            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GREAT is the pleaſure with which I embrace the opportunity that your kind invitation has given me of addreſſing myſelf to you this day—a day which, I truſt, will ever be joyfully remembered by you all;—a day in which, by the Inſtallation of the Maſter and other Officers of a Lodge of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this city, the influence of that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fraternity will be extended, and the bands of mutual love and good-will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened among them;—A day in which the preſence of ſo many Brothers from the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029481_0005_0FE13C3372836580"/>
neighboring Lodges met together to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the principles of mutual love, and ſpread its happy influence, muſt cheer the heart and exhilarate the ſpirits of every humane man.</p>
            <p>BOTH as a Miniſter of that Goſpel which proclaimeth peace and good-will to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and as one of the common brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of men, I feel myſelf deeply intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the honor, proſperity, and happineſs of every Society, whoſe object is the peace, order, and welfare of the human race; and whoſe aim is the eſtabliſhment and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unity, brotherly love, and benevolence among its ſeveral branches.</p>
            <p>THIS is the profeſſed deſign of your ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. It conſiders the helpleſſneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantine ſtate of man, the wants and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his mature age, the numberleſs evils attendant on his declining years, as ſo many proofs that "it is not good for man to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone"—that in a ſolitary, unconnected ſtate, <hi>He could not ſubſiſt,</hi> or could not ſubſiſt with ſafety and ſatiſfaction to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:029481_0006_0FE13C3921A5FF98"/>
ANOTHER proof that man was made for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ariſes from the tender feelings of which his heart is ſuſceptible; of which, indeed, without violence and often repeated efforts it cannot be diveſted; from the ſympathetic anguiſh which riſes in it at the diſtreſſes of others; from the thrillings of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which it is delighted by the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of human happineſs; from the ſoft e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and extacy of pleaſure which ſpring from the reciprocal offices of friendſhip and love.—Theſe all proclaim that God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man for ſociety—that every individual of the human race ſhould be a help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to every other.</p>
            <p>To give full energy to theſe happy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of human nature, and carry them to their utmoſt effect, to cultivate natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acquired arts, and to diſſeminate their principles and improvements for the comfort and benefit of man, as well as to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize the ſoul, and bring the tender affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his nature into action, is the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed purpoſe of the Maſonic inſtitution. It commences its origin from the origin of man,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029481_0007_0FE13C3C8E776A38"/>
becauſe, from his origin, man hath ever wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the advantage of knowledge, and arts, and humane affections to enſure and make perfect the happineſs of ſocial life. Through various forms and degrees of refinement it hath hitherto ſubſiſted in the world, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times clouded in obſcurity, and ſometimes, ſhining in ſplendor; now diſtreſſed by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and oppreſſion, then cheriſhed by the favor of the world and the countenance of great men and princes. The former ſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the ignorance and the prejudices of narrow-minded men, the latter from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the human mind by knowledge and liberality of ſentiment.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever was its outward condition in the world, whether perſecuted or cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Maſonry was ſtill the ſame; ſtill it labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote the peace and harmony of the world, by cultivating the principles of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and love; ſtill it ſought the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, by advancing the knowledge of Architecture, Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce; ſtill it endeavored to promote the proſperity of ſocial life, by reſtraining the tempers and enlivening the affections which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029481_0008_0FE13C428A6725A0"/>
could either retard or advance it. Human happineſs was its object, and that object it kept ever in view. Through evil report and good, it ſtill purſued it. Though ſometimes diſappointed of its aim, it renewed its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: Though baffled by human infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and poſſibly by the fault and ill conduct of particular members, it purſued its point, it repeated its efforts, its object was ſtill before it, ſtill the end of its warmeſt wiſhes, of its moſt zealous endeavors.</p>
            <p>EXACTLY does the Maſonic inſtitution in this reſpect, coincide with the morality of that holy religion, to the profeſſion of which the mercy of God hath called us. To eſtabliſh this aſſertion, I recommend to your attention the exhortation of St. Paul, which I purpoſe for the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe. It is recorded in
<q>
                  <bibl>HEB. XIII. 1.</bibl>
LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE the rather choſen this text becauſe it will give me the opportunity of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my endeavors to promote the good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of your Society and the end of this day's
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029481_0009_0FE13C463A3B3618"/>
ſolemnity, by enforcing the precepts and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that amiable and divine Religion which we profeſs, reſpecting brotherly love and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence—a principle which, did it engage the hearts, and regulate the actions of men, would calm all their diſcordant paſſions and partial views, and bind them together, as ſtrong cement binds together the materials of a building, which without it would part and fall aſunder.</p>
            <p>THIS religion, I truſt, is not only ours by profeſſion, but by its being the ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in our hearts; and that it will bring every thought and deſign, every temper and paſſion in obedience to its divine precepts. Its importance demands our utmoſt attention; and that attention will convince us that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity furniſhes mankind with the beſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and moſt perfect inſtitutions of life; that it contains not only the beſt ſyſtem of moral duties that is extant, but, in truth, the only ſyſtem that is fully adapted to the nature and condition of man in this world; being exactly ſquared to his circumſtances, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to his capacity; laying the ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his happineſs; tending to raiſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029481_0010_0FE13C4C12E157F0"/>
his powers and faculties to their higheſt perfection, to cement together the whole brotherhood of men, and build them up an edifice of love, ſupported by the two grand pillars of virtue and holineſs, the light and ſtrength of the world.</p>
            <p>THE precepts of this religion which enjoin love and charity are very numerous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſtrongeſt and plaineſt terms: And reaſon, as well as experience, evinces the neceſſity of theſe precepts, to procure and preſerve the happineſs of the human ſpecies. Born in weakneſs and ignorance, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on the care and protection of others; how ſoon muſt man fall a prey to thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs evils which ſurround him, did not the tenderneſs of love, and ſympathy of affection prevent it? And as he grows up to more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture age, he ſtill continues indebted to the ſame amiable principles for almoſt all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. Bodily ſtrength comes too late to protect him againſt injuries, and experience comes too late to point out the road to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He muſt depend on the protection and inſtruction of others; and nothing but love and affection can excite others to afford
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029481_0011_0FE13C5126173498"/>
this protection, or give this inſtruction. And in his beſt eſtate, when bodily ſtrength is perfected; when reaſon has come to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and inſtruction and experience ſupply their utmoſt help, the greater part of his happineſs muſt ariſe from the affectionate and ſocial tendencies of his nature.</p>
            <p>LOOK at the malignant and baneful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and tempers with which his nature is now unhappily debaſed, and you will be immediately convinced of the truth of what I have ſaid. Malice, and revenge, and ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture carry their own torment with them.—They <hi>may,</hi> and they probably <hi>will,</hi> vex, and and fret and torment thoſe againſt whom they are exerted: But, at the ſame time, they <hi>muſt</hi> torment the boſom which indulges them; and, while they prevail, render it incapable of any rational enjoyment. To have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned this matter is enough: It carries its own evidence along with it, and needs no elaborate proof to convince us of its reality. We know that ill-nature and malice make thoſe who indulge them miſerable in themſelves, and odious to all around them. And we know that the benign and ſocial propenſities of our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029481_0012_0FE13C5675BAD260"/>
nature give pleaſure in their exerciſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure happineſs wherever they are practiſed.</p>
            <p>IN this view, then, as well as in all other views, the Chriſtian Religion deſerves our beſt regards. It teaches us to conſider mankind as one common brotherhood—the children of the ſame parent, and members of the ſame family—allied to each other by partaking of the ſame nature, and being ſubject to the ſame neceſſities and infirmities: And it directs us to ſeek and promote their happineſs by all the means that ſhall be in our power; to comfort the afflicted, to protect the weak, to relieve the oppreſſed, to ſupport the indigent, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ignorant, to adminiſter, in ſhort, to the various neceſſities of mankind, as God ſhall bleſs us with ability and opportunity.—It forbids all malevolent deſigns and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as the open and avowed acts of malice; and it carries the principle of love and charity ſo high, as to require the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of real injuries, and the ſuppreſſion of even our juſt anger.</p>
            <p>ALL the writers of the New Teſtament,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029481_0013_0FE13C59D0546F68"/>
however they may vary in the enumeration of the other virtues, and in the encomiums they beſtow upon them, are unanimous in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this of brotherly love the preference; making it pre-eminent in its ſtation, in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and excellency above them all.</p>
            <p>THE adorable Jeſus, the great lover of men, declares that command of God, which enjoins us to love our neighbor as ourſelves, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to that great command which requires us to love the Lord our God with all our hearts; and ſays, that on theſe two command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the love of God and man, all the Law and the Prophets do hang: Thereby more than intimating to us, that the foundation of all <hi>moral</hi> precepts, lies in this love of God and man; and that nothing in morality has any virtue or real excellency in it, but as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from, or may be referred to one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe principles.</p>
            <p>ST. James calls this law which commands the love of our neighbor, the <hi>Royal Law;</hi> thereby declaring its excellency and pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence: And aſſures us that the whole train of ſocial duties is fulfilled by fulfilling this law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thyſelf.</hi>

ST. Paul repreſents Love to others as a debt which, though due to all, can never be paid ſo as to cancel its obligation, and declares, in expreſſions ſimilar to thoſe of St. James, that the whole law, or obligation of duty, which one man owes to another, is fulfilled by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this one precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thyſelf.</hi> And in the concluſion of his epiſtle to the Hebrews, the ſtrong ſenſe he had of it returns upon his mind with ſuch force, that he could not help mentioning it, as neceſſary to complete the Chriſtian character, <hi>Let brotherly love continue.</hi> He ſaith nothing of the commencement of it. It already ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted among Chriſtians. Chriſtians they could not be without it—it was woven into their religion, and made a part of it. Their duty, therefore, required them to nouriſh it, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintain it, to regulate their hearts and actions by it, to purſue it through all its branches, and follow wherever it led them. It was one of the fruits of the Spirit of God, and at no rate to be neglected.</p>
            <p>FROM the Spirit of God it hath deſcended and become the profeſſed principle of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonic
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029481_0015_0FE13C69218D9D68"/>
fraternity: For wherever the principle of brotherly love is, wherever it reſides and governs the paſſions and actions of men, there is the Spirit of God; for <hi>God is love;</hi> and "there is none good but one, that is God."</p>
            <p>BE this love then the Line which directs your conduct, the Square by which to form the rectitude of your principles and actions, the Plummet to try their uprightneſs, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to aſcertain their conformity to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Architect; and let its Compaſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the whole human race. Love hath ever diſtinguiſhed your fraternity: Let, therefore, brotherly love continue. It will give reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Society, ſtability to the Lodge this day inſtalled, and make it an ornament to the city in which we live. Love to others, a deſire to promote their happineſs will enſure reſpect. Real worth alone can acquire real dignity, and propriety of conduct only can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure reſpect, either to individuals, or to bodies of men.</p>
            <p>I HAVE thought it needleſs to take up your time in explaining what is meant by <hi>brotherly love.</hi> The feelings of your own hearts will do
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029481_0016_0FE13C69218D9D68"/>
that better than the moſt elaborate deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let us only remember that <hi>every</hi> man is our brother, being all the children of the ſame common parent, God Almighty, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the duty will be immediately percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Only conſider the common wants and neceſſities of this brotherhood—that its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs can no otherwiſe be promoted, and the variety of evils to which it is expoſed no oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe prevented than by loving one another, and the reaſonableneſs of the duty will be clearly ſeen. Only reflect, that to love one another, to delight in doing good to all, to cultivate the tender, benign, and ſocial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of our nature, is the command of our Creator, and the obligation of the duty will be ſtrongly felt. Only recollect, that God hath declared him who hateth his brother to be a murderer, and that he muſt have his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with apoſtate ſpirits—that He, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the eſſence of love; and that he who loves his brother reſembles his Creator, and ſhall enjoy everlaſting felicity with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the motives to the practice of the duty will be too forcible for an ingenuous mind to reſiſt.</p>

HOW unhappy is it for the world that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking man attends ſo little to theſe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations! How much of the miſery which man endures, how many of the evils under which he conſtantly groans, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by cultivating this amiable, this divine quality! Look at the calamities that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the earth—What we call the evils of nature, ſickneſs and accidents, ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, thunder and earthquakes, bear no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thoſe evils which the malevolent and baneful paſſions of men bring on it. War alone hath done more miſchief, hath deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more of the human race, hath brought more miſery into the world, than all of them together. And whence come wars and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among men? come they not from their unbridled luſts and malignant paſſions? How dreadful is the ſituation! how melancholy the proſpect, when brotherhoods of men arm themſelves for mutual deſtruction!</p>
            <p>TO have mentioned this horrible ſtate of human depravity is enough to expoſe its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normity. With pleaſure I turn from ſuch a theme, to the contemplation of the amiable
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029481_0018_0FE13C731901E6B8"/>
qualities of affection and benevolence, which firſt founded that brotherhood to which I have, this day, the pleaſure of addreſſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and which hath cemented it together, and built it up, an edifice of love, a temple of unity and concord. May God proſper their endeavors to extend the bleſſings of peace, friendſhip, love, and knowledge through the world!</p>
            <p>IN cultivating this principle you are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; a principle on which human happineſs muſt be built. Of this happineſs the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was laid by God his Creator, when he gave man thoſe tender, benign, and ſocial feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are the greateſt ornament and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection of his nature. To rear the fair fabrick to this perfection; to bring to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that ſeed of ſalvation which was ſown in the hearts of all men, when God ſaid, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> was the end the Son of God, the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Savior of men, had in view, when he took our nature upon him. He therefore went about doing good, cultivating the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der propenſities of that nature he had aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029481_0019_0FE13C789468D698"/>
calling into action all the amities and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the human heart, enforcing them by his precepts, and confirming them by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; making it the very mark and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al characteriſtic of his diſciples, that they ſhould <hi>love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO further this bleſſed diſpoſition, and give it its utmoſt efficacy, is your profeſſed deſign; and as, I truſt, it has the warmeſt wiſhes of your hearts, I truſt, alſo, it will have the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exertions of your abilities to bring it to perfection. In this buſineſs you are workers together with God, and fellow-laborers with Chriſt and his apoſtles, and with all good men.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me then with the affection of a brother who earneſtly wiſhes your proſperity, as well as with the authority of a miniſter of the Goſpel of peace and good-will to men, whoſe greateſt glory it is to recommend that Goſpel to men, and make it effectual to their ſalvation, to put you in mind of your obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this reſpect, and earneſtly to exhort you, not to be weary in doing good, but to <hi>let brotherly love continue,</hi> and mark all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as Chriſtians, as well as Maſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:029481_0020_0FE13C7DB35B6A48"/>
THE evil propenſities of wicked men will, it is true, riſe up in oppoſition; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant paſſions of human nature will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract the benevolent deſign of your holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well as of your particular inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But theſe, by their contrariety, will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add to the ſplendor of your glory, and make the virtue of your conduct the more conſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, while you ſtrive to bring order and peace out of confuſion and diſcord, and to make friendſhip and love triumphant over en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and malice.</p>
            <p>RECOLLECT, therefore, that all the words and actions of men,—the whole tenor and particulars of their lives—are noted by God who made them, and will by him be brought into judgment. Not only ſo; but their open conduct is viewed and ſcanned, and judged by their fellow-men; and that they will eſteem or diſregard the particular Society to which they belong, not only according to the worth of its inſtitutions and regulations, but alſo according to the conduct of thoſe who are members of it. Of the inſtitutions of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry, it may, I aſſure myſelf, be juſtly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029481_0021_0FE13C80DC7946B0"/>
that they are calculated to promote the happineſs of the world. Let then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Maſons be anſwerable to them. Let the force of their good inſtitutions appear in their deportment. Let truth and juſtice, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and modeſty, courteſy and affability, liberality and candor, affection and love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and charity mark their whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and ſhew to the world, that they are the faithful ſervants of the merciful Savior of men, united by particular badges and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to do good to mankind by promoting their happineſs. Then ſhall their fellow-men regard and reſpect them: God will look with favor upon them and bleſs them: This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary life will be cloſed in the ſatiſfaction of having done good in their generation, and the merit of their Redeemer will carry them to the eternal kingdom of peace and love.</p>
            <p>KEEP, therefore, Brethren, the lamp of brotherly love burning bright in your hearts, ſquare all your actions by the eternal rules of equity and juſt proportion; meaſure your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by analogy with that ratio which the lip of truth hath given you, "Whatſoever ye
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029481_0022_0FE13C868D139478"/>
would that others ſhould do to you, do ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo to them;" circumſcribe all your deſires by the compaſs of duty, and level them by patience to your circumſtances: So ſhall the Lodges of the craft riſe in order, beauty, and ſtrength, cemented by the Spirit of the Almighty Architect of nature, who always worketh in and by Love—Jehovah—Trinity of Perſons, in Unity of Eſſence: To whom be aſcribed, by men and by angels—by every creature his hand hath formed—Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Dominion, Praiſe, Thankſgiving, now and forever.</p>
