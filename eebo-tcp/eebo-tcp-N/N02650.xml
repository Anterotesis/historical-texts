            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſt was, That the preſent <hi>Engliſh Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Bible</hi> might be adher'd to on both ſides, &amp; no <hi>Terms</hi> or <hi>Phraſes</hi> in it <hi>objected againſt</hi> as what were capable of Amendment: And to induce to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance on our part, Mr. <hi>Moſs</hi> gave us the following piece of Hiſtory, viz. <hi>That the ſaid Verſion was made from the Original Languages by Seventy men, all which as they acted under a Sentence of Death in caſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs, and went through the whole Work in Solitude, being each alone in a ſeparate Apartment; ſo afterward, on a comparing their ſeveral Performances, were not found to differ in any thing Material.</hi> By which tis manifeſt this famous Teacher among our Sectaries, not only ſuppoſed the Verſion of the ſeventy and our Engliſh Verſion to be the ſame; but moreover that the Authors of it ſtood well nigh upon a Level, in point of Divine direction &amp; aſſiſtance with the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubim or Hagiographi of the Scriptures in the Originals: Which could he have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us of, no doubt would have wrought us to a compliance with his propoſal. But we gave him to underſtand, that 'twas what we had never heard before, &amp; very much doubted the Truth of; and farther, that our Engliſh Tranſlation, tho' a worthy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003142_0006_0FF01096583FDAF0"/>yet was not Perfect, but capable of Amendment in many places; and that tho' we had no reaſon to Boaſt of our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Hebrew &amp; Greek Languages, their various Idioms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſince the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we had of them did aſſure us of this, we could not ſee ourſelves obliged to comply with what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>d.</p>
            <p>The Second thing they inſiſted upon was, That no Argument ſhould be Propounded <hi>Syllogiſtically,</hi> it being they ſaid, a way of Reaſoning they did not underſtand, and would be unedifying to the Hearers; and yet, as you will ſee by and by, when Mr <hi>Wightman</hi> took the part of an Opponent, he diſcovered himſelf not ſuch a Stranger to this way of Reaſoning as was pretended.

               </gap>he Debate now was about the meaning of this word [Diſciples] Acts 15.10.— whether it intend only ſuch Gentile Believers as were Adult, or of Years, or their Seed together with them; and that the whole matter in Controverſy was determined by the Reſolution of this. Mr <hi>Wightman</hi> own'd there was a Divine Command for Baptizing Diſciples of Chriſt; and conſequently that if the Seed of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Believers are Diſciples, its the will of GOD they ſhould be Baptized: But this he denied and ſaid that Acts 15 10. did not prove they are Diſciples, but by that word intended only Adult Gentile Believers.

And to ſet this matter in a clearer light told him the caſe was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That as in that day there were both of Jews and Gentiles who by the Preaching of the Goſpel were brought over to an Embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtianity, So of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> The Jews, there were many who ſtill retained

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003142_0038_0FF010E88A3F2758"/>Bleſſing and Covenant alſo. To prove this the Apoſtle particularly inſiſts in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes. Where (1) He proves it <hi>a Minori,</hi> by an Argument from the leſs to the greater, ver. 15. <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men; tho' it be but a man's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet if it be Confirmed, no man Diſanalleth or Addeth thereto.</hi> q. d. Covenants among men being once Confirmed or Ratified, they are Unalterable; and no man preſumes to Diſanul or Add to them: Much more muſt it be thus with this Covenant made with Abraham and his Seed, which the Moſt High not only at the firſt exhibition or making of it, declar'd to be an Everlaſting Covenant, but has ſince ratifi'd or confirm'd, not only by his Oath, <hi>Hebrews</hi> VI. 17, 18. by frequent Repetitions of it, by ſuch ſolemn Rites as Covenants uſed to be confirmed by, by the Seal of Circumciſion, finally by the Death of Chriſt. Further, the Unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and conſequently the Perpetuity of the Covenant, He proves (2) From the Promiſes of it, which he tells us were made not only to Abraham but alſo to his Seed whether of Jews or Gentiles in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ver. 16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the Promiſes made. He ſaith not, And to Seeds, as of many; but as of One, And to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> i. e. Christ Myſtical,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003142_0039_0FF010EA1CF7FC30"/>or the Church in any A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e or Day even to the End of Time. Thus he proves the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, or Unalterableneſs of Abraham's Covenant or Bleſſing; and conſequently, that its now our Covenant and Bleſſing alſo. But becauſe notwithſtanding theſe things, ſome might object and ſay, That as GOD himſelf could Reverſe or Diſanul this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo he has actually done ſo by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting or making another Covenant with Abraham's Seed ſince; He adds further, and ſays, That the Promiſe or Covenant made to or with Abraham, neither was nor could be Diſanulled by the Exhibition of the Law at Sinai, ver. 17. <hi>And this I ſay, that the Covenant that was before confirmed of GOD in Chriſt,</hi> i.e. To Abraham and his Seed of Jews or Gentiles in all Generations, <hi>the Law, which was Four Hundred and Thirty Years after, cannot Diſanul, that it ſhould render the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> (or Covenant) <hi>of none effect.</hi> Which words of the Apoſtle alone, I may obſerve by the way, were there nothing elſe, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove the Covenant of Abraham to be the Goſpel or our Covenant, for how elſe was is confirmed in or by Chriſt? Did he by his Death confirm or ratifie any other Covenant or Teſtament than that of the Goſpel? Thus he proves the Perpetuity of Abraham's Covenant or Bleſſing, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003142_0040_0FF010EBE5A72518"/>that by Conſequence that its now our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Bleſſing, which is the thing he had aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Promiſe is bro't in as a Cordial to keep them from Fainting, &amp; to give them Spirits to believe and lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt.

To which further to ſhew the Abſurdity of the fore-mentioned Opinion, and that the Promiſe here ſpoken of, is no Promiſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, Temporary Gifts, but of Saving Good things, I'll only add this one Paſſage further out of him, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Its undeniable by the Principles of thoſe that differ, its a Promiſe made not only to theſe Jews, but its univerſally to the Gentiles &amp; to all the called of GOD: But all that are called have not received ſuch gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which then were given; but every one that is effectually called doth receive the Promiſe of Remiſſion of Sins &amp; the free Favour of GOD, and therefore this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe muſt be taken mainly in that ſenſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this Inſtance, I paſſed to that of <hi>Peter</hi> his going to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a Gentile, to whom when he came he Preached the Covenant or Promiſe, with a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acious Entail upon his Houſe or Family, Acts 11 14 <hi>Who ſhall tell thee Words whereby thou and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003142_0049_0FF01102A0EB2F60"/>all thy Houſe ſhall be Saved.</hi> To which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Inſtance of the Jaylour, whom the Apoſtle exhorts to believe, with the Promiſe that thereby, not only he but his whole Houſe ſhould be Saved, <hi>chap.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be Saved and thy Houſe.</hi> Juſt as GOD of old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded or Preach'd the Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Abraham. Gen. 17.1, 2, 7. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou Perfect; and I will be a GOD to thee and to thy Seed,</hi> or Houſhold. Did the Apoſtle intend here to Suggeſt that the Jaylours Faith ſhould Eternally Save his Houſe, or that they ſhould be in that ſenſe Sav'd meerly on his Believing? No ſurely, all he could intend by it, was, that on his Believing they ſhould be viſibly Sav'd, or bro't into a viſible State of Salvation, or of Right and Heirſhip to it, and conſequently have right to all the Viſible means of it. And thus much at leaſt he muſt intend: So that granting it to be true what ſome would have, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were none in his Houſe or Family, but Adult Perſons, yet this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge he aſſures the Jaylour they ſhould all have by his Faith; and if his Adult Children or Servants had ſo, who can give a reaſon why his Infant Children alſo ſhould not have the like Priviledge by their Father's Faith, provided he had then any ſuch?
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003142_0050_0FF011065A6E53B0"/>Was there not as much Efficacy in his Faith this way, toward the one as toward the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And to Conclude, In all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I've now mentioned, whence was it; or who can give a reaſon why the Goſpel or Promiſe was thus Preach'd by Chriſt and his Apoſtles with ſuch an Entail on the Houſholds, Families or Children of thoſe to whom they Preach'd it, as we have ſeen? Who can, I ſay, give a reaſon for this, if it be not true what I'm now in the Proof and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of, <hi>viz.</hi> That Abraham's Covenant is our Covenant in theſe Days of the Goſpel, and Diſpenſed or Adminiſtred in this Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to us now, as of Old it was to him, and his Seed? This as I'm ſure it well agrees with the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, when he tells us in the forecited Gal. 3 13. <hi>That the Bleſſing of Abraham is come on the Gentiles through Chriſt;</hi> So if it be not the reaſon why the Goſpel was thus Preach'd or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, for my part I know not what was.</p>
            <p>Having laid this Foundation, I came to the more immediate Anſwer of Mr. <hi>Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Objection or Argument; taken as was ſaid from ſuch Scriptures as require Faith and Repentance in order to Baptiſm, and that we have no Example or Inſtance in the Word of GOD of any Baptized, but ſuch as were ſo qualified: To which I replied to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003142_0051_0FF01107ED233CA0"/>this effect, That as for ſuch Scriptures as he had a reference to, and which, to many Perſons, ſeem'd to require Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as univerſally neceſſary in order to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, I could not but look upon ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of them as very wrong, and great Aboſes of ſuch Scriptures When it is ſaid, <hi>He that Believes and is Baptized ſhall be Saved,</hi> &amp;c they themſelves would ſay, It were a manifeſt abuſe of the Text for any to ſay, It limited Salvation only to ſuch as actually Believed and were Baptized, and implied that no other than they ſhould be Saved; and yet this Concluſion may as fairly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Text, as that thoſe only that actually believe ſhould be Baptized. The one is as much in the Text as the other. And for this reaſon with ſome others, I told him that when we find Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> required in ſome we read of Baptized, as neceſſary in order to their Baptiſm, as, <hi>viz</hi> in the <hi>Three Thouſand</hi> Acts 2. the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Jaylour,</hi> &amp;c. All that Conſiſtently with reaſon we could think was implied or taught us by ſuch inſtances was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That of thoſe that were Adult or grown to Years of Diſcretion, they only ſhould be Baptized in whom there is a viſible Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And this I told him we all Believed, and is what our daily Practice confirms: But
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003142_0052_0FF01109C69B0A40"/>it being as I have ſhewed above, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Abrahams Covenant</hi> is our Covenant in theſe days of the Goſpel, and Diſpenſed or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred with a Gracious E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then when any Perſons did ſo Believe and Repent and were Baptized, and thereby became Members of the Viſible Church, the Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salvation does not thereupon come to their Houſes or Families, as of old it did when Parents Believed and were Baptized; or in other words, whether they do not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring in their Children with them, and convey a Memberſhip to them alſo; making them thereby viſibly Heirs of the Promiſe &amp; Salvation together with themſelves? This I ſay, is a Queſtion needful to be Reſolved by and Perſons thus Employed; and ſo by You &amp; Us, in order to our knowing what is Duty in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm. This Queſtion I know you reſolve in the Negative, and ſay; That the Perſons ſo Believing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, do not thereby bring Salvation to their Houſes, or in other words do not bring their Seed or Children into a ſtate of Viſible Salvation; but who, I pray, muſt we believe, You or CHRIST and his Apoſtles? Do <hi>you</hi> or <hi>They</hi> Preach True Doctrine here? If Perſons ſo Believing and Repenting do not thus bring in their Children with them, as you ſay, then moſt certainly CHRIST miſs'd it when he told <hi>Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003142_0054_0FF0111009F01CF8"/>to his Houſe;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he told thoſe Penitents, <hi>Act</hi> II. That the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was to them &amp; their Children, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> III. when he told the <hi>Galatians,</hi> That <hi>the Bleſſing of Abraham is come on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> If what you ſay be true, theſe Texts ſhould be Ras'd out of the Bible, for they are certainly Falſe. Unleſs ſome good Reaſon can be given why the Faith &amp; Repentance of Believers in that day ſhould bring Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Houſes, and not in the preſent; this for my own part I'm not able to do.</p>
            <p>But now if on the other hand, it be true, that CHRIST and his Apoſtles are in the right in what they tell us in thoſe Texts, the unavoidable Conſequence of it will be, that the Infants of Viſible Believers are to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the Caſe in hand, this was the very Caſe with the Apoſtles &amp; Evangeliſts, thoſe firſt Miniſters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; when they were ſent out to Preach the Goſpel and gather Churches, the whole World, excepting a few that were brought in by the Miniſtry of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> and CHRIST, were either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and both of them Unbelievers, and therefore E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to CHRIST and his Goſpel, out of theſe they were ſent to gather Churches; and it being ſo, as I ſaid before, Viſible Faith

And whereas you ſay, we have no Example or Inſtance of their Baptizing any other than Adult Believers; I grant its true we have it not in Expreſs Terms ſaid they Baptized any Infants, Yet we have That that to us, and we think to any not blinded by Error &amp; Prejudice, is Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent; when we are told that they Baptized Houſholds or Families, viz. <hi>Lydia</hi> and her <hi>Houſhold,</hi> the <hi>Jaylor</hi> &amp; his <hi>Houſhold, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Critica Sacra</hi> on this Word, where alſo he gives many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it from Scripture. And this (<hi>viz.</hi> the Scripture uſe of this Word) is what at preſent deſerves our more particular conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and enquiry. As to which, though I have not had time ſo to look into this matter as that I may be Poſitive in it; yet believe that upon a ſearch it will be found, that its no where ſo applied or uſed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to ſignify <hi>Plunging</hi> or <hi>Dipping.</hi> I do not remember any Text where it neceſſarily ſo ſignifies; but this I find, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture when it would expreſs ſuch a kind of waſhing or cleanſing things as may be performed <hi>by pouring on</hi> or <hi>the Application of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003142_0059_0FF0111B305EEB58"/>Water</hi> to them, it then uſes the word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizo,</hi> but when it would expreſs a Plunging things under Water, it then uſes other Words. I'll give here ſome inſtances, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. Its uſed for waſhing <hi>Hands and Cups, Pots, Brazen Veſſels</hi> and <hi>Tables.</hi> Where none can ſay it neceſſarily ſignifies waſhing or cleanſing by <hi>immerſing</hi> or <hi>dipping</hi> thoſe things in Water, ſince they may as well be cleanſed by pouring on, or applying Water to them. Of the Phariſees its there ſaid, That when they came from the Market, except they Waſh they Eat not: In the Greek, <hi>Ean me Baptizontai,</hi> i. e. <hi>Except they are Baptized,</hi> but there rendred <hi>Except they Waſh</hi> becauſe none can rationally underſtand the Baptizing there ſpoken of as ſignifying an Immerſion or Dipping of their whole Bodies. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things there be which they have received to hold, as <hi>Baptiſmous Poterion,</hi> i. e. according to the Greek the <hi>Baptiſms of Caps,</hi> but there rendered the <hi>Waſhing of Cups,</hi> which may as well be done by the Application of Water to them, as by Plunging them into it. So <hi>Luke</hi> 11 28. Its ſaid of the Phariſee with whom Chriſt at a certain time Dined, that he Marvelled at him, <hi>Oti ou proton ebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſthe pro tou Aristou,</hi> i. e. <hi>That he was not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized before Dinner;</hi> but there rendered that he had not firſt Waſhed before Dinner:
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003142_0060_0FF0111D01B35550"/>Becauſe none can rationally underſtand by it any more to be intended than the Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Hands, which every one will ſay might as well have been done by pouring Water on them, as by dipping them into it. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. All the Ceremonial Waſhings or Sprinklings are in the Greek called <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, (Diaphorois Baptiſmois)</hi> the words in the Original are rendred by <hi>Beza, diverſes Ablutionibus,</hi> i e <hi>Diverſe Waſhings,</hi> as in our Tranſlation) many of which, ſays <hi>Pool in loc.</hi> were for the <hi>Prieſts, in their Services,</hi> and for others in performing theirs by them; ſome by <hi>Sprinkling with Blood, Exod.</hi> 29.20, 21. with Water. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8 7. and 19.9, to 19. ſome by waſhing at the Brazen Laver, as the Prieſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.4. and 30.17, to 22. ſo the Sprinkling of Healed Lepers, <hi>Lev</hi> 14.4, to 9 and the Purification of the Unclean. All which Ceremonies were performed by Sprinkling or Pouring on of Blood or Water, and not by an immerſion of the Body into it, and are therefore evidences that the word (<hi>Baptiſma,</hi> Baptiſm) is ſo far from being neceſſarily underſtood to intend Dipping or Plunging, that in this place at leaſt, its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily underſtood to intend no more than Sprinkling or Pouring on of Blood or Water.</p>
            <p>But now on the other hand, when the Scripture would expreſs a Submerſion or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

Whereas ſpeaking of the Iſraelites who at the ſame time had only the Dewings of the Cloud, and <hi>Sprinklings</hi> of the Water of the Sea on them, uſes the word for Baptizing, expreſſing it thus, <hi>Baptizanto en te Nephele, kai en te Thalaſſe,</hi> i. e As its rendred in our Bibles, <hi>They were Baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea.</hi> This I mentioned as the firſt Ground or Reaſon on which we held ourſelves Juſtifiable in Adminiſtring Baptiſm by Sprinkling or Pouring on of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But before I had quite finiſh'd this particular, Mr. Moderator <hi>Hitchcock,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Order and Laws of Diſputation, broke in upon me, and having bro't with him Mr. <hi>Sympſon,</hi> his <hi>Lexicon Anglo Graeco

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003142_0063_0FF01124CE2B78D0"/>others, that he was againſt me, or at leaſt not ſo full with me in the account I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the import and uſe of the Word, as we ſhould have ſeen he was, had he read to us all he had ſaid. He read as far as that Clauſe, viz. <hi>Yet its taken more largely for any kind of Waſhing,</hi> and ſtop'd there; whereas had he read all, every one would have ſeen Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> was fully with me in what I had ſaid. I mention not this through any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Prejudice againſt Mr. <hi>Hitchcock;</hi> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that I know of, ſaw his face before, but becauſe I think I owe this Juſtice to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he may ſee how little theſe inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Teachers, as they would be accounted, ſo frequent in many parts of the Land are to be depended on for light and guidance in our way, what little regard they have to Truth, and how unwilling they are it ſhould appear in caſes where it will Reprove them, &amp; Convince others of their Errors: I make no doubt but the reſt of his Brethren preſent knew of the Cheat as well as he.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time he read to us from <hi>The Portſmouth Diſpute,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> informs me, the Title of the Book was) the Opinions of the Aſſembly of Divines, Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in doing which alſo he repreſented them as of Opinion that <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> or <hi>plunging</hi> was the Primitive way of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003142_0064_0FF011274B53BC08"/>Baptizing. To which he added, that if this was not the Primitive way, whence was it that the Eunuch was Oblig'd to come forth of his Chariot and go down with <hi>Philip</hi> into the Water in order to his being Baptized? What, ſaid he, had not ſo great an Officer of Queen <hi>Candace</hi> as he was, any Diſh or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Veſſel in his Chariot in which a little Water, enough for Sprinkling him, might have been fetch'd? this is very unlikely. He did not acquaint us with the particular Books of the fore-mentioned Authors from whence that Author had made thoſe Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor have I to this day ever ſeen that Book; ſo that whether I have them by me, or if I have, whether that Author was Faithful in making his Collections from them, or Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> read them as Honeſtly to us as he did Mr. <hi>Sympſon,</hi> I can't ſay.</p>
            <p>However as I then wondered to hear thoſe two Venerable Names, viz <hi>POOL</hi> and <hi>BAXTER</hi> among them, eſpecially the laſt, conſidering what he ſays of Baptizing by Dipping, in his <hi>Plain Scripture Proof of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſm,</hi> ſo ſince Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi>'s Diſhoneſty reſpecting Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> is detected, as I am ſtrongly Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of ſome ſuch unfair-dealing as to all the Perſons above-named, either by that Author in making his Collections from them,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:003142_0065_0FF0112A7AFB9430"/>or in Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> in reading thoſe Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to us: So I find that as for Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> they were greatly Abuſed or Miſrepreſented in this matter. You will be convinc'd of this when I have cited to you ſome Paſſages from them. As for Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> I find it was his Opinion that Dipping in Baptiſm was ſometimes uſed in the Eaſtern, Warmer parts of the World; in his Notes on <hi>Mat</hi> 3.5, 6. He has theſe words, viz. <q>
                  <hi>A great part of thoſe,</hi> i. e. of the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Jeruſalem, &amp;c. <hi>who went out to hear John, were Baptized,</hi> i. e. <hi>Dipped in Jordan.</hi>
               </q> But then as he adds in the ſame place, <q>
                  <hi>That it will not from hence follow that Dipping is Eſſential to Baptiſm,</hi> So in his Notes on <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23.</q> he as fully expreſſes it to be his Opinion that this was not the conſtant way or manner of Baptizing in the Primitive times, but that ſometimes they Baptized then by applying or pouring on of Water. For there we have theſe words, viz. <q>
                  <hi>If ſome think it probable from this Text, that ſometimes the Apoſtles did Baptize by Dipping, yet it is at leaſt as Probable that they did not, or not conſtantly, from what we read of the Apoſtles Baptizing in Houſes, Acts</hi> 9.17, 18 &amp; 10.47, 48. &amp; 16.33.</q> From whence tis evident that as to Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> had that Author or Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> from him, given
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003142_0066_0FF0112CB9466638"/>this account of his Opinion in this matter, viz. <hi>That in the Primitive times, when Time, Place and other Circumſtances concurr'd, Baptiſm was performed by Dipping, but at other times when thoſe Circumſtances did not invite to it, 'twas performed by pouring on of Water.</hi> And that however it was then adminiſtred, yet Dipping is not eſſential to it. This had been an Honeſt Repreſentation of him in this matter; but for them, or either of them to take from him only what I but now cited from his Notes on <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5, 6. with other like Paſſages, perhaps elſewhere in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Writings, at the ſame time paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by others, and hereupon repreſent him as of Opinion, not only that Dipping was the way of Baptizing only in uſe in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, but as needful to be obſerved now in order to the due Adminiſtration of it, and hereby to bring him in as Patronizing an Error which never entred into his Heart, as Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> then did; This I ſay is ſuch an abuſe of him, as can in no wiſe be juſtified, and which I think no Man of Faith and Probity would have been Guilty of: But this is one of the uſual Refuges of Error, and what we may oft ſee it has recourſe to.

As will appear if the Argument of the Text, be diſpos'd into Syllogiſtical form: In which caſe it will ſtand thus, Viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If John Baptized in Enon near Salim becauſe there was much Water there, then he Baptized by Dipping.</hi>

But how Enormous is the Conſequence here? How far from being neceſſary and concluſive? Does it neceſſarily follow he Baptized by Dipping, becauſe the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Water in this Place beyond what it did perhaps in moſt others, was a reaſon of his making choice of it to attend that Duty in? Eſpecially conſidering that in that Country, many places of it at leaſt, a Man may go many Miles without coming at a drop of Water, unleſs ſuch as is procured by Art and Labour: And with all conſidering that there were Multitudes that came to be Baptized of him</p>

               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:003142_0077_0FF0114768CDA208"/>But yet I think there is a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of this, and to take thoſe words in a Metaphorical ſenſe, as holding forth only the Communion Believers have, in or by Baptiſm, with Chriſt in his Death, the Fruits and Effects of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that for this reaſon we are in Baptiſm not only ſaid <hi>to be Buried with him,</hi> but <hi>Buried with him into Death;</hi> which ſeems to be expounded by the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 <hi>ult.</hi> In other places when he telis us we are by Baptiſm Baptized into Chriſt and into his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this ſenſe I find Pious and Learned Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe words, whoſe Gloſs on them you have in the following words, <hi>We are Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him by Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. ſays he, <q>We have Communion with him, (i. e by Baptiſm) in his Burial alſo, which Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a further degree of the Deſtruction of Sin; by putting it as it were out of our ſight.</q> And then adds, <q>Some think the Apoſtle alludes here to the manner of Baptizing in thoſe Warm, Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which was to Plunge or Dip the Party Baptized under Water: Others think <hi>with greater reaſon,</hi> that this Phraſe is uſed to ſignify that Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Believers have with Chriſt in his Death and Burial, which is ſignified by Pouring Water on a Perſon, like Earth or

            </p>
            <p>Now if this be right; and for my own part I ſee no neceſſity of the other ſenſe, then nothing certain relating to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mode of Baptiſm can be concluded from theſe Texts neither, which, unleſs there be others, that I know not of, is ſufficient to make good what is now before me for proof, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That none of the Scriptures alledged by our Adverſaries in this point, to prove that Dipping was the Primitive way of Baptizing, do neceſſarily conclude or prove it. The Third Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are ſundry Scriptures which when conſidered render it difficult, if not impoſſible to think that Dipping was, at leaſt always, the Primitive way of Baptizing. For evidence of which I inſtanc'd,</p>

(2) In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. The Three Thouſand Converted by Peter's Sermon, all which as they were Baptized, ſo if it was by Dipping, ſeems a caſe attended with more difficulty than that already mentioned, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can't ſuppoſe they came with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prepar'd on purpoſe for the Reception of the Ordinance in, ſince in the courſe of the Story we have good aſſurance they had no thought of being Baptized when they came together, on the occaſion mentioned toward the beginning of the Chapter, no, nor until they were exhorted to it by the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. So that its Morally certain if they were Dipp'd, they were either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or array'd with the ſame Garments with which they came, either of which, I think muſt ſeem very unlikely to any Man. And to this, one thing further, which is a difficulty in my way of Believing they were Dipped or Plunged, I'll now add; and it is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis manifeſt from <hi>ver.</hi> 4.1. <hi>That they were all Baptized in one Day:</hi> Yea, and it was in that part of it too which ſucceeded the <hi>SERMON,</hi> which could not be much more than the laſt Half of it, ſince its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>ver.</hi> 15. that the Sermon began not till Nine in the Morning.

[1] <hi>Becauſe its reaſonable enough to think a conſiderable part of this ſhort time muſt be ſpent in Enquiries after, or in taking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or account of the Faith and Repentance of thoſe they Baptized.</hi> 'Tis certain that all that were preſent at this time and heard this <hi>SERMON,</hi> were not Baptized, but only ſuch of them as gladly received the Word. This is plain in the Text. Now who theſe were, was ſome way or other known to the Apoſtles before they Baptized them; and probably it was by ſome Declaration made on their part, in anſwer to Enquiry made by the Apoſtles. I grant the Apoſtles were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowing this by that Power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirits they were endued with; yet ſince in other Inſtances of their Baptizing, we find not they made any uſe of this Power for this end, but diſcovery was made of the requiſite qualifications of thoſe they Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſomething ſaid or done by them, its reaſonable to think it was ſo at this time too. And if ſo, be it never ſo conciſe or ſhort, yet it muſt of neceſſity take up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of this ſhort time.</p>
            <p n="2">[2] <hi>Becauſe there is no reaſon to think the needful Requiſites of Adminiſtring Baptiſm in this way, were ready prepared before hand.</hi> But on the other hand there is reaſon to think <hi>they were not;</hi> ſince, as I hinted before,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:003142_0083_0FF011559C4C4340"/>none of thoſe that were Baptized had any tho't of being ſo when they came to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, no nor until they were exhorted to it by <hi>Peter</hi> in the cloſe of his Sermon. Now if they were not ready prepared, then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of this remaining part of the Eight Hours muſt of neceſſity be ſpent in this alſo; ſo much that I can't but think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Unprejudic'd Perſon will ſay, its hard to conceive how ſo much could ſtill remain, as in which, it was poſſible for them to Plunge Three Thouſand Men. The only thing that can be ſaid here, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that the Apoſtles were now at or near ſome Pool, Pools, Pond, or River where there was a ſufficiency of Water, and to which they might have free acceſs, and therefore no need of ſpending time either in going far to ſome ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, or in procuring a number of large Veſſels, and filling them with Water, (and that more than once,) for Dipping this Multitude.</p>
            <p>But to this I anſwer,</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) That though it be true there were diverſe Pools in the City, yet that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and this Multitude were now met at or nuar to any one, or more of them, or if they were, that they had free Acceſs to them on this occaſion are things which I Conjecture will want proof for ſome time, and which
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:003142_0084_0FF01157EA62DC50"/>I think no Rational man, will ſay, are very probable, (eſpecially the laſt of them.)</item>
               <item>(2) The contrary to this is what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably true, and what a view of the Chapter and conſideration of all Circumſtances, leads us to think in the caſe, unleſs the houſe in or at which the Apoſtles and the Multitude met had one or more of thoſe Pools in it or Adjacent to it; and this too I Conjecture will want proof for ſome time. Certain it is that as the Place where the Apoſtles Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled on this Day of Pentecoſt, &amp; where thoſe extraordinary Gifts were beſtowed on them, <hi>was an Houſe,</hi> ver. 1, 2 And that the Multitude that heard the Sermon came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to them; ſo is it equally certain that in the whole Chapter we have no hint of any remove from thence till the whole affair was over. For which reaſon, what ſeems moſt probably to be Truth in this matter is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That from ſome Loft or Window of the Houſe the Apoſtle Peter Preach'd to this Multitude, and that thoſe of them that gladly received the Word, were <hi>Baptized upon the Spot,</hi> before they removed from thence. This is what the whole Story leads us to think in this matter; and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that conſiderable time muſt be ſpent in procuring a Veſſel or Veſſels ſufficient to receive many Bodies at once, &amp; ſo to employ
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:003142_0085_0FF0115989F00588"/>all the Apoſtles in Baptizing; and in filling them with Water, and that more than once or twice before all were Baptized. A couſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of this ſhort remainder of time, I ſay, muſt be ſpent in thoſe things, in caſe they were Dipp'd, unleſs, as I ſaid, this Houſe had the conveniency of ſuch a Body of Water in or Adjacent to it, (to uſe which they had Liberty,) as was ſufficient for the purpoſe As to which if our Adverſaries in this point will take the liberty to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture <hi>it had,</hi> I cant but hope they will give us liberty on the other hand to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture <hi>it had not,</hi> ſince I'm well aſſured they themſelves can't but be ſenſible we ſhall do it on far the more probable grounds.</item>

If on the other hand, it be ſaid, they had not ſuch Convenience, then beſides what time was ſpent in taking Account or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Faith and Repentance of thoſe they Baptized, which muſt be conſiderable, beſides this, I ſay, the procurement of ſome large Veſſel or Veſſels ſufficient for Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging diverſe Bodies at once, and the filling them with Water, (and that diverſe times) muſt neceſſarily take up ſo much more time, and cauſe ſuch further delay to their work, that it ſeems to me Night muſt needs overtake them before they could get thro' it; and how then will what we are told <hi>ver.</hi> 41. remain true, viz <hi>That the ſame Day there were added unto them about Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls?</hi> But I return to my Narrative,</p>

               <hi>And Finally,</hi> Since its unreaſonable to think that CHRIST ſhould Ordain an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance which can't univerſally and at all times be attended by Perſons, without ſuch Incoveniences and Perils as above; theſe things being ſo, it muſt needs be lawful to Baptize by applying or pouring Water on the Subject of it, and we are Juſtifiable in ſo Adminiſtring of it. But the Antecedent is true: Therefore ſo alſo is the Conſequence. This is what I offered in proof of the Second Article; nor do I remember any thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſaid in anſwer to it, more than I have already accounted for. And now again it came to Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi>'s turn to act the part of an Opponent, and offer on the Negative part of the Queſtion, which accordingly he did, and in doing of it, let us know he was not ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <q>And thus Sir, I thought ſit to give you a few Arguments on the manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, and I think fit to reſerve my other Arguments on the other Two Heads, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I ſee yours in Print; and if they are really Concluſive of Truth in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will ſubmit, for I love to be on the ſtrongeſt ſide, and I account Truth the Strongeſt. I ſhould have choſen to try the matter out by plain Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ſince you go in this Method, I have followed you; and I know of no fallacy in them, to be ſure they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſigned. If they are not ſo exactly formed according to rule, yet if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions be fairly drawn from the Premiſes, I hope you will bear with the reſt, and ſometimes my miſpelling, if you put the Diſpute in Print. I think you ought to have Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi>'s Arguments, perhaps
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003142_0096_0FF01174DAB10200"/>they are better than mine, with all the Scriptures that was then brought, &amp; our words their due weight. The firſt Four Arguments was delivered at the Diſpute, only now a little alter'd in the Two firſt; the other added now. If you ſay ſome of theſe Arguments are not Negative but Affirmative, I anſwer, If the Affirmative be on our part, it neceſſarily implies the Negative on your parts, in my Judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This from him that is willing to ſerve you in the Truth, <hi>Valentine Wightman.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This I think is his Letter Verbatim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miſtake of a word. He ſays the firſt Four of the Arguments above were offered by him at the Diſpute, I remember but Two, and they not as here written, as he himſelf intimates; however ſince its poſſible I may be miſtaken, I'll not inſiſt on that. What I would ſay here, is, That as I am I hope ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deſirous, and ſhould heartily rejoice if Mr. <hi>Wightman,</hi> or any others of his Way or Denomination might receive any benefit by what is now written, ſo its my reſolution as far as may be to avoid every thing tending to Prejudice or Hinder it; for which reaſon, though it were eaſy for me to make both my ſelf and others Merry with ſome remarks
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003142_0097_0FF011771AAA0CC0"/>on the Arguments above, yet I will not do it leſt I ſhould offend thoſe, whom I ſhould rejoice to Gain. For this reaſon I ſay, (as alſo becauſe I think there is not any thing in them with an Anſwer to which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Diſcourſe does not furniſh the Reader) I'll wave any thing of that Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it annex ſome further thoughts on this matter, by which Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> and his Brethren may ſee there is more reaſon to doubt of Dipping, its being the Primitive way of Baptizing, than perhaps now they do, &amp; at the ſame time be convinc'd that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, yet that the Poſition laid down by us in this matter (as we ſuppoſe prov'd) at the Debate, is an Undoubted Truth, and we therefore Juſtifiable in Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject.</p>
            <p>And for this end I'll endeavour to make good theſe Two Propoſitions. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That a good account may be given why John the Baptiſt Baptized in Jordan and Enon, and Philip made uſe of the Water of a Fountain, Brook or River in Baptizing the Eunuch, altho' they did not Dipp or Plunge thoſe they Baptized.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That ſuppoſing the utmoſt that can be deſired by any in this caſe,</hi> viz. <hi>That John the Baptiſt, the Apostles, Philip, and the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003142_0098_0FF0117A1230E410"/>did Immerſe or Dipp thoſe they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or that Dipping was really the Primitive Mode of Baptizing, yet this will not prove that others are oblig'd to Baptize in the ſame manner alſo, &amp; by Conſequence that our way of Baptizing by Sprinkling or Pouring on of Water, is Sinful; yea that it will be ſo far from it, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it may be Sinful in others to Immerſe or Dipp thoſe they Baptize.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>If theſe Two Propoſitions can be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, I think, that as our Adverſaries in this matter will have reaſon to abate of their Confidence reſpecting the Primitive way of Baptizing, <hi>viz</hi> That it was by Dipping or Plunging; and to be more ſparing in their Invectives againſt us, for not complying with it; ſo at the ſame time to ſee how Inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are in making this one Ground or Reaſon of their ſeparating from us. I'll therefore make an Eſſay here, and ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That a good account may be given why John the Baptiſt Baptized in Jordan and Enon, and Philip made uſe of the Water of a Fountain, Brook or River in Baptizing the Eunuch, altho' they did not Dipp or Plunge thoſe they Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Opinion of our Adverſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> That Dipping was the Primitive way of Baptizing, takes riſe as I conceive principally from the Hiſtory we have of the Places of the Baptiſms
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:003142_0099_0FF0125F2C8D0398"/>of thoſe Two Primitive Miniſters; of the former his Baptizing in <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> the latter his making uſe of the Water of a <hi>Fountain, Brook</hi> or <hi>River</hi> in Baptizing the Eunuch. Not ſo much from the Phraſe (of <hi>going down into</hi> &amp; <hi>coming up out of</hi> the Water) made uſe of in thoſe Hiſtories, which have been before taken notice of, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency to prove what they would from them ſhewed; this Opinion of theirs I ſay, does not ſo much take Riſe from theſe, as from the conſideration of the Places (<hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon</hi>) where they Baptized, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much Water there. And this they think is a good evidence of the Truth of it, in-as-much as if it be ſuppoſed the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> did not Dipp thoſe they Baptized, no man, they ſay, can excogitate or aſſign any good reaſon why they Baptized in ſuch places, rather than others where there was not ſuch plenty of Water: To which, I ſay, that if other reaſons can be given of this, ſuch as will well account for, or juſtify their doing ſo, though it be ſuppoſed they did not Dip thoſe they Baptized there, the Inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſequence of this will be, that this Opinion or theirs ſtands upon a very Feeble Baſis, ſuch as will ſcarcely bear them out in their Confidence in it. Now this is what I would here give ſome evidence of, and this
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:003142_0100_0FEFD871CD7DD3B0"/>I will do from ſeveral Propoſitions of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Truth or Certainty, and which, altho', ſome of them at leaſt, may at firſt view, ſeem remote from my preſent buſineſs, yet will appear otherwiſe when I come to apply or make my deſigned uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Then let it be Conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>P.</hi> The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in which the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized, was and is <hi>a Dry and Thirsty Land,</hi> not Watered with <hi>Springs</hi> or <hi>Rivers</hi> as many other Countries are. That it is ſo now, the accounts of thoſe whoſe Curioſity has led them to Travel into it, aſſure us; and that in Ages paſt it was in this reſpect, as it is now, Revelation aſſures us alſo. Indeed its called, Deut. 8 7 — <hi>A Land of Brooks, of Water, of Fountains, and Depths that Spring out of Valleys and Hills;</hi> and ſo it was and ſtill is, Comparatively ſpeaking, or compared with ſome other Lands, in which ſenſe thoſe words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and yet it was and is <hi>a Dry &amp; Thirſty Land</hi> ſtill, compared with many others. Nor was the extraordinary Produce of it in Old time whereby it Subſiſted, ſuch vaſt numbers of Inhabitants ſo much the effect of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fertility of its Soyl, as the peculiar <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> attending of it, the Eyes of the Lord being upon it from one <hi>end</hi> of the year to the <hi>other,</hi> Deut. 11.10, But more of this under, 4 <hi>P.</hi>

2 <hi>P.</hi> The words <hi>[Much Water]</hi> Joh: 2.23. in the Original are <hi>Polla Hudata,</hi> i. e. <hi>Many Waters;</hi> according to which the Verſe ought to run thus, viz. <hi>And John alſo was Baptizing in Enon near to Salim, becauſe there were many Waters there;</hi> alluding no doubt to the many Springs that were in it, which are intimated in the name <hi>Enon,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Place of Springs.</p>

               </gap> his firſt ſetting out therein. Its true, at his firſt appearance in that work, he had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral eſteem with the People. He came in the Spirit and Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a Warmth and Zeal like that of <hi>Elias,</hi> was one who in his conduct diſcovered a great Mortification <hi>to</hi> and Contempt <hi>of</hi> the World, the Manners and Faſhions of it; which things occaſioned in multitudes an extraordinary Veneration of him; inſomuch that they held him for a Prophet; ſome Extraordinary Perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned and Sent from GOD, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhewed a great Regard to his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; Submitted to his Baptiſm. But as is uſual in ſuch caſes, this raiſed Eſteem of the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:003142_0102_0FF0117E1E06EF78"/>Multitude was not of long continuance, but ſo ſoon declined that (tho' the whole time of his Miniſtry was very ſhort; ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a Year and half,) we find him not toward the cloſe of it, attended or followed with ſuch Multitudes, as in his beginning. And to this our Saviour no doubt has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, when in his Diſcourſe with the Jews, ſpeaking of John, he ſays of him, Joh 5.35. <hi>He was a Burning and a Shining Light, and ye were willing for a Seaſon to rejoice in his Light, Q. D.</hi> How ſhining a Light ſoever he was, &amp; how well ſoever deſerving of their eſteem and affection, yet their regard to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not long; you for a ſhort time made diſcovery of a great regard to him, and came with great Zeal to hear him, hoping that he was (if not the <hi>MESSI AS,</hi> yet at leaſt) <hi>Elias,</hi> or that <hi>Prophet</hi> in him revived again: but when you ſaw that <hi>John</hi> did only bear Record to CHRIST, you ſoon grew cold in your Affections to him, and fell of from him. And with reference to the ſame, no doubt it was, that he told them of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive Speeches concerning him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.18 And finally, to the ſame thing refer thoſe words of <hi>John</hi> to his Diſciples, on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their relating to him the growing Reputation and Intereſt of CHRIST among the People, when he had entred on his
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:003142_0103_0FF01181047868C0"/>Miniſtry, Joh. 3.30 <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.</hi> He muſt increaſe in Honour, Dignity &amp; Reputation in the world; He is the Riſing Sun, To give you notice of which I was but as the Morning Star; He muſt ſhine every Day more and more, but as for my ſelf, tho' I was once venerable in your eyes, as he now is, yet my Glory is now in the Wane, and I muſt every day grow leſs and leſs. Not that there were none that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Honour for him even to the laſt; the Hiſtory we have of him aſſures us of the contrary, <hi>viz</hi> That there were many who did ſo; but the number was ſmall compared with what it was in his beginning or firſt entrance on his Miniſtry. But as for the leading, governing part of the People, there was no time of his Miniſtry in which he had their countenance or favour, as is variouſly evident. In the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> that grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Nation, as well as in their leſſer Councils, there were many of the Phariſees, who every one knows were a Set of Men moſt Zealous <hi>for</hi> and Tenacious <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Rites,</hi> and would allow nothing to be added in Divine Worſhip to what they had received concerning it, either from the Law of GOD, or the Tradition of the Elders. Their eves were therefore open to Spie out and take ſeaſonable care of every thing tending to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:003142_0104_0FF01184CE2FE5A0"/>Introduce Innovations in Religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſ-much as they could not but ſee this to be the Tendency of John's Preaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, it could not be but that they were no ſooner appriz'd of it, than they look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with a Jealous eye. According to this we find that forthwith upon this they ſent Prieſts and Levites from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Bethabara,</hi> where he was in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, to enquire of him, who he was, and by what Authority he Preach'd and Baptiz'd? See <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.19, <hi>to</hi> 25. Hereby letting us know that they had no Favour for him, that they look'd upon him as a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Perſon, one who if he were ſuffered to proceed, as he had begun, it might be of ill Conſequence. And for further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Propoſition, there are Two things Obvious in the Hiſtory we have of the Baptiſt, which I would here take notice of, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) His Wilderneſs Life. The Story we have of him aſſures us not only that the more Private part of his Life, which continu'd till he was about Thirty Years of Age, was ſpent in the Wilderneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> in places Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and but thinly Inhabited; but alſo that his Publick Life, or that part of his Time which ſucceeded his Entrance upon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was ſo too. I remember not that in that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003142_0105_0FF011870E843790"/>part of his Hiſtory that relates to us this part of his Life, we find him any where but at <hi>Jordan, Bethabara</hi> and <hi>Enon</hi> and <hi>Parts Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent;</hi> all of them Places remote and not ſo ſtor'd with Inhabitants as many other parts of the Land. According to which he is ſaid, Mat. 3 1. <hi>To come Preaching in the Wilderneſs of Judea;</hi> and is ſtiled by the Prophet Iſa. Chap 40.3 <hi>The Voice of one crying in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Otherwiſe it was with CHRIST, who ſhunn'd no places of greateſt Reſort; oft Preach'd in the Temple &amp; Synagogues of the Jews, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas <hi>Chemnitius</hi> thinks the Baptiſt choſe thus to fulfil his Miniſtry in the Wilderneſs, rather than in the Temple and other places of Reſort, to make an illuſtrious difference between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his LORD; of whom it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, Mal. 3.1. <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his holy temple.</hi> I muſt ſay, that to me it ſeems far more reaſonable to think, it was for the Reaſon hinted above, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he knew how he was eſteemed or look'd upon by the Leading, Governing part of the Nation, as well as the main Body of the People (at leaſt in the cloſe of his Miniſtry) that they look'd upon him with an evil Eye, as a dangerous Perſon, one who it ſuffered to proceed, might bring on Changes they deſired not; to prevent which there was
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003142_0106_0FF01189C3CEA7B8"/>danger leſt they ſhould Apprehend and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him, if not inflict greater Evils on him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) It gives us no account of ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers reſorting to him in the latter part of the time of his Miniſtry, as in the beginning of it. This will be evident to every one that conſiders the Order of things related by the Evangeliſts as done by him in the courſe of his Miniſtry. With relation to which I ſay, That as in the Story we have of him, we never find him any where, during that time but at <hi>Jordan</hi> &amp; <hi>Places adjacent,</hi> viz. <hi>Bethabara</hi> &amp; <hi>Enon,</hi> (which were near to it; the one on the Eaſt, the other on the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of it) So what it accounts for as done by him, it relates as done in one or other of thoſe Places; And further, That he that attentively Reads it, will ſe that he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Miniſtry in thoſe places in this order, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt at <hi>Jordan,</hi> then at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> and laſt at <hi>Enon.</hi> I need not enlarge here to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence this, it being what every one that attentively Reads that part of the Sacred Hiſtory will ſee. Now we have in it no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch Multitudes reſorting to him when at <hi>Bethabara</hi> &amp; <hi>Enon</hi> as when at <hi>Jordan.</hi> With reſpect to this laſt, the Story ſays, <hi>Then went out to him Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, and were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> great Numbers of all
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:003142_0107_0FF0118C062228F0"/>ſorts went out. But with reſpect to his Baptizing at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> it only informs us of the Conference he had with the Prieſts and Levites ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to Enquire of him who he was, &amp; by what Authority he Baptized; Adding for a cloſe, <hi>Theſe things were done in Bethabara beyond Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, where John was Baptizing;</hi> without a word accounting for the Number that reſorted to him there. In like manner, with reſpect to his Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>izing in <hi>Enon,</hi> it only tells us there were ſome that came and were Baptized of him. Now, tho' its not to be doubted, there were many who came to and were Baptized of him in thoſe Places, ſince its manifeſt he was in great Eſteem with many, even to the time of his Death, yet in as much as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is ſilent here, makes no mention of ſuch Numbers reſorting to him when at thoſe Places as when at <hi>Jordan,</hi> 'tis reaſonable to think they were Comparatively few: which if it was ſo, its no doubt to be Reſolved into this as the Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> The Baptiſts ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, declining Reputation among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of People. That ſhining Light at the time of his Miniſtry in theſe Places was in his decreaſe and therefore they Reſorted not to him as at firſt:</p>

               <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> at <hi>Jordan,</hi> there were many that came a great way to it (and the ſame muſt be ſuppoſed to be proportionably true of thoſe that attended his Miniſtry at <hi>Bethabara</hi> and <hi>Enon</hi>) with Reſpect to the time of his Miniſtry there, 'tis ſaid Mat. 3.5, 6. <hi>Then went out to him Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the Regions round about Jord in, and were Baptized of him in Jordan, Confeſſing their fins.</hi> If the Term <hi>[Judea]</hi> here be taken in its ſtricteſt acceptation, as diſtinct from <hi>Samaria</hi> &amp; <hi>Galilee</hi> and containing only the Tribes of <hi>Judah, Benjamin, Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Dan,</hi> yet of ſuch Extent in this ſenſe is it, as to make it Evident that ſuch as came from the Remoteſt parts of it, muſt Travel near (if not full out) an Hundred Miles before they reach't <hi>Jordan.</hi> Such as came from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem (which lies near in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Weſtern Borders of the land and <hi>Jordan</hi> on the Eaſt) Travelled between Fourty and Fifty Miles. Now it being ſo, its unreaſonable to think that ſuch of this Multitude at leaſt as lived thus Remote from <hi>Jordan,</hi> Travelled thither on foot; without the help of Horſes or ſuch other Creatures as they ordinarily uſed in their Journeys, and the caſe is the ſame as to ſuch as from Remote parts Travelled to <hi>Bethabara</hi> and <hi>Enon</hi> to attend his Miniſtry there, of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:003142_0109_0FF01190A93ADEE0"/>whom its not to be doubted there were many.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>P.</hi> As the Southern parts of <hi>Canaan</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Arabia's</hi> &amp; <hi>Egypt,</hi> are more eſpecially dry and thirſty above the reſt; ſo it was in this part of that Land that <hi>Philip</hi> met the Eunuch on the Road &amp; Baptized him. This Propoſition contains two Particulars in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) That the Southern parts of <hi>Canaan</hi> are more eſpecially Dry and Thirſty above other parts of it. Of this we are aſſured not only by Humane, but Divine Teſtimony. <hi>Gerar</hi> (where <hi>Abimelek</hi> was King, and to which <hi>Abraham</hi> Removed from <hi>Mamre</hi> upon the turning the Adjacent place where the City's of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> ſtood into a ſtinking Lake) was in this part of the Land, yea near the moſt Southern Borders of it. The Lake it ſelf where thoſe abominable City's ſtood, and near to which <hi>Mamre</hi> was is in the Southern parts of it, and from thence the Text tells us he removed ſtill more South when he went to <hi>Gerar. Gen.</hi> 20 1. And that this part of the Land was more Dry and Thirſty than other parts of it. The Scriptures aſſure us in that they let us know that here Principally it was that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were forc't to be at ſuch Pains and Coſt in procuring Water for their Herds and Flocks by digging Wells or Pitts. Here
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:003142_0110_0FF0119258950F70"/>it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> was at this Pains and Coſt for preſerving the lives of his. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.15.18. — Here it was that he Contended with <hi>Abimelek</hi> about a Well which his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had violently ſeized and taken away. Here it was that the Bond-woman and her Son, <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> being ſent into the Wilderneſs with a bottle of water, when it was ſpent ſhe lays the Child under a ſhrub and Removing ſome diſtance from him, ſays <hi>Let me not ſee the Death of the Child:</hi> And where they were Relieved in that diſtreſs by a Well of water not far from them, See <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12, to 19. Here in a word it was that the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> envying <hi>Iſaac's</hi> growing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Flocks and Herds, as an effectual Remedy to prevent it; fill'd up his Wells of water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. forecited. And to add no more, this is that part of <hi>Canaan</hi> wherein <hi>David</hi> hiding himſelf from <hi>Saul</hi> calls it <hi>a Dry and Thirſty Land where no Water is,</hi> or without Water, as it is in the Original. <hi>Pſal</hi> 63.1.</p>
            <p>It was in this part of the Land that <hi>Philip</hi> met the <hi>Eunuch</hi> on the Road and Baptized him. This is manifeſt in the ſtory of it; For as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf is Scituate in the Southern parts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo this Eunuch was now in his Return from it home; which home whether it was in the <hi>Arabic</hi> or <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Ethiopia</hi> it matters not as to this, ſince in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:003142_0111_0FF0119408D44100"/>either caſe he muſt ſteer South from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> According to which the Angel that ſent <hi>Philip</hi> on that Errand, does it in theſe words, Acts 8.26. <hi>Ariſe and go toward the South, unto the way that goeth down from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to Gaza:</hi> Which Command he obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meets with this man of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> This <hi>Gaza,</hi> the City whoſe Gates <hi>Sampſon</hi> took away <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.2. And whether he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried when taken <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and where he pulled down the Houſe of their god <hi>Dagon</hi> on the Lords of the Philiſtins <hi>ver.</hi> 30. this <hi>Gaza</hi> I ſay ſtood in the very Southern Borders of <hi>Canaan</hi> toward <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Affrica.</hi> In this very Dry and Thirſty part of this Thirſty Land it was that he met and Baptized him. Now what I Scope at in this and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Propoſitions, is, to make it evident that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Baptize in <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> or ſome other places a like Circumſtanc'd, tho' it be not ſuppoſed they Dipp'd thoſe they Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: And if I miſtake not, theſe Propoſitions reflected on, will ſuggeſt ſuch reaſons for it, as will Convince any unprejudiced Perſon, 'twas Wiſdom and Neceſſary for them to do ſo, tho' we ſo ſuppoſe concerning them.</p>
            <p>For let it be Conſidered here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> (1) That ſince there were ſuch Multitudes came to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:003142_0112_0FF011972BE5DE88"/>at <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> (Thouſands no doubt to the laſt, and to the firſt many Thouſands) and ſince many of them came from parts ſo Remote from thoſe Places, and therefore rode on Horſes or other Beaſts ordinarily uſed by them in their Journeys, and ſince reaſon will tell every man, the Baptizing ſuch a Multitude (eſpecially the Multitude that came to <hi>Jordan</hi>) muſt needs take up a conſiderable time, ſome Weeks no doubt, if not Months, and did therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a conſiderable time of ſtay or abode there, at leaſt in many that came; ſince, I ſay, theſe things were ſo, how could it be that theſe Multitudes and the Beaſts they rode upon, could be ſupply'd with Water neceſſary to ſubſiſt them, and ſatiate their Thirſt, unleſs he had choſen ſome ſuch place or places as theſe were, for his Baptiſm, where Water was in ſuch plenty? For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that tho' Comparatively ſpeaking, a little Water would have Suffic'd for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing thoſe Multitudes, ſuppoſing they were Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inkl'd or Waſh'd, yet the ſupply of their neceſſities, and the neceſſities of their Beaſts for ſo long a time, as reaſon will tell any man, many of them at leaſt, muſt attend or wait for Baptiſm, was what required no ſmall quantity of Water.</p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:003142_0113_0FF0119982771A80"/>
If it be ſaid that as <hi>Dry &amp; Thirſty a Land</hi> as this was, yet its not to be doubled, but that there were in it <hi>Towns</hi> or <hi>Cities</hi> (and they Scituate in the Central parts of it too, to which a Reſort had been more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the People) ſo ſtor'd with Pools &amp; Wells, as to be able to furniſh with Water for the Baptiſm of thoſe Multitudes, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they were only Sprinkled or Waſhed, and ſatiate the Thirſt of them and their Beaſts; and that therefore in that caſe he would doubtleſs have choſen one or more of thoſe Places to Baptize in. To this I ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That ſuppoſing it to be true that there were ſuch Places, and they ſo conveniently Scituate in the Land yet from what has been premiſed, particularly the Third Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its Evident it would have been far from Wiſdom in him to have made Choice of any of them to diſcharge his Miniſtry in, inasmuch as its from thence manifeſt, that in ſo doing he would have had reaſon not only to doubt of a free undiſturbed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ionally expect or look for in this caſe? Did he not know that the Superior part of the Nation, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d upon him as a dangerous
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003142_0114_0FF0119B1BC187A0"/>Perſon, One, of whom there was need ſome care ſhould be taken to ſtop his Progreſs, as they did afterward on Him, whoſe way he came to prepare? And that among the Inferior ſort, tho' there were many that had a Veneration for him, and accordingly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regard to his Perſon and Miniſtry, yet that there were others (and they perhaps not Inferior in Number) who were of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtrain, and had other thoughts of him, and who making their Judgment of him by his Garb and manner of Life, tho't him to be Hypocondriacal even to a degree of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and therefore ſaid of him He had a Devil! <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. Tis evident therefore ſuch a choice in him would have been what no man in his Wits would have made, and that Wiſdom did direct him to a more Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs Life, during the time of his Miniſtry, &amp; to the choice of ſuch <hi>places</hi> for the exerciſe of it as <hi>Jordan, Enon</hi> and <hi>Bethabara,</hi> where (alſo probably) Water being ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Nature, without the coſt of Labour and Art, in great plenty; and being <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Juris,</hi> free and open for Man and Beaſt as they had occaſion, he was aſſured of the free undiſturbed uſe of it, and which places being more remote, he could promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more ſafety to his Perſon. This is what to me appears reaſonable to think reſpecting
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:003142_0115_0FF0119D74483F30"/>the reaſons inducing <hi>John</hi> to make choice of theſe places to diſcharge his Miniſtry in, and what I'm ready to think will appear to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dic'd perſon to be the Truth of the matter; which if it be ſo, it lets us know he had good reaſon thus to do, even tho' he Baptized not by Dipping or Plunging, and by Conſequence that when our Adverſaries infer or argue his doing ſo becauſe he Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> ſuch inference muſt appear to be what the Premiſes will in no wiſe allow to be Concluſive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Philip</hi> his Baptizing the Eunuch in or at a Fountain, Brook or River the foregoing account of the Condition of the place where he met him on the road and Baptized him, will alſo well account for it, tho' we don's ſuppoſe he Dipp'd or Plung'd him; inasmuch as from thence its rational enough to think that beſides that Fountain, Brook or River, there might not be a Drop of Water within many Miles of them. This I ſay, by all account of the place is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think, and if ſo, he muſt either make uſe of that or not Baptize him at all, unleſs he had Travell'd with him (perhaps) many Miles further. Had <hi>Philip</hi> met the Eun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch in ſome Town or Village where Water ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Sprinkle or Waſh him, might have been had from Wells or Pits they had made
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:003142_0116_0FF011A1534B8788"/>for their uſe, and had gone with him from thence to ſome Fountain, Brook or River, there had then been good reaſon to conclude he Plung'd or Dipp'd him; and there would then be ſome ſtrength in the Conſequence, if from their doing ſo his Plunging him were inferred or argued. But we find not a Word of this in the Story, but quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz</hi> That it was in the Wilderneſs that he met him. The Angel ſays to Philip, Ner. 26. <hi>Ariſe and go toward the South, unto the way that goeth down from Jeruſalem to Gaza, which is Deſert,</hi> i. e. which <hi>way</hi> is a Deſert; as <hi>Whitby</hi> renders it exactly according to the Greek. Here, in this Dry &amp; Thirſty Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where a man may Travel many Miles (yea, may I not ſay Scores of Miles?) and not ſee a Drop of Water, it was that <hi>Philip</hi> Met and Baptized him, from whence 'tis evident he was obliged to make uſe of this Water they came to as they were Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling on the Road, or not Baptize him at all, unleſs (as I ſaid but now) he had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with him, perhaps, many Miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whereas Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> at that time of the Debate, as I before obſerved, ſaid on this Inſtance, <q>If Philip did not Dipp the Eunuch, why was it that he was obliged to come forth of his Chariot and go down with <hi>Philip</hi> to the Water? What,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:003142_0117_0FF011A2E2A3D410"/>had not ſo great an Officer of Queen <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace</hi> as this Eunuch was, any Diſh or Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in his Chariot in which a little Water ſufficient for Sprinkling or Waſhing him might have been fetch'd?</q> To this I ſay, that as <hi>ver.</hi> 36. aſſures us that they came in their way even to or upon this very Water (<hi>Epi to Huder</hi> the Orignal is,) before the Eunuch mov'd to Philip to Baptize him, and cauſed his Chariot to ſtand ſtill, ſo every one will ſay the Room of his Chariot was a place no ways convenient or proper to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Ordinance of Baptiſm in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chariots in that Day were very different from what they are now; and that they were better I think there is little reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 'Tis not therefore ſtrange he came forth of his Chariot, as great a man as he was, to be Sprinkl'd or Waſh'd with the Water, tho' he be ſuppoſed to have never ſo many Attendants, and a Score of Golden Bowls with him. And now to conclude this matter, From theſe things it appears to me, that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had Wiſe and Good reaſons for Baptizing in the Places mentioned, where there were ſuch large Collections of Water, even tho' they did but Sprinkle or Waſh thoſe they Baptized; and it being ſo, how Feeble the Argument or our Adverſaries muſt be, when from their
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003142_0118_0FF011A57696DE68"/>Baptizing in thoſe places they infer that they Dipp'd thoſe they Baptized, is what I hope there are none but will ſee. And this may ſuffice for the Firſt Propoſition. The Second is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuppoſing the utmoſt that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by any in this matter,</hi> viz. <hi>That John the Baptiſt, the Apoſtles, Philip, and other Primitiva Miniſters, did Immerſe thoſe they Baptized; or that Dipping was really the Primitive way of Baptizing, yet this will not prove that all others are obliged to Baptize in the ſame manner alſo, and by Conſequence that our way of Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject is Sinful, yea it will be ſo for from it, that notwwithſtanding it may be Sinful in others to Immerſe or Dipp thoſe they Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition contains a Two-fold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, Viz.</p>
            <p n="1">[1] <hi>That ſuppoſing Dipping was the way in which John the Baptiſt, the Apoſtles, Philip,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did Baptize, yet this will not prove that all others are obliged to Baptize in the ſame manner, and Conſequently that our way of Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject, is Sinful.</hi> This I think will be evident to every one that will weigh the following particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That the Examples even of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and Beſt Men in any caſe or inſtance, are not ſimply or in themſelves binding to
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:003142_0119_0FF011A71CB08F08"/>others. Its true, its our Duty and we are bound in many things to trace the ſteps of the Wiſe and Holy, and its our Sin when we do not; But why is it ſo? Why not meerly becauſe they did thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are bound to follow them, but either becauſe there are moral reaſons in the things themſelves, or becauſe there is ſome expreſs, poſitive Command of GOD ſuper-added to the example. And in theſe caſes only it is that an Obligation lies on us to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them. If the example of any Man, John the Baptiſt, Philip or any other, as ſuch, be binding, I would gladly know in what caſes or Inſtances it is ſo, whether in ſome things only done by them, or in all? I'm ready to think Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> and his Brethren will not ſay the laſt, or that its binding in all they did; inasmuch as this would be a dangerous Doctrine indeed, one inevitable Conſequence of is being this, viz. That they, and I, and many others, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to imitate John in his manner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, taking up our abode in the Wilderneſs, clothing our ſelves with Camels Hair, and wearing a Leathern Girdle about our Loyns, and Eating Locuſts and wild Honey, as he did. But this I ſuſpect <hi>they</hi> would not like very well, I am ſure <hi>I</hi> ſhould not; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Man will find it a difficult Task
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003142_0120_0FF011A95D725C50"/>to perſwade them they are bound by the Example of John in theſe points. Well, if we are not obliged by it in theſe Inſtances, in what are we? You ſay in the Inſtance of his Baptizing, otherwiſe there is no force in vour Argument, when from his Dipping in Baptiſm, as you ſuppoſe, you infer an Obligation on us to do ſo too. But pray give me a reaſon for this, <hi>viz.</hi> Why it ſhould oblige us in this caſe or Inſtance, and not in the fore-mentioned. When I was at the School <hi>A Quatenus ad Omne, valet Conſequentia,</hi> (which you may Engliſh thus if you pleaſe, <hi>viz</hi> If the Example of any Man as ſuch, oblige in one inſtance, it does in all;) was received for a Maxim or Rule of Everlaſting Truth; and that it is ſo, I firmly believe ſtill. And if it be ſo, then our Obligation from John's example, conſidered as ſuch, to dwell in the Wilderneſs, array our ſelves with Camels Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as great and ſtrong, as to Baptize by Dipping; for as I ſaid, if his Example as ſuch, bind us in any one caſe or inſtance, it muſt in all. But its needleſs for me to enlarge here, ſince what I now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert is no more than what I preſume Mr. <hi>Wightman,</hi> (or at leaſt ſuch of his Brethren, as paſs under the Denomination of Seventh Day Baptiſts) will allow or grant. Their ſtanding practice in not obſerving or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:003142_0121_0FF011AD15FE2080"/>the Firſt Day of the Week, but the Seventh, gives me, I think, juſt reaſon ſo to preſume; ſince if they tho't Examples of Holy men, as ſuch binding, how they can hold themſelves excuſable in not Sanctifying that Day, for the Sanctification of which, the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians have ſet us an Example, is hard for me to ſee. This particular at once Caſhiers Four of Mr. <hi>Wightmans</hi> Arguments; and I can't but hope he will now ſee, that for him or any other Perſon to attempt to prove the Unlawfulneſs of Sprinkling or Waſhing in Baptiſm, from the Example of John, Philip or any other, (ſuppoſing it were evident they Dipp'd thoſe they Baptized) is Vain and Abſurd; ſince whatever they did in this matter Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ſelf, can't infer any Obligation on us to do in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſing they Dipp'd in Baptizing, yet as there are no moral reaſons in the Nature of the thing obliging others to do ſo too, ſo neither is there any poſitive Law obliging us to follow them in it, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that mode of Baptiſm. There are two Caſes, as I Intimated above, wherein Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are binding, or Rather wherein we are bound to follow them, <hi>viz.</hi> When there are Moral Reaſons in the nature of the things done, and when any expreſs, poſitive Law
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:003142_0122_0FF011AF13DE5D60"/>of God is ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>added determining them and Requiring in others an Imitation of them. But now neither of theſe things can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this matter of which I'm now ſpeaking. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) There can be no Moral Reaſons in that mode of Baptiſm obliging us to it, but on the other hand I think its manifeſt from what I have cited above from Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> there are Moral Reaſons obliging us to Swerve or Deviate from it. If it be true that the Sixth and Seventh Commands of the Moral Law, are Moral, and Baptizing by Dipping be, as he ſays, a Breach of thoſe Commands, then ſurely there muſt be Moral Reaſons in the Nature of the thing thus obliging us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) There is no expreſs poſitive Law Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to follow them in it; or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that mode of Baptiſm. If Mr. <hi>Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> or any of his Denomination know of any, I'le thank them if they'll let me do ſo too, and inſtantly come over to them, at leaſt, in this point. All that I know can be ſaid here, is, that <hi>John's</hi> Baptiſm was from Heaven, as our Saviour imply's in that Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he propounded to the Chief Prieſts and Elders of the Jews. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25.—And if ſo, then ſo was the mode of it too: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Baptized by Dipping, this will infer
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:003142_0123_0FF011B159A07490"/>a poſitive Law, ſome may think, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that mode of it. But I deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence here, and ſay that tho' it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he Dipp'd in Baptizing, his Baptiſm may well enough be ſaid to be from Heaven, and yet that mode of it not be ſo, ſince the modes of things are not of their Eſſence. I know very well Mr <hi>Wightman</hi> &amp; his Brethren ſay this mode, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping, is of the Eſſence of Baptiſm, and that Baptiſm in any other way is no Baptiſm. But beſides that herein they ſeem not to me well to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Entities &amp; their Modes: Beſides this I ſay, I'm at a loſs how they will prove it, any poſitive Law determining this mode of it I'm ſure there is none, nor can it I think be done from the import or meaning of the word in the Original: ſince (whatever it is, yet) we find it oft uſed there by the Spirit of God to ſignify Sprinkling or Waſhing by pouring on or applying water to things, as well as dipping them. But enough of this, and more I think I need not add to make out this firſt Particular, which is <hi>That Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Dipping was the way in which John the Baptiſt, the Apoſtles, Philip</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did Baptize, yet this will not prove that all others are Obliged to Baptize in the ſame manner.</hi> The Second is,</p>
            <p n="2">[2] <hi>That tho' this he Suppoſed. yet it will be ſo far from inferring ſuch an Obligation lying on
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:003142_0124_0FF011B476F06C30"/>others, that not withſtanding it may be ſinful in them to Immerſe or Dip thoſe they Baptize.</hi> This will be readily allowed for a Truth by all thoſe that know that many caſes may be ſuppoſed, wherein there may be Moral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons obliging Perſons to Swerve or Deviate from the Example of Holy men, in things wherein at other times and in other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it were not only warrantable for them, but their duty to imitate or follow them. And this all thoſe muſt know that are not ſo near to perfect Ideotiſm, as not to know that as <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> i.e. <hi>time and place</hi> are Circumſtances inſeparable from all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that the Expediency or Inexpediency, and Conſequently the Lawfulneſs or Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them has a great dependance on thoſe Circumſtances. Actions good in themſelves and Expedient or Proper in one time or place, in another are Inexpedient; and it is a known Rule, <hi>Quicquid not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit, in Quantum non Expedit, non licet,</hi> i. e. Whatſoever is not Expedient, is ſo far forth Unlawful as it is Inexpedient. What I now ſay might be Illuſtrated by a Thouſand Inſtances; but one ſhall ſuffice. And its that of the Corinthians, their going to Law before Unbelievers; Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> no doubt will allow that the uſe of the Law for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of mens juſt Rights is lawful, yea
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:003142_0125_0FF011B6D2B907A0"/>many times a neceſſary Duty; and doubtleſs was ſo in many of the Caſes refer'd by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthiane to the Deciſion of Pagan Judges: Yet it was a ſin in them at that time, for which the Apoſtle greatly blames them, and it was ſo meerly on the account of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place, which did render their doing ſo Inexpedient, Prohibit it, and Require that they ſhould rather have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and iſſued their Controverſies among themſelves. Now to apply this to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping or Plunging in Baptiſm, as what I have now ſaid eſpecially takes place in the Poſitives of Religion, that have nothing moral in the Nature of them, and more eſpecially in the Undetermined Modes of thoſe Poſitives, ſo as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of them of which I'm now ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping in Baptiſm, if the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place or either of them are ſometimes ſuch that there are Moral Reaſons Diſſwading from and Prohibiting of it, 'twill then follow that tho' the Baptiſt and others in the Primitive Times did Dip in Baptizing, yet that will be ſo far from proving an Obligation on others to do ſo too, that notwithſtanding it may be very ſinful in them.</p>
            <p>If any of our Adverſaries ſay here, Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what I now ſay to be true, yet what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:003142_0126_0FF011B88EE1C0E0"/>can it be to us; Or how does it excuſe us in Baptizing by the Application of water to the Subject, ſuppoſing Dipping was the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive way, ſince we can Plead no ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in our way from the Circumſtances of time and place? I Anſwer,</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) I am not now immediately proving the Lawfulneſs of our Baptizing in particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but that tho' <hi>John the Baptist</hi> and others in the Primitive Times did Dip, yet that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding others may ſin in ſo doing; and that becauſe the Circumſtances of time and place may be ſuch as to render it Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and therefore Sinful. And this I take to be a truth ſo evident, that I can't but eſteem that man better ſtor'd with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then Senſe that ſhall deny it. And,</item>
               <item>(2) As to Ourſelves in particular, I ſay I am of Opinion, that the Circumſtances of time and place, very often at leaſt, do on Moral Conſiderations forbid our Dipping in Baptiſm, and that ſo evidently, that for my own part I durſt not do it. To Conclude, I think I have made good the two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions above, and having done ſo, as its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt on the one Hand, that Mr. <hi>Wightman's</hi> Arguments taken from the Examples of <hi>John the Baptiſt, Philip,</hi> &amp;c their Dipping as he ſuppoſes, are utterly Inſufficient to prove what he would by them, ſo on the

            <p n="1">[1] That when Chriſt Ordained and ſent forth the Twelve and the Seventy, 'twas with this Expreſs Command or Charge, that they ſhould not Act in the Affair before them, at their own Expence or Coſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 9.10. <hi>Luk</hi> 9.1. to 4. and 10.3, 4, 5. Where we

            <p n="4">4.

The caſe is the ſame now, its His Will and He has Ordained that thoſe who are taken off from their Worldly employments, and ſpend their time in the Study and Preaching of the Goſpel ſhould have a Live-lihood by their Labour. Having obſerved theſe things, I told Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> 'twas evident from the Scriptures cited, and what had been ſaid on them, that, ſuppoſing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Miniſtry of the Country is a true Goſpel Miniſtry, the Duty of Maintaining them is not among the number of meer Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitives in Religion, but Moral, and ſuppoſing that to be ſo, for proof of the point before me I offered this Argument, Viz.</p>

            <p>To which I added, That the Support of Miniſters by a Publick Rate or Tax, was one Mode or Manner (among diverſe others) of Subſiſting them, and that the Word of GOD tho' it had plac'd this among the number of Morals in Religion, yet had not Determined the Mode of it, or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it ſhould be done, whether by Publick Rate or Tax, or Weekly Contribution, or any other, only in General, that it ſhould be done in ſome way or other: And that if in ſuch a caſe where Moral Duties are thus Ciroumſtanc'd, Lawful Authority may Rightfully Interpoſe and Determine the Mode of them, then the preſent way of the Country in Supporting Miniſters muſt be Lawful, becauſe 'twas what ſuch Authority had by poſitive Law determined.

            <p>I Think nothing Material ſaid on either ſide is Omitted in the Narrative above,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:003142_0135_0FF011CEE2FDEE78"/>beſure I have not willingly Omitted any thing of that Nature. In accounting for ſome things, for the Advantage of ſuch as may think it worth their while to <hi>Peruſe theſe Sheets,</hi> and more full Illuſtration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, I have enlarged beyond what was ſaid at the Debate, yet not <hi>varying</hi> from the Subſtance of it. Yet let not any think what is here Related as then offered on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However by what is contained in the fore-going Pages, its hoped Perſons will ſee We of the Eſtabliſhed Miniſtry in the Country, have ſomething to ſay for our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and Practice in thoſe Points, and at the ſame time, reaſon to hope we are not in our Conſciences convicted of Error in them, as ſome of our Adverſaries Scrupled not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully to ſay of us before the Debate. I have no pleaſure in Recriminations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on ſuch Perſons, yet can't forbear ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Occaſion, that when at the time of the Debate I urg'd them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>a any of them then preſent, and that Repeatedly, to make

And alaſs, when this once gets hold of us, how much are we put into the Hands of our Grand Enemy, and how many Luſts are there that inſtantly riſe up and ſet in with it, and almoſt Inevitably oblige us to ſtand by it, and this, tho' the Error be ſuch as if retained, will iſſue in Eternal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine!

            <p>But its time that I haſten to an End; and for a Cloſe (tho' the Obſtinacy of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons but now mentioned, and Contempt of all that can be ſaid to them, manifeſted in their Pertinacious perſiſtance in their Old Practices, nowithſtanding all diſcourages me from an Addreſs to them, yet) I think my ſelf obliged on this occaſion earneſtly to call

Certainly Opinions of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are no leſs Damning than the moſt Enormous Practices. Heaven can no more Receive one who holds not the Head (at leaſt in the ſenſe the Apoſtle there ſpeaks,) than it can the moſt <hi>Proſligate Wretch.</hi> And this conſideration, no doubt, was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that mighty concern reſpecting the Jews, we find the Apoſtle making diſcovery of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. &amp; 10 — It was not their <hi>Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,</hi> but their bad <hi>Principles</hi> or Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Errors that wrought in him that Concern leſt they ſhould fall ſhort of Life, as he there lets us know. <hi>Error</hi> is as Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as <hi>Vice;</hi> the one is an open Road, the other but a more By-path to Hell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Take heed therefore, and what
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:003142_0139_0FF011D91D8505A8"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.14. I would ſay to you on this occaſion, <hi>Continue in the things you have learn'd and be not by any means turn'd aſide from them</hi> And that you may take heed, I'll here for a Cloſe leave with you a few Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Con. <hi>The Way now Recommended for your Walk and Continuance in, is in all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of it that good old way our Pious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors walked in, and which as they have vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Recommended to us their Children, ſo God has variouſly witneſſed his Approbation of.</hi> Its in all the Eſſentials of it the ſame way they walked in. Indeed of us who are of the Preſent Day, it may be ſaid that our Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments generally ſpeaking in that way are much ſhort of what theirs were, at leaſt many of them; Where are thoſe Eminent degrees of Faith, Love, Holineſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that were Conſpicuous in many of them? In how few to be found? Yet the way we walk in and deſire your Adherence to and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in, is the ſame ſtill as to all Eſſentials of it. Our Doctrines of Faith and Precepts of Life were theirs alſo, they Believed and Practiſed them, and handed them down to us. Our Miniſtry and Worſhip are the ſame with theirs in all the Eſſentials of them. We do not in any thing material differ from them in theſe things. What I now ſay is ſo
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:003142_0140_0FF011DCD2C45A10"/>well known to moſt, that any thing in way of proof can't I think, be needful. And this way, I ſay, they have variouſly Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, and God has variouſly Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed his Approbation of it, that its the way he has Choſen and Ordained for us to walk in. Beſides their great Concern and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to train us up in and inure us to it, (whereby they bore witneſs to it) they have Recommended it by their frequent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations to it and that both while living and when dying. We have in our hands, &amp; no doubt many of you have alſo, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of many of them while living, as wherein tho' they are now dead, yet they beſpeak us their Children in ſuch words as theſe, <hi>viz This is the Right way, walk in it: In this way we walking have ſound God, Received Tokens for good from him,</hi> the Pledges and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of his Favour, even thoſe that are the Earneſts of the Eternal Inheritance And not only ſo, but as holy <hi>David</hi> when Old and Dying, being fill'd with a Pious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for <hi>Solomon</hi> that he might both do and be well after he was gone, left it in Charge with him to <hi>know the God of his Fathers, and ſerve him with a Perfect Heart and willing Mind,</hi> in the ſame way they had gone before him, in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28 9. So have not many of our Pious Progenitors done in like manner?
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:003142_0141_0FF011DE83DA2908"/>Of how many of them may we ſay that words of this Import, were their laſt words to us? And with them they took their leave of us: thereby giving witneſs to this way and aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing us that our Adherance to and Walk in it was what they look'd upon to be of an Importance for us beyond other things, and was therefore what lay on their Spirits with a peculiar Concern. Now this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration methinks ſhould be of <hi>weight</hi> with us, and mightily arm us with Reſolution to adhere to it, and withſtand all attempts or endeavours of any whatever to turn us aſide from this way. I'm ſure it will be ſo with all thoſe that are wiſe, and Conſider who and what thoſe our Progenitors were, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioularly that they were of thoſe of whom the Pſalmiſt ſays Pſal. 25.14. <hi>That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Lord is with them, and that to them be ſheweth his Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, The Moſt High Himſelf has variouſly ſignified and witneſſed his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it. I might luſtance here in more things than one, but it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, He has done ſo by that peculiar Bleſſing wherewith he has attended or followed it, whereby he has made it effectual for ſaving good to Multitudes. It's but little more then one Century of Years ſince <hi>New-England</hi> was numbred among thoſe Dark Places of
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:003142_0142_0FF011E04CEFA158"/>the Earth that are fill'd with the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cruelty, where Satan Reigns, and which belong to his viſible Kingdom, as having never been viſited with the Day Spring from on High. But ſince the happy Day has dawned, and it has been Bleſſed with the preſent Eſtabliſhed Religion and way of Worſhip, I believe that all Impartial Perſons, being Judges, will allow it has been a Fruitful Mother, bringing forth more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God, and more Serious, Pure and Practical Religion than perhaps any other Place in the known World, <hi>Caeteris Paribus,</hi> has done. And this I take to be a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its being what God approves of and is well pleaſing to him. And may not we of the Eſtabliſhed Miniſtry in <hi>New-England,</hi> on this Occaſion, with little variation ſay to you as Paul on the like Occaſion did to the Corinthians 1 Cor. 9 2. <hi>If we are not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to others, yet doubtleſs we are to you, for the Seal of Our Miniſtry are ye in the Lord.</hi> The Converſion of ſo many Sinners to a Life of Serious, Practical Religion, and the Building up ſo many Saints in Faith and Holineſs, is Gods Seal to Our Miniſtry; and what we may with good Reaſon look upon as an Evidence of its being what he approves of. Now it being ſo, every one will ſay its not eaſy to believe any ſuch Exceptions
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:003142_0143_0FF011E2C05F5A28"/>ſhould lie againſt this way as may excuſe any man in deſerting of it. Eſpecially when here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the following are Conſidered, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Con <hi>That in this way of Religion or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip you have a True Goſpel Miniſtry in all the Eſſentials of it</hi> i. e. A Number of men in Succeſſion who being competently qualifi'd for the Miniſterial work, are Lawfully called and ſet apart to it. None I think will doubt of this, but ſuch as Diſ-believe the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular; ſince if that be true, this is little leſs than a neceſſary Deduction or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary from it. That our Miniſtry, generally ſpeaking, are ſo far entich'd with Furniture for their Work or Office as to be capable of anſwering the main deſigns of it, I preſume will be allowed me. And tho' as to their Call and Separation to it, ſome may think it not according to the order of the Goſpel, yet for my own part I'm not able to ſee thoſe things by Poſitive Laws or otherwiſe ſo Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited or Reſtrained there, to any particular Mode or Modes of them, as to doubt of the Lawfulneſs of them as Practiced among us, at leaſt under our preſent Circumſtances. As for the right of Nominating, Electing &amp; Calling Miniſters to their Office, certain it is that in different Places of the World, and Ages of the Church it has been variouſly aſſumed and uſed; ſometimes by the <hi>Laity,</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:003142_0144_0FF011E6726AC4D0"/>ſometimes the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and at other times by the <hi>Civil Powers:</hi> and no doubt there may be caſes wherein either of them may rightfully do ſo. But I ſhall not here enter into this Controverſy, nor can I think it needful ſince I preſume there are few, if any, who will deny the Eſtabliſhed Miniſtry in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to have the Eſſentials of a true Goſpel Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Con <hi>The various Objections againſt this Miniſtry with which the Mouths of ſuch Seducers as would turn you away from it are fill'd, are Abſurd, of no Validity, nor can in any wiſe juſtify you in Deſerting of it.</hi> Among the ſeveral things which deprav'd reaſon (or ſomething worſe) in Seducers of all Ages has ſuggeſted as proper to turn Men from the Truth, one has been this, <hi>viz.</hi> Endeavours to load with Infamy ſuch as are the Teachers and ſet for the defence of it; and thereby bring them into Diſ-reputation with their hearers. According to which, as no Age of the Church ſcarce has been free from them, ſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of CHRIST have ever been the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Invectives and Railery. Thus it is in this our Day. He is a Stranger to the men of this Character among us who knows not that they have nothing ſo much in view, and in which they ſo much lay out themſelves as in Endeavours to bring an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:003142_0145_0FF011E811FA8618"/>upon the Miniſtry in the Land, and hurt their Reputation &amp; Intereſt with their People. To which End they are daily ſpending their Invectives upon it; and ſuch Truths taught &amp; maintained by it, as whereby their Enormous Opinions and Practices are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Of this Strain and Tenor, and little elſe but this, are the generality of the Harangues with which they entertain their Hearers. But how Abſurd and Senſeleſs their Objections are, and how unable to Apologiſe for a deſerting this Miniſtry you will ſee in the following view of them.</p>
            <p>To Inſtance then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what is related in the fore-going Narrative, as offered on the Third Article, I can't but preſume you agree with me in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Miniſters may of right Demand ſomething in way of Reward for their Work, &amp; by Conſequence that its no Valid plea or exception againſt our Miniſtry that they do ſo.</hi> This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one knows is a main exception againſt it, eſpecially in the Mouths of thoſe Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries you are now Cautioned againſt giving heed to. Thoſe of the Eſtabliſhed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in the Country they ſay are Hirelings, they Teach for Hire and Divine for Money, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. — Yea and what is worſe, they are Greedy Dogs &amp; Ravenous Wolves than devour their Flocks: Therefore come not
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:003142_0146_0FF011EAA0649658"/>nigh them. And what they think juſtifies them in this Opprobrious Language, is only this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Miniſters according to the allowance &amp; grant of CHRIST their Maſter, demand &amp; receive from their People, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in way of Reward for their work. I grant, that in caſes where its evident that <hi>Gain</hi> is a Miniſters laſt or higheſt end; and that indeed the Teacheth for <hi>Hire</hi> &amp; Divines for <hi>Money,</hi> in the ſenſe of the Prophet there, he is juſtly entitul'd to thoſe opprobrious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithets. But in order to the conviction of any one in this point, ſomething more is needful than meerly his Preaching the Doctrine of CHRIST &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> in this matter, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing according to it; <hi>i. e.</hi> His aſſerting his Right to partake and his actual receiving of the Temporal good things of thoſe, unto whom he communicates them that are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; this I ſay alone will not do it, ſince as there is a vaſt difference between Preaching for Money; or other Temporal good things, &amp; taking them for Preaching; ſo this laſt is no more than his great LORD has veſted him with a Right to do, and is of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all the deſigns of his Office. But I need not add here, conſidering what has been ſaid above on this Head. Nor,</p>

               </gap>eaſing after a time, there was not a like neceſſity of their being continued to ſucceding Miniſters. When thoſe <hi>firſt</hi> Miniſters of CHRIST had Publiſh'd
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:003142_0150_0FF011F359E9AAC0"/>the Doctrine of the Goſpel, &amp; thereby Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the knowlege of it to others, there was then among thoſe to whom they had ſo Communicated it, ſome that were ſo far forth furniſhed to be Miniſters of it too, &amp; there was no neceſſity of an extraordinary &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation of it to them. And when by <hi>Signs, Wonders</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by them, the Doctrine they Preached was witneſſed to from Heaven, and proved to be from thence, 'twas not needful that a like Power of Miracles ſhould be continued to their Succeſſors. And further, When in purſuance of their extenſive Commiſſion, they had gone into all the World, &amp; Preached the Goſpel among all Nations, gathered Churches &amp; Ordained Officers in them; what occaſion was there for the continuance of the gift of Tongues? <hi>And in a word,</hi> When by theſe means the Foundations of Chriſtianity were laid, and it had obtained ſome Reputation &amp; Intereſt among men, thoſe who Succeeded them had not the like occaſion for that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Preſence, Guidance &amp; Aſſiſtance of the SPIRIT that was Vouchſafed to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are plain &amp; ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any that tho' there was a Neceſſity thoſe firſt Miniſters ſhould be Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Furniſhed, Called and Aſſiſted to and in their Work as they were, yet that there is

               </gap>igh, God &amp; Nature we ſay, do nothing in Vain; nothing without ſuch Reaſons and Ends as Juſtify the doing of it: This doubtleſs is as true as any Article of Our Creed; but how it can be ſo, Provided what theſe Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Objectors ſay, be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That all True Miniſters of Chriſt in all Ages are Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, Called and Aſſiſted as the Apoſtles were, I am not able to ſee. On this Ground alone, were there no other, we may, I think, ſafely conclude that if among the many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Character of the true Miniſters of Chriſt, any are to be found that are really ſo, as doubtleſs there are, they are in theſe Reſpects a ſet of men different from what thoſe firſt Miniſters were. But for further Conviction here, before I leave this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I would ask theſe ſilly Objectors what they intend when they ſay that all thoſe that are the true Miniſters of Chriſt are Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, Called and Aſſiſted in the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, extraordinary manner the Apoſtles were? Do they intend that in all Reſpects they ſtand upon a Level with them in theſe
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:003142_0152_0FF011F7BB56C008"/>things, or in ſome only? I think there are few, if any, of them now under ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Enthuſiaſm or Madneſs as to pretend the former: As Blind as they are they ſee this will be in effect to deny that Chriſt has now, or in any Age ſince thoſe firſt Miniſters went off has had, any true Miniſters on Earth; ſince among the or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oy that pretend to be ſo, there are none to be found endued with thoſe Powers of Miracles, Tongues, and diſce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ning of Spirits which they had I Charitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they themſelves think that thoſe who in any time paſt have, or now may pretend to thoſe things, were and are V le deceivers. All that they can be underſtood therefore to intend, when thus they ſay, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That what Furniture the true Miniſters of CHRIST have for their Work, is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the SPIRIT; that by Him they are immediately called to it; and that what they do in it is by his immediate Suggeſtion and Aſſiſtance This as I take it, is what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, &amp; this ſome of theſe ſilly Objectors, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch as are Teachers among them, pretend to: And hence as they declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> as they call it, as what is no ways neceſſary to accompliſh any for the Miniſtry, wait not for a call from Man, ſo in Preaching, Renoencing all Previous Meditation or Study to prepare for it; they
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:003142_0153_0FF011FAC0B81118"/>depend, as they ſay, <hi>entirely</hi> on the Suggeſtions and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit. But now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this to be the caſe with all true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, that they are thus furniſhed, called &amp; aſſiſted, yet this comes much ſhort of what was Viſible in the Apoſtles; and it muſt remain a Truth even with theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors themſelves, that its no valid Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Plea againſt our Miniſtry, that they are not in all points ſuch as the Apoſtles were. But further, How do theſe Men prove that even this is the juſt or true Character of the Goſpel Miniſter? and that they themſelves, or ſuch as are Teachers among them at leaſt, who they ſay, are the only true Miniſters of CHRIST, are thus immediately furniſhed for, called to, and aſſiſted in their Work? Why we have but their <hi>Autos Ephe,</hi> their bare word for it, nor muſt we expect any thing more. Whatever ſome of them in times paſt, being under an extraordinary Infatuation, have done yet there are none of them now, I think, make any pretences to that evidence or proof of this, the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of old gave, or any other that might be equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and ſatisfying to ſuch as doubt of the Truth of what they ſay. And this to me, and I believe to all Men that are not given up to ſuch ſtrong Del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſion as to believe Lies, is a convincing evidence theſe Miſerable
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:003142_0154_0FF011FC53D2DFF8"/>Creatures are ſadly deceived, and that what ever they think and would perſwade others to think concerning the Spirit by which they are, as they ſay, thus furniſhed, called and aſſiſted, Yet that really &amp; in truth it is no other than that fallen Spirit that of old ſaid reſpecting <hi>Ahab's</hi> Prophets, <hi>I'll go forth &amp; be a Lying Spirit in their Mouths,</hi> 1 King. 22.22. For certainly were they immediately Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, Called &amp; Aſſiſted, as they ſay, they would be enabled to give ſuch Proof of it as the Apoſtles did, or ſome other that might be equally ſatisfying; and we ſhould not be left to their Word only for ſatisfaction in that matter. Princes when they ſend their Embaſſadors on any Errand, expect not that thoſe to whom they are ſent ſhould depend on their naked Word only for proof of their Miſſion, but together with their Inſtructions, furniſh them with ſuch Credentials as may be an evidence of it: And can we think that the Moſt High in this affair, which all muſt allow to be of the Higheſt Importance, would leave us at ſuch uncertainty whom he ſends, as in that caſe he muſt do? Is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his Wiſdom and Goodneſs? No furely, for how ſhould we know who to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or how to diſtinguiſh ſuch as thus came from him, from Deceivers! Contrary to this we find all along, that when he has thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:003142_0155_0FF011FFE0D8D040"/>and ſent any Perſons on any Errand or Buſineſs, he has at the ſame time furniſh'd them with ſuch things as might be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to all that they were ſo ſent. He is Blind that in Reading the Scriptures can't ſee this, and its needleſs for me to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it on Record there. From whence I think we may, yea we muſt Conclude that neither is this the true Character of a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſter, that he is not one immediately furniſhed for, called and aſſiſted to and in his Work and that as for ſuch as ſay they are ſo and therefore true Miniſters of CHRIST, they do but Lie and deceive us. And further, That if we would find the men that are ſo, we muſt look for them elſe-where, and not among theſe Vile pretenders to the things they are ſtrangers to. To Conclude, Tho' we find in Scripture, the appointment of a Miniſtry in the Church to the End of the World, yet we no where find theſe things mentioned as the Character of that Miniſtry, but on the other hand that it is a number of Men in ſucceſſion, who being by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bleſſing of GOD on proper endeavours of their own, ſo furniſhed with Light and Grace as to be capable of the Ends of the Miniſterial Work, are by Man regularly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet apart to it; and by the ordinary Influences of Grace Aſſiſted in it. And if
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:003142_0156_0FF01202D35F55D8"/>this be ſo, as I think its not difficult to prove, its to be hoped the generality of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have a fair claim to be accounted of this Number, &amp; by Conſequence that its no juſt exception againſt them that they ſtand not upon a Level with the Apoſtles in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars. Nor Finally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Do we impoſe on our People, teach them to obſerve things unneceſſary, and Doctrines which we think Falſe and don't ourſelves Believe.</hi> The contrary to this, how much ſoever of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my it carries with it, yet is what may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be heard from the Mouths of theſe Men. Our Miniſters, they ſay, are Deceivers, walk in Craftineſs, impoſe on their People unneceſſary Burdens; and urge on them the belief of Doctrines they themſelves don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. To this effect, as is before obſerved, ſome of them Scrupled not to ſay of us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Debate related above. To which Opprobrious Charge, not rendring Evil for Evil, nor Railing for Railing, I hope we can ſay with the Bleſſed Apoſtle in the like caſe, 1 Cor. 4.12, 13. <hi>That being Reviled, we Bleſs; being Defamed we intreat.</hi> We wiſh them more Charity, and beg of GOD to give it them; and further, that we can Appeal to Heaven for a Teſtimony of our Innocence in theſe points. I'm ſure I know not the Man of this Character concerning whom I
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:003142_0157_0FF012048D5C8458"/>dare think otherwiſe. Its not difficult to guets what theſe Objectors refer to when they thus Reproach us: They, or at leaſt ſome of them, think the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, Rituals of Religion, which like thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law are now ceas'd and of no Obligation. This is what they Teach, and perhaps ſome of them, from the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them, may Believe. But does it therefore follow that they are really ſo, &amp; that we in Preaching another Doctrine do teach the Obſervance of unneceſſary things? Tis not long ſince ſome of them taught the ſame Doctrine concerning the BIBLE it ſelf, and ſcrupled not to load that Sacred BOOK with the moſt Opprobrious Epithets. And does it thence follow that that is unneceſſary too, &amp; that we in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe teach unneceſſary things? To be ſhort, How Trifling and Unneceſſary ſo ever theſe men, (viewing theſe Sacred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of our LORD ſimply in themſelves and not conſidering at the ſame time, nor perhaps underſtanding, heir Relation to the Covenant, their Symbolical Nature, nor their deſigned End or Uſe,) may think them, yet we that know theſe things &amp; conſider them, can't but look upon them as ſignal diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Wiſdom and Grace of CHRIST, very neceſſary to be retained and obſerved,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:003142_0158_0FF0120711EA70E8"/>and of great Advantage to the ends of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. And further, as for our Doctrine Reſpecting the Neceſſity of them we are ſure its among the things left in Charge to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, by Chriſt their Maſter in that Commiſſion by which we Preach.</p>
            <p>Nor is it difficult to Conje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ture what they intend, when they charge us with Preaching Doctrines which we our ſelves think falſe &amp; don't believe. To this head no doubt belong our Doctrines reſpecting the <hi>ſubject</hi> &amp; <hi>Manner of Baptiſm.</hi> To which I ſhall only ſay, That as I have no reaſon to doubt that we all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as we Teach in thoſe matters, ſo on what Grounds we do ſo; I have in part, at leaſt, accounted for them in the foregoing Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. To the ſame head alſo, doubtleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long our Doctrines reſpecting the <hi>Decrees of GOD, Original Sin,</hi> the <hi>Extent of CHRIST's Redemption, &amp;c.</hi> In all which they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Oppoſite to Us, and Teach in thoſe Points what thoſe men of Great Renown with <hi>them</hi> (<hi>Pelagius</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminius</hi>) before them have taught. To which I ſhall think it enough to ſay that as theſe things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly to be Rank'd among the <hi>Duſnoeta</hi> of Religion <hi>i. e.</hi> Things hard to be under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="unknown:003142_0159_0FF0120A8D040030"/>talk of things they underſtand not; and which are utterly beyond their Sphere or Compaſs. And as it would better become ſuch Perſons to be more Modeſt, either wholly Silent or leſs Dogmatical and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in theſe matters, which indeed are a great deep, and puzzle the moſt Learned &amp; knowing Head, ſo as for what we teach Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, we Conceive it to be according to the Faith which of Old was delivered to the Saints; and being as ſure of this as Our beſt endeavours to be rightly informed in theſe things can make us, if after all we are miſtaken, we have reaſon to hope God will not impute it to us for Sin.</p>

Who in his right Wits can think thoſe that adhere to and follow them are exalted above you in this Reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are under better Advantages to attain that bleſſed Place and End at laſt than you? Have they better means of Inſtruction and growth in Grace? Are their Teachers more knowing than yours, or are they more Painful and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?

Who can think ſo, yea who knows not the Contrary to this to be truth? And that partly thro' the want of neceſſary helps for the obtainment of that Knowledge that is neceſſary to qualify any to be Teachers of others, and partly thro' an Avow'd Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Contempt of them, they are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking a Set of men extreamly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, eſpecially in matters of Faith or Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,

A little Converſation with them is enough to ſatisfy any one of this. Nor do I Remember any one (of the many I have Conferred with) that was able to account for even any of the more Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Doctrines of Chriſtianity, with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in our work, tho' I'm far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are no Inſtances among us of the want of it; &amp; inſtead of ſaying ſo, I will rather ſay, Would to GOD there were fewer of them; Yet I look upon my ſelf bound charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to think this is not the Caſe with the generality, no nor with many of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

When we pretend to be the mouth of God to our People, we can't think ourſelves faithful in only delivering to them an old Premeditated, and yet Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, Senſeleſs, Unintelligible heap of <hi>Jargon,</hi> which perhaps we have gone over with ſcores of times before, and in endeavours to eſtabliſh ſome Extra-eſſential matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ from others, and in ſpending ſome of our Gall in Invective and Railery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as diſſent from us; this indeed is all, I, or perhaps any one elſe, have ever heard from the mouths of thoſe Teachers I am now diſſwading you from; and this, they, and perhaps many of their miſerable, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded hearers think Merits for them the Character of Faithful: And verily when I can think ſo too, I'll agree with them and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege they are bleſſed with the moſt faithful Teachers.

When poor People hear thoſe deſpiſe the Miniſtry, that once were conſtant hearers, &amp; hear thoſe deride Family Duties, and Holy Walking, &amp; the Lords Day, who once ſeemed Godly, they may think that ſure theſe men that have tried this ſtrict way, ſee ſome Evil in it, or elſe they would never ſpeak againſt it ſo much.

And uſually when they run up into a Pulpit or Preach in Private, the chief ſcope of their Doctrine is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the People that the Miniſters are Seducers and Liars, and falſe Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if the poor People were in the ſure way to Salvation, if they could but have baſe thoughts of their Miniſters; and as if the firſt thing that they have need to learn to make them Happy, were to Scorn their Teachers, whom the Holy Ghoſt commands them to Obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. and highly to eſteem them for their Works ſake, and know them to be over them in the LORD, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. How could all the Devils in Hell have found out a more effectual means to make all the People deſpiſe and diſregard the Goſpel, and ſo to Periſh cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and ſpeedily, than by thus bringing them to Vilify the Meſſengers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and think it a vertue to reproach and forſake their Guides.</q> And <hi>pag.</hi> 146 you have theſe words, <q>In my own experience I never knew the Labours of any Zealous Anabaptiſt that ever GOD Bleſſed to the true Converſion of many Souls; but many they make meer talking, cenſorious Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatiſts, and uſually there leave them.

And theſe are the uſual fruits of the Doctrine of Anabaptiſtry where it comes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much more of the ſame ſtrain or tenor I might have cited from the Pages above mentioned, but this is enough to ſatisfy any man how greatly diſſerviceable to Religion theſe men have been in other parts of the World, what dreadful effects have attended
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:003142_0184_0FF0124731A895E0"/>or followed them wherever they have come, and how much it ſtands every one in hand to take heed of them, and of giving the leaſt Countenance or Favour to them.</p>
            <p>Nor can this ſeem at all incredible to any one that takes a view of the Condition of Religion in ſuch places of this Land, as in which this Sect (or Sects) have obtained, and have not been favoured with better helps to further that Intereſt in them When Mr. <hi>Wheelright,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and others of their way that firſt ſowed the Tares of Antinomianiſm &amp; Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm in <hi>New-England,</hi> were for their Sedition and Blaſphemies Baniſhed the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> they (or at leaſt many of them) went into the Neighbouring Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Rhode-Iſland;</hi> where they and ſome who in Succeſſion have imbibed their Errors, have ever ſince been almoſt the only helps (if I may call them ſo) that miſerable People have had to help forward among them the great intereſt of Religion, till of late Years: And who viewing the Condition of it among them, can think theſe men have been of any ſervice to it? Yea who can think otherwiſe than that they have been very Prejudicial to it, have been ſo far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men forward in the Poſitives of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they have even almoſt utterly
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:003142_0185_0FF0124AF7F3AB60"/>Ras'd out the very Naturals of it. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that People (at leaſt the moſt of thoſe I have had opportunity to obſerve) had been far better, had had much more of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion than they have, had they been left purely to the dim light of Nature, without any further advantage or help. They are not ſuch moral Pagans as the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone ordinarily ſuffices to make men, but what is much worſe. And as to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples what <hi>Calvin</hi> in the place before cited ſays of the <hi>Familiſts</hi> and <hi>Antinomians</hi> of his day, is true of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are a Sea of Dotages and Errors, there being few of the Hereſies perhaps advanced by any ſince Chriſt's Day, that are not taught by one or other among them.</p>
            <p>And if we look into any other Places where theſe men have made entrance and gained Parties to themſelves, what can we find that may give us reaſon to hope they have ſerved the Intereſt of Religion in any one Soul? Among thoſe that follow and adhere to them where ſhall we find a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Prayerful, Painful Chriſtian that makes it his Care to walk with GOD, and ſhew forth the power of Godlineſs in his life? For my own part among all thoſe of them I now do, or ever did know, I never knew one concerning whom there was reaſon thus
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:003142_0186_0FF0124CC4F5F560"/>to think. No, this is not what they endeavour to bring Perſons to: If they can but gain them to their <hi>Senſeleſs Opinions,</hi> furniſh them with ſome Objections againſt the Eſtabliſhed Religion of the Country, render them Prompt and ready at Invective and Railery againſt Miniſters, and prevail on them to forſake our Aſſemblies, neglect Family Prayer, Prophane the Sabbath <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis enough, and there they leave them, they are now Good Chriſtians.

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:003142_0189_0FF01254A78007B0"/>And when I found any want of Strength, I ſhould Pray to GOD to aſſiſt me, &amp; I tho't He would be, as it were obliged to help me, and I ſhould be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; all would be well: And when I heard or read that we muſt depend on CHRIST for Salvation, I tho't it eaſie to Believe —. But true Faith in CHRIST, that was the thing I wanted; I was quite ignorant as to any Saving Knowledge of CHRIST, as I afterwards was made to ſee clearly. But I was firſt brought into great perplexity of Thoughts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the right Way of Salvation; the full of which would take up many Hours, yea Days and Weeks to Relate, if I had retained it all in Memory. In ſhort, The occaſion of my Solicitude at firſt was my halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between two Opinions; being ignorant in the natural Darkneſs of my mind, &amp; not confidering of what eternal weight &amp; moment the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are to our precious Souls; and of what ſad Conſequence my liſtening to new Opinions might be, I ſuffered my ſelf to be drawn away, inſenſibly, into Error: And I believe GOD was angry with me for my too great Neglect &amp; Coldneſs about the Means of Salvation, that I was brought up under, &amp; for my liſtning to new Doctrines; and therefore leſt me to ſtrong Perſwaſions that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were in the only right way to Heaven; becauſe they were a Separate People, and ſeem'd to be full of Love &amp; Charity to one another, &amp; to contem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Vanities of the World, and to be very Zealous in their way.</p>
            <p>The firſt Quaker I heard was one <hi>Jonathan Tyler,</hi> who came out of <hi>England,</hi> being mov'd thereto (as he profeſs'd) by the SPIRIT, that he might lead People in this Land out of their dark State, unto the true Light! I was much taken with the Sermons he Preach'd at ſeveral time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> &amp; places: He ſpake much againſt Sin, &amp; ſet forth an holy Life as moſt Excelient, I tho't he was the holieſt &amp; humbleft &amp;
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:003142_0190_0FF0125820B1B488"/>moſt zealous man that ever I had ſeen or heard; and I never before was ſo Affected with any Means that ever I had been undex. I concluded the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be the beſt People in the world: I could not bear to hear any body ſpeak Uncharitably of them; A Perſon tho' never ſo mean, that had but the Name of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> I could not but have an high Opinion of; and I wiſh'd for nothing in the world more than to be like Them. I tho't they were far above the People of other Perſwaſions: I perceived by their own Confeſſions in Prayer, that other People were full of Sin; but theſe, I ignorantly thought, had none to Confeſs. I ſhould earneſtly Cry to GOD to give me ſuch a Spirit as they had. I thought I could have followed them to the farther end of the world; Yea, I was ſo ſatisfied and confident that they were the true People of GOD (eſpecially after I had heard many of them Preach, &amp; had been much Converſant in the Houſe of one <hi>D. Z.</hi> a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> in <hi>Boſton</hi>) that I am well aſſured all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world could hardly ever have ſhaken my good Opinion of them. I deſired never to hear any other Miniſters, and ſhould have readily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd my ſelf a <hi>Quaker</hi> (for their Habit and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage I could eaſily have Conformed unto, and the Shame of the world ſeem'd nothing to me) Only I had not yet attain'd (as I blindly tho't) to their degree of Light &amp; Comfort &amp; Holineſs &amp; freedom from Sin; ſo that I tho't it would be Hypocriſie to own my ſelf one of them, till I had farther Humbled my ſelf &amp; gotten the Victory over Sin.</p>
            <p>But one thing ſeems Remarkable! While I was Waiting &amp; earneſtly Seeking Day &amp; Night for the Spirit &amp; Light, which I tho't the <hi>Quakers</hi> had, GOD ſhould put it into my Heart, to beg earneſtly (altho' it was not from any Jealouſie of the Truth of their Principles, yet it was in my heart to Beſeech) of the

            <p>And if I tho't at any time (becauſe my Life had been Blameleſs before men) that I had not Sinn'd &amp; Fallen ſo as ſuch &amp; ſuch had done; yet it was ſet home upon my Heart, that I had as much Guilt on my Conſcience, as if I had broken every one of the Commandments an Hundred times over My Sins in Tho't Word &amp; Action, from my Childhood were in great Swarms bro't into my mind; but yet my Unbelief ſeem'd greater than all.

I was much diſtreſſed, eſpecially at times, 'till after ſerious deliberation, I reſolved to ſeek CHRIST in his Ordinances: and deſiring the LORD to guide me, according to the Scriptures, &amp; not having been Baptized, I deſired to ſearch the Scriptures, Concerning that Ordinance: but I quickly found that Satan had not left me: I had new Aſſaults; and I was dreadfully afraid I ſhould fall back again into thoſe Errors, which I had ſeen to be ſo dangerous: I trembled for fear they ſhould be ſet before me; I hardly dared ſometimes, to open my Bible, for fear leſt I ſhould miſ-underſtand the Scriptures; which (the Apoſtle ſays) <hi>the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and Unlearned do wreſt to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> I cry'd again to God in my diſtreſs, and he heard me, and from the Scriptures of Truth I was perſwaded that CHRIST would have his Diſciples Baptized with water; Eſpecially by ſuch plain Scriptures as theſe, Acts 8.36 37. <hi>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the Eunuch ſaid, See, here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip ſaid If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayst. So Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:003142_0197_0FF0126960727908"/>be baptized which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he Commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the LORD. ver.</hi> 48. And now the argument that had been uſed with me, over and over in vain, while I was blinded by Prejudice, deep Prejudice againſt this Ordinance, which I had drunk in from the Quakers Books, I ſay now it ſeemed quite another thing, namely, that CHRIST's Miniſters muſt act according to their Commiſſion: Their Commiſſion is (in Math. 28.19) <hi>Teach all nations, baptizing them—And lo I am with you to the End of the World:</hi> It was therefore to be a Rule to all that ſhould ſucceed them, in Teaching Men and Women their Duty, in after ages. Now the only Diſpute is, What baptiſm this is; the Apoſtles doubtleſs underſtood their Commiſſion, and without doubt would not Practiſe Contrary to their knowledge: yet we find them baptizing three thouſand at one time. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. and, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places, we find it was water they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them with: therefore all that have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to teach, have Authority to baptize with water, otherwiſe the Apoſtles muſt needs act Contrary to their Commſſion: How plain did this ſeem to me, when my Eyes were opened. And the other Seal of the Covenant ſeemed as plain. Not but that I had many doubts before I was ſetled: But the light prevailed over my Darkneſs: &amp; I thought how the Apoſtles ſaw but thro' a glaſs darkly: and CHRIST's words to <hi>Thomas</hi> relieved me, when I deſired to ſee things more clearly, <hi>Bleſſed are they who have not ſeen and yet have believed:</hi> I thought I muſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the plain word of GOD, notwithſtanding Temptations to the Contrary and much carnal reaſoning in my heart againſt my Duty. And no ſooner was this purpoſe ſetled in my mind, that I would ſeek CHRIST in theſe ways of his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I found peace and quietneſs; and was
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:003142_0198_0FF0126B2F562A00"/>Confident I ſhould find and enjoy more of CHRIST in the Sacrament. Since I was Propounded, I have been more and more confirmed in the Truth. The laſt Sabbaths Doctrine, concerning Election, ſeemed the Sweeteſt Doctrine to me that ever I heard in my life. And yet I Wondred not that it ſeems ſo dark to many, not only Quakers but others; for it is above Natural light and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſanctified reaſon. I thought, yea, I knew aſſuredly, if GOD would pleaſe to ſhine into the darkeſt hearts with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light, it would quickly Satisfie them, that if there be no Election, there's no free Grace, nor certainty of Salvation. It ſeemed plain to me, that if this Foundation Stone be removed, the whole building of Religion muſt unavoidably fall to the ground. Since GOD has brought me ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Darkneſs into his Marvellous light, he has alſo ſtirred up in me a deep ſenſe of the ſad Eſtate of dark ſouls, let them be of what Religion they will; who have nothing but the light of Nature, and Reaſon, and External Revelation: And my Soul ſeems the more feelingly to pity them, becauſe I know they will take their own apprehenſions of things to be Right: And it ſeems as eaſy to perſwade a man that white is black, as to make us believe that our Legal apprehenſions of the way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with GOD, are quite wrong, 'till a new Light, from the Spirit of GOD, ſhines into our hearts: For want of which the Quakers ſeem (to me now) quite to invert the way of Salvation, while they ſeek to have a Righteouſneſs wrought within, that they may be accepted; whereas they ſhould <hi>firſt</hi> ſeek <hi>Acceptance</hi> in the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which CHRIST himſelf wrought for ſinners, imputed, by Faith, to us, which Faith does not only Juſtifie us, but unite us to CHRIST; and ſo we receive Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, and righteouſneſs inherent, from him, to Juſtifie us, for that is done upon our firſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
