         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Did the Apo≈øtle intend here to Sugge≈øt that the Jaylours Faith ≈øhould Eternally Save his Hou≈øe, or that they ≈øhould be in that ≈øen≈øe Sav'd meerly on his Believing? No ≈øurely, all he could intend by it, was, that on his Believing they ≈øhould be vi≈øibly Sav'd, or bro't into a vi≈øible State of Salvation, or of Right and Heir≈øhip to it, and con≈øequently have right to all the Vi≈øible means of it. And thus much at lea≈øt he mu≈øt intend: So that granting it to be true what ≈øome would have, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were none in his Hou≈øe or Family, but Adult Per≈øons, yet this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge he a≈ø≈øures the Jaylour they ≈øhould all have by his Faith; and if his Adult Children or Servants had ≈øo, who can give a rea≈øon why his Infant Children al≈øo ≈øhould not have the like Priviledge by their Father's Faith, provided he had then any ≈øuch?

This as I'm ≈øure it well agrees with the Doctrine of the Apo≈øtle, when he tells us in the forecited Gal. 3 13. <hi>That the Ble≈ø≈øing of Abraham is come on the Gentiles through Chri≈øt;</hi> So if it be not the rea≈øon why the Go≈øpel was thus Preach'd or Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øed, for my part I know not what was.</p>
            <p>Having laid this Foundation, I came to the more immediate An≈øwer of Mr. <hi>Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Objection or Argument; taken as was ≈øaid from ≈øuch Scriptures as require Faith and Repentance in order to Bapti≈øm, and that we have no Example or In≈øtance in the Word of GOD of any Baptized, but ≈øuch as were ≈øo qualified: To which I replied to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003142_0051_0FF01107ED233CA0"/>this effect, That as for ≈øuch Scriptures as he had a reference to, and which, to many Per≈øons, ≈øeem'd to require Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as univer≈øally nece≈ø≈øary in order to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm, I could not but look upon ≈øuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of them as very wrong, and great Abo≈øes of ≈øuch Scriptures When it is ≈øaid, <hi>He that Believes and is Baptized ≈øhall be Saved,</hi> &amp;c they them≈øelves would ≈øay, It were a manife≈øt abu≈øe of the Text for any to ≈øay, It limited Salvation only to ≈øuch as actually Believed and were Baptized, and implied that no other than they ≈øhould be Saved; and yet this Conclu≈øion may as fairly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Text, as that tho≈øe only that actually believe ≈øhould be Baptized. The one is as much in the Text as the other. And for this rea≈øon with ≈øome others, I told him that when we find Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> required in ≈øome we read of Baptized, as nece≈ø≈øary in order to their Bapti≈øm, as, <hi>viz</hi> in the <hi>Three Thou≈øand</hi> Acts 2. the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Jaylour,</hi> &amp;c. All that Con≈øi≈øtently with rea≈øon we could think was implied or taught us by ≈øuch in≈øtances was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That of tho≈øe that were Adult or grown to Years of Di≈øcretion, they only ≈øhould be Baptized in whom there is a vi≈øible Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And this I told him we all Believed, and is what our daily Practice confirms: But

            </p>
            <p>Hereto I added, That were I or any other Per≈øon or Per≈øons Sent into any part of the Heathen World, to gather Churches there, Vi≈øible Faith and Repentance being things nece≈ø≈øary in all Adult Per≈øons in order to their being Members of the vi≈øible Church, and Bapti≈øm being the Door of Admi≈ø≈øion into it, what Doctrine could we Preach to men, but this of the Apo≈øtles, viz. <hi>Believe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003142_0053_0FF0110DCBC6A600"/>and be Baptized, Repent and be Baptized?</hi> We could Preach no other. But then when any Per≈øons did ≈øo Believe and Repent and were Baptized, and thereby became Members of the Vi≈øible Church, the Que≈øtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salvation does not thereupon come to their Hou≈øes or Families, as of old it did when Parents Believed and were Baptized; or in other words, whether they do not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring in their Children with them, and convey a Member≈øhip to them al≈øo; making them thereby vi≈øibly Heirs of the Promi≈øe &amp; Salvation together with them≈øelves? This I ≈øay, is a Que≈øtion needful to be Re≈øolved by and Per≈øons thus Employed; and ≈øo by You &amp; Us, in order to our knowing what is Duty in the Admini≈øtration of Bapti≈øm. This Que≈øtion I know you re≈øolve in the Negative, and ≈øay; That the Per≈øons ≈øo Believing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, do not thereby bring Salvation to their Hou≈øes, or in other words do not bring their Seed or Children into a ≈øtate of Vi≈øible Salvation; but who, I pray, mu≈øt we believe, You or CHRIST and his Apo≈øtles? Do <hi>you</hi> or <hi>They</hi> Preach True Doctrine here? If Per≈øons ≈øo Believing and Repenting do not thus bring in their Children with them, as you ≈øay, then mo≈øt certainly CHRIST mi≈øs'd it when he told <hi>Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003142_0054_0FF0111009F01CF8"/>to his Hou≈øe;</hi> and the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he told tho≈øe Penitents, <hi>Act</hi> II.

Unle≈øs ≈øome good Rea≈øon can be given why the Faith &amp; Repentance of Believers in that day ≈øhould bring Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Hou≈øes, and not in the pre≈øent; this for my own part I'm not able to do.</p>
            <p>But now if on the other hand, it be true, that CHRIST and his Apo≈øtles are in the right in what they tell us in tho≈øe Texts, the unavoidable Con≈øequence of it will be, that the Infants of Vi≈øible Believers are to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the Ca≈øe in hand, this was the very Ca≈øe with the Apo≈øtles &amp; Evangeli≈øts, tho≈øe fir≈øt Mini≈øters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity; when they were ≈øent out to Preach the Go≈øpel and gather Churches, the whole World, excepting a few that were brought in by the Mini≈øtry of <hi>John the Bapti≈øt</hi> and CHRIST, were either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and both of them Unbelievers, and therefore E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to CHRIST and his Go≈øpel, out of the≈øe they were ≈øent to gather Churches; and it being ≈øo, as I ≈øaid before, Vi≈øible Faith

            <p>At the ≈øame time he read to us from <hi>The Port≈ømouth Di≈øpute,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> informs me, the Title of the Book was) the Opinions of the A≈ø≈øembly of Divines, Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in doing which al≈øo he repre≈øented them as of Opinion that <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> or <hi>plunging</hi> was the Primitive way of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003142_0064_0FF011274B53BC08"/>Baptizing. To which he added, that if this was not the Primitive way, whence was it that the Eunuch was Oblig'd to come forth of his Chariot and go down with <hi>Philip</hi> into the Water in order to his being Baptized? What, ≈øaid he, had not ≈øo great an Officer of Queen <hi>Candace</hi> as he was, any Di≈øh or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ve≈ø≈øel in his Chariot in which a little Water, enough for Sprinkling him, might have been fetch'd? this is very unlikely. He did not acquaint us with the particular Books of the fore-mentioned Authors from whence that Author had made tho≈øe Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor have I to this day ever ≈øeen that Book; ≈øo that whether I have them by me, or if I have, whether that Author was Faithful in making his Collections from them, or Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> read them as Hone≈øtly to us as he did Mr. <hi>Symp≈øon,</hi> I can't ≈øay.</p>
            <p>However as I then wondered to hear tho≈øe two Venerable Names, viz <hi>POOL</hi> and <hi>BAXTER</hi> among them, e≈øpecially the la≈øt, con≈øidering what he ≈øays of Baptizing by Dipping, in his <hi>Plain Scripture Proof of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Church-Member≈øhip and Bapti≈øm,</hi> ≈øo ≈øince Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi>'s Di≈øhone≈øty re≈øpecting Mr. <hi>Symp≈øon</hi> is detected, as I am ≈øtrongly Su≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of ≈øome ≈øuch unfair-dealing as to all the Per≈øons above-named, either by that Author in making his Collections from them,

You will be convinc'd of this when I have cited to you ≈øome Pa≈ø≈øages from them. As for Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> I find it was his Opinion that Dipping in Bapti≈øm was ≈øometimes u≈øed in the Ea≈øtern, Warmer parts of the World; in his Notes on <hi>Mat</hi> 3.5, 6. He has the≈øe words, viz. <q>
                  <hi>A great part of tho≈øe,</hi> i. e. of the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Jeru≈øalem, &amp;c. <hi>who went out to hear John, were Baptized,</hi> i. e. <hi>Dipped in Jordan.</hi>
               </q> But then as he adds in the ≈øame place, <q>
                  <hi>That it will not from hence follow that Dipping is E≈ø≈øential to Bapti≈øm,</hi> So in his Notes on <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23.</q> he as fully expre≈ø≈øes it to be his Opinion that this was not the con≈øtant way or manner of Baptizing in the Primitive times, but that ≈øometimes they Baptized then by applying or pouring on of Water. For there we have the≈øe words, viz. <q>
                  <hi>If ≈øome think it probable from this Text, that ≈øometimes the Apo≈øtles did Baptize by Dipping, yet it is at lea≈øt as Probable that they did not, or not con≈øtantly, from what we read of the Apo≈øtles Baptizing in Hou≈øes, Acts</hi> 9.17, 18 &amp; 10.47, 48. &amp; 16.33.</q> From whence tis evident that as to Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> had that Author or Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> from him, given
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003142_0066_0FF0112CB9466638"/>this account of his Opinion in this matter, viz. <hi>That in the Primitive times, when Time, Place and other Circum≈øtances concurr'd, Bapti≈øm was performed by Dipping, but at other times when tho≈øe Circum≈øtances did not invite to it, 'twas performed by pouring on of Water.</hi> And that however it was then admini≈øtred, yet Dipping is not e≈ø≈øential to it. This had been an Hone≈øt Repre≈øentation of him in this matter; but for them, or either of them to take from him only what I but now cited from his Notes on <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5, 6. with other like Pa≈ø≈øages, perhaps el≈øewhere in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Writings, at the ≈øame time pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing by others, and hereupon repre≈øent him as of Opinion, not only that Dipping was the way of Baptizing only in u≈øe in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, but as needful to be ob≈øerved now in order to the due Admini≈øtration of it, and hereby to bring him in as Patronizing an Error which never entred into his Heart, as Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> then did; This I ≈øay is ≈øuch an abu≈øe of him, as can in no wi≈øe be ju≈øtified, and which I think no Man of Faith and Probity would have been Guilty of: But this is one of the u≈øual Refuges of Error, and what we may oft ≈øee it has recour≈øe to.

<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003142_0096_0FF01174DAB10200"/>they are better than mine, with all the Scriptures that was then brought, &amp; our words their due weight.

For this rea≈øon I ≈øay, (as al≈øo becau≈øe I think there is not any thing in them with an An≈øwer to which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Di≈øcour≈øe does not furni≈øh the Reader) I'll wave any thing of that Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of it annex ≈øome further thoughts on this matter, by which Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> and his Brethren may ≈øee there is more rea≈øon to doubt of Dipping, its being the Primitive way of Baptizing, than perhaps now they do, &amp; at the ≈øame time be convinc'd that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, yet that the Po≈øition laid down by us in this matter (as we ≈øuppo≈øe prov'd) at the Debate, is an Undoubted Truth, and we therefore Ju≈øtifiable in Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject.</p>
            <p>And for this end I'll endeavour to make good the≈øe Two Propo≈øitions. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That a good account may be given why John the Bapti≈øt Baptized in Jordan and Enon, and Philip made u≈øe of the Water of a Fountain, Brook or River in Baptizing the Eunuch, altho' they did not Dipp or Plunge tho≈øe they Baptized.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That ≈øuppo≈øing the utmo≈øt that can be de≈øired by any in this ca≈øe,</hi> viz. <hi>That John the Bapti≈øt, the Apostles, Philip, and the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeli≈øts
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003142_0098_0FF0117A1230E410"/>did Immer≈øe or Dipp tho≈øe they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or that Dipping was really the Primitive Mode of Baptizing, yet this will not prove that others are oblig'd to Baptize in the ≈øame manner al≈øo, &amp; by Con≈øequence that our way of Baptizing by Sprinkling or Pouring on of Water, is Sinful; yea that it will be ≈øo far from it, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, it may be Sinful in others to Immer≈øe or Dipp tho≈øe they Baptize.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>If the≈øe Two Propo≈øitions can be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, I think, that as our Adver≈øaries in this matter will have rea≈øon to abate of their Confidence re≈øpecting the Primitive way of Baptizing, <hi>viz</hi> That it was by Dipping or Plunging; and to be more ≈øparing in their Invectives again≈øt us, for not complying with it; ≈øo at the ≈øame time to ≈øee how Inexcu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are in making this one Ground or Rea≈øon of their ≈øeparating from us. I'll therefore make an E≈ø≈øay here, and ≈øay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That a good account may be given why John the Bapti≈øt Baptized in Jordan and Enon, and Philip made u≈øe of the Water of a Fountain, Brook or River in Baptizing the Eunuch, altho' they did not Dipp or Plunge tho≈øe they Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Opinion of our Adver≈øaries, <hi>viz.</hi> That Dipping was the Primitive way of Baptizing, takes ri≈øe as I conceive principally from the Hi≈øtory we have of the Places of the Bapti≈øms
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:003142_0099_0FF0125F2C8D0398"/>of tho≈øe Two Primitive Mini≈øters; of the former his Baptizing in <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> the latter his making u≈øe of the Water of a <hi>Fountain, Brook</hi> or <hi>River</hi> in Baptizing the Eunuch. Not ≈øo much from the Phra≈øe (of <hi>going down into</hi> &amp; <hi>coming up out of</hi> the Water) made u≈øe of in tho≈øe Hi≈øtories, which have been before taken notice of, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufficiency to prove what they would from them ≈øhewed; this Opinion of theirs I ≈øay, does not ≈øo much take Ri≈øe from the≈øe, as from the con≈øideration of the Places (<hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon</hi>) where they Baptized, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much Water there. And this they think is a good evidence of the Truth of it, in-as-much as if it be ≈øuppo≈øed the <hi>Bapti≈øt</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> did not Dipp tho≈øe they Baptized, no man, they ≈øay, can excogitate or a≈ø≈øign any good rea≈øon why they Baptized in ≈øuch places, rather than others where there was not ≈øuch plenty of Water: To which, I ≈øay, that if other rea≈øons can be given of this, ≈øuch as will well account for, or ju≈øtify their doing ≈øo, though it be ≈øuppo≈øed they did not Dip tho≈øe they Baptized there, the Inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Con≈øequence of this will be, that this Opinion or theirs ≈øtands upon a very Feeble Ba≈øis, ≈øuch as will ≈øcarcely bear them out in their Confidence in it. Now this is what I would here give ≈øome evidence of, and this
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:003142_0100_0FEFD871CD7DD3B0"/>I will do from ≈øeveral Propo≈øitions of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtionable Truth or Certainty, and which, altho', ≈øome of them at lea≈øt, may at fir≈øt view, ≈øeem remote from my pre≈øent bu≈øine≈øs, yet will appear otherwi≈øe when I come to apply or make my de≈øigned u≈øe of them.</p>

And to this our Saviour no doubt has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, when in his Di≈øcour≈øe with the Jews, ≈øpeaking of John, he ≈øays of him, Joh 5.35. <hi>He was a Burning and a Shining Light, and ye were willing for a Sea≈øon to rejoice in his Light, Q.

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) His Wilderne≈øs Life. The Story we have of him a≈ø≈øures us not only that the more Private part of his Life, which continu'd till he was about Thirty Years of Age, was ≈øpent in the Wilderne≈øs, <hi>i. e.</hi> in places Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and but thinly Inhabited; but al≈øo that his Publick Life, or that part of his Time which ≈øucceeded his Entrance upon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was ≈øo too. I remember not that in that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003142_0105_0FF011870E843790"/>part of his Hi≈øtory that relates to us this part of his Life, we find him any where but at <hi>Jordan, Bethabara</hi> and <hi>Enon</hi> and <hi>Parts Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent;</hi> all of them Places remote and not ≈øo ≈øtor'd with Inhabitants as many other parts of the Land. According to which he is ≈øaid, Mat. 3 1. <hi>To come Preaching in the Wilderne≈øs of Judea;</hi> and is ≈øtiled by the Prophet I≈øa. Chap 40.3 <hi>The Voice of one crying in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs, &amp;c.</hi> Otherwi≈øe it was with CHRIST, who ≈øhunn'd no places of greate≈øt Re≈øort; oft Preach'd in the Temple &amp; Synagogues of the Jews, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas <hi>Chemnitius</hi> thinks the Bapti≈øt cho≈øe thus to fulfil his Mini≈øtry in the Wilderne≈øs, rather than in the Temple and other places of Re≈øort, to make an illu≈øtrious difference between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and his LORD; of whom it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øied, Mal. 3.1. <hi>The Lord whom ye ≈øeek, ≈øhall ≈øuddenly come to his holy temple.</hi> I mu≈øt ≈øay, that to me it ≈øeems far more rea≈øonable to think, it was for the Rea≈øon hinted above, <hi>viz.</hi> becau≈øe he knew how he was e≈øteemed or look'd upon by the Leading, Governing part of the Nation, as well as the main Body of the People (at lea≈øt in the clo≈øe of his Mini≈øtry) that they look'd upon him with an evil Eye, as a dangerous Per≈øon, one who it ≈øuffered to proceed, might bring on Changes they de≈øired not; to prevent which there was
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003142_0106_0FF01189C3CEA7B8"/>danger le≈øt they ≈øhould Apprehend and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him, if not inflict greater Evils on him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) It gives us no account of ≈øuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers re≈øorting to him in the latter part of the time of his Mini≈øtry, as in the beginning of it. This will be evident to every one that con≈øiders the Order of things related by the Evangeli≈øts as done by him in the cour≈øe of his Mini≈øtry. With relation to which I ≈øay, That as in the Story we have of him, we never find him any where, during that time but at <hi>Jordan</hi> &amp; <hi>Places adjacent,</hi> viz. <hi>Bethabara</hi> &amp; <hi>Enon,</hi> (which were near to it; the one on the Ea≈øt, the other on the We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide of it) So what it accounts for as done by him, it relates as done in one or other of tho≈øe Places; And further, That he that attentively Reads it, will ≈øe that he di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Mini≈øtry in tho≈øe places in this order, <hi>viz.</hi> fir≈øt at <hi>Jordan,</hi> then at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> and la≈øt at <hi>Enon.</hi> I need not enlarge here to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence this, it being what every one that attentively Reads that part of the Sacred Hi≈øtory will ≈øee. Now we have in it no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ≈øuch Multitudes re≈øorting to him when at <hi>Bethabara</hi> &amp; <hi>Enon</hi> as when at <hi>Jordan.</hi> With re≈øpect to this la≈øt, the Story ≈øays, <hi>Then went out to him Jeru≈øalem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, and were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> great Numbers of all
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:003142_0107_0FF0118C062228F0"/>≈øorts went out. But with re≈øpect to his Baptizing at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> it only informs us of the Conference he had with the Prie≈øts and Levites ≈øent from <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> by the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to Enquire of him who he was, &amp; by what Authority he Baptized; Adding for a clo≈øe, <hi>The≈øe things were done in Bethabara beyond Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, where John was Baptizing;</hi> without a word accounting for the Number that re≈øorted to him there. In like manner, with re≈øpect to his Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, tho' its not to be doubted, there were many who came to and were Baptized of him in tho≈øe Places, ≈øince its manife≈øt he was in great E≈øteem with many, even to the time of his Death, yet in as much as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory is ≈øilent here, makes no mention of ≈øuch Numbers re≈øorting to him when at tho≈øe Places as when at <hi>Jordan,</hi> 'tis rea≈øonable to think they were Comparatively few: which if it was ≈øo, its no doubt to be Re≈øolved into this as the Rea≈øon, <hi>viz.</hi> The Bapti≈øts ≈øink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, declining Reputation among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ≈øort of People.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>P.</hi> As the Southern parts of <hi>Canaan</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Arabia's</hi> &amp; <hi>Egypt,</hi> are more e≈øpecially dry and thir≈øty above the re≈øt; ≈øo it was in this part of that Land that <hi>Philip</hi> met the Eunuch on the Road &amp; Baptized him. This Propo≈øition contains two Particulars in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) That the Southern parts of <hi>Canaan</hi> are more e≈øpecially Dry and Thir≈øty above other parts of it. Of this we are a≈ø≈øured not only by Humane, but Divine Te≈øtimony. <hi>Gerar</hi> (where <hi>Abimelek</hi> was King, and to which <hi>Abraham</hi> Removed from <hi>Mamre</hi> upon the turning the Adjacent place where the City's of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> ≈øtood into a ≈øtinking Lake) was in this part of the Land, yea near the mo≈øt Southern Borders of it. The Lake it ≈øelf where tho≈øe abominable City's ≈øtood, and near to which <hi>Mamre</hi> was is in the Southern parts of it, and from thence the Text tells us he removed ≈øtill more South when he went to <hi>Gerar. Gen.</hi> 20 1. And that this part of the Land was more Dry and Thir≈øty than other parts of it. The Scriptures a≈ø≈øure us in that they let us know that here Principally it was that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were forc't to be at ≈øuch Pains and Co≈øt in procuring Water for their Herds and Flocks by digging Wells or Pitts. Here
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:003142_0110_0FF0119258950F70"/>it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> was at this Pains and Co≈øt for pre≈øerving the lives of his. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.15.18. ‚Äî Here it was that he Contended with <hi>Abimelek</hi> about a Well which his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had violently ≈øeized and taken away. Here it was that the Bond-woman and her Son, <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>I≈øhmael,</hi> being ≈øent into the Wilderne≈øs with a bottle of water, when it was ≈øpent ≈øhe lays the Child under a ≈øhrub and Removing ≈øome di≈øtance from him, ≈øays <hi>Let me not ≈øee the Death of the Child:</hi> And where they were Relieved in that di≈øtre≈øs by a Well of water not far from them, See <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12, to 19. Here in a word it was that the <hi>Phili≈øtins</hi> envying <hi>I≈øaac's</hi> growing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in Flocks and Herds, as an effectual Remedy to prevent it; fill'd up his Wells of water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. forecited. And to add no more, this is that part of <hi>Canaan</hi> wherein <hi>David</hi> hiding him≈øelf from <hi>Saul</hi> calls it <hi>a Dry and Thir≈øty Land where no Water is,</hi> or without Water, as it is in the Original. <hi>P≈øal</hi> 63.1.</p>
            <p>It was in this part of the Land that <hi>Philip</hi> met the <hi>Eunuch</hi> on the Road and Baptized him. This is manife≈øt in the ≈øtory of it; For as <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> it ≈øelf is Scituate in the Southern parts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ≈øo this Eunuch was now in his Return from it home; which home whether it was in the <hi>Arabic</hi> or <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Ethiopia</hi> it matters not as to this, ≈øince in

And whether he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried when taken <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and where he pulled down the Hou≈øe of their god <hi>Dagon</hi> on the Lords of the Phili≈øtins <hi>ver.</hi> 30. this <hi>Gaza</hi> I ≈øay ≈øtood in the very Southern Borders of <hi>Canaan</hi> toward <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Affrica.</hi> In this very Dry and Thir≈øty part of this Thir≈øty Land it was that he met and Baptized him. Now what I Scope at in this and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Propo≈øitions, is, to make it evident that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to Baptize in <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> or ≈øome other places a like Circum≈øtanc'd, tho' it be not ≈øuppo≈øed they Dipp'd tho≈øe they Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: And if I mi≈øtake not, the≈øe Propo≈øitions reflected on, will ≈øugge≈øt ≈øuch rea≈øons for it, as will Convince any unprejudiced Per≈øon, 'twas Wi≈ødom and Nece≈ø≈øary for them to do ≈øo, tho' we ≈øo ≈øuppo≈øe concerning them.</p>
            <p>For let it be Con≈øidered here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>John the Bapti≈øt,</hi> (1) That ≈øince there were ≈øuch Multitudes came to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm

            <p>And here,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:003142_0113_0FF0119982771A80"/>
If it be ≈øaid that as <hi>Dry &amp; Thir≈øty a Land</hi> as this was, yet its not to be doubled, but that there were in it <hi>Towns</hi> or <hi>Cities</hi> (and they Scituate in the Central parts of it too, to which a Re≈øort had been more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the People) ≈øo ≈øtor'd with Pools &amp; Wells, as to be able to furni≈øh with Water for the Bapti≈øm of tho≈øe Multitudes, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they were only Sprinkled or Wa≈øhed, and ≈øatiate the Thir≈øt of them and their Bea≈øts; and that therefore in that ca≈øe he would doubtle≈øs have cho≈øen one or more of tho≈øe Places to Baptize in.

But we find not a Word of this in the Story, but quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz</hi> That it was in the Wilderne≈øs that he met him. The Angel ≈øays to Philip, Ner. 26. <hi>Ari≈øe and go toward the South, unto the way that goeth down from Jeru≈øalem to Gaza, which is De≈øert,</hi> i. e. which <hi>way</hi> is a De≈øert; as <hi>Whitby</hi> renders it exactly according to the Greek. Here, in this Dry &amp; Thir≈øty Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs, where a man may Travel many Miles (yea, may I not ≈øay Scores of Miles?) and not ≈øee a Drop of Water, it was that <hi>Philip</hi> Met and Baptized him, from whence 'tis evident he was obliged to make u≈øe of this Water they came to as they were Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling on the Road, or not Baptize him at all, unle≈øs (as I ≈øaid but now) he had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with him, perhaps, many Miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whereas Mr. <hi>Hitchcock</hi> at that time of the Debate, as I before ob≈øerved, ≈øaid on this In≈øtance, <q>If Philip did not Dipp the Eunuch, why was it that he was obliged to come forth of his Chariot and go down with <hi>Philip</hi> to the Water?

'Tis not therefore ≈øtrange he came forth of his Chariot, as great a man as he was, to be Sprinkl'd or Wa≈øh'd with the Water, tho' he be ≈øuppo≈øed to have never ≈øo many Attendants, and a Score of Golden Bowls with him. And now to conclude this matter, From the≈øe things it appears to me, that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had Wi≈øe and Good rea≈øons for Baptizing in the Places mentioned, where there were ≈øuch large Collections of Water, even tho' they did but Sprinkle or Wa≈øh tho≈øe they Baptized; and it being ≈øo, how Feeble the Argument or our Adver≈øaries mu≈øt be, when from their
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003142_0118_0FF011A57696DE68"/>Baptizing in tho≈øe places they infer that they Dipp'd tho≈øe they Baptized, is what I hope there are none but will ≈øee. And this may ≈øuffice for the Fir≈øt Propo≈øition. The Second is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ≈øuppo≈øing the utmo≈øt that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired by any in this matter,</hi> viz. <hi>That John the Bapti≈øt, the Apo≈øtles, Philip, and other Primitiva Mini≈øters, did Immer≈øe tho≈øe they Baptized; or that Dipping was really the Primitive way of Baptizing, yet this will not prove that all others are obliged to Baptize in the ≈øame manner al≈øo, and by Con≈øequence that our way of Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject is Sinful, yea it will be ≈øo for from it, that notwwith≈øtanding it may be Sinful in others to Immer≈øe or Dipp tho≈øe they Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Propo≈øition contains a Two-fold A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertion, Viz.</p>
            <p n="1">[1] <hi>That ≈øuppo≈øing Dipping was the way in which John the Bapti≈øt, the Apo≈øtles, Philip,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did Baptize, yet this will not prove that all others are obliged to Baptize in the ≈øame manner, and Con≈øequently that our way of Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject, is Sinful.</hi> This I think will be evident to every one that will weigh the following particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That the Examples even of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie≈øt and Be≈øt Men in any ca≈øe or in≈øtance, are not ≈øimply or in them≈øelves binding to
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:003142_0119_0FF011A71CB08F08"/>others. Its true, its our Duty and we are bound in many things to trace the ≈øteps of the Wi≈øe and Holy, and its our Sin when we do not; But why is it ≈øo? Why not meerly becau≈øe they did tho≈øe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are bound to follow them, but either becau≈øe there are moral rea≈øons in the things them≈øelves, or becau≈øe there is ≈øome expre≈øs, po≈øitive Command of GOD ≈øuper-added to the example. And in the≈øe ca≈øes only it is that an Obligation lies on us to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them. If the example of any Man, John the Bapti≈øt, Philip or any other, as ≈øuch, be binding, I would gladly know in what ca≈øes or In≈øtances it is ≈øo, whether in ≈øome things only done by them, or in all? I'm ready to think Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> and his Brethren will not ≈øay the la≈øt, or that its binding in all they did; inasmuch as this would be a dangerous Doctrine indeed, one inevitable Con≈øequence of is being this, viz. That they, and I, and many others, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to imitate John in his manner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, taking up our abode in the Wilderne≈øs, clothing our ≈øelves with Camels Hair, and wearing a Leathern Girdle about our Loyns, and Eating Locu≈øts and wild Honey, as he did. But this I ≈øu≈øpect <hi>they</hi> would not like very well, I am ≈øure <hi>I</hi> ≈øhould not; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Man will find it a difficult Task
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003142_0120_0FF011A95D725C50"/>to per≈øwade them they are bound by the Example of John in the≈øe points. Well, if we are not obliged by it in the≈øe In≈øtances, in what are we? You ≈øay in the In≈øtance of his Baptizing, otherwi≈øe there is no force in vour Argument, when from his Dipping in Bapti≈øm, as you ≈øuppo≈øe, you infer an Obligation on us to do ≈øo too. But pray give me a rea≈øon for this, <hi>viz.</hi> Why it ≈øhould oblige us in this ca≈øe or In≈øtance, and not in the fore-mentioned. When I was at the School <hi>A Quatenus ad Omne, valet Con≈øequentia,</hi> (which you may Engli≈øh thus if you plea≈øe, <hi>viz</hi> If the Example of any Man as ≈øuch, oblige in one in≈øtance, it does in all;) was received for a Maxim or Rule of Everla≈øting Truth; and that it is ≈øo, I firmly believe ≈øtill. And if it be ≈øo, then our Obligation from John's example, con≈øidered as ≈øuch, to dwell in the Wilderne≈øs, array our ≈øelves with Camels Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as great and ≈øtrong, as to Baptize by Dipping; for as I ≈øaid, if his Example as ≈øuch, bind us in any one ca≈øe or in≈øtance, it mu≈øt in all. But its needle≈øs for me to enlarge here, ≈øince what I now a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert is no more than what I pre≈øume Mr. <hi>Wightman,</hi> (or at lea≈øt ≈øuch of his Brethren, as pa≈øs under the Denomination of Seventh Day Bapti≈øts) will allow or grant. Their ≈øtanding practice in not ob≈øerving or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:003142_0121_0FF011AD15FE2080"/>the Fir≈øt Day of the Week, but the Seventh, gives me, I think, ju≈øt rea≈øon ≈øo to pre≈øume; ≈øince if they tho't Examples of Holy men, as ≈øuch binding, how they can hold them≈øelves excu≈øable in not Sanctifying that Day, for the Sanctification of which, the Apo≈øtles and Primitive Chri≈øtians have ≈øet us an Example, is hard for me to ≈øee. This particular at once Ca≈øhiers Four of Mr. <hi>Wightmans</hi> Arguments; and I can't but hope he will now ≈øee, that for him or any other Per≈øon to attempt to prove the Unlawfulne≈øs of Sprinkling or Wa≈øhing in Bapti≈øm, from the Example of John, Philip or any other, (≈øuppo≈øing it were evident they Dipp'd tho≈øe they Baptized) is Vain and Ab≈øurd; ≈øince whatever they did in this matter Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ≈øelf, can't infer any Obligation on us to do in the ≈øame manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppo≈øing they Dipp'd in Baptizing, yet as there are no moral rea≈øons in the Nature of the thing obliging others to do ≈øo too, ≈øo neither is there any po≈øitive Law obliging us to follow them in it, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that mode of Bapti≈øm. There are two Ca≈øes, as I Intimated above, wherein Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are binding, or Rather wherein we are bound to follow them, <hi>viz.</hi> When there are Moral Rea≈øons in the nature of the things done, and when any expre≈øs, po≈øitive Law

            <p n="1">(1) There can be no Moral Rea≈øons in that mode of Bapti≈øm obliging us to it, but on the other hand I think its manife≈øt from what I have cited above from Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> there are Moral Rea≈øons obliging us to Swerve or Deviate from it. If it be true that the Sixth and Seventh Commands of the Moral Law, are Moral, and Baptizing by Dipping be, as he ≈øays, a Breach of tho≈øe Commands, then ≈øurely there mu≈øt be Moral Rea≈øons in the Nature of the thing thus obliging us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) There is no expre≈øs po≈øitive Law Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to follow them in it; or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that mode of Bapti≈øm. If Mr. <hi>Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> or any of his Denomination know of any, I'le thank them if they'll let me do ≈øo too, and in≈øtantly come over to them, at lea≈øt, in this point. All that I know can be ≈øaid here, is, that <hi>John's</hi> Bapti≈øm was from Heaven, as our Saviour imply's in that Que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he propounded to the Chief Prie≈øts and Elders of the Jews. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25.‚ÄîAnd if ≈øo, then ≈øo was the mode of it too: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Baptized by Dipping, this will infer
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:003142_0123_0FF011B159A07490"/>a po≈øitive Law, ≈øome may think, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that mode of it. But I deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence here, and ≈øay that tho' it be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed he Dipp'd in Baptizing, his Bapti≈øm may well enough be ≈øaid to be from Heaven, and yet that mode of it not be ≈øo, ≈øince the modes of things are not of their E≈ø≈øence. I know very well Mr <hi>Wightman</hi> &amp; his Brethren ≈øay this mode, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping, is of the E≈ø≈øence of Bapti≈øm, and that Bapti≈øm in any other way is no Bapti≈øm. But be≈øides that herein they ≈øeem not to me well to di≈øtingui≈øh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Entities &amp; their Modes: Be≈øides this I ≈øay, I'm at a lo≈øs how they will prove it, any po≈øitive Law determining this mode of it I'm ≈øure there is none, nor can it I think be done from the import or meaning of the word in the Original: ≈øince (whatever it is, yet) we find it oft u≈øed there by the Spirit of God to ≈øignify Sprinkling or Wa≈øhing by pouring on or applying water to things, as well as dipping them. But enough of this, and more I think I need not add to make out this fir≈øt Particular, which is <hi>That Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing Dipping was the way in which John the Bapti≈øt, the Apo≈øtles, Philip</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did Baptize, yet this will not prove that all others are Obliged to Baptize in the ≈øame manner.</hi> The Second is,</p>
            <p n="2">[2] <hi>That tho' this he Suppo≈øed. yet it will be ≈øo far from inferring ≈øuch an Obligation lying on
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:003142_0124_0FF011B476F06C30"/>others, that not with≈øtanding it may be ≈øinful in them to Immer≈øe or Dip tho≈øe they Baptize.</hi> This will be readily allowed for a Truth by all tho≈øe that know that many ca≈øes may be ≈øuppo≈øed, wherein there may be Moral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons obliging Per≈øons to Swerve or Deviate from the Example of Holy men, in things wherein at other times and in other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances it were not only warrantable for them, but their duty to imitate or follow them. And this all tho≈øe mu≈øt know that are not ≈øo near to perfect Ideoti≈øm, as not to know that as <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> i.e. <hi>time and place</hi> are Circum≈øtances in≈øeparable from all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ≈øo that the Expediency or Inexpediency, and Con≈øequently the Lawfulne≈øs or Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs of them has a great dependance on tho≈øe Circum≈øtances.

What≈øoever is not Expedient, is ≈øo far forth Unlawful as it is Inexpedient. What I now ≈øay might be Illu≈øtrated by a Thou≈øand In≈øtances; but one ≈øhall ≈øuffice. And its that of the Corinthians, their going to Law before Unbelievers; Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> no doubt will allow that the u≈øe of the Law for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of mens ju≈øt Rights is lawful, yea
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:003142_0125_0FF011B6D2B907A0"/>many times a nece≈ø≈øary Duty; and doubtle≈øs was ≈øo in many of the Ca≈øes refer'd by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthiane to the Deci≈øion of Pagan Judges: Yet it was a ≈øin in them at that time, for which the Apo≈øtle greatly blames them, and it was ≈øo meerly on the account of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of time and place, which did render their doing ≈øo Inexpedient, Prohibit it, and Require that they ≈øhould rather have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and i≈ø≈øued their Controver≈øies among them≈øelves. Now to apply this to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping or Plunging in Bapti≈øm, as what I have now ≈øaid e≈øpecially takes place in the Po≈øitives of Religion, that have nothing moral in the Nature of them, and more e≈øpecially in the Undetermined Modes of tho≈øe Po≈øitives, ≈øo as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of them of which I'm now ≈øpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping in Bapti≈øm, if the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of time and place or either of them are ≈øometimes ≈øuch that there are Moral Rea≈øons Di≈ø≈øwading from and Prohibiting of it, 'twill then follow that tho' the Bapti≈øt and others in the Primitive Times did Dip in Baptizing, yet that will be ≈øo far from proving an Obligation on others to do ≈øo too, that notwith≈øtanding it may be very ≈øinful in them.</p>

            <p>To which I added, That the Support of Mini≈øters by a Publick Rate or Tax, was one Mode or Manner (among diver≈øe others) of Sub≈øi≈øting them, and that the Word of GOD tho' it had plac'd this among the number of Morals in Religion, yet had not Determined the Mode of it, or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it ≈øhould be done, whether by Publick Rate or Tax, or Weekly Contribution, or any other, only in General, that it ≈øhould be done in ≈øome way or other: And that if in ≈øuch a ca≈øe where Moral Duties are thus Ciroum≈øtanc'd, Lawful Authority may Rightfully Interpo≈øe and Determine the Mode of them, then the pre≈øent way of the Country in Supporting Mini≈øters mu≈øt be Lawful, becau≈øe 'twas what ≈øuch Authority had by po≈øitive Law determined.

All that they can be under≈øtood therefore to intend, when thus they ≈øay, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That what Furniture the true Mini≈øters of CHRIST have for their Work, is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the SPIRIT; that by Him they are immediately called to it; and that what they do in it is by his immediate Sugge≈øtion and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance This as I take it, is what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, &amp; this ≈øome of the≈øe ≈øilly Objectors, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially ≈øuch as are Teachers among them, pretend to: And hence as they declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> as they call it, as what is no ways nece≈ø≈øary to accompli≈øh any for the Mini≈øtry, wait not for a call from Man, ≈øo in Preaching, Renoencing all Previous Meditation or Study to prepare for it; they

But now ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing this to be the ca≈øe with all true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters of Chri≈øt, that they are thus furni≈øhed, called &amp; a≈ø≈øi≈øted, yet this comes much ≈øhort of what was Vi≈øible in the Apo≈øtles; and it mu≈øt remain a Truth even with the≈øe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors them≈øelves, that its no valid Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Plea again≈øt our Mini≈øtry, that they are not in all points ≈øuch as the Apo≈øtles were. But further, How do the≈øe Men prove that even this is the ju≈øt or true Character of the Go≈øpel Mini≈øter? and that they them≈øelves, or ≈øuch as are Teachers among them at lea≈øt, who they ≈øay, are the only true Mini≈øters of CHRIST, are thus immediately furni≈øhed for, called to, and a≈ø≈øi≈øted in their Work?

<pb n="153" facs="unknown:003142_0154_0FF011FC53D2DFF8"/>Creatures are ≈øadly deceived, and that what ever they think and would per≈øwade others to think concerning the Spirit by which they are, as they ≈øay, thus furni≈øhed, called and a≈ø≈øi≈øted, Yet that really &amp; in truth it is no other than that fallen Spirit that of old ≈øaid re≈øpecting <hi>Ahab's</hi> Prophets, <hi>I'll go forth &amp; be a Lying Spirit in their Mouths,</hi> 1 King. 22.22. For certainly were they immediately Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed, Called &amp; A≈ø≈øi≈øted, as they ≈øay, they would be enabled to give ≈øuch Proof of it as the Apo≈øtles did, or ≈øome other that might be equally ≈øatisfying; and we ≈øhould not be left to their Word only for ≈øatisfaction in that matter. Princes when they ≈øend their Emba≈ø≈øadors on any Errand, expect not that tho≈øe to whom they are ≈øent ≈øhould depend on their naked Word only for proof of their Mi≈ø≈øion, but together with their In≈øtructions, furni≈øh them with ≈øuch Credentials as may be an evidence of it: And can we think that the Mo≈øt High in this affair, which all mu≈øt allow to be of the Highe≈øt Importance, would leave us at ≈øuch uncertainty whom he ≈øends, as in that ca≈øe he mu≈øt do? Is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with his Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs? No furely, for how ≈øhould we know who to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or how to di≈øtingui≈øh ≈øuch as thus came from him, from Deceivers! Contrary to this we find all along, that when he has thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:003142_0155_0FF011FFE0D8D040"/>and ≈øent any Per≈øons on any Errand or Bu≈øine≈øs, he has at the ≈øame time furni≈øh'd them with ≈øuch things as might be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to all that they were ≈øo ≈øent. He is Blind that in Reading the Scriptures can't ≈øee this, and its needle≈øs for me to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of it on Record there. From whence I think we may, yea we mu≈øt Conclude that neither is this the true Character of a Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Mini≈øter, that he is not one immediately furni≈øhed for, called and a≈ø≈øi≈øted to and in his Work and that as for ≈øuch as ≈øay they are ≈øo and therefore true Mini≈øters of CHRIST, they do but Lie and deceive us. And further, That if we would find the men that are ≈øo, we mu≈øt look for them el≈øe-where, and not among the≈øe Vile pretenders to the things they are ≈øtrangers to. To Conclude, Tho' we find in Scripture, the appointment of a Mini≈øtry in the Church to the End of the World, yet we no where find the≈øe things mentioned as the Character of that Mini≈øtry, but on the other hand that it is a number of Men in ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, who being by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ble≈ø≈øing of GOD on proper endeavours of their own, ≈øo furni≈øhed with Light and Grace as to be capable of the Ends of the Mini≈øterial Work, are by Man regularly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ≈øet apart to it; and by the ordinary Influences of Grace A≈ø≈øi≈øted in it. And if
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:003142_0156_0FF01202D35F55D8"/>this be ≈øo, as I think its not difficult to prove, its to be hoped the generality of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters have a fair claim to be accounted of this Number, &amp; by Con≈øequence that its no ju≈øt exception again≈øt them that they ≈øtand not upon a Level with the Apo≈øtles in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars.

Its not difficult to guets what the≈øe Objectors refer to when they thus Reproach us: They, or at lea≈øt ≈øome of them, think the Sacraments of the New Te≈øtament, Rituals of Religion, which like tho≈øe of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>'s Law are now ceas'd and of no Obligation.

            <p>Nor can this ≈øeem at all incredible to any one that takes a view of the Condition of Religion in ≈øuch places of this Land, as in which this Sect (or Sects) have obtained, and have not been favoured with better helps to further that Intere≈øt in them When Mr. <hi>Wheelright,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Hutchin≈øon,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and others of their way that fir≈øt ≈øowed the Tares of Antinomiani≈øm &amp; Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øm in <hi>New-England,</hi> were for their Sedition and Bla≈øphemies Bani≈øhed the Government of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts,</hi> they (or at lea≈øt many of them) went into the Neighbouring Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Rhode-I≈øland;</hi> where they and ≈øome who in Succe≈ø≈øion have imbibed their Errors, have ever ≈øince been almo≈øt the only helps (if I may call them ≈øo) that mi≈øerable People have had to help forward among them the great intere≈øt of Religion, till of late Years: And who viewing the Condition of it among them, can think the≈øe men have been of any ≈øervice to it?

            <p>And if we look into any other Places where the≈øe men have made entrance and gained Parties to them≈øelves, what can we find that may give us rea≈øon to hope they have ≈øerved the Intere≈øt of Religion in any one Soul?
