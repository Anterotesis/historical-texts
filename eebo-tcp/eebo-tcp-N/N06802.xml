            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Demonſtration of the great Duty, and Uſefulneſs of PRAYER.</head>
            <p>WHAT is here attempted, is, a <hi>Demonſtration of the Reaſonableneſs, Uſefulneſs, and great Duty of</hi> PRAYER, as including, not only a moſt grateful Acknowledgement of all the Inſtances of GOD's Goodneſs towards us, but alſo a humble and reſigned Addreſs to him for the Supply of our Wants, under a deep Senſe of our intire Dependence upon him.</p>
            <p>IN both theſe Senſes I maintain, that Prayer is an indiſpenſible Duty, founded in the Reaſon and Nature of Things; in the Nature of GOD and of Man, and the Relation, in which, by the Neceſſity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſtand in to him. In order to be convinced of this, we need only conſider fully, What we mean by the Word <hi>Duty?</hi>—What GOD is?—And what we are?—and the Nature of that Relation we ſtand in to him. Theſe I muſt therefore define; and</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Word <hi>Duty,</hi> I mean, that Obligation we are immediately under from the inward Senſe of our own Reaſon and Conſciences, to conſider and treat, or conduct, towards every Being, Perſon, and Thing, as being what in Truth it is, in order to our true Happineſs. But that which gives it the full Force of Obligation, and ſo conſtitutes the complete Notion of <hi>Duty,</hi> is, the Conſideration of it, not only as being a Dictate of our own Reaſon and Conſciences, ariſing from our Conception of the Truth and Nature of Things; but moreover, and chiefly, as being the Will of God, our great Creator and moral Governor
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008627_0005_10316786A9B50468"/>
concerning us, relating to what he requireth us to do or forbear, in order to our true Happineſs.—Now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>God,</hi> I mean, That great and glorious Being who is infinitely intelligent and active, infinitely wiſe and powerful, Holy, Juſt, and Good, from whom we and all Things derive, and on whom we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depend for every Moment we live, and every Breath we breathe, and all we enjoy and hope for, both in Time and to all Eternity; to whom we are accountable for all that we think, ſpeak, and do; and from whoſe Goodneſs and Juſtice, we have all Reaſon to expect we ſhall be rewarded, or puniſhed, according as our Behaviour is good or bad, vertuous or vicious. Whether every one that pretends to think in earneſt, hath this Notion of GOD, I know not; but to me it evidently appears, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Nature and Providence, that this is the Notion we ought to have of him. And I would wiſh any one that heſitates, exactly to read and conſider Dr. CLARK<hi>'s Demonſtration of the Exiſtence and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of GOD;</hi> and Mr. WALLASTON<hi>'s Religion of Nature;</hi> not to mention the Archbiſhop of CAMBRAY, and many others. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. By <hi>Man,</hi> I mean, what every one that duly conſiders, and truly knows himſelf, muſt be intuitively ſenſible he really is; a meer dependent Being, that came into Being, and ſubſiſts by the meer Will and Power of GOD, having no Sufficiency in himſelf to continue himſelf in Being, Life, or Health, ſo much as one Moment, nor ſo much as to think any Thing of himſelf, but all his Sufficiency is of GOD, both with regard to his Being, and Well-being. He is indeed furniſhed with intelligent and free, active, ſelf exerting Powers; but at the ſame Time, (as he is in Fact now) he is a very frail and ſickly, a very weak and mortal Creature, and which is worſe, he is a very ſinful and untoward Creature, and is daily
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008627_0006_1031678A89C27190"/>
violating the inward Senſe of his own Reaſon and Conſcience, and acting contrary to the moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and conſequently the Will of his Maker, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and Governor.—And yet, from the divine Attributes, compared with his preſent State, and the Powers and Faculties he is endowed with, from whence the true End of his Being muſt be judged of, there ſeems all imaginable Reaſon to conclude, that this Life is not his All, but that he is now only in a State of Probation for another State after this Life; that, as to his better Part, he is really an immortal Being, and accountable for his Behaviour here.—Now therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. THE Relation we ſtand in to God, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that of Creatures to their Creator; that of mere Dependents to their Benefactor; that of Subjects to their King and Governor; and moreover, that of Sinners and Criminals with regard to their Judge; and unable, without his Inſtruction and Aſſiſtance, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify themſelves for, or to regain, his Favour.—If then it be our Duty, conſidering ourſelves as being what we are, to conduct ourſelves towards God as being what he is, it demonſtratively follows,</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. THAT it muſt be our Duty, not only as Creatures, Children, Dependents, and Subjects, to give all poſſible Expreſſion and Proof of our Love, Gratitude, and Obedience to God, as our Creator and Father, and our great Benefactor and Supreme King and Governor; but moreover, as we are frail Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and liable to innumerable Caſualties and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and depend on him every Moment for our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Well-being, it muſt be evidently fit, right, and our bounden Duty, every Day to implore his Protection and Bleſſing, and humbly addreſs our ſelves to him for the Supply of our Wants.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, as we are Sinners, and have in fact, in innumerable Inſtances, violated our Duty to him as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008627_0007_1031678C11A53E10"/>
our King and our Judge, to whom we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for our Behaviour; and at the ſame Time, if we do at all know our ſelves, we muſt be conſcious, not only of our Guilt, but alſo of our great Weakneſs, and of the little Command we have of our Appetites and Paſſions, eſpecially (as the Caſe generally is) if we have contracted any vicious Habits, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to conquer; I ſay, the Fact being thus, it muſt be no leſs evidently fit, right, and our bounden Duty, moſt humbly to confeſs and bewail our Sins, and beg God's Pardon for whatſoever we have done amiſs, and to implore his Help and Aſſiſtance to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to conduct better for the future, and to bear with Patience whatſoever he calls us to ſuffer in the Courſe of his Providence, and to do with Chearfulneſs and Fidelity what he requires of us, in order to anſwer the End of our Being, which is our true Perfection and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears to me, that this Duty of Prayer, is demonſtratively eſtabliſhed from the Reaſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things; and this Reaſoning is confirmed to be Right from Fact and Experience correſpondent to it, it being always found, that, by ſuch a conſtant Courſe of Prayer, joined with Vigilance, and a due Care of their Conduct, good Men have been enabled to gain and maintain a good Maſtery of their vicious Tempers and Habits, and to make Proficiency in every Virtue, agreeable to an ancient Maxim or Obſervation, "That as perſiſting in a Courſe of ſinning will make a Man leave praying, ſo a ſtedfaſt Perſeverance in a Courſe of Prayer, will eventually make a Man leave ſinning, and return to his Duty."</p>
            <p>Now againſt all this, it hath been objected by ſome, who I doubt do not rightly know God, or themſelves, "That it reflects hard on the Wiſdom, Benevolence, and Juſtice of God, to ſuppoſe, that he hath not given Mankind ſufficient Capacities to diſtinguiſh Right from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008627_0008_1031678E8523A4B0"/>
Wrong, Virtue from Vice, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and ſufficient Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to anſwer the End of their Being: And if he hath done this, Prayer muſt be a uſeleſs Ceremony." This is illuſtrated, by comparing Man to a Machine, which if it is not ſo made as to anſwer it's End without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Interpoſition, it muſt give but a poor Notion of the Wiſdom or Power of its Author, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer:—If Man were indeed but a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, this Reaſoning would be right enough, even him ſuppoſing a conſcious Machine. But it can be nothing to the Purpoſe if he be, as in fact he is, not only an intelligent, but alſo a free, active, ſelf-exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creature, and therefore of a Nature to be led to anſwer the End of his Being, not by Mechaniſm, but in the Way of moral Government, being deſigned to be influenced by Conſiderations and Motives ſuggeſted to his Underſtanding, under the Senſe of which he is freely to exert his own Activity, in order to anſwer the End of his Being.</p>
            <p>In this Caſe, he may be (as in fact, I allow he is) endowed with ſufficient Powers, Faculties, and Means to anſwer the End of his Being, ſo that it ſhall be his own Fault if he does not; and yet, as he is a free Agent, it muſt be in his Power to abuſe his Liberty, and other Faculties, ſo as to fall ſhort of it, without the Divine Interpoſition. But this, from the Nature of moral Government, he may always be ſecure of, if he will in earneſt apply himſelf to God by Prayer, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently make uſe of the Means which he hath put within his Power, and pointed out to him.</p>
            <p>But for the full clearing up of this Objection, and the further Demonſtration of the Duty of Prayer, I will next proceed, and go upon the Principle the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector allows, <hi>viz.</hi> "That the Duty of any Creature muſt be determined, (or judged of) by the End for which it was created."—Let us then conſider, what muſt be ſuppoſed to be the End for which Man was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008627_0009_1031679112A96F70"/>
created? And as to this, no doubt but it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the End for which it muſt be ſuppoſed an infinitely wiſe and good God brought Man into Being, was, that he might do Honour to his Maker, and enjoy himſelf, and be, in ſome good Degree, happy in the Participation and Enjoyment of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And he that willed this End, muſt have willed the Means neceſſary to it. Conſequently it is allowed, that Man is furniſhed with ſufficient Powers, Abilities, and Means for his true Happineſs. He is an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Creature, and conſequently capable of knowing wherein his true Happineſs conſiſts, and the Means of attaining it. And he is a free, active, ſelf-exerting Creature, and therefore is capable of an active Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf to the Purſuit of his Happineſs, in the Uſe of the Means conducive to it. But then, he is of himſelf an ignorant Creature, and therefore needs to be inſtructed both in the End and Means; and he is a weak dependent Being, and therefore needs to be aſſiſted, as well as inſtructed; for both which he muſt neceſſarily depend upon God.</p>
            <p>And indeed I am apt to think, that if the Nature of a Creature, as ſuch, be duly conſidered, it will be found that no Creature is, or ever was, or can be made ſelf-ſufficient to its own Happineſs; nor is it fit it ſhould, if it were poſſible. On the Contrary, as every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in it ſelf, a meer dependent Being, it is moſt fit that every conſcious, intelligent Creature, ſhould ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually live under a deep Senſe of it's Dependence, as a neceſſary Means to it's true Happineſs, and account it its greateſt Glory, it's true Perfection, and higheſt Satisfaction, to hold a perpetual Intercourſe with the great Parent Mind, the eternal Father of Spirits, in and by whom it lives and moves, and hath it's Being; and in doing this, to make it it's own intelligent free Act, and Deed to exert and expreſs it's Senſe of it's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and its earneſt Aſpirations alter, and Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008627_0010_10316793C5328548"/>
towards an intire free active Union of it's Will with the Will of it's great and Almighty Parent, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the moral Perfections of his Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it's higheſt Perfection and Happineſs conſiſts. And this, in Effect, is all that is implied in Prayer, which therefore muſt in the Nature of the Thing, be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Means towards anſwering the End of our Being. Now therefore let us lay theſe Propoſitions together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The End of our Being is our true and endleſs Happineſs. I ſay <hi>endleſs,</hi> becauſe it is plain we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truly Happy, without having a Proſpect of being endleſsly ſo; and it is no leſs plain that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain to the intire End of our Being, ſo as to be truly Happy, in this very mixed imperfect State; our Exiſtence therefore muſt reach forward and extend to an endleſs State of further Proficiency after this Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is impoſſible we ſhould be Happy; nay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the Nature of the Thing, but that we muſt be miſerable under the Power and Guilt of Sin, or in a Courſe of Deviation from moral Rectitude, both from the miſcheivous Nature of Sin in it ſelf, and from the inward Reproaches of our own Reaſon and Conſciences, as well as the Diſpleaſure of our Maker. On the Contrary,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our true Happineſs, as free, intelligent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Beings, or moral Agents, muſt conſiſt in the vaſt Satiſfaction ariſing from the Conſciouſneſs of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and faithful Practice of, and Proficiency in, all moral Virtues, and a Senſe of the Divine Favour and Approbation, which will not fail to attend it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Practice and Proficiency in all moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, implies, our Conformity to the moral Perfections of God, the Author of our Being, and on whom we depend; at leaſt, our conſtant Care and Endeavour, as far as we are able, to be <hi>Holy as He is Holy, Pure as He is Pure, Righteous as He is Righteous,</hi> true and faithful, kind and merciful, as He is: All which are,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008627_0011_1031679698B45358"/>
in the Nature of them, conducive and neceſſary to our Happineſs, and therefore muſt be his Will and Law concerning us, becauſe he would have us happy. Now,</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, and laſtly, The natural and neceſſary Means, in the Nature of Things, towards theſe Attainments, is to have Recourſe to GOD, and converſe frequently with that great Pattern of all moral Perfection; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our many and great Deficiencies, in falling ſhort of theſe Things, and our great Untowardneſs in acting ſo much the Reverſe of them, ſo contrary to his bleſſed Will; imploring his Pardon and Mercy for our paſt Miſcarriages, and expreſſing our earneſt Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations after Amendment, and better Proficiency for the future; and finally, from a due Senſe of the great Weakneſs of our Reaſon and Reſolution, and the Strength of our Appetites and Paſſions, and ill Habits, and the many Temptations that ſurround us, earneſtly ſoliciting the ſecret Influences and Aſſiſtances of that great Parent Spirit on whom we depend, to enable us to gain and maintain the Maſtery of our ſelves, and to make all poſſible Proficiency in all thoſe Virtues and moral Attainments, wherein our true Perfection and Happineſs conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe are the proper Exerciſes of Prayer! and ſure I am, He cannot ſee either deep or far into the preſent Condition of human Nature, who is not fully ſenſible that ſuch a Practice is evidently, in the Nature of Things, conducive and neceſſary to all moral Proficiency; and conſequently, that it is ſo far from being "a uſeleſs Ceremony," that it is of the greateſt Uſe, and therefore an indiſpenſible Duty, as being a neceſſary Means towards anſwering the End of our Being.</p>
            <p>If, indeed, our Objector is fully ſure and conſcious to himſelf, that he never has, nor ever does, in the leaſt vary, in Thought, Word, or Deed, from the great Rules of Virtue, and moral Rectitude, it will
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008627_0012_103167982738D138"/>
be allowed that he has no Occaſion to aſk GOD's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and if he perfectly knows that he has always in himſelf that Strength and Preſence of Mind, as to have and maintain an intire Maſtery of his Luſts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that he can ſteadily withſtand all Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that by dint of his own Strength, he always actually does his whole Duty, all that is Right and Good, both towards GOD and Man, I own he has no Occaſion to aſk GOD's Help, but has infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be thankful, and this is all he has to do.—But I very much queſtion, whether he can or will venture to ſay all this: Nay I queſtion, whether this laſt was ever the Caſe of any Creature, no not even of the higheſt Angel in Heaven, without a divine Influence, much leſs of ſuch a frail Creature as Man evidently is.—</p>
            <p>For my own Part, I muſt be free to confeſs, that it is far from being the Caſe with me, and I believe there are very few conſiderate Perſons but ſuch as will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily join with me. I am conſcious that I am ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and deficient, and ſo weak and infirm, that I need to aſk God's Pardon and Mercy, and his Help and Aſſiſtance every Day that I live; and this I find to be the only Courſe I can take, in Conjunction with due Care and Vigilence, to get the better of my Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and to make any tolerable Proficiency in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And it is to me the greateſt Satisfaction in the World, to hold ſuch a frequent Intercourſe with the great Father of my Spirit, and thereby to impreſs my Mind with a due Senſe of his perpetual Preſence with me, and Inſpection over me, and in View thereof, to commit myſelf to his Protection, Guidance and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in all my Ways.</p>
            <p>This Senſe of God's univerſal Preſence and All-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye, which is vaſtly improved and cultivated by the daily Exerciſe of Prayer, is of the utmoſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to make us watchful and circumſpect in all our Behaviour before him, nay, in the Tempers of our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008627_0013_1031679C72CA9428"/>
Hearts, as well as the Conduct of our Lives; and the more ſo, as it hath moreover the greateſt Tendencey to make and keep us humble, for, Humility is the Baſis of all other Virtues, as on the other Hand, Pride, Self-Conceit, and Self-ſufficiency, are Tempers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely miſbecoming a meer dependent, weak, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Being, and utter Enemies to all Proficiency in Knowledge, or Virtue. It is therefore very fit that our Creator ſhould keep us in a perpetual State of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that we ſhould, by the frequent Practice of Prayer, keep up and cultivate in our Minds, a moſt humble Senſe of our Weakneſs, Dependence and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſs, as a neceſſary Means in order to our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment and Proficiency in Virtue and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Since therefore it is thus manifeſt, that Prayer is in the Nature of the Thing, ſuch an effectual Means to promote our Proficiency in all moral Virtue, in order to our true Happineſs, which is the End of our Being, it is evident, That inaſmuch as God wills this End, he muſt moſt certainly alſo will this Means, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it muſt be his Will and Law concerning us, that we ſhould live in the daily Performance of this Duty. It muſt therefore be a direct Rebellion againſt him, and the Conſtitution which he hath made, to live in the Neglect of it.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are placed in Society, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sins to confeſs and reform, and common Wants, both Temporal and Spiritual, that we muſt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, the common Father and Lord of all, for the Supply of, and inaſmuch as every thing that Concerns our common Weal, is beſt promoted by ſocial Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, it is evident that a common ſocial and public Worſhip, in Prayer as well as Praiſe, muſt be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Duty, as well as Perſonal: Eſpecially, if we moreover conſider, that ſuch a common ſocial Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in jointly paying our common Duty, to our common heavenly Father, Lord, and Governor, is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008627_0014_1031679F140A18B0"/>
moſt amiable in itſelf, and hath, in the Nature of the Thing, a direct Tendency to promote univerſal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, Brotherly Love, the Love of public Weal, and all ſocial Virtues towards one another, as well as Piety towards God. So that, in order to any one's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true Patriot or Friend to the public Weal of Mankind, and his Country, it is indiſpenſibly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould ſet a good Example of a frequent and religious Attendance on the public Worſhip: Nay he muſt be an Enemy to Mankind if he does not.—And it is a Thing of moſt melancholly Conſideration in this degenerate Age, that ſince Prayer, both perſonal and ſocial, hath been ſo much decryed and deſpiſed, and the public Worſhip, as well as private, ſo much neglected, and eſpecially by many great Examples in our Nation, there hath been a vaſt Increaſe of all Sorts of Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, and ſuch a Deluge of Vice prevailing, as threatens the utter Ruin both of our Nation and its Colonies.</p>
            <p>But to proceed. It is further objected againſt this great Duty of Prayer, That, in the Nature of the Thing, Prayer can attain no End, and therefore muſt be impertinent, becauſe there is a certain eſtabliſhed Courſe of Providence, which cannot be altered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Miracle, which we have no right to expect or deſire.—To this I anſwer,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Miracle implies a very ſenſible and manifeſt Variation from the known eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature, whereas, he that hath ſtudied Nature, can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a thouſand Caſes wherein God may ſecretly interpoſe to prevent, or bring about various Events in the Courſe of Providence, without any ſenſible Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the general known eſtabliſhed Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as, in varying the Courſe of Winds and Weather, preventing or healing Sickneſſes, and the like.— Nor can it reaſonably be denied, or doubted, but God can ſecretly influence the Thoughts, Purpoſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008627_0015_103167A0A4EB2430"/>
of Men, in a Manner, (in the Time of it) inſenſible to themſelves, and without at all interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Freedom, which may be attended with Events, either on the one Hand very fatal, <note n="*" place="bottom">Quos Jupiter vult perdere prius dementat. <hi>Dict. ap. Ethu.</hi>
               </note> or greatly beneficial to them on the other, that would not otherwiſe have occurred, and which in many Caſes, may have great and laſting influence, even on the public Affairs of Mankind, as well as thoſe of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons.<note n="†" place="bottom">The Heart of Kings is in the Hand of the Lord, as the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Water, he turneth it whetherſoever he will. <hi>Sol. pr.</hi> 21.1.</note>— And I believe there are not many that have duly obſerved the State of their own Minds, and the Courſe of Providence in the various Events that have occurred to them, but who (without the leaſt Tincture of Enthuſiaſm) will find Reaſon to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that they have, in ſeveral, and ſomtimes very remarkable Inſtances, been under ſuch an Influence and Conduct, and many Events have occurred, of which no other Account could be given.—This being ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will follow, that it is a moſt reaſonable Duty, not only to thank God for his kind and watchful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over us, but alſo to pray to him for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Protection, Guidance and Bleſſing. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would further obſerve, that as this Objection proceeds upon the Suppoſition of only a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or a Kind of Fate, and implies in it the Denial of any particular providential free Interpoſition, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of either particular Nations or Individuals, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays a very low, and moſt unworthy Conception of the infinite Being; for it imports as tho' he either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or will not, <hi>ſo</hi> conduct the general Courſe of his Providence, as at the ſame Time to attend to, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, and influence the Affairs of particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Communities of Men (as is fit upon ſome ſpecial Emergencies, either for Correction, or Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution) and even of every individual Perſon, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008627_0016_103167A23870C2D0"/>
to their ſeveral bad or good moral Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whereas it is certain, that his infinite Wiſdom and Power muſt enable him, and his infinite Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Juſtice muſt, in all Reaſon, be conceived to diſpoſe him at once, equally to give Attention to what concerns the whole of Things, and at the ſame Time to what relates to the Caſe of every Individual.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, ſuppoſing Prayer ſhould not procure any Alteration in the Courſe of Providence, (as for wiſe and good Reaſons, in many Inſtances the Caſe may be) it doth not follow but that ſeveral excellent Ends may be accompliſhed by it, particularly, as it cultivates and improves in our Minds a great Senſe of God and our Dependence upon him, and diſciplines us to the Exerciſe of an implicit Faith in him, and a humble Reſignation to his all diſpoſing Will, and a greater Concern to pleaſe him in all our moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that we may be the better qualified for future Favours. But for further Satisfaction on this Head, I would wiſh the Objector to read and conſider well what Mr. <hi>Wollaſton</hi> anſwers to this Objection.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it is objected, "That Prayer implies a low and unworthy Notion of the Deity, either as not knowing or not willing what is beſt for us of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Whereas it is impoſſible but that God muſt know what we Want infinitely better than we do our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and muſt be diſpoſed to do what is fit and beſt for us, without any Information or Importunity of ours."</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer.— It is very true, God knows what we want, and is diſpoſed to do what is beſt for us; but as we are reaſonable, free, ſelf-exerting Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and our true Perfection and Happineſs is, in the Nature of it, to be accompliſhed by our own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, under the Influence of the divine Aid, in the Uſe of proper Means, it is not fit that he ſhould proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute his Favours upon us, without our own Activity
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008627_0017_103167A3C692BD40"/>
in endeavouring to qualify ourſelves for them. Since then, Prayer, as I have ſhewn, hath a direct and natural Tendency to promote and improve in us all thoſe moral Qualifications that render it fit he ſhould beſtow his Favours upon us, it is therefore fit in itſelf, and muſt accordingly be his Will, that we ſhould uſe this Exerciſe as a Means for our Proficiency, and as a Condition of his Beſtowments; Juſt as it is fit that a kind Parent who knows what is beſt for his Child, and is ſufficiently diſpoſed to beſtow it, ſhould yet require him in a dutiful Manner to aſk it as a Favour, as being a proper Means to cultivate and improve in him all thoſe dutiful and filial Tempers, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and obedient Behaviour which, as it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to his own Happineſs, does at the ſame Time qualify him to receive his Parent's Favours.</p>
            <p>It is therefore an utterly wrong Notion of Prayer, to imagine that the Intent of it is to inform God of what he is ignorant of, or incline him to do what is beſt for us, as tho' he were not otherwiſe ſo diſpoſed. No: The Intent of it is, to keep up in our Minds a lively and habitual Sence of our Dependence, and to qualify us to receive the Bleſſings we pray for, by cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating and improving in our Souls, all thoſe dutiful Tempers and Diſpoſitions of Faith, Hope, Truſt in Him, and Submiſſion to Him, and a Concern above all Things, to conform ourſelves to his Will, and the moral Perfections of his Nature, wherein our real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Happineſs conſiſts; and which are, in the Nature of the Things themſelves, Qualifications ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to fit us to receive the Favours we aſk for, and without which we ſhould never anſwer the End of our Being.</p>
            <p>Thus I think I have anſwered, or obviated every Objection that hath been offered againſt the Duty of Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arguing only from the Reaſon and Nature of Things, to which I was confined by the Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008627_0018_103167A65C60C540"/>
of the Objector, who, by one Expreſſion he has, ſeems to think we have no other Way of coming to the Knowledge of our Duty but by Reaſoning.— But, alas! What a very little would Mankind ever have known about the Reaſon and Nature of Things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Divine Things, without Divine Inſtruction?— When indeed, we are inſtructed in the firſt Rudiments of the Knowledge of God and ourſelves, and our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Duty to Him and one another, the Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that obtain in the Nature of Things between thoſe Truths and Duties, will, to a thinking Perſon, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively obvious; as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>Wiſdom is eaſy to him that underſtandeth,</hi> i. e. having learned it by teaching.—And this, I apprehend, is the Reaſon that we have now ſo many fine Demonſtrations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Morality, which have ſo blown us up with a Conceit of the Sufficiency of our own Reaſon, that we are apt to imagine we could have diſcovered all theſe Truths and Duties of ourſelves without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teaching; whereas the Truth is, without having firſt had the <hi>Data</hi> in Scripture given us, we ſhould ſcarce ever have had a Thought of them, much leſs been able to demonſtrate them by the Dint of our weak Reaſon.</p>
            <p>What a miſerable Hand, Mankind would have made of Reaſoning from the Nature of Things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divine Teaching or Revelation, is abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from Fact, to whoever looks into the real State of thoſe Millions of People, where the Ancient Original Inſtructions have in a great Meaſure, been gradually loſt, and for Want of which they are, in Fact, ſunk into ſuch an abject Condition of Ignorance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, as is hardly to be conceived by us, who have had the ineſtimable Advantage of Divine Teaching.— It is true, there were ſome extraordinary Men in the Heathen World, that did attain to the Knowledge of many ſublime Truths and Duties: But from Facts
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008627_0019_103167ABECCDE110"/>
which there is no diſputing, there is the greateſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude that they would ſcarce ever have thought of them, if it had not been for ſome Remains of the Original divine Inſtructions handed down to them from the Beginning, by Tradition. For it is to Tradition that they frequently aſcribe their beſt Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they picked up in their Travels, far and wide among the Wiſeſt and moſt Ancient Nations the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Phenicins,</hi> whoſe Notions were ſtill ſo much the better by how much the older, and the nearer they approached to the Fountain Head, and by how much the nearer Connections they had with that Nation, among whom thoſe Original divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were handed down by Writing, together with the ancient ſacred Heiroglyphics. See <hi>Shuckford</hi>'s Connection, and <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s Works.</p>
            <p>We have in particular ſome fine Paſſages in <hi>Plato, Tully, Seneca,</hi> and others, relating to the Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, our Dependence on the divine Aids, and the Duty of Prayer. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Menone</hi> ſays,
<q>Virtue does not derive from Nature, nor Teaching, but from a divine Influence.</q>—<hi>Tully</hi> in <hi>Nat. Deor.</hi> ſays, <q>We muſt believe that no Good Man was ever ſuch, but by the Aſſiſtance of God, and that no one was ever a great Man without a divine Inſpiration or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.— And <hi>Seneca,</hi> Ep. 41. ſays, No one is a good Man without God, and that there is no good Mind or Diſpoſition without him. Ep. 71.</q>—And <q>accordingly he directs with regard to Prayer, Ep. 10. That we ſhould firſt beg of God a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and good Health of the Soul, and then that of the Body.</q>— <hi>Plato</hi> wrote an excellent Dialogue, his 2d <hi>Alcihiades,</hi> meerly upon the Subject of Prayer, wherein he introduces <hi>Socrates</hi> (who was the Oracle of Wiſdom in thoſe Days) as highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Prayer of an ancient Poet, <q>That God would give us thoſe Things that are really good for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008627_0020_103167AD820355C8"/>
us, whether we aſk them or not; and that he would by no means grant us thoſe Things that are bad for us, however ſo earneſtly we ſhould deſire them.</q>— In ſhort it doth not appear that any of the wiſeſt and greateſt Men, even in the Heathen World (none but a few Atheiſts) ever doubted but that Prayer is an indiſpenſible Duty: All their Difficulty was to know what they ought to pray for, and how they ſhould pray acceptably. Here indeed <hi>Socrates</hi> laments the Darkneſs they were under, and judges it a Thing of ſo much Importance, that he is perſwaded God will ſend ſome great Perſon to inſtruct Mankind how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Duty.</p>
            <p>Now I would aſk our Objector; Did theſe great Men diſcover theſe Things by their own reaſoning and the meer Light of Nature?— If ſo, it is plain that Prayer muſt be a Duty not only evidently founded in Nature, but diſcoverable by meer Reaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be a moſt reaſonable Duty, ſo that it muſt be flying in the Face of Reaſon to doubt of it, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect it.—On the other Hand, if, (as I rather think) they had theſe Things by Tradition derived down ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from divine Inſtruction, (tho' when taught they appeared intirely agreeable to Reaſon) this proves that ſuch an original divine Inſtruction and Injunction there was; and if ſo, it muſt be a direct Rebellion againſt Heaven, as well as Reaſon, to heſitate about it, and not live in the due Performance of it.</p>
            <p>Whatever therefore ſome Men may think, it yet remains a moſt certain Truth, that God hath from the Beginning, and thro' all Ages ſince, at ſundry Times and in divers Manners, inſtructed Mankind in theſe Affairs, and expreſsly declared his Will and our Duty relating to them. It is indeed a Thing of moſt melancholly Conſideration, that this ſhould become a Matter of doubt, as it is, with many in this degenerate Age, which, as it has ſadly forſaken God, ſeems to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008627_0021_103167AF0B0526D8"/>
be abandoned by him!— Nay, ſome have peremptorily concluded againſt it, while others moſt ungratefully make a meer Joke of it, and treat it with the utmoſt Contempt.—However, I can't but earneſtly wiſh that Gentlemen would once again ſeriouſly return to the Conſideration of this Matter, and be perſwaded to think it, at leaſt poſſible, that they may be miſled:— That it is a moſt fatal Thing for them, if they be:— And that it is, therefore, infinitely worth the While for them, again to enquire with Candor, and without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or Partiality, into this important Affair.— Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly I would wiſh them to read and conſider with the utmoſt Exactneſs, ſome Things that have been written of late Years, and particularly Biſhop <hi>Butler</hi>'s Analogy, Biſhop <hi>Berkeley</hi>'s Minute Philoſopher, and Preſident <hi>Forbes</hi>'s Works, Doctor <hi>Ellis</hi> of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divine Things, and a late Peice called <hi>Deiſm revealed,</hi> and <hi>Clayton,</hi> &amp;c. againſt <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> not to mention <hi>Weſt, Leland,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Leland</hi> has lately, by the Piety and Charity of the good young <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> been ſent in great Numbers into <hi>America,</hi> to prevent our Apoſtacy.</note> 
               <hi>Browne,</hi> and ſeveral others, all which have written long ſince it ſeems by many to have been, inconſiderately taken for granted, that all Pretences to reveal'd Religion are meer Impoſtures.</p>
            <p>And before I take my Leave of this Subject, I will venture to offer a ſhort Sketch of Argumentation <hi>a priori,</hi> from the Divine Attributes, and the Nature of Things, to prove, that there muſt have been, and conſequently that in Fact there moſt certainly was, from the Beginning, a Divine Revelation or Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to Mankind. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I preſume I may take it for granted, That Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were at firſt brought into Being by an infinitely Wiſe and Good God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt therefore have been made for a wiſe and good End.— Now, as I have obſerved above,</p>
            <p n="3">3. This End muſt have been, that they might be Happy, or in ſome good Degree enjoy themſelves. And,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:008627_0022_103167B1E8B52C50"/>4. It is a maxim of eternal Truth, That he that wills an End, if he be Wiſe and Good, muſt, of Courſe, will the Means neceſſary for the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that End. Now,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Look into the Nature of Man, and conſider what muſt be the neceſſary Means of his Well-being, and you will find, he muſt as a ſocial Creature have ſome Language, and as an Animal he muſt know what is proper Food and other Means for his Subſiſtance, and conſequently know ſomething of the Nature of the Things about him.—Nor can he be Happy without knowing from thence ſomething of the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his Maker, and Benefactor, his Preſerver, and Governor, who muſt be his Chief Good, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, how to conduct himſelf ſo as to be ſecure of his Favour in Conformity to all thoſe moral Laws, which, both with regard to his Maker, himſelf, and his Species, are in the Nature of Things, neceſſary to his Happineſs: Nor muſt he be ignorant of their Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Happineſs that will attend his Obedience to them, and the Miſery that muſt reſult from his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.— But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. However ſo neceſſary theſe Things and the Knowledge of them are, as Means to Man's Well-being and Happineſs, and however ſo perfect you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Powers and Faculties to have been, it is plain that when he firſt came into Being he muſt have been totally ignorant of them.— Now</p>
            <p n="7">7. It cannot, I think, be doubted, but that it was poſſible for God Almighty, either by himſelf or ſome other Agent, to appear to the firſt of our Species, and converſe with them, and inſtruct them in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all theſe Things, ſo neceſſary to their Well-being.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If therefore our Maker infinitely wiſe and good, deſigned our Well-being and Happineſs as his End, it is Demonſtration that he muſt have immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008627_0023_103167B6F21551D0"/>
or ſome how inſtructed the firſt of our Species, in the Knowledge of all theſe neceſſary Means in order thereunto, and put them within the reach of their Power, and it muſt have been his Will that they ſhould make uſe of them for that End.—</p>
            <p>Can it then be imagined, That the infinitely wiſe and good Father of Mankind, would bring them into Being and then deſert them?—Would he leave them to grope out the Means of their Well-being themſelves, in purſuit of which they could not fail, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, of making 10,000 fatal Blunders?—At beſt, if they could have at all ſubſiſted, it muſt have been ſeveral Ages before they could have beat out any thing of a tolerable Scheme of Life.—It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be, but they muſt have been immediately inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put into a State of moral Government, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tenor of which they ſhould be happy or miſerable, according as they ſhould behave themſelves well or ill:— Be obedient or diſobedient to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Injunctions, under the Sanctions of Life or Death.</p>
            <p>And when they had been ſurprized by a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into an Act of Diſobedience, and ſo forfeited that Immortality and Happineſs they were deſigned for, and brought themſelves into a State of Mortality, Sin and Miſery, ſuch as we do in Fact find ourſelves in, is there not in this Caſe, all imaginable Reaſons from the Conſideration of the ſame Divine Attributes, his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to conclude, that he would ſtill conſider them with Compaſſion as his own Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, tho' in a State of Rebellion, and at the ſame Time that he paſſed upon them the Sentence of his Juſtice, open a Way for Mercy to take Place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it, and diſcover to them the Method and Means for their Recovery and Reſtoration to that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and Happineſs which they had loſt by Sin?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:008627_0024_103167B986063C80"/>In order to this, which was the original End of theſe Being, this new State into which they were reduced by Sin, muſt, in the Nature of it, neceſſarily require new Truths to be diſcovered, which they could no otherwiſe come to the Knowledge of, and thence new Means to be preſcribed, and new Duties enjoined.— And as God muſt be infinitely the beſt Judge what is beſt for us, what could be more fit than that we ſhould wholly refer ourſelves to him? And what better, or other Method could be deviſed, than that he ſhould treat with as Sinners by a Mediator, and that we ſhould be required by Faith to look for Pardon, Mercy, and Acceptance, thro' the Merits and Interceſſion of that all-ſufficient Mediator, upon Condition of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance, and return to our Duty; and to depend on the Aids of the Divine Spirit, to enable us to repent and reform, and to return to ſuch a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and preſerving Obedience as our preſent frail Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will admit of, and ſuch as is, in the Nature of it, neceſſary to qualify us for his Favour? And in ſuch a State of the Caſe, can it be, but that a conſtant Courſe of Prayer, for Pardon and Aſſiſtance, and Watchfulneſs againſt all Temptations, muſt be preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the moſt appoſite Means for gaining the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Sin, and a Habit of new Obedience, in order to that bleſſed End?</p>
            <p>All theſe Things do thus evidently appear <hi>a priori</hi>
to be moſt fit and reaſonable in themſelves, from the Conſideration of the Divine Attributes, and the Nature of Things: But then they alſo appear, <hi>a Poſteriori,</hi>
to have been Fact, from the Account which the Holy Scriptures gives us of the Origin of Mankind, and the ſubſequent Conduct of God towards them.— In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the firſt Account of theſe Things is very ſhort, and not ſo particular as I have repreſented them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our preſent Tranſlation, tho' they appear much more ſo, to one that underſtands the Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008627_0025_103167BC2F382E38"/>
Nature of the moſt ancient original Language and Inſtitutions, and Manner of Inſtruction, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets them as he ought, by the ſubſequent Facts cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to them, both ſacred and profane; the due Conſideration of all which, cannot fail of giving us the higheſt moral Certainty, that the Nature of the Things (ſuppoſing them) are capable of: But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they were then much more particularly explained than is accounted for, in the very ſhort Hiſtory we have of them.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole; I can't but think that whoever ſhall meekly and candidly conſider the whole of Things; the real Condition of Mankind, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic Excellency of the Things themſelves, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taught in the Holy Scriptures; their real Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all our Needs, and to all the Purpoſes of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Happineſs, which are the End of our Being; and at the ſame Time, the whole Series of Revelation from the Beginning, thro' all the ancient Ages, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a Series of Miracles and Propheſies, and the exact Correſpondence of Facts and Events, muſt be convinced, that there hath been one Uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Scheme of Religion and Providence worthy of God, and fitted to the preſent Condition of Mankind, carrying on from the Beginning of the World to this Day, and to continue to the Conſummation of all Things, when <hi>Mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of Life,</hi> in complete, unmixed, and endleſs Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing the Holy Scriptures to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration of the Will of God and our Duty, it would be endleſs to take notice of all the Paſſages wherein this Duty of Prayer is therein enjoined, and ſpoken of as practiſed by all good Men, and the many <hi>great and precious Promiſes</hi> which are made to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and faithful Performance of it.— I ſhall only take notice of that Paſſage of the Prophet, where God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Readineſs and Purpoſe, to do what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008627_0026_103167BE874F3B28"/>
for the Weal of his People, <hi>I have ſpoke it, and will do it,</hi> ſays he. But adds, <hi>I will yet for this be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of,</hi> (or ſought to) <hi>by the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to do it for them,</hi> (Ezek. 36.37.) Which plainly intimates that which was always the great Maxim of the Divine Conduct towards the Children of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> That however ready he is to do us good, yet it is his Will that we ſhould exert ourſelves, and pray to him to co-operate with us, and to grant us what we want, as the Condition of his Beſtowments. Not that he wants our Homage for his own Sake, but for our Sakes, he requires it, becauſe he knows it is highly beneficial to us, and the beſt Means we can uſe, to render our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves qualified for his Favours.—And this you have ſeen was accordingly the Practice of all the great, wiſe, and good Men of all Ages, not only of the Patriarchs, Jews and Chriſtians, but even of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves.</p>
            <p>Ought we not then ſeverely to ſuſpect ourſelves, when we are tempted to go into Concluſions ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whether we are not under ſome great Deluſion, and be very jealous, whether it may not be occaſioned by too much Affectation of Singularity, or too much Self-ſufficiency, or Senſuality, or ſome other wrong Temper, which may have ſtrangely warped and biaſſed our Minds?— Let us rather with all the Wiſe and Good, be content, and rejoice to be directed by God, who knows what are the beſt Means to our beſt Good, infinitely better than <hi>we</hi> do, and diligently make uſe of all the Means that he hath appointed for that End: And let us be ſolicitouſly upon our guard, <hi>leaſt there be in any of us an evil Heart of Unbelief, in departing from the living God,</hi> our chief and only Good, and leaſt we juſtly fall under that Cenſure which was unjuſtly thrown upon <hi>Job; Thou caſteſt off Fear, and reſtraineth Prayer before God.</hi>—Ch. 15.4.</p>

            <head>A <hi>LETTER</hi> to a <hi>FRIEND,</hi> relating to the ſame Subject. Weſt-Cheſter, <date>January <hi>15, 1758.</hi>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I thank you for yours of the 2d. and am very glad that you took in ſo good part, the friendly and well-meant Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I uſed, in expoſtulating with you, on Account of your not frequenting the public Worſhip ſo much as you ought, and uſed to do.—Had you varied only in ſome meerly <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and doubtful, or indifferent Point, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were not ſo much:— But what I wrote about was a <hi>practical</hi> Affair, and ſuch an one, as I think muſt evidently appear, to any one that thinks ſeriouſly, of the greateſt Importance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Thing in the World beſide.— It was a Matter indeed both of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> reſulting even from ſtrict Demonſtration; for ſo I muſt think the Duty of publickly worſhipping the Deity, as well as in private, evidently is.—It is a Matter of ſtrict <hi>Juſtice,</hi> from which no moral Agent can be at Liberty to vary. For all Moraliſt's muſt and do allow, that <hi>Gratitude</hi> is ſtrictly due from Dependents to a Benefactor, and the Worſhip of GOD is in effect nothing elſe but our Expreſſion of Gratitude, and of our due Senſe of our Dependence on him, and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, as our Supreme Father, Lord and Governor, and moſt kind Friend and Benefactor. See <hi>Walleſton,</hi> R. N. p. 124, 5, 6, or 124— to 126.</p>
            <p>And methinks he muſt have a very depraved Mind who does not ſee, that our conſtant holding this Intercourſe with the Father of our Spirits, who is the Light and Life of our Souls, and the great Source and Patern of all moral Perfection, is, in the Nature of the Thing, directly connected with every good Temper, and virtuous Diſpoſition, wherein the true Perfection and Happineſs of every reaſonable and immortal Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts:— And moreover, That to do this firſt, and moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Act of Juſtice and Duty, openly and jointly, in Society with our Friends and Neighbours, as Brethren and Children of the ſame common heavenly Parent, does, in the Nature of it, happily tend to conciliate Benevolence, and promote every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, as well as perſonal Virtue, wherein the public Weal and Happineſs of Mankind conſiſts; and conſequently that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a contrary Conduct, in neglecting ſo important a Duty,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008627_0029_103167C677394888"/>
muſt be really Criminal; (vaſtly more Criminal than open In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to a human Benefactor, as baſe and injurious as that is accounted) eſpecially in Perſons of Education and public In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the Society: It muſt be Criminal, not only againſt their own Souls, but even againſt the Society itſelf, as well as the common Parent and Lord of the whole ſocial Syſtem, the great <hi>Father of whom the whole Family of Heaven and Earth is named.</hi>—</p>
            <p>But you ſay, I am not ſatisfied in this, or that, or <hi>any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Syſtem,</hi> &amp;c. Dear Sir, I beg in the Name of Truth, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and Benevolence; is it fit you ſhould neglect the plaineſt and moſt important Duty, both to your Maker and great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the Society whereof you are a Member, as well as to your own Soul, till you can do it in Company where every thing is intirely perfect, according to your Notion of Things? Can you make no Allowances for the Miſtakes and Differences among Chriſtians which yet perhaps, in many Inſtances, may be chiefly, if not only, in Sounds?—Would not Candor diſpoſe you to put the beſt and moſt favourable Conſtruction, eſpecially on ſuch Things as have the Sanction of the public Senſe and Authority? And would not a Senſe of Duty diſpoſe you, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conform to it?— Is there not ſomething extremely inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous in an Affectation of Singularity:mdash;And what I beſeech you, do you think would in a little Time become of all public Virtue and Order, and indeed of every thing that is amiable among Mankind, if every one ſhould renounce the open Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Deity, which one may do as well as another, and the leſſer People will ſoon be apt to learn to do, from the Greater? —How can you endure ſo much as the Appearance of having a Hand in ſuch public Havock? It is ſhocking and deplorable to ſee the Churches already ſo much deſerted. And then, what a hideous Thing muſt it be, for a Family of young Children to be bred up under the Example of a Parent that ſhews no open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the God that made them, and the Saviour that redeemed them?— What can be expected, if they have any regard for their Parent, but that they will learn from his Example, <hi>to have no Fear of God before their Eyes</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">For you know, <hi>non exiſtentis, &amp; non apparentis, eadem eſt Ratio.</hi> If it does not appear by outward Expreſſion and Behaviour, it will not be thought to exiſt at all.</note>; the Conſequence of which will be, that they will of Courſe run into all manner of Vices, that will deſtroy them in the midſt of their Days!— As the Fact has ſadly been in innumerable Inſtances in this miſerable Age, in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe licentious Principles that now obtain and iſſue in the neglect and contempt of all public Religion, as well as private.—On which Account methinks (ſuppoſing nothing <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
ſinful impoſed upon me, in which I muſt be active) I would be zealous and ſteady in worſhipping God, almoſt any
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008627_0030_103167C910934558"/>
how, rather than not at all, and according to any Syſtem rather than none. Nay I proteſt, if it were poſſible for me to believe Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity and it's Sacraments to be but a meer human Contrivance, yet it's Moral is ſo excellent, and it's Doctrines and Rites do ſo evidently tend to purify the Heart, and to promote Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and univerſal Juſtice and Benevolence, and all kinds of Virtue, that I would ſteadily attend upon all it's public Offices, and by my Example and Influence, do all the Honour I could to it, for the ſake of the public good of Mankind.—</p>
            <p>I am verily perſwaded that Popery itſelf, as bad as it is, does nothing near the Miſchief towards deſtroying the Virtue and morals of Mankind, as Scepticiſm, and the looſe Notions that are ſo much in vogue in our unhappy Nation, and in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and apoſtatizing Days. How inexcuſable then muſt it be to neglect ſo excellent a Method of Worſhip, as that in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in one that does not doubt, as you profeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Chriſtian Syſtem is a divine Revelation?</hi>— If ſo, how can you heſitate a Moment, to worſhip God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Liturgy that is very little elſe but a judicious Collection out of that very Syſtem, the Holy Scriptures, which you profeſs to believe?— If there be ſome few Paſſages in it that you are not well ſatisfied in, or that imply Doctrines about which you doubt, yet ſo long as you are not obliged to aſſent to thoſe Particulars, they ought by no Means to tempt you to neglect a plain and moſt neceſſary Duty: And even thoſe Paſſages, if you would conſider them with Candor, and a Diſpoſition to underſtand them in ſuch a Senſe, as, putting the moſt favourable Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, they would well admit of, you might at leaſt bear with them. You ought ſurely to conſider them, (having the Sanction of Authority) at leaſt with the like Candor, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays he would have for any Author, in that fine Paſſage of his,—<hi>ubi plura ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

indeed, and <hi>Science falſly ſo called,</hi> that tends to alienate our Minds from him, or tempt us to neglect the conſtant Adoration of him, both ſeverally and ſocially.
