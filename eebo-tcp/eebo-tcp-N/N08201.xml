            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE IMPORTANCE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WITHIN theſe few Years frequent have been the Alarms that the State was in Danger, nor would I venture to affirm that they have always been without Foundation. We have had power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemies abroad, diſtreſſed Allies to ſupport, Rebellion at home, Faction and Diſcontent among the People, which has riſen to an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Height, and has even extended itſelf to our Colonies in <hi>North America,</hi> where the Spirit of Riot has broke out at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and with the utmoſt Violence attacked ſeveral of the Kings's Officers, plundered their Houſes, and robbed them of their Effects, and ſet Government at Defiance. Encouraged by this Example, the Multitude at <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:010471_0004_0F7FC371D6B97D58"/>
were proceeding to the ſame Violences, ſo that ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inhabitants, it is ſaid, were obliged to betake themſelves to Ships to avoid their Rage. How alarming are ſuch Acts of Violence in a civilized Country, and ſubverſive of all Order and good Government, which every good and loyal Subject ought to ſupport to the utmoſt of his Power? But altho' the other Colonies, much to their Honour, have not proceeded to ſuch Violence, yet we are well aſſured that great Uneaſineſs and Diſcontent prevails in all of them, on account of an Act of Parliament, impoſing a Stamp-Duty, to which, they ſay, if they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, it will be an Introduction to all the Variety of Taxes which are paid in <hi>England,</hi> beſides the numerous Taxes impoſed on them by their own Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>To juſtify themſelves in this Diſobedience to the Act, they preſume to call the Right of the Houſe of Commons over them in queſtion. This is a Matter of ſuch Importance, that it cannot fail of being one of the firſt Things conſidered by that auguſt Houſe, when their own Dignity, and Juſtice to the Colonies, I hope, will both be defended and ſupported; and in the mean Time I wiſh to ſee the Miniſtry act with Spirit on this moſt important Occaſion, but ſhould be ſorry to ſee their Actions were mere Deeds of Power; for it ſhould always be remembered, that the Colonies are our Brethren and Fellow-Subjects, free-born <hi>Britons</hi> equally as we are, and intitled equally with us to every Right and Privilege of <hi>Britons.</hi> We ſhould inquire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether we have behaved to them as Brethren? and whether we have not exacted from them what we ſhould have judged extremely hard to have ſuffered ourſelves? The firſt Right of a <hi>Briton</hi> is, that he
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010471_0005_0F7FC3726DB48408"/>
cannot be tried but by his Peers; the next, that he cannot be taxed but by a Parliament, in which he is repreſented, or by Gentlemen who pay a Share of the Tax they impoſe on him; for the Law, not truſting too much to Virtue, wiſely proceeds on this Suppoſition, that however inattentive a Man may be to the Concerns of others, he will probably pay ſome Regard to his own Intereſt; and it is in this View that the Law requires a Man to be poſſeſſed of a certain Eſtate, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to repreſent others. Are the Colonies then in this Manner repreſented in the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> Do thoſe who impoſe Taxes on them pay alſo a Share of thoſe Taxes? If this is not the Caſe, what have the Colonies done that they ſhould be ſtripped of one of the moſt valuable Privileges of <hi>Britons?</hi> Have the Parliament a Right to take from the loweſt of the Subjects the ſmalleſt Privilege which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits, unleſs forfeited by Law? Do not miſunderſtand me. I do not by any Means call the Power of Parliament in queſtion; I know they are in many Caſes omnipotent; they may, of Power, paſs a Law by which any Colony ſhould be deprived the Privilege of being tried by Jury; but I aſk, could they of Right do it? for between Power and Right is a very great Difference.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, and I believe truly, that, in 1763, when the Sugar-Act paſſed, that the Stamp-Duty was then under Conſideration; but the evil Conſequence being repreſented, it was reſolved by the then Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to put it off, in order to have the Senſe of the Colonies on it; they, therefore, laſt Seſſions would have applied by Petition to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Manner of impoſing the Stamp-Act; but I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed no Member would preſent their Petitions, for it ſeems it was
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010471_0006_0F7FC37339C352B0"/>
againſt the Forms of the Houſe. That honourable Houſe ought to know beſt whether Forms ought to ſtand in the Way of Right, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when ſo great a Part of this Empire deſired to be heard: If a Charter of Magna Charta had been the Impediment, it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it ſhould be annulled.</p>
            <p>This Rejection to be heard, has cauſed all the Colonies to reſolve to ſend Deputies from their Aſſemblies to meet at <hi>New-York</hi>; from whence, it is probable, they will again attempt to petition Parliament. If their Demands are reaſonable, Juſtice requires that ſo vaſt a Part of this Empire ſhould be heard; and I am well convinced that they will demand nothing that is unreaſonable, or inconſiſtent with the Laws.</p>
            <p>The utmoſt Wiſdom of Parliament will be wanted on this moſt important Occaſion; and no Member, it is hoped, will adviſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Exertion of Power. It is the true Intereſt of <hi>Britain</hi> to acquire and retain, not to alienate the Affections of her Colonies, which ſurpaſs moſt Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> in Power and Number of People; and this can only be done by kind Uſage, and always conſidering them, as they moſt certainly are in all Reſpects, on the ſame Footing with ourſelves, and of Right intitled to every Privilege that we in <hi>England</hi> enjoy.</p>
            <p>The Colonies are ſo many diſtant Provinces of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, and which add great Dignity and Power to it, and will continue to do ſo infinitely more; but if, inſtead of improving this vaſt Acceſſion of Dominion to our mutual Advantage, we make Enemies of our Friends and Fellow Subjects, and thereby convert this Bleſſing of Heaven into
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010471_0007_0F7FC373E7B884A0"/>
a Curſe, then, indeed, we may have Cauſe to weep, and to mourn over our late Conqueſts, whilſt every Power in <hi>Europe</hi> would rejoice in our Diviſions and Diſtractions, which they already do, and will not fail to encourage.</p>
            <p>Never, therefore, did the Welfare, and even Independence, of this Kingdom call more for the utmoſt Wiſdom and united Counſels of the Government, than on this moſt important Occaſion; for it ſhould be remembered, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire on the Continent of <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> extends more than 2000 Miles, in which is every Kind of Soil and Climate, and therefore yields, in great Plenty, near all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>Europe,</hi> and is certainly capable of producing every Kind of Fruits that any Part of the World is known to afford.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Bleſſings of Life, they have all the Sinews of Power. The Earth is known to contain innumerable Iron Mines, endleſs Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Oak and other Timber, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax; vaſt Banks, Rivers, Bays, Harbours, abounding with the greateſt Fiſheries on the Globe; ſo that not a Doubt can be entertained that this vaſt Country will, in Time, become the greateſt Empire that the World has ever ſeen; and this Opinion is confirmed by the rapid Progreſs they have made ſince 1621, when a few perſecuted People firſt went thither, and who are now become near three Millions; theſe, in a Country where Land is ſo eaſily had, and which occaſions early Marriages, cannot fail, in twenty-five Years, of becoming ſix Millions, which is about equal to the People of <hi>England</hi>; and this Increaſe will continue in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whoſe Bounds weſtward are unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010471_0008_0F7FC375D72F8430"/>This is ſuch a ſtriking Proſpect of increaſing Population in thoſe Regions, as ſhould induce us to deſert the Idea of being long able to ſubject them to our Power. They have already often aided us in our <hi>American</hi> Wars, and they will ſoon be able to do ſo in <hi>Europe</hi>; we ought therefore to adopt true Policy, which, is, to rule them with Lenity, for that only can continue for Ages, what an Exertion of Power might fail to ſecure for a few Years.</p>
            <p>The great Uneaſineſs and Diſcontent of the Colonies, having taken its Riſe from the Stamp Duty laid on them; this, we ſee, has ſet them upon eſtimating for themſelves, and of their Utility to us; and accordingly they ſet a Value upon themſelves, and we ought to be aware how very ſtrongly the Eſtimation of their own Utility will on all Occaſions operate on their Minds. The <hi>North-Americans</hi> ſay, they have been toiling for the Mother-Country; that the Fruits of all their Labour centers here; that therefore, if they are not conſidered as Children, their Treatment is that of Slaves, and therefore, if oppreſſed, they muſt unite. They accordingly cry out for Union, which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Congreſs of all the Colonies, whoſe Deputies are now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>New-York,</hi> which is firſt propoſed for Repreſentation only; but ſhould they not ſucceed, we ſhould be aware of what they may next proceed to conſult on; as alſo what may prove the Conſequence of rooted Hatred and Deſperation.</p>
            <p>I therefore cannot help cenſuring thoſe to be tyrannic Principles, which are for dragooning, and an Exertion of Power and Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am well convinced that true Policy often dictates to Authority
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010471_0009_0F7FC376548305B8"/>
to yield upon critical Exigencies; the higheſt Authority has often done it with true Wiſdom, in this Kingdom, as in the propoſed Exciſe on Wine and Tobacco in 1733, and in 1755 repealing the Jew Bill. We ought always to give Applauſe to thoſe who, by reſtoring Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, prevent Deſperation.</p>
            <p>True Principles of Policy and Commerce, abhor <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> that tend to prevent our Colonies of <hi>North-America</hi> from enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by other States, for ſuch are a Prejudice to the Mother-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; becauſe all the Riches which they acquire, muſt, in ſome Shape or other, center here; and to prove this, you can have no better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the Courſe of Exchange; and how immenſely that is againſt the Colonies, muſt be known to all Men. Whatever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get, they only ſubſiſt themſelves, being always kept in a State of deep Debt to us. What can we deſire more? And whom can we injure more by Reſtrictions and ſevere Laws than ourſelves?</p>
            <p>Reſtraints on their Trade then certainly is very impolitic; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Trade they carry on, if they get but a Balance in their Favour, it muſt turn to our Advantage; and ſurely, of all Inſtruments for ruining and ſuppreſſing Trade, Military and Marine are the moſt deteſtable; their arbitrary Principles are incompatible with Commerce, which can never flouriſh but with Mildneſs and Encouragement; nor ought Vice Admiralty Courts to be intruſted with Power over Commerce.</p>
            <p>As to the Stamp and other Taxes, if they have not Money enough even to pay for our Manufactures, nothing can be gained by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010471_0010_0F7FC376E945B838"/>
to tax them; becauſe if you take their Money for Taxes, you loſe it in Commerce, which muſt end in the Ruin of your Merchants, and numerous Manufacturers; for what is gained by Taxes is ſo much Loſs to Trade; the draining therefore from them every Farthing of their Money by Trade, and then demanding from them more by Taxes, is abſolutely reducing them to <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery, of making Bricks without Straw.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the great Object with Regard to <hi>North-America</hi> is vending our Manufactures, which, the more they are enabled to buy, ſo much the better it muſt be for us in the Employment of our People at home, and the Returns we receive; and the leſs we ſtudy to perplex our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by attempting to tax them, the more it will be to our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and contribute to the Peace and Proſperity of both Countries.</p>
            <p>The ruling Policy of every State is unqueſtionably Self-Intereſt; the Policy therefore of every State of <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly our inveterate Enemies, muſt induce them to wiſh a Revolt of our Colonies on the Continent of <hi>North-America</hi>; and they would not fail of ſupporting them, either openly or ſecretly, in doing it, whereby that whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent would be thrown open to them in Point of Trade, which this Kingdom now alone enjoys. The Part which both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> took when <hi>Holland</hi> revolted from <hi>Spain,</hi> proves that my Apprehenſions are not ill grounded; if therefore Severity is uſed, to inforce an unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Act, and that Deſperation ſhould enſue, it would not only be Matter of great Joy to our inveterate Enemies, but they would ſecond ſuch Diſobedience with all their Power, in order to confirm it, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010471_0011_0F7FC377CB2E7128"/>
thereby hope to reduce the Dignity and Power of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; and in ſuch dreadful Situation, which (God forbid) the Evil would not ſtop in <hi>North America,</hi> for the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> would moſt probably follow the Fortune of the Continent. It ſhould always be remembered, that <hi>Spain</hi> loſt both <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> by her Acts of Severity; and in thoſe famous Revolutions every Power of <hi>Europe</hi> rejoiced. We ought therefore to be very careful in our Conduct towards the <hi>Americans,</hi> whom, in all Probability, every Power in <hi>Europe</hi> would encourage to Rebellion, whereby they would greatly weaken this Kingdom, and advance their own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Such Conſiderations as theſe ſhould point out to this Kingdom the right Rule of Policy to be purſued with regard to our Colonies, which contain near three Millions of People; and this Rule is, to acquire and retain by Acts of Lenity and Mildneſs, the Affections of our Colonies, and not to alienate them by Severity; for the Time will approach, in which it will become extremely dangerous to attempt ruling ſo vaſt a Continent, already abounding with Millions, by the Iron Rod of Power, the Sway of which will only make them the ſooner refractory; and when the Fire of Reſiſtance is once kindled, there is no foreſeeing how far it may ſpread. The Deſire of Independence is inherent in all Men, and few will long bear even imaginary Grievances, with the Means in their Hands, however deſperate, of ſhaking them off. This has been ſeen in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was once the Miſtreſs of the World, the Seat of Arts, Empire, and Glory; but who, by her Oppreſſion of a Part of <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and the greateſt Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which could no longer bear the Severity of her Government, forced them to renounce her Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and ſet up for themſelves; in conſequence of which, great
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010471_0012_0F7FC37867A4D590"/>
Kingdoms aroſe; and this Country, (<hi>Britain</hi>) antiently the Jeſt of the polite <hi>Romans,</hi> became the happy Seat of Liberty, Plenty, and Power, whilſt her former Sovereign (<hi>Rome</hi>) lies ſunk into Slavery, Ignorance, and Poverty. Let this be a Warning to us how we conduct ourſelves to our Colonies, who, for the firſt Time, are now united in a Congreſs at <hi>New-York</hi>; from this Union of their Councils, we cannot tell what they will reſolve, but, from all Accounts, many of the People ſeem ripe for Deſperation, becauſe they think themſelves oppreſſed. We ſhould remember that they are <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and many of them inherit from their Anceſtors republican Principles, which they carried thither during the civil Wars; being perſecuted here, they fled to the Foreſts of <hi>America</hi> for the Sake of Liberty; their Sons are all of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the ſame Principles of Liberty, which Spirit perhaps is more prevalent there than in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons great Care ought to be taken in our Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Americans.</hi> To attract willing Obedience from them muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be more ſafe than to exact it by Compulſion; and it can never deſerve Reproach to correct human Policy and Error. The Rulers of Kingdoms, no more than other Men, are always wiſe; and when they are not ſo, it is happy if they ſee their Errors before it is too late, and not perſevere in them through Obſtinacy, rather than diſcover to the World that they have been wrong, as has frequently been the Caſe, even to the producing the very worſt Effects; but we are at preſent expoſed to no ſuch Hazard from the Meaſures that have embroiled our Colonies, becauſe our preſent Miniſters cannot be intereſted in the covering or ſupporting the Errors of the laſt. I hope in theſe Thoughts to be rightly underſtood; my Meaning is, to point out the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010471_0013_0F7FC37B011FA0D0"/>
true Policy that I think this Kingdom ought to purſue; for the ſingle Object of Union between us and the Colonies, is undoubtedly Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and Self-intereſt; for if we had no Views of reaping Profit, or an Acceſſion of Power from <hi>North-America,</hi> we ſhould not concern ourſelves farther about them, than to prevent their falling into other Hands, to the endangering us: And the Affection of the <hi>North-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> to this Nation, from which they ſprung, together with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection which they received in their infant State, ſecures their Duty and Loyalty.</p>
            <p>But in all Debates at this Time, too much Streſs is laid on that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, ſince whatever we did for them was with a View to ſerve our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and, to ſpeak the Truth, our perſecuting the Diſſenters in the Times of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> I. by Commiſſion and Spiritual Courts, compelled the Anceſtors of the People of <hi>New-England</hi> to fly thither from Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny.</p>
            <p>The ſame Spirit of Perſecution prevailed againſt the Quakers in the latter End of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and, being made very uneaſy thro' Popiſh Bigotry, Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> that modern <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> ſolicited and obtained a Grant of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Thither he took great Numbers of Quakers at his own Expence, which were followed by many others, in order there to enjoy their innocent and conſcientious Opinions.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that the four Colonies of <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> were peopled by our Perſecution, and without receiving any other Aid than that of Protection only, and for which they have not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful; for it ſhould be remembered, that, in conſequence of our Wars in <hi>Europe,</hi> whenever we ſent an Expedition to <hi>America,</hi> we have always been aſſiſted by our Colonies, to the utmoſt of their Power; for in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010471_0014_0F7FC37B6BE1EEB8"/>
1690, when Sir <hi>William Phipps</hi> was ſent againſt <hi>Canada, New-England</hi> alone ſent 3000 Men and forty Tranſports; and in the Expedition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der General <hi>Hill,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> againſt the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Colonies ſent 6000 Men. In 1739, at the Requeſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, 4000 men were inſtantly raiſed in the Colonies, and ſent, at their own Expence, to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the Place of Rendezous, from whence they were conveyed to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and there uſed. In the Courſe of that War, when our Affairs looked deplorable enough in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, New-England,</hi> even without our Knowledge, or a ſingle Soldier from <hi>Britain,</hi> undertook the Conqueſt of <hi>Cape-Breton</hi>; they ſucceeded in it, and thereby gave Peace to this Kingdom. During the late War they had 20,000 Men in Arms againſt the Enemy in <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and when the <hi>French</hi> were totally conquered there, they ſeconded our Deſigns in <hi>South-America</hi> againſt the <hi>Havannah,</hi> which important Place, it is ſaid, would not have been taken, but by the ſeaſonable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Troops from <hi>New-York,</hi> when our own were ſwept away by a raging Diſtemper: For theſe, and many more of their Services, Duty, and Loyalty, they claim the Liberty of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects, and to which they affirm they have an hereditary Right.</p>
            <p>They have now no <hi>European</hi> Power that they can dread in their Neighbourhood, and their own internal Power is very conſiderable, and this will increaſe very faſt, which a juſt and gentle Sway may for Ages connect to this Kingdom; they will be held to it by the Ties of Conſanguinity, Religion, Language, Manners, Cuſtoms, and Laws; theſe, with good Uſage, will long ſecure them to us; for they will always conſider us as their ſafeſt and beſt Friend in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010471_0015_0F7FC37C27A2E960"/>But our greateſt Security and Power over them, muſt conſiſt in their Diſunion as Colonies; but unhappily the Stamp-Act has abſolutely dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to cry out for Union, and accordingly their Councils are now united in a Congreſs at <hi>New-York.</hi> They will now feel their Power, and become ſenſible of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Motto, that <hi>Unity gives Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Advantages which we ſeek from the Colonies are in a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Way, and as they add to our Power, we ſhould therefore, by Plans of mild Government, attract them as Colonies reſpectively; and we ſhould rather make them Rivals for our Favour, than united Friends in oppoſing us. We muſt not think that the <hi>North-Americans,</hi> who have a watchful Eye over our Proceedings, and are greatly jealous of their Liberty, will ſuffer their Properties and Intereſts to be miſapplied. <hi>America</hi> is every Year growing more inviting, and <hi>Great-Britain</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more diſguſting; in which Caſe her Strength will increaſe, whilſt our's will decreaſe, for we daily ſee many of our Manufacturers and uſeful People getting on that Side of the Water. In ſhort, the Means moſt apparently ſolid for ſecuring our Colonies to us, muſt be, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their Induſtry in every Way but manufacturing, and ſecuring to ourſelves the Fruits thereof, by furniſhing them with our Manufactures on cheaper Terms than they can procure them elſewhere; this will tend to promote mutual Harmony and Proſperity, and a laſting Union with our Colonies reſpectively, without weakening their natural Rivalries, which, tho' we need not foment, we ſhould not wiſh to leſſen, nor by any Means by unpopular Acts drive them to Union; but this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately has been done by the Stamp-Act, ſince the paſſing which, and the Sugar-Act of 1763, great Numbers of our Manufacturers have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010471_0016_0F7FC37E3517D3D0"/>
and are gone to ſettle in <hi>North-America,</hi> the Effects of which are already, and will ſoon be much more ſeverely felt in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is a miſtaken Policy to attempt making the <hi>North-Americans</hi> Slaves to our Intereſt or Power, for they are too knowing to be made the former, and too high ſpirited to become the latter; the only Way to keep them dependent on this Kingdom, muſt proceed from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Rectitude of the Government; no diſtinct Intereſt muſt be purſued, and, above all, the landed Intereſt muſt not be favoured at the Expence of the commercial; for the landed Intereſt can only be ſupported by the Proſperity of Commerce, in which we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the <hi>Americans</hi> as much as in our Power, and thereby take off their Attention from becoming Manufacturers. This only is true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and on ſuch Principles we ſhould begin with preventing them from being harraſſed by Vice Admiralty Courts, and remove every exiſting Cauſe of juſt Complaint, and we ſhould conſider their Proſperity as the Source of our Riches; by this Conduct we ſhould reſtore Content and Harmony both here, there, and between us. This is the true Syſtem which I think ought to be obſerved, and thoſe who fail in purſuing it, will be the juſt Abhorrence both of <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Americans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the Stamp-Act, in the Preamble of which it is ſaid to be juſt and neceſſary that Proviſion be made for raiſing a further Revenue toward defraying the Expences of defending, protecting, and ſecuring the Colonies in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would not only be imprudent, but ill become me to attack the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that Houſe, of which I always deſire to think and ſpeak with
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010471_0017_0F7FC37F2C152FD0"/>
Reſpect; but I cannot help remarking, that for a Century paſt, whilſt <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Louiſiana</hi> were in the Hands of <hi>France,</hi> the Colonies wanted no ſuch Defence or Security from <hi>England,</hi> for they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but now, when <hi>Louiſiana, Cape-Breton,</hi> and <hi>Canada</hi> are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Obedience of, and poſſeſſed by the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> now that there is not a <hi>French</hi> Subject left on that Continent, it is tho't neceſſary to keep a conſiderable Army in the Colonies, for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which this grievous and unpopular Act is impoſed; but it has been ſaid, they are neceſſary to reduce the Indians; this, tho' a very idle one, I know was the Pretext. The Colonies have defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a hundred Years ſince againſt the Indians, and are they now all of a ſudden become unable, with the Addition of ſeveral hundred thouſand Men? This is extraordinary indeed! But if the Indians were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to live in Peace, it would be very hard if the Colonies could not bring them to Subjection without the Crown keeping a numerous Body of Troops in a Country where Soldiers are ſo very diſagreeable; and not only ſo, but to lay heavy Duties on Merchandize and even a Stamp-Tax, for the Support of ſuch Troops, and in a Country where every Man by Beat of Drum is obliged to appear under Arms; for all the Colonies are formed in a regular and well-diſciplined Militia; and they are ſo ſenſible of their Numbers, that they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely glad to ſee every Soldier embark for <hi>England,</hi> ſince they are are of no Uſe, but a Burthen to the Colonies, whoſe real Defence and Protection is received from the Valour of their own native Militia; nor have they an Enemy worth Notice within 3000 of them.</p>
            <p>With the recalling therefore of thoſe Troops from among them, the Cauſe of the Stamp Tax will be removed; the Colonies would then
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010471_0018_0F7FC37FEF6A65B0"/>
reſume their Trade, which is now ruined; and their Heads, which are at preſent full of manufacturing, would be employed on Schemes of Commerce and Navigation; the Fruits of all their Labour would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to center in <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; and the Language which they now hold, that they are treated not as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> but as Aliens and Slaves, would immediately ſubſide; their Affections and Labours would be united in promoting the Trade and Intereſt of this Kingdom, and all Things would return to their late happy and proſperous State.</p>
            <p>But it may perhaps be ſaid, that admitting the Parliament were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Inability of the Colonies paying the Stamp-Duty, and that they were inclined to repeal the Act, but that the <hi>Americans,</hi> by denying the Authority of that auguſt Houſe to impoſe internal Taxes on them, has, as it were, put it out of the Power of Parliament to repeal the Act, becauſe their Dignity is concerned.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that as to the Authority of Parliament, that auguſt Houſe can reſolve, that their legiſlative Power is not confined to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but doth extend over the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire; that it is hereditary and inherent in them; and that they will defend and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch their Authority and Dignity whenever Occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>After this, if they are convinced of the Impropriety of the Act, they can, I humbly conceive, conſiſtently with their Honour, ſuſpend its Execution for twelve Months, or any other Period of Time, till a new Parliament, when ſome ſmall commercial Tax may be laid on them, and this abrogated.</p>
