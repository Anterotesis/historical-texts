            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>NOW from this Story we learn, not only, That if <hi>Israel</hi> would prevail against their Enemies, they
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002705_0004_0FE60F2615E97B58"/>
should all, but their <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, lift up and keep up, the hand of Prayer: But also, That the Remarkable Preservation and Success of Soldiers in Fighting the Lords Battles, are very proper to be Commemorated, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of GOD, and Encouragement of his Servants, in future Expeditions, and Military Actions.</p>
               <p>IN Consideration hereof, I've the more easily comply'd with the Request of some of the Publishers of the Ensuing Sermon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it might be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with a Narrative of the Memorable Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>AND tho' I at first propos'd only to Reprint the Relation of this Action, given us in the Public News Papers; yet having been favour'd with a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account from the Valorous Capt. <hi>Wyman,</hi> and some others of good Credit, that were in the Engagement; I hope it will not be unacceptable to <hi>any,</hi> and am sure it will be very grateful to <hi>some</hi>; to have the Story Publish'd with some Enlargments. And particularly to make a Public Record of the Names of those Couragious Soldiers, who have so nobly play'd the man for their Country; several of whom have been grievously Wounded, &amp; others have Died in the Field of Battle, or of the Wounds they there Receiv'd: All of whose Names I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the greatest part of the Country will allow, deserve to be Transmitted unenvi'd to Posterity, with very bright Encomiums.</p>
               <p>'TWAS then, about the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1725, that the Brave LOVEWELL began his March from <hi>Dunstable</hi> for <hi>Piggwacket,</hi> with <hi>Forty-Six</hi> Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002705_0005_0FE60EEE6A1A61A0"/>WHEN they'd Travell'd a little way, <hi>Toby,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> falling Lame, was oblig'd to return, with great Reluctancy.</p>
               <p>WHEN they came as far as <hi>Contoocook,</hi> one <hi>Wm. Cummins</hi> of <hi>Dunstable</hi> was so disabl'd by a Wound he'd Receiv'd from the Enemy some time before, that the Capt. dismiss'd him, with a Kinsman of his to accompany him.</p>
               <p>THEN they Travell'd as far as <hi>Ossipy,</hi> and there one <hi>Benjamin Kidder</hi> of <hi>Nutfield</hi> falling Sick; the Capt. made a Halt, and tarried while they built a small Fortification, for a place of Refuge to repair too, if there should be Occasion. Here he left his Doctor, a Serjent and Seven other Men, to take care of <hi>Kidder,</hi> and of a Considerable Quantity of Provision, here left to lighten the Men, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their March; and for a Recruit upon their Return.</p>
               <p>WITH his Company now reduc'd to <hi>Thirty-Four</hi> Men with himself, the Capt. Travell'd to <hi>Pigwack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,</hi> which is about <hi>Forty</hi> Miles from said Fort.</p>
               <p>THEIR Names that made up this Company (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his that started from them in the beginning of the Battle, and ran back to the Fort, which I'd be excus'd from mentioning) were as follow.</p>

                  <hi>SATURDAY</hi> the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> while they were at Prayers, very Early in the Morning, they heard a Gun; and somtime after spy'd an <hi>Indian</hi> on a Point, that ran into <hi>Saco Pond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY now concluded that the design of the Gu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; of the <hi>Indian</hi>'s Discovering himself, was to draw them that way: And expecting without fail to be Attack'd; It was now proposed, whether it were Prudent to venture an Engagement with the Enemy, (who they perceiv'd were now sufficiently Alarm'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) or, endeavour a speedy Retreat. The Men Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and Boldly Answered,
<q>We came out to meet the Enemy; we have all along Pray'd <hi>GOD</hi> we might find 'em; and we had rather trust Providence with our Lives, yea Dy for our Country, than try to Return without seeing them, if we may, and be called Cowards for our Pains.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Captain</hi> readily comply'd to lead them on, though not without Manifesting some Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; — And (supposing the Enemy were a Head of 'em, when as it prov'd, they were in the Rear) Ordered the Men to lay down their Packs, &amp; March with greatest Caution, and in utmost readiness.</p>
               <p>WHEN they'd March'd about a Mile and Half, or two Miles, Ensign <hi>Wyman</hi> spy'd an <hi>Indian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:002705_0008_0FE60EFB44598E50"/>
toward them, whereupon he gave a Sign, and they all squat, and let him come on: presently several Guns were Fir'd at him; upon which the <hi>Indian</hi> Fir'd upon Captain <hi>Lovewell</hi> with <hi>Bever</hi>-Shot and Wounded him Mortally (as is supposed) tho' he made little Complaint, and was still able to Travel, and at the same time Wounded Mr. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Whiting</hi>: Immediately <hi>Wyman</hi> Fir'd at the <hi>Indian</hi> and Kill'd him; and Mr. <hi>Frie</hi> and another Scalp'd him.</p>
               <p>THEY then March'd back toward their Packs, (which the Enemy in the mean while had seiz'd) and about Ten a Clock, when they came pretty near where they'd laid 'em, on the North East and of <hi>Saco Pond,</hi> in a plain Place, where there were few Trees and scarce any Brush; The <hi>Indians</hi> rose up in Front and Rear, in two Parties, and ran toward the English Three or Four Deep, with their Guns Presented: And the English also Presented in a Moment and ran to meet them; and when they came within a few Yards, they Fir'd on both sides, and the <hi>Indians</hi> fell amain, but the English (most, if not all) 'scap'd the first Shot, and drove the <hi>Indians</hi> several Rods, both sides Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or four Rounds. But the <hi>Indians</hi> being more than double in Number to our Men, &amp; having soon Kill'd Captain <hi>Lovewell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fullam,</hi> (only Son of Major <hi>Fullam</hi> of <hi>Weston,</hi>) Ensign <hi>Harwood, Iohn Iefts, Ionathan Kittridge, Daniel Woods, Ichabod Iohnson, Thomas Woods</hi> and <hi>Iosiah Davis</hi>; and wounded Lieutenant <hi>Farwell,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Robbins</hi> and <hi>Robert Usher,</hi> in the place where the Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and striving to Surround the rest; The Word
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:002705_0009_0FE60EA2D1E83A80"/>
was given, to Retreat to the Pond, which was done with a great deal of good Conduct, and prov'd a vast service to the English (in Covering their Rear,) tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> got the Ground where our Dead lay.</p>
               <p>THE Fight continu'd very Furious &amp; Obstinate, till towards Night. The <hi>Indians</hi> Roaring and Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Howling like Wolves, Barking like Dogs, and making all Sorts of Hideous Noises: The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Frequently Shouting and Huzza'ing, as they did after the first Round. At one time, Captain <hi>Wyman</hi> is Confident, they were got to Powawing, by their striking on the Ground, and other odd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but at length <hi>Wyman</hi> crept up toward 'em and Firing among 'em, shot the Chief Powaw and brake up their Meeting.</p>
               <p>SOME of the <hi>Indians</hi> holding up Ropes, ask'd the English if they'd take Quarter, but were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd Briskly, they'd have none but at the Muzzle of their Guns.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the middle of the Afternoon, the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Mr. <hi>Ionathan <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

But when he could Fight no longer, He Pray'd Audibly several times, for the Preservation and Success of the Residue of the Company.</p>

Lieutenant <hi>Robbins</hi> desir'd they'd Charge his Gun and leave it with him, (which they did) for says he, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians will come in the Morning to Scalp me, and I'll kill one more of 'em if I can.</hi> Eleven more that were Wounded, who were Lieut. <hi>Farwell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Frie,</hi> Serjent <hi>Iohnson, Timothy Richardson, Iosiah Iohnson, Samuel Whiting, Elias Barron, Iohn Chamberlain, Iohn Gilson, Eleazar Davis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iosiah Iones,</hi> March'd off the Ground, with the Nine that received no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Wound, who were Ensign <hi>Wyman, Edward Lingfield, Thomas Richardson,</hi> Two <hi>Melvins, Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezar Ayer, Abiel Astin, Ioseph Farrah,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph Gilson,</hi> who did not perceive they were way-laid, or pursued by the Enemy, tho' they knew our Men had no Provision, and must needs be very faint. Four of the Wounded Men, viz. <hi>Farwell, Frie, Davis</hi> and <hi>Iones,</hi> after they'd Travell'd about a Mile and Half, found themselves unable to go any further, and with their free Consent, the rest, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Recruit at the Fort, and to come back with Fresh Hands to relieve them, kept on their March. But one Morning as they were passing a thick Wood, they Divided into Three Companies for fear of making a Track, by which the Enemy might follow them. One of the Companies came upon Three <hi>Indians,</hi> who pursu'd 'em sometime; And <hi>Elias Barron</hi> one of that Party stray'd from the rest, and got over <hi>Ossipy River,</hi> by the side of which, his Gun Case was found, &amp; he has ne'r been heard <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

For in the beginning of the Battle, the man that I Promised not to Name, ran directly to the Fort, and gave the Men Posted there, such an account of what had happen'd, that they all made the best of their way Home. There came in also to the Fort, One <hi>Solomon Kies,</hi> who having fought till he'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd three Wounds, &amp; lost so much Blood he cou'd not stand, He crawl'd to Ensign <hi>Wyman</hi> in the heat of the Battle, &amp; told him
<q>He was a Dead Man; But (says he) if it be possible, I'll get out of the way of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they mayn't get my Scalp.</q>
This <hi>Kies</hi> Providentially found a Canoe in the Pond, &amp; roll'd himself into it, &amp; was driven by the Wind some Miles toward the Fort; when being Wonderfully Strengthen'd, he got to the Fort, as soon as the Eleven aforesaid: &amp; they all came in to <hi>Dunstable, May</hi> 13th. at Night. <hi>O <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 15th. came in at <hi>Dunstable</hi> four more of our Soldiers, whereof Ensign <hi>Wyman</hi> was one; who says,
<q>He'd no sort of Food from <hi>Saturday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till <hi>Wednesday</hi> following, and yet scarce felt at all Hunger bitten.</q>
They then caught two Mouse-Squirrels, which they roasted whole, &amp; found them a sweet Morsel. Afterward they Kill'd some Partridges and other Game, &amp; were Comfortably Supply'd, till they got home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazar Davis</hi> came in at <hi>Berwick,</hi> &amp; reports, (as I'm Inform'd) that He &amp; the other Three left with him, when they'd waited some Days for the Return

of the Men from the Fort, &amp; at length despair'd of their coming, tho' their Wounds Stank &amp; were Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, &amp; they were ready to Dy with Famine; yet they all Travell'd several Miles together, till Mr. <hi>Frie</hi> desired <hi>Davis</hi> &amp; <hi>Farwell</hi> not to hinder themselves any longer for his sake, for that he found himself Dying, &amp; so lay down, telling them
<q>He should never rise more: Charging <hi>Davis,</hi> if it should Please GOD to bring him home, to go to his Father, &amp; tell him, that he expected in a few Hours to be in Eternity; and that He was not afraid to Dy.</q>
Whereupon they left him; and this Hopeful Gentleman Mr. <hi>Frie,</hi> who had the Journal of the March in his Pocket, has not been heard of since.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant <hi>Farwell,</hi> who has been very much &amp; no doubt Deservedly Applauded, was also left by <hi>Davis</hi> at a few Miles distance from the Fort &amp; not heard of since. But <hi>Davis</hi> getting to the Fort and finding Provision there, tarried and Refresh'd himself and recover'd strength to Travel to the place mention'd. <hi>Iosiah Iones</hi> another of the Four, came in at <hi>Saco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since</hi> the Action, Col <hi>Tyng</hi> with a Company, have been on the spot, and found and Buried Twelve of our Men. They also found where the <hi>Indians</hi> had Buried Three of their Men, and when they were dug up, One of them was known to be the <hi>Bold Paugus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who has been such a Scourge to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable</hi>; but if he be gone to his own place, He'll cease from Troubling.</p>
               <p>HIS <hi>Honour,</hi> Our Excellent Lieutenant <hi>Governour</hi> has been Pleas'd to give Ensign <hi>Seth Wyman,</hi> a Captains Commission, since his Return, as a Reward of His Valour. And it's much to be Desired, that He, and all that are Return'd from <hi>Piggwacket,</hi> to

their own Houses, will consider and show what <hi>Great Things</hi> GOD has done for them.

               </p>
               <p>BUT thus I've related the Story of the Action at <hi>Piggwacket,</hi> according to the best Information I cou'd obtain; and hope there are no <hi>Material,</hi> I'm sure, there are no <hi>Willing</hi> or <hi>Careless</hi> Mistakes in it.</p>
               <p>AND I've only to add,</p>
               <p>THAT whoever Considers the Distance our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were at from any English Settlement, in a Howling Wilderness, and very far in the Enemies Country, who were at Home, &amp; more than double the Number of our Men; Their Fighting from Morning to Night in a Long, Hot Day, without any Refreshment; The Number Kill'd and Wounded, amongst whom were some, that were Persons of Distinction on both sides; will doubtless grant that this Action Merits a Room in the History of our <hi>New-English</hi> Wars, whenever a Continuance of it shall be Publish'd If any judge, I've observ'd some Circumstances in this Action too Minute, I've only to say, if some such Persons or their Relations had been in the Action, it's possible they would not have been of this Opinion. However, those who I am firstly Oblig'd to Gratify, wont easily come into their Sentiments in this matter. And I must beg of the others to forgive me this Wrong, and that they'd only consider, the Different Taste of Readers, &amp; consequently the extreme Difficulty, if not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility

of pleasing every Body, in a Performance of this Nature. And yet none would be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do it, than the Unworthy Author, who is a Hearty Lover of His Country, and of all Good Men of every Denomination.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Book before us is Entitled <hi>The Second of Samuel,</hi> not, that it was written by the Famous Prophet of that Name; (for it contains an History of what came to pass, after his Death; of which we've an account in the beginning of the XXV. Chap. of the former Book) but the latter part of the <hi>former,</hi> with the whole of <hi>this</hi> Book, is supposed to be written by <hi>Nathan</hi> or <hi>God</hi>; or by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> or <hi>Ezra.</hi> And probably it's call'd, <hi>The Second of Samuel,</hi> by the Hebrews, because It's a Continuation of the History began by him; and so, being <hi>a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi> to the History of <hi>Samuel,</hi> it goes under his Name; as is usual in such cases now a days.</p>
            <p>IN the Chapter before us, we've a very Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elegy; of which our Text is the Conclusion.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002705_0016_0FE60F2AA677B7A0"/>
And here we may observe. (1) WHO was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Elegy, or Funeral Poem; Namely, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Agreably it's termed in our Psalm-Book, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's Elegy.</hi> The Sweet Psalmist of Israel was a Poet, as well as Musician; and has given us a noble Specimen of his admirable Poetick Genius, in the Mournful Poem before us. But we're to consider Him here, not only as a finish'd Poet, but as an Eminent Servant of GOD, even the Man after GOD's own heart: who duely considering the works of the Lord, and regarding the operations of His hands, has set us a very bright Example, how to behave upon, and what Improvement to make of, the Death of Useful Men; especially of such, as not only have Jeoparded their Lives unto the Death, but nobly laid down their Lives, in the high places of the Field, in the Service of their King &amp; Country: <hi>David</hi> Lamented with this Lamentation. —</p>
            <p n="2">(2) OBSERVE the Subject &amp; Occasion of this Elegy; <hi>viz.</hi> The Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi>; who with many of their Army fell down slain upon Mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> 1 Sam. 31.1, 2, 3. Tidings of this Slaughter being bro't to <hi>David,</hi> he was greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, and (as was customary amongst the Hebrews on such sorrowful occasions) <hi>David, took hold on his clothes and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him. And they mourned and wept and fasted until Even, for</hi> Saul <hi>and for</hi> Jonathan <hi>his Son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of</hi> Israel; <hi>because they were fallen by the Sword.</hi> Context 11, 12. <hi>ver.</hi> And having done Justice on the young Amalekite, that brot' the News, who by his own Confession had stretched forth his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002705_0017_0FE60F09D52E35F0"/>
hand to slay the Lord's anointed; He further gave vent to his Grief, in the Elegant Composition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) OBSERVE the Matter and Substance of this Elegy: or, what <hi>David</hi> said on this great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. And <hi>First,</hi> He utters this mournful assertion, <hi>The Beauty of Israel is Slain upon thy high places</hi>! ver. 19. Expert Soldiers are no inconsiderable part of the beauty of <hi>Israel.</hi> Then follows a very pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Exclamation, which is thrice repeated, <hi>v.</hi> 19.25, 27. and is the burthen of the Song, <hi>How are the Mighty fallen</hi>! We have then his Poetical Wish, with the Reason of it, That the Tragical News might not be published, v. 20. <hi>Tell it not in</hi> Gath, <hi>publish it not in the Streets of</hi> Askelon: <hi>lest the Daughters of the Philistines rejoyce, lest the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the uncircumcised triumph.</hi> The Imperative Mood is used in the begining of the verse for the Optative, after the manner of passionate Mourners, who often wish for things impossible. And by this form of Speech <hi>David</hi> rather expresses his Detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what was done, then forbids the doing of it: <hi>q. d.</hi> O that this Doleful Story had never been told in Gath! for so it surely was, 1 Sam. 31.8, 9, 10. <hi>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the Slain, that they found</hi> Saul <hi>and his three Sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

            <p>DAVID then goes on to commend <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> for their wonderful Success at Arms, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>From the Blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of</hi> Jonathan <hi>turned not back, and the sword of</hi> Saul <hi>returned not empty.</hi> They were wont to be Victorious over their stoutest Enemies. And that it's otherwise now, and that these Valiant Men are fallen, argues that GOD is angry; which should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken his people to Repentance. He further ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates (as, their affection to one another and Union in Death, <hi>v.</hi> 23. so,) their Agility and Courage. <hi>They were swifter than Eagles, they were bolder than Lions.</hi> They were <hi>Swift</hi> and Nimble to pursue their Enemies, and to avoid danger; and <hi>Strong</hi> and Valiant to resist and overcome such as dare oppose them. Briefly, he commends <hi>Sau</hi> for his Royal Bounty to the Daughters of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom he calls upon to Lament him, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Ye Daughters

of</hi> Israel, <hi>weep over</hi> Saul, <hi>who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your Apparel.</hi> Even the Daughters of <hi>Israel</hi> had been wont to bear their part in <hi>Sauls</hi> Triumphs, and now it became them to mourn his Fall. As <hi>all</hi> share in common Calamities; so <hi>all</hi> should be suitably affected therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> DAVID particularly Laments over <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> professing his deep Distress for him: the dear affection between them, and the pleasure he took in his Conversation, <hi>v</hi> 25, 26. <hi>O</hi> Jonathan, <hi>thou wast slain in thy high places.

            <p n="4">(4) OBSERVE some of the Properties of this Elegy. And, <hi>First,</hi> It is extremely <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>elegant.</hi> The Ideas are very bright, and well adapted: the Phrases are very Expressive and Emphatical, and hence the whole Poem is very moving and patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. And particularly, where he speaks of his Friend <hi>Ionathan,</hi> nothing can be more soft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and express'd with a greater Pathos. And what more passionate, than his Repeated Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>How are the Mighty fallen!</hi> Those Valiant and Renowned Commanders, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> with their brave and undaunted Soldiers, that fell with them. So that <hi>the Weapons of War are perished i. e.</hi> those that wielded them are dead. And what will Weapons do, without Men of Skill and Courage to handle them, for their Countrie's Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Defence, and the Suppression and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of their Enemies!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002705_0020_0FE60F2D5A51EA40"/>
               <hi>Again,</hi> THE whole Poem is sufficiently <hi>Brave</hi> and <hi>Manly.</hi> David shows himself a Man of a great Soul, now, that <hi>Saul's</hi> day was come to die, &amp; GOD had delivered him out of his hands; and <hi>Saul</hi> could now no longer persecute and hunt him as a <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> on the Mountains, as he'd a long while done (for as in the <hi>Grave</hi> the weary Servants of GOD, are at rest, so, Blessed be GOD! when the Wicked are lodg'd <hi>there,</hi> they cease from troubling) I say tho' <hi>David</hi> was now delivered, he scorns to trample with insulting feet on the Monument of the Dead, and crow over a Breathless Corpse; But buries all the faults of <hi>Saul</hi> in perpetual oblivion, in the land of forgetfulness, lays aside all Spleen, and heartily mourns his Countrie's Reproach and Loss, tho' the very means of his own deliverance and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (a Noble instance of Public Spiritedness) and commemorates what was commendable, even in <hi>Saul.</hi> For, <hi>De mortuis, nil nisi bonum.</hi> None that are Men after GOD's own heart, will unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily rip up the faults of others; and speak evil of those that can't speak for themselves. Those that are not thus tender of the Reputation of others, may justly fear that others will be as free with them, when they are silent in the Grave.</p>
            <p>BUT then, it's also a <hi>Martial</hi> Poem, 'tis written with a Martial Air. The Subject is intirely Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. He Laments his Heroes, considered in their Military Character. He Celebrates their Military Accomplishments and Atchievments. And he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates it to the Militia of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as in the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis in the Preface, 18. <hi>v. also he bade them teach the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>the use of the Bow</hi>: Whence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002705_0021_0FE60F1C32100270"/>
it's evident, That <hi>David</hi> in the midst of his mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not unmindful of what was necessary for the good of the Common Wealth: Teaching us, not to be so overcome with Grief, on such sorrowful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, as to forget our Duty and neglect means for our own or our Countries safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi> THIS Elegy is very Ancient. 'Twas written about Eight and Twenty Hundred Years ago. And according to some Chronologies, before the Famous Iliads of <hi>Homer,</hi> who was the very Father of all the Heathen Poets, and said to be born in the Reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> the Son of <hi>David.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <desc>〈8 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </note> It is then one of the first-born of Elegies, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable for it's Antiquity. It's said to be Recorded in the Book of <hi>Iasher</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is tho't to be a General Chronicle of the Acts of the Jewish Nation: <note n="a." place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Willet in loc.</hi> &amp; <hi>alii.</hi>
               </note> and call'd <hi>Iesher,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Iust</hi> or <hi>Upright.</hi> We read of it <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10.13. It's suppos'd this Book was continued from Age to Age, as a Collection of State Poems, (say some) or of the Memorable Acts of GODs Worthies, and tho' laid up at length in the Temple (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports) yet being not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, is now lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> TO remark no more Characters of this Poem, It's a <hi>Scripture</hi>-Elegy, for tho' we don't sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it at first written by inspiration; yet being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Will of GOD, was adopted (if I may so express it) by the Holy Spirit, who inspired those that inserted it in the Sacred Pages, so that it is now a part of Canonical Scripture. And thus it's probable the Penman of the Chronicles collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002705_0022_0FE60F1236436738"/>
many things out of the Book of <hi>Iasher,</hi> being guided therein by the unerring Spirit of GOD. And tho' the Name of GOD is not to be found in this Elegy, yet it is consonant to Religion, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by GOD; and we hence learn, that what is spoken or written by the Servants of GOD, may be very agreable to the Will of GOD and for his Glory, tho' the Name of GOD or CHRIST is not to be found therein. Thus the Book of <hi>Esther</hi> wherein are no less than Ten Chapters, has not the Name of GOD in it.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) OBSERVE the main Scope and Design of this Elegy And there are two things more especially that <hi>David</hi> had in view, after the Glory of GOD, his Ultimate End. <hi>First,</hi> to perpetuate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Dearly Beloved <hi>Ionathan,</hi> his Bosom Friend.
<q>Great indeed was the Love between <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi>; for when <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant, had on some occasion, signifi'd his Resolution, that one of them should Die; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Damon</hi> to go home and settle his Affairs before his Death, provided he could find one to be Surety for his return; <hi>Pythias</hi> forthwith offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed voluntarily, and put himself in the Tyrants power. <hi>Damon</hi> coming back precisely at the time appointed, <hi>Dionysius</hi> did so much admire their mutual Fidelity, that he Pardon'd both, &amp; pray'd that he might be admitted the Third into their Friendship.</q>
               <note n="a." place="bottom">
                  <hi>Collier's Dictionary.</hi>
               </note> But the Love of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was more Divine and Excellent, than that of these brave Heathen <hi>Philosophers.</hi> We've the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it's Commencement, 1 Sam. 18. <hi>begin.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002705_0023_0FE60EE523518100"/>
And it came to pass when he</hi> [David] <hi>had made an end of speaking to</hi> Saul, <hi>that the Soul of</hi> Jonathan <hi>was knit with the Soul of</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> Jonathan <hi>loved him, as his own Soul. And</hi> Saul <hi>took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his Fathers house. Then</hi> Jonathan <hi>and</hi> David <hi>made a Covenant, because he loved him as his own Soul. And</hi> Jonathan <hi>stript himself of the Robe that was upon him, and gave it to</hi> David, <hi>and his garments even to his Sword and to his Bow, and to his Girdle.</hi> For such a Friend one would even dare to die. To be sure, <hi>David</hi> would have the Memory of this Just Man Blessed. He would have him had, in Everlasting Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. And he here does his part, that it might be so, and the event was agreable to his pious desire, for wherever the BIBLE is enjoyed, this Elegy is still to be found on Record for a Memorial of him.</p>
            <p>BUT then <hi>David</hi> had a further reach than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Embalm the Name of his Friend, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the Remembrance of <hi>Saul,</hi> for his Relation to <hi>Ionathan</hi> and to his Country: For, by this Elegy, or Funeral Song, <hi>David</hi> design'd to fire the ambition of his Contemporaries &amp; Successors, to seek to excel in Chivalry; and to fire them also with Zeal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the War against the Barbarous <hi>Philistines,</hi> and to avenge the Death of their Sovereign, and several of the Royal Family, and many other Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Soldiers; and to defend themselves, against their Insults and Depredations. Agreably in the Parenthesis before mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>He bade them teach the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>the use of the Bow.</hi>— The best Interpretation of which Passage (says <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) is, That it expresses the design of <hi>David,</hi> that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002705_0024_0FE60EC0DE6F90A0"/>
this Song, being put into the hands of <hi>Iudah,</hi> it might serve to excite and provoke them to addict themselves to Martial Exercises, and to acquire Skill in the <hi>use of the Bow,</hi> which is here put for all Warlike Weapons then in fashion. And may the same use be made of the Discourse, you are now Reading, to provoke all among us, of a Military Character, to inure themselves to the use of the GUN, and all such Exercises as may accomplish them for Service in the Doleful War, we're unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily involved in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having,</hi> Observ'd these things in General in this Elegy, I come now to remark from the Conclusion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT the Full of Brave and Successful War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in the Field of Battle; is very much to be Lamented by the People of GOD, in whose immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Service they Lost their Lives.</hi> We should La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them with this Lamentation, <hi>How are the Mighty fallen, and the Weapons of War perished!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> IT is sometimes the Lot of the Bravest Warriours, and of such as have been very Success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to fall at last, or be slain in the Field of Battle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> had been a Brave Warriour and did worthily in the beginning of his Reign. The History of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of <hi>Iabesh-Giliad</hi> when <hi>Nahash</hi> the <hi>Ammonite</hi> came up &amp; Encamped against it, is very noble and brave, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>begin.</hi> He discover'd both Great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Conduct, in that whole action, at the 11<hi>th.</hi> we read, <hi>Saul put the people in three Companies, and they came into the midst of the Host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites, until the heat of the day: and it came to pass that they which remained
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002705_0025_0FE60EC0D04730C8"/>
were scattered, so that two of them were not left to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Thus he effectually raised the Seige of poor <hi>Iabesh-Giliad,</hi> and delivered the City. And then some Hot-headed people, proposed to <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the Male-contents should be put to Death, who had said, <hi>shall</hi> SAUL <hi>reign over us? Saul</hi> very Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously suppress'd the Motion, and snub'd those that too officiously propos'd it; saying, <hi>There shall not a man be put to Death this day!</hi> And as he was once returning from the slaughter of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the Women came out of all the Cities of <hi>Israel,</hi> singing and dancing, to meet King <hi>Saul,</hi> with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brets, with Joy and with Instruments of Musick: and the Women answered one to another as they played, and said, <hi>Saul hath slain his thousands.</hi> We read also of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that <hi>he smote the Garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.3. And in the beginning of the 14 Chapter, wer'e inform'd how <hi>Ionathan</hi> and his Armour-Bearer, did mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously smite the <hi>Philistines.</hi> And in the Context, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>David</hi> gives 'em this encomium, <hi>From the Blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the Bow of</hi> Jonathan <hi>turned not back, and the Sword of</hi> Saul <hi>returned not empty.</hi> And he calls them, <hi>the Mighty,</hi> and <hi>the Flower or Beauty of Israel</hi> Now these Brave, Successful Soldiers, were Slain in Battel at last, upon mount <hi>Gilboa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND (not to mention any other instance) Thus

neglect his Life and perform rather the Duty of a Soldier than of a General; and to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would say, <hi>That Armies slight the Danger they share in with their King; and that if Generals don't act in Person they can never atchieve a Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Reputation</hi>: And that such as shun Death, meet it oftner, than they that seek it: That <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar</hi> was never wounded in Battle, tho' he ever fought in the foremost Ranks of his Troops: and that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great mark'd out the way with his own Blood, that led him to the Empire of the East; and that to be as Famous as these Great Men, he ought to be no more timerous than they: this Great Man, after he'd obtain'd divers Victories over the <hi>Danes</hi> &amp; <hi>Poles</hi> &amp; <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and received Thirteen Wounds before those of which he died, was at length Slain in a Battle with the <hi>Germans,</hi> having first almost got the Victory, which his Army compleated after his Death. And thus the Great <hi>Gustavus</hi> Died, in the 38<hi>th.</hi> Year of his Age, <hi>Anno Domi.</hi> 1632. whilst Victory (as one expresses it) lay a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his side.</q>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>THE Fall of Brave and Successful Soldiers is very much to be Lamented by the People of GOD, especially by those in whose immediate Service they Sacrific'd their Lives.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> THIS is very Decent and Becoming the People of GOD. There's a time to weep, as well as a time to laugh. And every thing is beautiful in it's season. Now when Brave and Seuccessful
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002705_0027_0FE60EA2C459D0B8"/>
Soldiers are Slain in Battle, who have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by Providence as Instruments of Checking the Pride and Insolence, and Weakning the Force, and Thinning the Number, and Discouraging the Hearts of the Enemies of GOD's People; and of preserving the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the Israel of GOD: and might if GOD had spared them, been a further Scourge to the Enemy, and Defence to the People of GOD, by contending with the Enemy in Battle. It's very proper and highly reasonable, such especially in whose immediate Service they've Couragiously ventur'd and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly laid down their Lives, should Lament their Death. And the Contrary, is, how indecent? how Sottish? how Stupid and Unreasonable? <hi>Now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are lovely, decorus, and of good report,</hi> Christians should love and practise these things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. The Civiliz'd <hi>Heathen</hi> will rise up in Judgment against <hi>Christians,</hi> yea and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> also, if they don't do such deserving Persons the Honour of Lamenting their untimely Death. It's Humane and Manly to do so: but the contrary is indeed, inhumane, and worse than Heathenish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT is Just and Equal, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD to Lament the Death of Brave and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Soldiers Slain by the Enemies, and in their Service.

            <p>AND then, its a Spur to Virtue. When Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soldiers (and particularly such as have been Eye-Witnesses of the Fall of their Brethren, and fought with uncommon Bravery, and were either Wounded, or, Equally Exposed in the same Battle,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002705_0029_0FE60EBB69833280"/>
with those that are Slain) take Notice that the Death of their Officers or Fellow-Soldiers, is deeply resented by the People of GOD, that they still speak of them with great Honour in their Lamentations, this will Animate them, we hope, to do Worthily, and rather Die with Honour, if call'd to Battle, than live with Disgrace; and for their Cowardice, have the offer of a <hi>Wooden Sword,</hi> and be Branded with the Infamous Character of a <hi>Coward,</hi> even by the Weaker Sex.</p>
            <p>WEHREAS, on the other hand, it's a great Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the Affliction of destressed Mourners, when they observe that the Generality, only give the News of their Friends Death, the hearing, but seem as Stoical and unconcern'd about it, as if their Lives were of no value, and their Death what does no way concern them. Such Ingratitude and Inhumanity is very Exercising to Ingenious minds and such as have any sense of Honour. Besides such a Sordid Insensibleness, is very Discouraging to our Brave Soldiers. Who would be willing to venture their Lives for such ungreatful People!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> It's Pious and Scriptural to bewail the Death of such Brave and Successful Soldiers, whose Lot it is, to be Slain at last in the Field of Battle. GOD expects we should lay to heart the Death of all our fellow Creatures, <hi>That is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart,</hi> Eccl. 7.2. And particularly, we'r oblidg'd to Lament the Death of Eminently useful Men, tho' they Die quietly in their Beds; and come to their Graves in a <hi>good Old Age, like as a shock of Corn comes in, in it's season.</hi> How much more should we mourn
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002705_0030_0FE60F2D64F25408"/>
their loss, when Slain in Battle, in the midst of their Days, or in the very Flower of their Age, while their <hi>Breasts were full of milk, and their Bones were moistned with marrow.</hi> It's a sore Judgment when GOD suffers such to fall <hi>by,</hi> and <hi>into</hi> the hand of the Enemy; and does not cover their heads in the day of Battle. This is an aweful Frown and argues the great displeasure of GOD. Hence He threatned the men of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> that said to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Prophesy not in the Name of the Lord, that their <hi>Young men should die by the Sword,</hi> Jer. 11.21, 22. and a like threatning he denounc'd against <hi>Moab,</hi> Jer. 48.15. — <hi>His chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose Name is the LORD OF HOST.</hi> And when the Wrath of the LORD was risen against <hi>Israel,</hi> for their <hi>measure-filling Sin,</hi> in mocking the LORD's Messengers, despising his words and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using his Prophets, it's said, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought upon them, the King of the <hi>Chaldees, who slew their young men with the Sword.</hi> Now what greater cause of Mourning and Lamentation than the Manifestations of GOD's displeasure? If the <hi>Lion</hi> roar who will not tremble? but alas, who can stand when GOD is angry! And he highly resents it, when his people are insensible under the Tokens of his holy anger: if they cry not, when he corrects them. He says to such, <hi>why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more,</hi> Isa. 1.5. and again, <hi>they are not humbled unto this day,</hi> Jer. 44.10.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, We've many Scripture Precepts and Examples, that teach us to Lament, on the occasion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002705_0031_0FE60F1C41622810"/>
under consideration. When GOD threatn'd <hi>Israel,</hi> by the weeping Prophet, that a People should come from the North Country, that should lay hold on Bow and Spear, being <hi>Cruel,</hi> and having <hi>no Mercy</hi>: Jer. 6.22, 23. It's added, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>O Dau'ter of my People gird thee with Sackcloth, and wallow thy self in ashes: make thee Mourning as for an</hi> ONLY SON <hi>most bitter Lamentation</hi>; — Surely then, there should be a proportionable Lamentation, when several chosen Young Men, and some very promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hopeful, are actually Slain by Men of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Character. Another instance we have, Jer. 9.17. — <hi>Consider ye, and call for the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women. — Let them make hast — that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gush out with waters — And teach your Dau'ters wailing and every one her neighbours lamentation. For Death is come up, — to cut off the Young Men from the streets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And even the Carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field — and none shall gather, or,</hi> BURY <hi>them. This</hi> Evinces, that GOD calls to mourning when Young Men fall by the Sword, &amp; the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Battle. And then to mention no other Scriptures, our Text and Context is a full &amp; direct proof of our Doctrine. For, as was observ'd before, this Mournful Song was <hi>Davids</hi> Lamentation over those that were slain by the <hi>Philistines</hi> on Mount <hi>Gilboa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to the APPLICATION. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> IF it's sometimes the Lot of the most Valiant and Successful Soldiers, to be Slain at last in Battle; <hi>Then they that Gild on the Harness should nor
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002705_0032_0FE60EAF46D25680"/>
boast as they that put it off.</hi> This was well observ'd by <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> 1 Kings 20.11. All such Preposterous Boasting is evil; very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and ominous, and commonly followed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal consequents. Boasting <hi>Benhadad</hi> had cause and leisure in his inner Chamber to think of this wise caution, when he had seen his Army miserably broken <hi>a first time,</hi> &amp; slain with a great slaughter, by a Company of Striplings, under the Command of <hi>Ahab</hi> their King: and <hi>a second time</hi> totally routed; an Hundred Thousand Footmen being slain in one Day by the <hi>Israelites</hi>; and Twenty Seven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more by the falling of a Wall upon them; and he reduced to such abject circumstances, as to beg Quarter by his Ambassadors with Sackcloth on their Loyns and Ropes on their Heads. How was the Scene now changed, &amp; his Tune turn'd, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20. And thus we find the Swaggering <hi>Goliah,</hi> who defi'd the Armes of the Living GOD, one Minute Cursing <hi>David</hi> by his Gods, and disdainfully saying, <hi>Come to me and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field</hi>; and the next Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute tumbling headlong with his Face upon the Earth: and the Beauty of <hi>Israel</hi> cutting off his Head with his own Sword, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.1, —51.</p>
            <p>GOD allows us indeed, in our Spiritual Warfare, (and in extraordinary cases, as, in <hi>David's,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Challenge of the Giant, in a <hi>Carnal</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare also) to Triumph before the Battle and to say, <hi>Thanks be unto GOD, that giveth us the Victory, thro' our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> For, in all these things we are more than Conquerors, thro' the Captain of our Salvation, whose is the Victory, and who hath loved us, and will give it to us!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002705_0033_0FE60F2479EA1C60"/>BUT without particular Revelation, not now to be expected, none can tell, whither the many, or the few; the strong or the weak; the Righteous or the Wicked; the Friend or Enemy will get the Day in the Field of Battle. Boasting then, upon the going forth of Armies, is to be Condemned; both in such as go forth to War, and in such as tarry at home, on their Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE most Skilful, Dextrous, Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Successful Soldiers, <hi>had need to be truly Religious and well prepared for Death</hi>; seeing they'r not Invulnerable, but as liable to Die as others. An <hi>Indian</hi> Bullet will kill a <hi>Hero,</hi> a <hi>Champion,</hi> as easily as a Faint-Hearted <hi>Coward</hi>: a <hi>Captain,</hi> or <hi>Chaplain,</hi> as soon as a Bringer-up of the Front half-Files; or the most inferiour Private Soldier. There must indeed be the Swiftness of the <hi>Eagle,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the <hi>Fox,</hi> the Strength and Boldness of the <hi>Lion,</hi> as well as the Grace of the <hi>Christian,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Brave Soldier; and every devout Christian, that's fit for Heaven, is not most fit to go forth to War. But, tho' such as are destitute of Grace may possibly be Stout Soldiers and Noble Commanders, and deserve well of their Prince and Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in answer to the Prayers of GOD's People, in whose cause they'r Employ'd, they may fight valiantly, and play the man for their People, and tread down the Enemy; yet if they'r Slain, they cannot ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly expect Salvation. Seeing then our Soldiers carry their Lives in their Hands, when they go forth to War, and are still liable to be Ambush'd, wher'er they Travel in the vast Howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and, kill'd unexpectedly, as well as Slain in a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002705_0034_0FE60EAF52096E80"/>
pitch'd Battle; they'd need be always ready not only to Fight, but to Die, and make their Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before GOD. And in order thereto, they should <hi>now</hi> Believe in CHRIST and Repent of all their Sins, and so get into, and keep in good terms with GOD, who can easily preserve them, tho' a <hi>thousand fall at their side, and ten thousand at their right hand</hi>: and can cause one of them to <hi>chase a thousand,</hi> and two, to put <hi>ten thousand <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> flight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Wretched <hi>Iesuites</hi> or <hi>Friers,</hi> are won't ('tis said) to absolve their deluded Proselytes, the Barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> when they come forth to War against Us: &amp; flatter 'em with the Promise of an immediate passage to Paradise, without any stop at Purgatory, if they fall in Battle: And these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusive Hopes may possibly animate them, to fight with great Fury in their Engagements with us. And many private Soldiers &amp; Inferiour Officers in the Campaigns in <hi>Christendom,</hi> meerly from the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Applause, Promotion, or filthy Lucre; or, from Thrift after Revenge, and a vain opinion that Fighting in a good cause, and on the right side, they shall surely be happy in the next World, if they'r kill'd in Battle, have possibly been led on to sight with undaunted Resolution, and the utmost Intrepidity. Surely then the Motives of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, such as serving GOD and their Country; having GOD to go before them, and fight for them, and either to cover their Heads, or, receive their departing Souls to the Blessed Mansions above where there is no Adversary nor Evil occurrent, where they shall <hi>rest from their labours and their works shall follow them,</hi> must needs be sufficient, by the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002705_0035_0FE60ED3B128F600"/>
Influence of the Holy Spirit that dwelleth in all real Christians, to cause them to wax Valiant in Fight, and to raise them above the fear of what Earth or Hell can do unto them.</p>
            <p>SO then, <hi>A well grounded Perswasion of a Part in Christ, and an Interest in the favour of GOD, is what all that go forth to War, would do wisely to give all Diligence to obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> SINCE the Best of Soldiers are liable to be overcome and Slain in War, <hi>It ill becomes the People of GOD to put their trust in Man.</hi> Tho' it's their Duty and Wisdom to Employ and Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Expert Soldiers: yet it's their Sin and Folly to trust in them. As it's Idolatry for Soldiers to trust in their Arms, or in their Dexterity and Courage to handle them; or in one another: so it's Idolatry for the People of GOD, in whose Service they go forth to trust in <hi>them.</hi> For alas! What is man whose Breath is in his Nostrils, and wherein is he to be accounted off? His Breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Dust; in that very Day, all his Projections and Resolutions and Accomplishments for War, perish!</p>
            <p>SURELY then, It's the greatest folly, for a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to trust in their Forces, how well soever Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, Spirited and Equipp'd: and how Successful soever they have been. For, <hi>Every Creature is that to us that GOD makes it to be</hi>; and unless GOD give Help, <hi>vain</hi> is the Help of Man, Jer. 3 23. <hi>Truly in vain is Salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the Salvation of Israel.</hi> And we know who has said, <hi>Cursed be the man that trusteth
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002705_0036_0FE60F33ABFCB630"/>
in man, and maketh flesh his arm — But Blessed is the man, that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is,</hi> Jer. 17.5, — 7. Agreably we find the People of GOD, resolving, in the Name of our GOD we will set up our Banners. And whilst <hi>some trust in Chariots and some in Horses, we will remember the Name of the Lord our God,</hi> Psal. 20.5, — 7. And again, <hi>Thro' thee we will push down our Enemies: Thro' thy Name we will tread them under that rise up against us,</hi> Psal. 40.5. and Psal. 60.12. <hi>Thro' God we shall do valiantly, for He it is, that shall tread down our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MEN may fail us, be overcome, and utterly frustrate our expectations: But, if we trust in GOD, we may pray with <hi>Asa,</hi> when <hi>Zerah</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> came against him, with an Host of a Thousand Thousand, and three Hundred Chariots; LORD, (said he) <hi>It is nothing with thee to help, whither with many, or with them that have no power: help us O LORD our GOD, for we REST on thee, and in thy Name we go against this Multitude. O LORD thou art our GOD, let not Man Prevail against thee.</hi> The Lord of Hosts is Immortal, and Invincible; He has all Creatures at His Command, and can cause the Stars in their Courses to fight against the Enemies of his People; and sell <hi>Sisera</hi> into the hand of a Woman. In a word, whatsoever the Lord pleaseth that he doth; It is therefore better to trust in him, than to put Confidence in man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ARE the Bravest and most Successful Soldiers, liable to fall in Battle, Such then as are Preserv'd in Military Expeditions and Engagements,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002705_0037_0FE60F24895BC468"/>
and Safely Return'd to their Families and Friends, are oblig'd to Study <hi>what they shall render to the Lord,</hi> and take heed, they dont forget <hi>his Benefits,</hi> but that all their days they perform their Vows. It is the LORD that has covered their heads in the Battle; It is the Lord that Redeemed their Lives from Destruction, when those, no more expos'd than they, are fallen, and gone down to the Grave and shall come up no more, and return to their Houses no more. O that all such as have Experienc'd the Destinguishing Favour of Heaven, would Praise Him for his Goodness, and not content themselves to desire thanks to be return'd for them in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Assemblies of GODs People, tho' that is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but that they would endeavour to Live the Praises of GOD. It's very Displeasing to GOD, when his People don't render to him according to his Benifits, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. David Celebrates the Praises of GOD, for Preservation and Success in War, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. <hi>begin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> HENCE the People of GOD ought to ascribe to Him the Glory of all their Success in War. His is the Victory &amp; he gives it to whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will. He furnishes Men with Military Skill &amp; Courage: <hi>Teaches their hands to War and their fingers to fight.</hi> He finds out the Enemy for his People, &amp; gives a Presence of mind to their Forces; and if they are not swallow'd up quick, when men, vastly superiour in Number, and other advantages rise up against them, it's because the Lord is on their side, <hi>Psal.</hi> 124. Again, we find <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> giving Glory to GOD, for avenging his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the defeat of <hi>Sisera</hi> &amp; his Host, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002705_0038_0FE60F33B8AF2F48"/>
how often is <hi>David</hi> the Famous Warriour of <hi>Israel</hi>; Harping on this string, as we noted before.</p>
            <p>GOD highly resents it, when his People Sacifice to their own Net, &amp; burn incense to their own Drag: when they ascribe that to Instruments that is due to GOD alone. This no doubt often provokes GOD, to deprive a People of their Chosen Soldiers. For he is a very Jealous GOD, and will not give his Glory to another. And, as the former Pastor of this Church would say of Ministers, we may say of Soldiers, <hi>People kill them two ways</hi>: either, by ascribing too much, or too little to them: Idolize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or Detracting from them, and Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> LET us all <hi>Religiously Lament</hi> the Fall of the <hi>Brave</hi> LOVEWELL, and several of his <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Company,</hi> that offered themselves willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People. Let us take up this Lamentation over them, <hi>How are the Mighty fallen</hi>! And if we would herein approve our selves to GOD, let us consider that these Brave Men (tho' I hope, we've many left as capable of serving their Country, yet they) were <hi>no inconsiderable part of the Beauty and strength of New-England.</hi> Indeed, being wholly a Stranger to most of them, I can't pretend to give their Character; yet its evident to the Country, they were Men form'd and rais'd up by Providence to serve us in pursuing an Enemy, of whom we may say as of the wild Ass, <hi>The Wilderness yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth food for them and for their Children,</hi> Job 24.5.</p>
            <p>THESE our <hi>Worthy Friends</hi> could endure Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as good Soldiers: And were well able to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Fatigues of Long Marches, both in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002705_0039_0FE60EE518B8DB80"/>
Winter and Summer. Some of them were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Woods, &amp; with the Customs and Lurking Places of the Enemy, &amp; were mightily Spirited to pursue them, &amp; GOD did graciously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve &amp; prosper them this Last Winter in Two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, <hi>First,</hi> Delivering <hi>Two Indians</hi> into their Hands, &amp; then <hi>Ten</hi> Stout Fellows as you all Remember, whom they kill'd, without receiving any harm from them. <hi>This was the Lords doings and marvellous in our eyes!</hi> And in this Last Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were inspir'd with a great deal of Bravery and good Conduct, &amp; their Company Crown'd with Wonderful Success. Now to lose such Experienc'd Soldiers, and Men so respected in the Country, is a great Loss.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> LET us consider, that this is the Finger of GOD. Let not any Say Prophanely and Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, <hi>It's the Fortune of War</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, as a good Man said on a bad occasion, <hi>The Sword devoureth one as well as another,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.25. For tho it's true <hi>the Battle is not to the strong, and time and chance happens to all men,</hi> yet the hand of the Lord, is <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> gone out against us, &amp; therefore <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his Displeasure to be seen in this Affair. That this Brave Company, should be so weakned by leaving so great a Number with one that fall Ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that at so great a distance from them. That one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany should so unhappily leave them in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fight, &amp; bring such News to those left behind, that occasion'd their immediate Return; when their Continuance there, might have been such an unspeakable Advantage to those that Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd the Battle. And <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> appears a Frown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:002705_0040_0FE60F35CBB8DAC0"/>
that they should venture so far with so small a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at that Season of the Year, when the Enemy are capable of better Subsisting in <hi>Bodies,</hi> than in the Winter Season. I say, the hand of the LORD appears in all this, that so many Brave Men should Descend into Battle and Perish.</p>
            <p>BUT then, We'r also to consider. <hi>Why the Lords Anger against us is not turned away; but his hand is stretched out still.</hi> Have not <hi>our Sins</hi> as really Slain our Magnanimous Soldiers, as ever, <hi>David</hi> slew <hi>Uriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> by the Sword of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi>? And should we not <hi>hear the Rod, and Him that hath appointed it</hi>: And consider in this Day of Adversity, what <hi>We</hi> have done; and humble our selves &amp; Pray &amp; seek GOD's Face? Thus did <hi>David</hi> and his Men, as in the Context. And the Men of <hi>Iab<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>SHOULD we not Endeavour to find out &amp; put away the <hi>Accursed thing</hi> from the midst of us? and <hi>turn to him that smites us</hi>? Should we not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakn'd by such Providences to get our Peace made with GOD, &amp; engage and secure his Gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with us, under our present dark views?</p>
            <p>HOW many calls have NEW-ENGLAND had, from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and by the <hi>Press</hi> also, from Year to Year; To Remember whence we are fallen and Repent &amp; do our First Works! How many <hi>Election-Sermons</hi> have been Publish'd amongst us, fill'd with Solemn Warnings, most Earnest Exhortations &amp; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Testimonies for GOD, &amp; against the <hi>Provoking Evils</hi> of the Land! But alas, How many are still acting the part of the Deaf <hi>Adder,</hi> or as the Prophet expresses it, <hi>They refuse to hearken, they pull away
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002705_0041_0FE60EF965544640"/>
the shoulder &amp; stop the ear that they should not hear,</hi> Zech. 7.11. How many hate to be Reformed? Yea hate to be told by those that have good right, full power, &amp; lawful Authority to do it, <hi>wherein</hi> We <hi>should be,</hi> and <hi>what's to be done</hi> that We <hi>may be,</hi> a Reformed People. How sad is it, if all the Notice taken by the Generality of People, of the Solemn Messages sent to them from the LORD GOD of their Fathers, is only to give them the hearing, and either <hi>Humm</hi> or <hi>Hiss</hi> the Preacher &amp; his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, pretty much as they stand affected to <hi>him</hi>; and it may be, with some considerable Formality, give him thanks for his Sermon (and then he comes off mighty well!) However if they carry the Matter so far as to Print the Sermon, yet perhaps they don't put it in Practice! But now, dont they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that hear, &amp; read GODs Word, but do it nor? Or, <hi>what meaneth that saying,</hi> Jam. 1.22.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, By the sore Judgment of War, and Particularly by the Fall of our Brethren, we are now Weeping over, GOD is loudly calling upon us, to amend our ways &amp; doings. And GOD expects we should all in our places endeavour a Reformation, that we should do <hi>Our</hi> part in this Work: and if we do so, whatever be the Event, GOD will set a <hi>Mark</hi> upon us, <hi>and our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> Let not any then be Discouraged, because some proper Essays and Noble Efforts have Miscarried and prov'd Abortive. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is laid upon us: NEW-ENGLAND must Reform, or without a Spirit of Prophecy, any one that observes the Signs of the times, may I think, Evidently foresee, that in one Twenty Years more,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002705_0042_0FE60EE7975403F0"/>
the Glory of <hi>New-England</hi> as <hi>New-England,</hi> will be much more than hitherto, if not TOTALLY E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed. <hi>GOD in his Infinite, Sovereign Mercy prevent it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then, our Soldiers that are fit to go forth to War, &amp; may probably be call'd forth, You my Brethren in an especial manner are oblig'd to take the Alarm given you by the late Intelligence. Be prevail'd with if you han't yet done so, to cast away the Weapons of your Rebellion against Heaven, (for there's no making peace Sword in hand) and <hi>come as with Ropes about your Necks, and lie in the dust, if there may be hope</hi>; and <hi>there is hope in Israel concerning you.</hi> Now's your time to make ready for Death. You'l have other work to do, when Engaged in Battle. And besides, Every Battle of the Warriour is with confused Noise, and <hi>Garments rol'd in Blood</hi>: hearing the hideous Yellings and Ejulations of the Enemy, and the Groanings of Deadly wounded Men, &amp; seeing them lie all bath'd in their Gore, may awaken you to cry to GOD and make your Vows: But alas, that's no time for Consideration, &amp; Confession, &amp; Deliberate Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to forsake Sin &amp; return to GOD. This should be done Now! And then as you should be excited by this Awakning Providence to yeild your selves to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To make hast and not delay to Believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; secure an Interest in Him: So, you should be prevail'd with to see that you've good Arms and kept in good order, with good store of Ammunition, &amp; inure your selves to Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, especilly to the Art of <hi>Shooting</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; be always ready, that you may Issue out at an Hours Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002705_0043_0FE60EFB526B4560"/>
if Occasion be: and not live careless &amp; secure, after the manner of the <hi>Zidonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if you'r truly Religious, &amp; thus Equipp'd for, &amp; train'd to War, &amp; GOD call you forth, He can easily, and we hope will, preserve and prosper you. He can make you swifter than <hi>Eagles,</hi> stronger and more couragious than <hi>Lions,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> elegantly describes his Heroes, and you need not fear all the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> For if you Fall in Battel, your Death is Brave, you Die in the Bed of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and your Rest will be Glorious. It well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Soldier to Die fighting, a <hi>Minister</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; an <hi>Emperour</hi> standing. But commonly such Soldiers may take <hi>Caesar</hi> Motto, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici,</hi> I came, I saw, I overcame,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> IF we'd Religiously Lament on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, we must not be Disheartned &amp; cast down, because a Crew of <hi>Salvages</hi> have kill'd a few Brave Men. No verily! it's beneath a Man, much more a Christan, whose <hi>heart is fixed trusting in the Lord,</hi> to be thus affected with such Evil Tidings. Such News should not daunt and terrify a Soldier, but whet his Courage, and make his Blood boil in his Veins, and Especially, it should rouse 'em on such occasions, to Rally forthwith and come to March with utmost Expedition, to Recover if possible, our Dear Brethren that lie Wounded, and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in a Howling Wilderness. That they may'nt Perish with Famine, or fall into the hands of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Enemy, to be kill'd over again, &amp; Tortur'd with <hi>Indian Cruelty.</hi> And also to give Christian Burial to the Remains of our Departed Heroes. How brave was it in the Men of <hi>Iabesh-Gilead,</hi> what an
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002705_0044_0FE60F35D68DD978"/>
Instance of Gratitude and true Valour that we find recorded to their Immortal Honour and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, 1 Sam. 31.11, — <hi>And when the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Iabesh-Gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to</hi> Saul: <hi>All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of</hi> Saul, <hi>and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Iabesh, and burnt them there. And they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Iabesh,</hi> — Methinks the reading those words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Comment, would fill a Soldier with Zeal suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to carry him with a sufficient Number, as far as <hi>Pigwacket,</hi> only to cover the Dust, the Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dust, of our Gallant Soldiers, that there kept the Field; lest <hi>the Dau'ters of the uncircumcised rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> WE should amidst our Lamentations, be much in Prayer to GOD. If we would have <hi>Israel</hi> prevail, we must keep up, as well as lift up the hand of Prayer. If our Soldiers would constitute, a Thundring, they must be a Praying Legion. And we that tarry at home must get into the Mount and Pray for 'em. A <hi>Good Woman</hi> in her Closet, (tho' she's afraid to take a Gun in her hand) may serve her Country to very good purpose, even in respect of the War; as really, as the Magistrate at the Council Board; or the most daring and well advis'd Commander in the open Field in a thro' Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For <hi>Prayer and Faith, always were, are, and will be the Churches Best Weapons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Once more,</hi> WHILE we Lament our own and Countries Loss, we should not forget to Sympathize with the <hi>Distressed Relatives</hi>: The <hi>Widow</hi> and the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002705_0045_0FE60F37D8B0E470"/>
               <hi>Orphan,</hi> &amp; such as mourn for an <hi>Only Son,</hi> or other near Relations. They are greatly to be pittied, and their case remembred in our Devotions. We should Pray for them, that GOD would give them Songs in the Night, &amp; say unto them weep not! That he would comfort those that are cast down, would afford 'em those Divine Consolations that are not small, &amp; refresh their Spirits, in the multitude of their perplexed tho'ts within them. That he would give them Patience to submit to his Holy Will, to bear his Indignation, to hold their peace &amp; be still, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is GOD, who gives none account of his matters. — And that he would be a GOD to the <hi>Widow,</hi> a Father to the poor Fatherless <hi>Children:</hi> And better than <hi>Ten Sons</hi> to Disconsolate Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briefly,</hi> WHILE we Lament our Case is so <hi>Sad,</hi> let us be very thankful it is no <hi>worse,</hi> that it is so well. That we've such abundant cause to Sing of <hi>Mercy</hi> as well as <hi>Iudgment.</hi> For tho' we've lost some Brave Men, (and have cause to mourn on that score) yet, it's probable the Enemy have lost more than Treble the Number, &amp; amongst them some of their Chiefs, &amp; particularly their Bold <hi>Paugus,</hi> and a Remarkable Chec<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s given to their Insolence, and many Lives may be sav'd by this means. While therefore we cry out, <hi>How are the mighty fallen</hi>! Let us admire the Divine Goodness, that under all their <hi>Hazards, Hardships</hi> &amp; <hi>Disadvantages,</hi> so many are Returned. That our Friends can't say as <hi>Iob's</hi> Messengers, <hi>I only am escaped alone to tell thee</hi>: But that so many are well, &amp; give us the Joyful Account that our <hi>Little Army</hi> behav'd Bravely, Fought Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, &amp; very Successfully; so that tho' our Loss is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002705_0046_0FE60F37CB8EB998"/>
Great, yet our Enemies have no cause to Triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>O let us magnify the Lord, &amp; exalt his Name together,</hi> that the Enemy did not swallow them up quick, that in Wrath GOD has Remembred Mercy, &amp; has not dealt with us after our Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To have done,</hi> LET us yet Encourage our selves in the LORD our GOD. Let us return to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty &amp; he will build us up. He will soon subdue our Enemies, &amp; give us Peace in our Borders His hand can find out our Enemies, &amp; he that made 'em can make his Sword to approach unto them. Is the Brave <hi>Lovewell</hi> and other Brave Men Dead! who made them what they were? who Spirited and Enabled 'em to do what they did? It was the Lord of Hosts, who lives still, who has the Residue of the Spirit, &amp; can easily raise up others &amp; will do so, if there be occasion, &amp; we answer his Expectation, and turn to him with all our Hearts.</p>
            <p>WE may then Sing the CXXI, and CXXV, and XLVI Psalms, and say, <hi>GOD is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountains are carried into the midst of the Sea: tho' the waters thereof roar and be troubled, and the Mountains shake with the swelling thereof. The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Iacob is our Refuge.</hi> Selah.</p>
