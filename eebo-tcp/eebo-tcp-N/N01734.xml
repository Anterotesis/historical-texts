            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear &amp; Intirely Beloved Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is an afflicting Providence from GOD, and juſt cauſe of ſhame to me [for I cannot clear my ſelf from a great deal of juſt blame] that I have not done, nor can now do any thing for you in regard of thoſe writings you deſired of me: I have, and am continually preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with variety of urgent occaſions, &amp; much time [in the way I am in] is daily taken up from my perſonal ſtudies, beſides many incident avocations: And alas I can do little, &amp; make but ſlow progreſs in the long race of Learning I have to run! And it is my miſerable guiſe, either by wickedneſs or weakneſs, to fall ſhort of that good I ſhould either get or do; and if it be ſo in this caſe towards you, it is no wonder, tho it ſhould be my deep ſorrow! But yet conſidering ſome paſſages in your laſt and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002055_0002_0FBA87EE317B34B0"/>
former Letters concerning your Spiritual Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and knowing, by experience in my ſelf, the reality of ſuch Complaints; I would not be ſo graceleſs as to neglect you wholly therein: And tho' I can ſay or do very little, yet a word or two might be of ſome uſe; nor do I know what guilt might lye upon me, if I ſhould be ſilent or ſlight in this Caſe! And therefore [Dear—] if my barren heart would ſuffer me, I would preſent you with a few words, as if you &amp; I were alone in a Corner, in the preſence of GOD!</p>
            <p>The Condition you expreſs, is the Common [but fearful] Epidemical Calamity of thoſe times and places where the Goſpel is Preached, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch as outwardly carry fair: Convinced but not humbled; ſome apprehenſions of miſery and affections now and then, but not deep effectual mournings; ſomething burdened with ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and wrath of GOD; but yet able to bear it, and contented to live without being delivered from it: Knowing every thing, and feeling no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; or rather knowing every thing, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed knowing nothing; in ſeeing, not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my own part, it is that which hath been the baneful miſery of my Soul [even that very thing which thou ſay &amp; mean] ever ſince I knew any thing; and the Lord knows how little I am delivered from it, and how much of my work in this point [upon which the very hinges of our Salvation turn] is yet to do to this day! Oh [my—] if my heart were not Adamant, I ſhould weep with, and for
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002055_0003_0FBA87EFA52EA188"/>
you: And truly when I am moſt near God, I have no greater requeſt than this for my ſelf &amp; you, that God would uſe any means to make us ſee things really as they are, &amp; pound our hearts all to pieces, and make indeed ſin moſt bitter, and Chriſt moſt ſweet; that we might be both humbled, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted to purpoſe! An imperfect work of the Law, and then an imperfect work of the Goſpel, is the bane &amp; ruine of us in theſe days! Some fears and affections, &amp; then ſome hopes of Mercy [without finding full reſt &amp; ſatisfaction in Chriſt only] men reſt in, &amp; here periſh! But hence is the ground of that you ſpeak of: An heart that doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feel ſin [&amp; conſequently, no other thing that Gods word ſpeaks of] &amp; the wrath of God for it, to purpoſe: Cannot be ſenſible of ſin or miſery in an effectual manner! Now a word or two of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to you in this Caſe!</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider the end &amp; thing you are to ſtrive after. Secondly the way &amp; manner how: Your buſineſs is never to reſt till you come to feel ſin as an inſupportable burden, and then to find reſt and everlaſting ſatisfaction in Chriſt, imbracing him as your own! To go on humbling to be humbled, and to ſee ſuch intollerable evil in ſin; and be ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with the wrath of God lying upon you for it, as it may make ſin everlaſtingly odious to you, and force you to fly for refuge to lay hold of the hope ſet before you; and to have ſtrong Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there! This is a great thing, not eaſily and quickly gotten; but ſit not down at quiet, till you
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002055_0004_0FBA87F1EB9FA9E0"/>
come to this! This is the way to make all ſure! But you will ſay I know not whether I ever had any true humiliation; whether there is any thing in me that will ſtand by me, when an hour of Temptation comes? Therefore now reſolve, I will padle &amp; dally with God &amp; my own ſoul no longer, I will never give God reſt till He ſhew me things really, &amp; till I have attained that ſenſe of ſin, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, which is real and effectual! This is the work of our lives, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.29. Let me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſt till it be put out of all doubt, that God in Chriſt is mine own, and hath made an everlaſting Covenant with me! This I will have, or I will be in bitterneſs before the Lord while I have any Being; and for the reſidue of my days, I will dwell with them that lye down in ſorrow, I will have my ſociety with ſuch forſaken ſouls; who being deſolate &amp; deſerted, are free among the dead: If the bleſſed God ſhall excommunicate this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul from His gracious preſence, [which yet is but an Act of His moſt Holy &amp; Juſt ſeverity] Oh! let me find this favour in his ſight, that I may alſo excommunicate my ſelf from the pleaſures &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of this preſent World! And reſolve this, If God will not let me ſee the good of his choſen, [and I have nothing to ſay why He ſhould] I will mourn, I will mourn; let me live &amp; dye in the houſe of Mourning! If God will not Comfort me, nothing elſe ſhall, if I may not have peace &amp; reſt in God, I'le have none at all; if God will take no pleaſure in me, I'le take no pleaſure in my ſelf:

theſe affections &amp; hopes are very good, and they may be true [and be ſure to be exceeding thankful for any ſuch thing; that you have any deſire to ſeek God, any tears at any time before him, and hope toward him; its more than thouſands have] and very good encouragement to ſeek after Chriſt more; but not to be reſted in without Chriſt!

I Anſwer, Firſt, let this deeply humble you; and the vileneſs of your heart that here diſcovers it ſelf will be worth the while. Secondly, beſeech God to help you. Thirdly, By uſe of time you will find it more eaſie. Fourthly, take advantage upon all the evil frames that at preſent you feel, to apply &amp; ſet on ſome ſoaking expreſſion in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: As in caſe of hardneſs, blindneſs, vanity, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. Yea hence ſee and ſay, that God is true, and his word is true; for the Scripture tells me of this heart I feel; and the reſt of it will be verified upon me as well as this. Fifthly, take the advantage of ſpecial ſeaſons for Meditation, when your heart is in a feeling frame [as after Prayer, after Sermon, if you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore] &amp; lay up what you get: One Truth felt in Meditation, is worth a World, &amp; it will make way for more. Sixthly, do ſomething that is equivalent and helping to it, at leaſt when you cannot ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly meditate: as reading of a good Book, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of your former and preſent life: [that is a thing of endleſs uſe] gathering up God's mercies, and your ſins in writing ſometimes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Prayer</hi> this is the bleſſed means of getting a poor ſoul to Heaven: And what an happineſs is it, that we may pray to God! Beſides Family-prayer, get ſome time for ſecret Prayer, daily leſs or more: Be telling God your heart alone; I know your oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and labours [the Lord break my heart for you] would not afford you that liberty that I [wretch] have: But do what you can; love the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002055_0011_0FBA87FC6A8F37C8"/>
duty, &amp; God will pity you, wherein you are juſtly, and by his providence [not your own negligence] hindred. And this is certain, He that hath an heart, ſhall never want time, or place to pray! Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to order your matters ſo, as you may have time for it: And if you could weekly have a piece of an Afternoon [as Saturday in the Afternoon an hour or two, or as God guides] ſet a part for ſecret and cloſe converſe with God by Meditation &amp; Prayer, thinking, writing, reading, examining, mourning before God; and do this conſtantly, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repent it: The buſineſs of Salvation is mainly carried on in ſecret between God &amp; a mans own ſoul: And by all means provide, that you may have your Sabbaths as free as poſſible all the day, and the Evening before &amp; after, for ſpiritual work: Ply God in ſuch ſeaſons as theſe be, and be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful if you get but any little ground of your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; miſeries: Go about your lawful occaſions, not as a liberty to the fleſh, [as to think that now my task of praying is over, now I may pleaſe my ſelf, and refreſh my heart in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] but as the ſervice of God, and as unto him, becauſe he bids you be thus employed: As when he bids me pray, I will pray with all my might; ſo I will work too, when he bids me work; and not do it to pleaſe my ſelf, [alas, if I conſider it, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Comfort is there in this evil World] but to pleaſe him: I will buſie &amp; employ my ſelf in this World, [becauſe he bids me] but my place &amp; my reſt ſhall be only in God, or no where: As Seamen
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002055_0012_0FBA87FDE4069478"/>
go to Sea, but build their houſes at Land; ſo I'le go into the World, but lay up my heart &amp; comfort and my whole ſupport in God! I will live <hi>in</hi> the World, but not <hi>upon</hi> it; I will live only upon God, &amp; have my Portion in him. And do not think that this ſorrow and ſenſe of ſin, and mourning after God, ſtands in a Monkiſh drooping ſullenneſs and ſadneſs, [tho' 'tis certain that by the ſadneſs of the Countenance the heart is made better; and one ſhould not give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to unneceſſary mirth, which is very poyſonful; nor purpoſely choak his ſpiritual ſorrows with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral delights:] But when you have ſeriouſly ſpent your time with God, and have left your heart with him, and he calls you to your occaſions; go about them with alacrity and chearfulneſs, ſo as you may diſpatch them comfortably; and carry amiably and delightfully to thoſe about you. And let your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows &amp; ſenſe of your Souls miſeries lie deep &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſo as you may recall them in their ſeaſon; when you come to pray, or be alone with God again; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have a conſtant habitual feeling of your ſelf, [and get as many good thoughts &amp; affections as you can, at all times] ſo as it may be livelily actual, eſpecially in your ſeaſons of attending upon God; and in them drive on the buſineſs of your Soul, as if there were no World; and as if there were nothing elſe to be minded but that. And if you find your heart gone when the ſeaſon of ſeeking God comes; then know that you have in ſome meaſure backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and forſaken God; and never leave till you have recovered it. Recall &amp; review often the chief ſins of your life that you can remember, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002055_0013_0FBA8800B3E08868"/>
gravate them before God in a ſpecial manner, [but have your times of confeſſing &amp; bewailing all the ſins that ever you can remember] &amp; think of what ſins or courſe it was that cauſed God to leave you, to this woful impenitency of heart, &amp; bewail them bitterly. One thing more I muſt add; Do not think it much to have ſome ſpecial ſeaſons of ſeeking God, beſides thoſe I have named. If you had a friend with whom you might now &amp; then ſpend a little time in conferring together, in opening your hearts, &amp; preſenting your unutterable groanings before God; it would be of excellent uſe: Such an one would greatly ſtrengthen, beſtead, and further you in your way to Heaven. Spend now &amp; then [as occaſions will permit] an hour [or ſo] with ſuch a friend more than ordinary, [ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a piece of a day, ſometimes a whole day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary faſt, in ſtriving &amp; wreſtling with God for everlaſting mercy.] And be much in quickning Conference, giving &amp; taking mutual encouragements and directions in the matters of Heaven! Oh! the life of God that falls into the hearts of the Godly, in and by gracious Heavenly Conference. Be open-hearted one to another, and ſtand one for another againſt the Devil &amp; all his Angels. Make it thus your buſineſs in theſe &amp; ſuch like ways, to provide for Eternity, while it is called to day, looking to Jeſus the Author and finiſher of your Faith. But you will ſay [it may be] and I ſpeak but what I have found in my own heart, [Dear — I deal plainly with you, as I know you would have me do, and therefore let me ſuppoſe it ſhould be ſaid] This is a tedious hard task, and my heart likes not to be ſo yoaked and toiled in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002055_0014_0FBA88052E6C6258"/>
ſuch things: I can take no pleaſure therein; and if I ſhould force my ſelf to it for a while, yet it would ſoon weary me: I have no heart to theſe things; it may be ſomething might be done in this way, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother might do ſomething: but I have no heart to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Wonder not at this, nor think the worſe of that courſe, becauſe your heart luſteth againſt it; but think the better of it. For, the better any thing is, and the more inſtrumental for our Salvation; the more it is oppoſed by our vile hearts, which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, &amp; conſequently to our own chief good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Confeſs to God this naughtineſs of your heart: beſeech him to help you againſt this Devil, to change your nature, and let this occaſion you to ſee &amp; loath the wickedneſs of your nature, and be inraged againſt it. <hi>The ſpirit that dwelleth in us lusteth unto envy, but he giveth more grace</hi>; Jam. 4.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Conſider what is the reaſon why this way ſeems ſo irkſome &amp; tedious and you have no heart to it? Is it not becauſe of inward blindneſs &amp; ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? becauſe you ſee not things as they be, nor the weight &amp; worth of them? It is an irkſome thing to a man to riſe out of his bed in the Night, when he lies warm, &amp; knows no danger, nor urgent occaſion to riſe: but if he awake, and ſee, his houſe on fire about his ears, he will make no demur about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but be glad he may riſe! Verily, one real glimpſe of the wrath of God burning about us, or of Eternity that is a coming; one real glimpſe of Gods Anger [lying upon our Souls] which is infinitely above the moſt awful apprehenſion of Man or Angel; Oh! this would make us skip at a time to pray in, at an
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002055_0015_0FBA880873B7D670"/>
hour to cry out to God for Mercy in, eſpecially if we might do it with any hope of being heard, and ſaved; as now we may. So that the reaſon why I have no heart to this courſe, is not becauſe there is want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſwade me, but becauſe I am blind; and I feel my blindneſs, I know that I do not ſee things as they be, and therefore I have good reaſon to be deaf, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of mine own blind ignorant heart, and to ſtrive by all means to ſee better; and in the mean time, to believe what I do not ſee.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> Offer violence therefore to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be reſolved in this point; let my heart ſay what it will, let Hell &amp; World be againſt me: My God I muſt have! my God I will have! I muſt get ſight of ſin, and faith in Chriſt Jeſus; I muſt make my Salvation ſure, or elſe I am undone for ever; and therefore pray I will, and follow God I will, in deſpite of the Devil: Unto him will I look, and [in ſuch a Caſe as this] on him will I wait, who giveth the ſame ſpirit of zeal, of indignation againſt ſin &amp; ſelf, as ſometimes was in holy <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he hewed <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces before the Lord in <hi>Gil<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

It will never repent us of any Prayer we have made, or tear we have wept, when we come there! Oh! follow not the guiſe of this ſecure World, that [in theſe days] is caſt into a dead ſleep: Many profeſs, but few know what it is to work out their own Salvation with fear &amp; trembling. It is another matter to be a Chriſtian indeed, than moſt make of it: And of thoſe that are ſincere &amp; lively, you ſee but their dark-ſide, you know not what they are in ſecret: Follow not example, but follow the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you the ſum of my thoughts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meaſure &amp; manner.
