            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AFRICA, though contiguous to the moſt commercial nations in the world, from whom one would naturally ſuppoſe it might derive ſome portion of refinement, is yet involved in a ſtate of the moſt deplorable barbariſm; and its very atmoſphere ſeems fraught with the moſt deteſtable depravity in human nature. Hence the ſpirit of diſcovery will ever be retarded, and travellers will have but little inducement to explore a region where they muſt be expoſed to ſuch a conſtant ſucceſſion of dangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since the deſtruction of Carthage, civilization ſeems not an attribute of the kingdom of Algiers, or of any of the ſtates of Barbary; and ſuch is the virulence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan antipathy to every thing that bears the name of Chriſtian, that their contiguous to Europe has perhaps tended to render them even more ferocious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In rendering an account of this famous regency who have ſo long ſignaliſed themſelves by their villany, the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032877_0005_0FF5A7B1742BE560"/>
author has av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ed himſelf of the moſt unexceptionable documents that could be procured, and perſpicuity inſtead of elegance and the complete developement of TRUTH have been his primary objects in the compilation of the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In its execution he has laboured under ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages. The firſt ſheets were put to preſs but a few days after the work was commenced, and before half the materials were collected. Great expedition was therefore indiſpenſibly requiſite, and this circumſtance will apologize for inaccuracies or deſultory arrangements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The work is, however, much more perfect than was originally contemplated. It exhibits a more circumſtantial detail of Algerine affairs of a recent date than was ever before publiſhed, and will we preſume afford the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can reader a tolerable idea of this famous piratical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, to which the United States have lately had the mortification of becoming tributory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It comprehends, beſides an ample account of the late American negociation, a variety of original obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the government, fortifications, cuſtoms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, puniſhments, religion, &amp;c. of the Algerines; and for this original matter the public are under conſiderable obligations to Mr. ISAAC BROOKS, a gentleman of veracity and intelligence, who was one of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate number who were ſubjected to the miſeries of this unparalleled ſervitude. The ſeverity of his afflictions
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032877_0005_0FF5A7B1742BE560"/>
has reduced him nearly to a ſtate of blindneſs; a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which afforded him ample leiſure for rendering a more minute account. In all his communications he has conſcientiouſly adhered to the truth, detected miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and related nothing but what will bear the teſt of the ſtricteſt examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſubject is particularly intereſting to the American people, and as the author has recorded events which are recent in the memory of all the captives, he has been ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly circumſpect in admitting nothing but matters of undiſputed authenticity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The laſt chapter is an abſtract or compendium of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Emanuel D'Aranda, "a poor ſoldier" as he was pleaſed to call himſelf, probably with a deſign to evade the payment of the exorbitant ſum demanded for the ranſom of all perſons of quality. We find, however, by a Latin eulogium in verſe prefixed to the French edition of his work, that he is called</hi> nobili conſultiſſimoque Emanueli D'Aranda, I. V. L.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe adventures were written above</hi> 150 <hi>years ago, and are now perhaps unknown in the literary world. In this work there is every appearance of candor, and the concurrence of various circumſtances corroborate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of its truth.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THERE is perhaps no problem in hiſtory ſo ſingular and unaccountable as the decadence of the power and ſplendor of the extenſive States of Barbary; which, while Carthage was in the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of its glory, were the ſeat of unrivalled great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and anterior ſo Rome itſelf in arts, in ſcience, in magnificence and refinement.</p>
               <p>The original inhabitants of this country, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt authentic hiſtorians, were the Phoenecians, and after them the Carthagenians, the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032877_0009_0FF5A7C5D6EF7D90"/>
formidable rivals of the Romans, and one of the moſt warlike nations of antiquity. The beginning of the Carthagenian hiſtory, like that of all other nations, is extremely obſcure and uncertain. In the 7th year of Pygmalion king of Tyre, his ſiſter Eliza, or Dido, is ſaid to have fled, with ſome of her companions and vaſſals, from the cruelty and avarice of her brother Sichaeus.</p>
               <p>She firſt touched at the iſland of Cyprus, where ſhe met with a prieſt of Jupiter, who was deſirous of attending her; to which ſhe conſented. At that time it was a cuſtom in the iſland of Cyprus, for the young women to go, on certain ſtated days before marriage, to the ſea-ſide, and there to look for ſtrangers, that might poſſibly arrive on their coaſts, in order to proſtitute themſelves for gain, that they might thereby acquire a dowry. Out of theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Tyrians ſelected eighty, whom they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with them, and then ſailed directly for the coaſt of Africa: and at laſt ſafely landed in the province called <hi>Africa Propria,</hi> not far from Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, a Phoenician city of great antiquity. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fable is, that the Phoenecians impoſed upon the Africans in the following manner: They deſired for their intended ſettlement, only as much ground as an ox's hide would encompaſs. This requeſt the Africans laughed at; but they were ſurprized when, upon granting it, they ſaw Eliza cut the hide into the ſmalleſt ſhreds, by which means it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded a large territory; in which ſhe built the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel called <hi>Byrſa.</hi> The learned, however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode this fable; but it is certain that the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians for many years paid an annual tribute to the Africans for the ground they poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>From this period commences the hiſtory of the Carthagenians, one of the moſt celebrated nations of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032877_0009_0FF5A7C5D6EF7D90"/>
antiquity, whoſe armies under the command of Hannibal, and other eminent generals, invaded the Roman territory, and threatened the downfal of Rome itſelf. But it is not the deſign of the preſent work to enter into a detail of this hiſtory, which would form of itſelf a large and intereſting volume.</p>
               <p>The city of Carthage, by order of the Roman Senate, was plundered and deſtroyed by the Roman army under AEmilianus. Before he proceeded to execute their order, he performed thoſe religious ceremonies which were required on ſuch occaſions. He firſt ſacrificed to the gods, and then cauſed a plough to be drawn round the walls of the city. After this, the towers, rampa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, walls, and all the works which the Carthagenians had raiſed in the courſe of many ages, were levelled with the ground. The edifices of this proud metropolis were ſet on fire, which conſumed them all, not a ſingle houſe eſcaping the flames. The ſire began in all quarters of the city at the ſame time, and continued to burn with incredible fury for the ſpace of ſeventeen days, at the end of which time the whole city was reduced to aſhes.</p>
               <p>Thus ſell Carthage, about 146 years before the birth of Chriſt. The treaſure carried off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

About twenty-four years after this event C. Gracchus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to rebuild it. Maxentius laid it in aſhes about the ſixth or ſeventh year of Conſtantine's reign, and Genſeric, king of the Vandals, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ook it in the year 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0 after Chriſt; but about a century afterwards it was re-annexed to the Roman empire by the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beliſarius. At laſt the Saracens, under Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet's ſucceſſors, towards the cloſe of the ſeventh
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032877_0010_0FF5A7D5B09B11C8"/>
century, ſo completely deſtroyed it, that there are now ſcarce any veſtiges of it remaining.</p>
               <p>After the reduction of the Carthagenian empire, the Romans for a long time maintained their power in Africa. But in the year 426, Bonifacius ſupreme governor of all the Roman dominions in this quarter, being compelled to revolt by the treachery of another general called Aetius, and finding himſelf unable to contend with the whole ſtrength of the Roman empire, invited Genſeric king of the Vandals to his aid; who thereupon abandoned his conqueſts in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and paſſed over into Africa. Bonifacius, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being ſoon after reconciled to his empreſs Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia, endeavoured in vain to perſuade the Vandals to retire. Hereupon a war enſued, in which the barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans proved victorious, and quickly over-ran all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man provinces in Africa. In the year 435, a peace was concluded; whereby Numidia and ſome other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were ceded to the Vandals, who ſoon after ſeized the reſt. But theſe barbarians did not long enjoy their conqueſts: for about the year 535, Beliſarus, the Greek emperor Juſtinian's general, drove them out, and annexed the provinces to the eaſtern empire.</p>
               <p>In the years 647, the Saracens, having conquered Meſopotamia, Egypt, Phoenicia, Arabia and Pales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, broke like a torrent into Africa, which they quickly ſubdued. This laſt revolution happened about the middle of the ſeventh century; and the Arabs continued maſters of the country till the year 1051. This year, one Abubeker-ben-Omar, or as the Spaniards call him, Abu-Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſien, an Arab of the Zinhagian tribe, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at the tyranny of thoſe deſpots, gathered, by the help of his marabouts or ſaints, a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful army of malcontents, in the ſouthern provinces of Numidia and Lybia. His followers were nick-named
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032877_0010_0FF5A7D5B09B11C8"/>
                  <hi>Marabites</hi> or <hi>Morabites;</hi> by the Spaniards <hi>Almoravides;</hi> probably from their being aſſembled principally by the ſaints, who were alſo called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabites. The khalif of Keyem's forces were at this time engaged in quelling other revolts in Syria, Meſopotamia, &amp;c. and the Arabs in Spain entered into the moſt bloody wars; ſo that Texeſien having nothing to fear from them, had all the ſucceſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e could wiſh againſt the Arabian cheyks or petty ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, whom he defeated in many battles, and at laſt drove them not only out of Numidia and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but out of all the weſtern parts, reducing the whole province of Tingitania under his dominion.</p>
               <p>Texeſien was ſucceeded by his ſon Yuſef, or Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, who was a warlike prince. In the beginning of his reign he laid the foundation of the city of Morocco, which he intended as the capital of his empire During the building of this city he ſent an embaſſy of marabouts to Tremeſen, a province of Algiers, for the purpoſe of reſtoring the Zeneti, a Mahometan ſect, to the true faith, as it was called. But the Zeneti contemning all overtures of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſſembled at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Amfa their capital, and murdered the ambaſſadors. Not content with this act of outrage and inſolence, they invaded Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's dominions with an army of 50,000 men.</p>
               <p>Joſeph juſtly exaſperated at theſe proceedings, levied an army with all poſſible expedition, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their territory, and deſtroyed all before him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire and ſword. The Zeneti inſtead of repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the invaſion, retreated towards Fez, where they expected aſſiſtance. But they were fatally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in this expectation; for the Fezz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s marched out againſt them, and meeting the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Zeneti, encumbered with their families and baggage, and ready to expire with hunger and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032877_0011_0FF5A7D736EDC868"/>
fell upon them and cut them all to pieces, except a few who were either drowned in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſwim acroſs a river, or daſhed to pieces from the precipices of rocks to which their enemy had purſued them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the march of Joſeph's army was marked by havoc and deſolation; the territory of the unhappy Zeneti was deſolated and reduced to a heap of ſmoking ruins. Their country was, however, ſoon after re-peopled by numerous immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations of Fezzans, who formed colonies under the protection of the reigning princes. According to the moſt authentic accounts it appears, that nearly a millon of men, women and children, of the Zeneti, loſt their lives in this murderous campaign.</p>
               <p>Joſeph, who was a prince of reſtleſs ambition, was not long diſpoſed for peace. He proclaimed war againſt the Fezzans whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e rendered tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and extended his conqueſts along the coaſts of the Mediterranean. His next attack was upon ſome Arabian cheyks, whom he purſued through the Lybian deſarts with ſuch fury, that neither the clifts of the moſt craggy rocks, nor ſecret receſſes, afforded them ſhelter from the vengeance of their purſuers. He reduced all their caſtles and fortreſſes, which till then were deemed impregnable, and the extent of his conqueſts ſpread general conſternation and grief through the other nations of Africa.</p>
               <p>Thus was the empire of the Morabites founded; but its exiſtance was of ſhort duration; for they were expelled from their new poſſeſſions in the 12th century by Mohavedin a marabout. This race of prieſts was ſubdued by Abdulac, governor of Fez, who was diveſted in his turn of his new conqueſta, in the 13th century, by the Shariffs of Haſcen, who
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032877_0011_0FF5A7D736EDC868"/>
were the deſcendants of thoſe Arabian princes whom Abu-Texe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ien had formerly conquered.</p>
               <p>The Shariffs divided their new acquired domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into ſeveral petty provinces, and the kingdom of Algiers was divided into Tremeſen, Tenez, Algiers Proper, and Bujeyah, for their greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt the invaſions of neighbouring princes. The four firſt monarchs laid ſo ſolid a foundation to their empire, by a judicious balance of power, that they continued in mutual peace and harmony for ſeveral ſucceeding centuries; but the king of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſen having violated ſome articles of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, Abul-Farez declared war againſt him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Tremeſen to a tributory kingdom.</p>
               <p>Abul-Farez did not long ſurvive this event. His kingdom was divided among his three ſons, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſcord and animoſity was the conſequence of this diviſion. Debilitated by theſe commotions, they became an eaſy conqueſt to the Spaniſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who tranſported a powerful fleet and army againſt Barbary, under the command of the Count of Navarre, in the year 1505. This commander ſoon completed the conqueſt of Oran, Bujeyah, and other important cities; which ſpread ſuch an alarm among the Algerines, that they invited the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Selim Eutemi, an Arabian prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for the proweſs of his arms. He came to their aſſiſtance with a large army of his moſt warlike ſubjects, attended by Zaphira his queen, and a ſon about twelve years of age. This force was not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſufficient to repel the incurſions of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; they effected the landing of an army the ſame year near the city of Algiers, and compelled the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis to become tributory to Spain. Nor could all the powers of Eutemi prevent the eſtabliſhment of a formidable Spaniſh garriſon of 200 men on the iſland,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032877_0012_0FF5A7D8C43DF7D0"/>
in front of the city, which did immenſe damage to the corſairs that attempted to ſail either in or out of the harbour.</p>
               <p>To this galling yoke the Algerines were obliged to ſubmit, and they continued tributory till the death of Ferdinand king of Spain, which happened in the year 1516. They were then determined to ſhake off their Spaniſh yoke, and in order to effectuate this deſign, they ſent an embaſſay to Aruch Barbaroſſa, to ſolicit his aſſiſtance againſt the Spaniards, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him an adequate compenſation for his ſervices.</p>
               <p>Barbaroſſa, ſo called from the red colour of his beard, was the ſon of a potter in the iſle of Leſbos, being prompted by a reſtleſs and enterpriſing ſpirit, he and his brother Hayradin forſook their father, and joined a crew of pirates. In this new profeſſion they ſoon diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and proweſs; they became maſters of a ſmall brigantine, and conducted their piracies with ſuch ſucceſs, that they ſoon aſſembled a fleet of twelve galleys, beſides many veſſels of ſmaller force. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa was admiral of this fleet, and Hayradin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in command. Their names ſoon became terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Straits of the Dardanelles to thoſe of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar. Their ambitious views extended with their power: being no leſs dreaded for their valour than their ſurpriſing ſucceſs, and while acting as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs, they aſſumed the ideas, and acquired the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes they had taken on the coaſts of Spain and Italy, into the ports of Barbary. The convenient ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe harbours, lying ſo near the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſtates of Chriſtendom, prompted them to the deſire of effecting an eſtabliſhment in the country of Barbary. An opportunity of accompliſhing this
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032877_0012_0FF5A7D8C43DF7D0"/>
project ſoon preſented itſelf, and they did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to paſs unimproved.</p>
               <p>Barbaroſſa received the Algerine embaſſy at Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gir, about 170 miles to the eaſtward of Algiers. He promiſed them every aſſiſtance in his power, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly exulted in ſo favourable an opportunity of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf maſter of their city. To carry his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns into execution, he fitted out a fleet of 18 gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, on board of which was embarked a powerful Turkiſh army, with a fine train of artillery, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply provided with military ſtores, and diſpatched them to the city of Algiers.</p>
               <p>Barbaroſſa in the mean time advanced toward the city by land, with an army of 800 Turks, 3000 Jigelites, and 2000 Mooriſh volunteers. But inſtead of taking the neareſt road to Algiers, he directed his courſe towards <hi>Sharſhel,</hi> (about 60 miles weſt of Algiers), where Haſſan, another famous corſair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command, had ſettled himſelf; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a meſſenger to his fleet, which by this time had anchored at Algiers, with orders to repair im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Sharſhel. His deſign by this march was to puniſh the treachery of Haſſan, who had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a conſiderable part of the fleet ſtationed there into his ſervice, and was upon the point of making a deſcent upon the Spaniſh coaſt. But he was much aſtoniſhed when he found Barbaroſſa was ſo near, and inſtantly prepared to oppoſe the approach of his army; but diſcovering the inefficiency of the force he had raiſed, he deemed it moſt prudent to adjuſt all differences by an amicable compromiſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had received a promiſe of pardon from his commander, ſurrendered himſelf a priſoner. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa, however, felt little diſpoſed to pardon the offence, and, by his command, Haſſan was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the preſence of the Turkiſh army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:032877_0013_0FF5A7DA4C40AC48"/>
After theſe events, he compelled the people of Sharſhel to acknowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> their ſovereign, and garriſoned a detachment of his army in that place for the ſecurity of his conqueſt. His army and fleet then directed their courſe towards Algiers. On the approach of his army he was met by Selim Eutemi, then regent of Algiers, attended by an immenſe concourſe of people from the city, who welcomed this celebrated conqueror, whom they deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, with every demonſtration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The day after his arrival he commenced his arrangements for the reduction of the Spaniards, who had been ſo long obnoxious to the Algerines. He ordered an entrenchment to be formed, and a battery raiſed againſt a Spaniſh fortreſs ſtationed upon a ſmall iſland in the harbour, about 500 yards from the city. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commencement of the intended ſiege of the iſland, he diſpatched a courier to the Spaniſh garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to inform them, that upon condition they would ſurrender the fortreſs they ſhould be well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Incenſed at this anſwer, Barbaroſſa commenced a briſk cannonade of the iſland, which was kept up, with little intermiſſion, for twenty days; but his

ordnance, conſiſting only of ſmall field pieces, made but little impreſſion upon the garriſon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the greater part of Barbaroſſa's army were rioting in every ſpecies of exceſs, and in their intercourſe with the citizens, committed every act of violence and atrocity. The Algerines were ſoon rouſed to a ſenſe of their danger, and Se im Eutemi, greatly exaſperated at the outrages of the Turks, entreated Barbaroſſa to withdraw his army from the city. But his ſole view now was the conqueſt of the city, and the more effectually to accompliſh his project, he reſolved to murder Eutemi in a private manner, and to proclaim himſelf king of Algiers.</p>
               <p>In order to execute his deſign, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Returning ſhortly after with his attendants, to the bath, he affected great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at the death of Eutemi, who, he alleged, had been drowned in a ſwoon.</p>
               <p>His death was, however, generally imputed to the cruelty of Barbaroſſa, and the citizens, who were panic ſtruck at this event, ſeemed more anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to ſcreen themſelves from oppreſſion, than to avenge the death of their ſovereign.</p>
               <p>Barbaroſſa now cauſed himſelf to be publicly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed king; and, as he rode along the ſtreets, his Turks and Moors exclaimed, "Long live king Aruch Barbaroſſa, the invincible king of Algiers, <hi>the choſen of God</hi> to deliver the people from the oppreſſion of the Chriſtians; and deſtruction to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032877_0014_0FF5A7EC8BE4E430"/>
ſo intimidated the inhabitants, already apprehenſive of a general maſſacre, that he was immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged king; and he ſummoned all the wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the citizens before him, to whom he promiſed honors and promotion if they would acquieſce in his ſovereignty. The unhappy princeſs Zaphira made an unſucceſsful attempt to ſtab him with a dagger; but not ſucceeding, it is ſaid ſhe poiſoned herſelf, to avoid the brutality of her new ſovereign.</p>
               <p>Barbaroſſa was no ſooner ſeated on the throne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Turks finding themſelves complete maſters of the town, indulged themſelves in every ſpecies of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and rapacity. Their enormities commenced with inſulting language, and the ſcene terminated in public plunder, murder, and the violation of women.</p>
               <p>In this extremity of inſult and miſery, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens held a ſecret correſpondence with the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Spaniſh garriſon; in which they inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that a plot was laid to maſſacre the whole Turkiſh army, ſolicited his aſſiſtance, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in conſequence, to become again tributory to the king of Spain.</p>
               <p>The commander readily acceded to their wiſhes, and the following plan was deviſed. A conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Moors, with daggers concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their clothes, were to enter the city for the purpoſe of trading; at the ſame time a number of galliots without the town were to be ſet on fire; and while the Turks were gone to extinguiſh the flames the gates of the city were to be ſhut upon them, and the Spaniards to be inſtantly landed from the garriſon to aſſiſt the citizens. But the vigilance
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032877_0014_0FF5A7EC8BE4E430"/>

The moment their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremonies commenced, Barbaroſſa ordered the doors of the Moſque to be ſhut, and the whole congregation to be mace priſoners: out of whom he ſelected twenty of the principal leaders of the faction, whom he conceived to be the moſt obnoxious, and by his orders they were inſtantly led into the ſtee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After the execution of this atrocious order their bodies were expoſed naked to public view, and their heads rolled about the city for ſeveral days, till at length becoming offenſive, they were buried in a dunghill. This event took place in the year 1517.</p>
               <p>While theſe things where tranſacting Selim Eute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi's ſon, apprehenſive of danger, fled to Oran, where he put himſelf under the protection of the marquis of Gomarez, general of that place, and laid before that nobleman a plan for putting the city of Algiers into the hands of the king of Spain.

But deplorable was the fate of this army; for they were no ſooner come within ſight of land, than a tempeſt aroſe, which raged with ſuch violence that the whole fleet was involved in deſtruction; many veſſels ran foul of each other; ſome were ſwallowed up by the ocean, and others daſhed to pieces againſt the rocks. Young Selim and Ximenes were never heard of again; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The pride of Barbaroſſa was greatly elated at this diſaſter, and though he had nothing to boaſt on this occaſion, yet his vanity and inſolence were now ſwelled to ſuch a degree, that he imagined himſelf invincible, and fancied that the very elements had conſpired to render him ſo. By this misfortune all hopes were loſt of expelling Barbaroſſa, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the heirs of Selim to the regency of Algiers.</p>
               <p>Barbaroſſa's tyranny became at length ſo inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, that the Arabians, who inhabited the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the country, implored the aſſiſtance of Hamidel Abdes king of Tenez to drive the Turks out of Algiers. That prince undertook to grant them all the aid in his power, upon condition that the Arabians would agree to ſettle the kingdom on himſelf and his deſcendants.</p>
               <p>This propoſal was readily accepted, and Hami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Abdes immediately ſet out at the head of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 10,000 Moors. He began his march in June 1517, and, upon his entering the Algerine domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, was joined by all the Arabians in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who openly avowed themſelves the enemies of the tyrant. Barbaroſſa, gaining intelligence of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032877_0015_0FF5A7EE143CB1D0"/>
approach of Hamidel Abdes, raiſed an army of 1000 Turkiſh muſqueteers, and 500 Granada Moors, and conſigning the government of Algiers to the care of his brother Hayradin, came out with this inconſiderable force to meet Hamidel Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. After a march of about twelve leagues to the weſtward of Algiers, Barbaroſſa came up with him, and a deſperate engagement commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Victory was for ſome time d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the Turks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſciplined to the uſe of fire arms, diſplayed great ſuperiority, and the enemy having only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and javelins, began to give way. Their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army was totally defeated, and Barbaroſſa purſued them to the gates of their capital; of which he eaſily made himſelf maſter. Hamidel Abdes ſtill retreated towards mount Atlas, and the unfortunate city, without the leaſt reſiſtance, fell a victim to every ſpecies of violence and brutality, and Barbaroſſa was proclaimed king.</p>
               <p>The fame of this deciſive victory was ſoon ſpread over all Africa, and no ſooner had Barbaroſſa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſter of Tenez, than he received an embaſſy from the inhabitants of Tremeſen, (about 50 leagues weſtward), who were diſſatisfied with the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their king, principally on account of his having dethroned his nephew; whom he obliged to fly to Oran; and they offered to inveſt Barbaroſſa even with the ſovereignty, in caſe he accepted their propoſal. An application of this nature, as may well be imagined, was highly pleaſing to him, and he was determined not to loſe ſo favourable an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of extending his conqueſts. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this embaſſay he wrote to his brother Hayradin to ſend him forward ſome pieces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and military ſtores; and upon the receipt

               <p>Two days after, he made a triumphal entry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

As ſoon as he was in poſſeſſion of the city, he began to tyrannize as uſual; but his new ſubjects ſoon convinced him they were not ſo paſſive as the citizens of Algiers. Suſpicious of oppoſition to his adminiſtration in the government of Tremeſen, and apprehenſive of a precarious reign in conſequence of his enormities, he entered into an alliance with Muley Hamet king of Fez, each ſtipulating to render each other mutual aſſiſtance againſt their enemies. After which he took care, for the purpoſe of greater ſecurity, to garriſon Tremeſen with troops, as well as the reſt of the cities in his kingdom. ſome of theſe, however, ſoon after revolted; upon which he ſent one of his corſairs, named Eſcander, no leſs ferocious than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to reduce them. Iſaac Benijoub in particular, the commander of Tenez, became extremely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious in his adminiſtration; which induced a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032877_0016_0FF5A7EF9F699C58"/>
revolt among the Moors of the country, and he fell a victim to their fury.</p>
               <p>The Tremeſenians ſoon repented ſincerely that they had courted the aſſiſtance of ſuch a tyrant; and held conſultations on the moſt effectual means of expelling him from their city, and reſtoring Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen Men, their lawful prince. But their cabals were ſoon diſcovered, and a great number of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators were maſſacred in the moſt cruel manner.</p>
               <p>Abuchen Men, who had fortunately eſcaped to Oran, was taken under the protection of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Gomarez, who ſent immediate advice of it to Charles V. then lately arrived in Spain, with a powerful fleet and army, and gave him a particular account of the tranſactions that had taken place in Africa. Charles immediately ordered an army of 10,000 men to be raiſed and put under the command of Gomarez, and the guidance of Abuchen Men; who began their march towards Tremeſen; and in their way were joined by prince Selim with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Arabs and Moors. Their firſt reſolve was to attack the important fortreſs of Cala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tremeſen and Algiers, and commanded by the corſair Eſcander, at the head of about 300 Turks. They inveſted it cloſely on all ſides, with a deſign to decoy Barbaroſſa from Tremeſen to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and to afford the Tremeſenians an opportunity of ſhutting their gates againſt him. But the tyrant kept cloſe lodged in his capital, embarraſſed by the fears of a general revolt, and the dangerous delays of the king of Fez, who had neglected to ſend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the auxiliaries he had promiſed. The garriſon of Calau in the mean time made a vigorous defence, and in a fortie they made in the night killed 300 Spaniards. This encouraged them to make a ſecond ſally; but they were repulſed with great loſs, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032877_0017_0FF5A7F128A92A18"/>
Eſcander himſelf was wounded. The garriſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hold out any longer, capitulated upon honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms; but they were all maſſacred by the Arabians except ſixteen, who clung cloſe to the ſtirrups of the king and the Spaniſh general.</p>
               <p>After the reduction of this fortreſs they began their march to lay ſiege to Tremeſen. Barbaroſſa receiving intelligence of their approach, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to wait no longer for reinforcements from the king of Fez, and came out of his capital with a troop of 1500 Turks and 5000 Mooriſh horſe, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the progreſs of the Spaniards. But gaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the ſuperiority of their force, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils adviſed him to return and fortify himſelf in his capital. This advice however came too late. The inhabitants of Tremeſen had ſhut their gates againſt him, and were reſolved to open them only to their lawful ſovereign, when he appeared. In this extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity he deemed it moſt prudent to retire to the citadel, and defend himſelf there till he could find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſtealing away with his men and treaſure. Here he made a vigorous defence, but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions failing, he effected his eſcape by night through a ſubterraneous paſſage, which he had cauſed to be dug for that purpoſe, and carried off all his immenſe treaſures with him. But his flight was ſoon diſcovered, and Gomarez ordered an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate purſuit. Barbaroſſa finding himſelf ſo cloſely purſued, cauſed a conſiderable quantity of money, plate, jewels, &amp;c. to be ſcattered along the rout he had taken, in order to amuſe the enemy, and to retard their purſuit in gathering it up, while he effected the paſſage of the river Fluexda, But this ſtratagem, through the vigilance of the Spaniſh commander, did not ſucceed; for Gomarez, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his men to march on, without waiting to gather
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032877_0017_0FF5A7F128A9DA18"/>
up the ſpoils, and they ſoon overtook the fugitive on the banks of the river, about eight leagues from Tremeſen. Barbaroſſa had juſt croſſed the river with his vanguard; and the Spaniſh army furiouſly attacked his rear on the other ſide, and cut them all to pieces. Gomarez then croſſed the river, and a bloody engagement enſued, in which his Turks fought with the greateſt fury. But being overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by numbers, the tyrant fell, and 1500 Turks were left dead upon the field of battle.</p>
               <p>Thus terminated the career of this powerful ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who died in the year 1519, in the 44th year of his age; four years after he had aſpired to the royal title of <hi>

               <p>After this important victory Gomarez returned in triumph to Tremeſen, amidſt the ſhouts of the multitude, who came out to meet him, with the head of Barbaroſſa carried upon the point of a ſpear; and Abuchen Men was proclaimed king, to the great joy of all the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>About fourteen days after the battle, the king of Fez made his appearance at the head of 20,000 Mooriſh horſe; but hearing of Barbaroſſa's defeat, he retired with all poſſible expedition, to avoid an attack from the enemy.

               <p>THE news of Barbaroſſa's death ſpread the utmoſt conſternation among the Turks at Algiers; and his brother Hayradin was immediately proclaimed king. The Spaniſh commander very imprudently neglected to follow up his victories at this auſpicious juncture, and ſent back the emperor's forces without attempting the reduction of Algiers. Hayradin in his preſent critical ſituation, apprehenſive of a Spaniſh invaſion, and dreading the conſequences of his tyrany and that of his officers, ſent an embaſſy to ſolicit the protection of the Grand Signior; which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted. He was appointed Baſhaw or Viceroy of Algiers, and received ſuch conſiderable rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements

In conſequence of theſe reinforcements, his armies were further aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by ſuch numbers of Turks that continually reſorted to him, that he was enabled not only to keep the Moors and Arabs in ſubjection at home, but to annoy the Chriſtians at ſea.</p>
               <p>His next ſtep was the reduction of the Spaniſh fortreſs in front of the city, which was a great nuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the metropolis, and of which the Spaniards held poſſeſſion till the year 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032877_0019_0FF5A8021D6E4958"/>
brought out, and at the command of Vargas, were both hanged upon an eminence in ſight of the city. Hayradin was greatly exaſperated at the ſight, and was reſolved upon the immediate reduction of the fort. Whereupon he diſpatched a renegado to the fort to acquaint Vargas, that if he would deliver up the garriſon, he and his men ſhould be well treated, and ſent to Spain; but if not, they ſhould all be put to death. Vargas returned for anſwer, that he would hold out to the laſt extremity. Haraydin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt of this anſwer, raiſed a formidable battery, and commenced a vigorous cannonade upon the iſland, which continued for fifteen days and nights without intermiſſion; at the end of which time almoſt all the walls of the garriſon were bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered down, and the greateſt part of the beſieged were killed. Hayradin now ordered a deſcent to be made upon the iſland, which was effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition, and the whole garriſon were made priſoners. Vargas ſuffered impriſonment for about three months, at the end of which time he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into the preſence of Hayradin, and baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed to death.</p>
               <p>After this event he ſet about building a ſtrong mole from the iſland to the city, for the protection of his ſhips, and in this he employed 30,000 Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſlaves, who were engaged in this work for three years without intermiſſion, in which time the work was completed. He then cauſed the fort ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Spaniards to be repaired, and placed a ſtrong garriſon in it to prevent foreign veſſels from entering the harbour without giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of themſelves. By theſe two important works, Hayradin ſoon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but alſo by the maritime
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032877_0019_0FF5A8021D6E4958"/>
Chriſtian powers, eſpecially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the Grand Signior with his ſucceſs, and obtained from him a freſh ſupply of money, by which he was enabled to build a ſtronger fort, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of the enemy. All theſe have ſince received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occaſion for them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Sultan, either out of a ſenſe of the great ſervices Hayradin had done, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps out of jealouſy leſt he ſhould make himſelf independent, raiſed Hayradin to the dignity of baſhaw of the empire, and appointed Haſtan Aga, a Sardinian renegado, an intrepid warrior, and an experienced officer, to ſucceed him as baſhaw of Algiers. Haſſan had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of his new government, than he began to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his ravages on the Spaniſh coaſt with greater fury than ever; extending them to the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtates, and other parts of Italy. But Pope Paul III. being alarmed at this, exhorted the emperor Charles V. to ſend a powerful fleet to ſuppreſs theſe frequent and cruel piracies; and, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting to render the enterpriſe ſucceſsful, a bull was publiſhed by his holineſs, wherein a plenary abſolution of ſins, and the crown of martyrdom, were promiſed to all thoſe who either fell in battle, or were made ſlaves. The emperor on his part needed no ſpur; and therefore ſet ſail at the head of a powerful fleet, conſiſting of 120 ſhips and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 choſen troops, an immenſe quantity of money, arms, amunition, &amp;c. In this expedition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young nobility and gentry attended as volunteers, and among theſe many knights of Malta, ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032877_0020_0FF5A803A6F075C8"/>
for their valour againſt the enemies of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles in his expedition, and the wives and daughters of the officers and ſoldiers followed them with a deſign to ſettle in Barbary after the conqueſt was completed. All theſe meeting with a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wind, ſoon appeared before Algiers: every ſhip diſplaying the Spaniſh colours on the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this prodigious armament the Algerines were thrown into the utmoſt conſternation. The city was ſurrounded only by a wall with ſcarce any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. The whole garriſon conſiſted of 800 Turks and 6000 Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly diſciplined and acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Spaniards landed without oppoſition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the courſe of a ſpring which ſupplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs, Haſſan receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſummons to ſurrender at diſcretion, on pain of being put to the ſword with all the garriſon. The herald was ordered to extol the vaſt power of the emperor both by ſea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Chriſtian religion. But to this Haſſan only replied, that he muſt be a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that would pretend to adviſe an enemy, and that the adviſed muſt ſtill act more madly who would take counſel of ſuch an adviſor. He was, however, on the point of ſurrendering the city, when advice was brought him, that the forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the weſtern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032877_0020_0FF5A803A6F075C8"/>
to defend it to the utmoſt. Charles, in the mean time, reſolving upon a general aſſault, kept a conſtant firing upon the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garriſon, he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as already in his hands. But while the <hi>divan,</hi> or Algerine ſenate, were deliberating upon the moſt proper means of obtaining an honorable capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, a mad prophet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the aſſembly, and foretold the ſpeedy deſtruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was ſoon verified in a moſt ſurpriſing and unexpected manner: for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful ſtorm of wind, rain, and hail, aroſe from the north, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with violent ſhocks of earthquakes, and a diſmal univerſal darkneſs both by ſea and land; ſo that the ſun, moon and elements ſeemed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine together for the deſtruction of the Spaniards. In one night, ſome ſay in leſs than half an hour, 86 ſhips and 15 galleys were deſtroyed, with all their crews and military ſtores; by which the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or ſhore was deprived of all means of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Their camp alſo, which ſpread itſelf along the plain under the fort, was laid quite under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the torrents which deſcended from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into ſome better ſituation, were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the Moors and Arabs; while ſeveral gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and other veſſels, endeavouring to gain ſome neighbouring creek along the coaſts, were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately plundered, and their crews maſſacred by the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The next morning Charles beheld the ſea co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the fragments of ſhips, and the bodies of men, horſes and other creatures ſwimming on

the waves; at which he was ſo diſheartened that he abandoned his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, and marched at the head of his army, though in no ſmall diſorder, towards cape <hi>Malabux,</hi> in order to reimbark in thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which had weathered out the ſtorm. But Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, who had watched his motions, allowed him juſt time enough to get to the ſhore, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> he ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out and attacked the Spaniards in the midſt of their hurry and confuſion to get into their ſhips, killing great numbers, and bringing away a ſtill greater number of captives; after which he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in triumph to Algiers, where he celebrated, with great rejoicings, his happy deliverance from ſuch diſtreſs and danger<note n="*" place="bottom">Some of the old Engliſh hiſtorians inform us, that this deſtruction of the Spaniards was occaſioned by <hi>witch-craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Soon after this the prophet <hi>Yuſef,</hi> who had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the deſtruction of the Spaniards, was not only declared the deliverer of his country, but had a conſiderable gratuity decreed him, with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of exerciſing his prophetic function unmoleſted. It was not long, however, before the marabouts, and ſome interpreters of the law, made a ſtrong oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt him; remonſtrating to the baſhaw, how ridiculous and ſcandalous it was to the nation, to aſcribe their deliverance to a poor fortune-teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of a ſaint of their own profeſſion. But though the baſhaw and his divan ſeemed, out of policy, to give into this laſt notion, yet the impreſſion which Yuſef's predictions, and their late accompliſhments, had made upon the minds of the common people, proved too ſtrong to be eradicated; and the ſpirit of divination and conjuring has ſince got into ſuch credit among them, that not only their great ſtates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032877_0021_0FF5A8052F60024B0"/>
but their prieſts, marabouts, and ſantoons, have applied themſelves to that ſtudy, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it with the name of <hi>Mahomet's Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The unhappy Spaniards had ſcarce reached their ſhips, when they were attacked by a freſh ſtorm, in which ſeveral more of them periſhed; one ſhip in particular, containing 700 ſoldiers, beſides ſailors, ſunk in the emperor's ſight, without a poſſibility of ſaving a ſingle man. At length, with much labour, they reached the port of <hi>Bujeyah,</hi> at that time poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Spaniards, whither Haſſan king of Tunis ſoon after repaired, with a ſupply of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the emperor, who received him graciouſly, with freſh aſſurances of his favour and protection. Here he diſmiſſed the few remains of the Malteſe knights and their forces, who embarked in three ſhattered galleys, and with much difficulty and danger reached their own country. Charles himſelf ſtaid no longer than till the 16th of November, when he ſailed for Carthagena, and reached it on the 25th of the ſame month. In this unfortunate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition upwards of 120 ſhips and galleys were loſt, above 300 colonels and other land and ſea officers, 8000 ſoldiers and mariners, beſides thoſe deſtroyed by the enemy on the reimbarkation, or drowned in the laſt ſtorm. The number of priſoners was ſo great, that the Algerines ſold ſome of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.</p>
               <p>Haſſan, elated with this victory, in which he had very little ſhare, undertook an expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king of Tremeſen, who, being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the aſſiſtance of the Spaniards, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to procure a peace by paying a vaſt ſum of money, and becoming tributory to him. The baſhaw returned to Algiers, laden with riches; and ſoon after died of a fever, in the 66th year of his age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:032877_0022_0FF5A816C857C5D0"/>
From this time the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines in any conſiderable degree. In 1555, they loſt the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salha Rais, Haſſan's ſucceſſor; who next year ſet out on a new expedition, which he kept a ſecret, but was ſuſpected to be intended againſt Oran: but he was ſcarcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged violently in the city, broke out in his groin, and carried him off in 24 hours.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his death the Algerine ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery choſe a Corſican renegado, Haſſan Corſo, in his room, till they ſhould receive further orders from the Porte. He did not accept the baſhawſhip without a good deal of difficulty; but immediately proſecuted the intended expedition to Oran, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching a meſſenger to acquaint the Porte with what had happened. They had hardly begun their hoſtilities againſt the place, when orders came from the Porte, expreſsly forbidding Haſſan Corſo to begin the ſiege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to raiſe it immediately. This news was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great grief by the whole fleet and army, as they thought themſelves ſure of ſucceſs, the garriſon being at that time very weak. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as they dared not diſobey, the ſiege was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately raiſed.</p>
               <p>Corſo had hardly enjoyed the dignity four months, before news came, that eight galleys were bringing a new baſhaw to ſucceed him; one Tekel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, a principal Turk of the Grand Signior's court; upon which the Algerines unanimouſly reſolved not to admit him. By the treachery of the Levantine ſoldiers, however, he was admitted at laſt, and the unfortunate Corſo was thrown over a wall, in which a number of iron hooks were fixed; one of which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032877_0022_0FF5A816C857C5D0"/>
caught the ribs of his right ſide, and he hung three days in the moſt exquiſite torture before he expired.</p>
               <p>Tekelli was no ſooner entered upon his new government, than he behaved with ſuch cruelty, that he was aſſaſſinated, even under the dome of a ſaint, by Yuſef Calabres, the favorite renegado of Haſſan Corſo; who for this ſervice was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly choſen baſhaw, but died of the plague ſix days after his election.</p>
               <p>Yuſef was ſucceeded by Haſſan the ſon of Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin, who had been formerly recalled from his baſhawſhip, when he was ſucceeded by Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ha Rais; and now had got the good fortune to get himſelf reinſtated in his employment. Immediately on his arrival, he engaged in a war with the Arabs, by whom he was defeated with great loſs. The next year, the Spaniards undertook an expedition againſt Moſtagan, under the command of the count d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candela; but were utterly defeated, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf killed, and 12,000 taken priſoners. This diſaſter was owing to the inconſiderate raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or rather madneſs, of the commander; which was ſo great, that after finding it impoſſible to rally his ſcattered forces, he ruſhed, ſword in hand, into the thickeſt of the enemy's ranks, at the head of a ſmall number of men, crying out, <hi>"St. Jago! St. Jago! the victory is ours, the enemy is defeated;"</hi> ſoon after which he was thrown from his horſe, and trampled to death.</p>
               <p>Haſſan having had the misfortune to diſpleaſe his ſubjects, by allowing the mountaineers of Cuco to buy ammunition at Algiers, was ſent in irons to Conſtantinople, while the aga of the Janiſaries, and general of the land forces, ſupplied his place. Haſſan eaſily found means to clear himſelf; but a new baſhaw was appointed, called Achmet; who
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032877_0023_0FF5A81866D46E00"/>
was no ſooner arrived, than he ſent the two deputy-baſhaws to Conſtantinople, where their heads were ſtruck off. Achmet was a man of ſuch inſatiable avarice, that upon his arrival at Algiers, all ranks of people came in ſhoals to make him preſents; which he the more greedily accepted, as he had bought his dignity by the money he had amaſſed while head gardener to the Sultan. He enjoyed it, however, only four months; and after his death, the ſtate was governed other four months by his lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant; when Haſſan was a third time ſent viceroy to Algiers, where he was received with the greateſt demonſtrations of joy.</p>
               <p>The firſt enterpriſe in which Haſſan engaged, was the ſiege of Marſalquiver, ſituated near the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Oran, which he deſigned to inveſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after. The army employed in this ſiege con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 26,000 foot and 10,000 horſe, beſides which he had a fleet conſiſting of 32 galleys and galliots, together with three French veſſels laden with biſcuit, oil, and other proviſions. The city was defended by Don Martin de Cordova, brother of the count d'Alcandela, who had been taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the battle where that nobleman was killed, but had obtained his liberty from the Algerines with immenſe ſums, and now made a moſt gallant defence againſt the Turks. The city was attacked with the utmoſt fury by ſea and land, and ſeveral breaches were made in the walls. The Turkiſh ſtandards were ſeveral times planted on the walls, and as often diſlodged; but the place muſt in the end have ſubmitted, had not Haſſan been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to raiſe the ſiege in haſte, on the news that the famous Genoeſe admiral Doria was approaching with conſiderable ſuccours from Italy. The fleet accordingly arrived ſoon after; but miſſing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032877_0023_0FF5A81866D46E00"/>
galleys, bore away for Pennon de Velez, where they were ſhamefully repulſed by a handful of Turks who garriſoned that place; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was taken the following year.</p>
               <p>In 1567, Haſſan was again recalled to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, where he died three years after. He was ſucceeded by Mahomet, who gained the love of the Algerines by ſeveral public ſpirited actions. He incorporated the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aniſaries and Levantine Turks together, and by that means put an end to their diſſentions, which laid the foundation of the Algerine independency on the Porte. He likewiſe added ſome conſiderable fortifications to the city and caſtle, which he deſigned to render impregnable.</p>
               <p>But while he was thus ſtudying the intereſt of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, one John Gaſcon, a bold Spaniſh adventurer, formed a deſign of ſurpriſing the whole piratic navy in the bay, and ſetting them on fire in the night time, when they lay defenceleſs, and in their firſt ſleep. For this he had not only the permiſſion of king Philip II. but was furniſhed by him with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per veſſels, mariners, and fire-works, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his plot. With theſe he ſet ſail for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers in the beginning of October, the moſt proper ſeaſon, when moſt, if not all the ſhips lay at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor there, and eaſily ſailed near enough, unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to view their manner of riding, in order to ſurpriſe them at a time when the greater part of their crews were diſperſed in their quarters. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole-gate, and diſperſed his men with their fire-works; but to their great ſurpriſe, they found them ſo ill mixed, that they could not with all their art make them take fire. In the mean time, Gaſcon took it into his head, by way of bravado, to go to the mole-gate, and give three loud knocks at it with
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032877_0024_0FF5A819ED776F50"/>
the pommel of his dagger, and to leave it fixed in the gate by its point, that the Algerines might have cauſe to remember him. This he had the good fortune to do without meeting any diſturbance or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but it was not ſo with his men; for no ſooner did they find their endeavours fruſtrated, than they made ſuch a buſtle as quickly alarmed the guard poſted on the adjacent baſtion, from which the uproar quickly ſpread itſelf through the whole garriſon. Gaſcon now finding himſelf in the utmoſt danger, ſailed away with all poſſible haſte; but was purſued, overtaken, and brought back a priſoner to Mahomet; who no ſooner got him into his power, than he immediately cauſed a gibbet of conſiderable height to be erected on the ſpot where Gaſcon had landed, ordering him to be hoiſted up, and hung by the feet to a hook, that he might die in extreme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to ſhow his reſentment and contempt of the king his maſter, he ordered his commiſſion to be tied to his toes. He had not, however, hung long in that ſtate, when the captain who took him, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a number of other corſairs, interceded ſo ſtrongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of a Chriſtian ſurgeon; but two days after, ſome Moors reporting that it was the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines durſt not hurt a hair of Gaſcon's head, the unfortunate Spaniard was hoiſted up by a pully to the top of the execution-wall, and from thence thrown down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hooks which were faſtened in it, one of which caught him by the ribs as he fell, and gave him ſuch a wound that he expired without a groan.—Thus ended the expedition of John Gaſcon, which has procured him a place among the Spaniſh martyrs; while on the other hand, the Algerines look upon his diſappointment to have been miraculous, and

owing to the efficacious protection of the powerful ſaint <hi>Sidi Outededda,</hi> whoſe prayers had raiſed ſuch a terrible ſtorm againſt the Spaniſh fleet.</p>
               <p>Mahomet being ſoon after recalled, was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the famous renegado <hi>Ocha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The kingdom of Algiers continued to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned till the beginning of the ſeventeenth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by viceroys, or baſhaws appointed by the Porte; concerning whom we find nothing very remarkable, further than that their avarice and tyranny was intolerable both to the Algerines and the Turks themſelves. At laſt the Turkiſh Janiſaries and militia becoming powerful enough to ſuppreſs the tyrannic ſway of theſe baſhaws, and the people being almoſt exhauſted by the heavy taxes laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the former reſolved to depoſe theſe petty tyrants, and ſet up ſome officers of their own at the head of government.

                  </gap> to ſee that the revenue of the kingdom was rightly applied, in keeping up its forces complete, and ſupplying all other exigencies of the ſtate, without any farther charge or trouble to the Porte than that of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it protection. On their part, they engaged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to acknowledge the Grand Signiors as their ſovereigns, and to pay them their uſual allegiance and tribute, to reſpect their baſhaws, and even to lodge and maintain them and their retinue, in a manner ſuitable to their dignity, at their own charge. The baſhaws, however, were for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be excluded from aſſiſting at any but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral divans, unleſs invited to it; and from having the liberty of voting in them, unleſs when their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was aſked, or the intereſt of the Porte was likely to ſuffer by their ſilence. All other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, which related to the government of Algiers, were to be wholly left under the direction of the dey and his divan.</p>
               <p>Theſe propoſals having been accepted by the Porte, the deputies returned highly ſatisfied; and having notified their new privileges, the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van immediately proceeded to the election of a dey from among themſelves. They compiled a new code of laws, and made ſeveral regulations for the better ſupport and maintenance of this new form of government, to the obſervation of which they obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all their ſubjects to ſwear; and the militia, navy, commerce, &amp;c. were all ſettled pretty near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the footing upon which they now ſtand: though the ſubſequent altercations that frequently happened between the baſhaws and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, cauſed ſuch frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints

and diſcontents at the Ottoman court, as made them frequently repent their compliance.</p>
               <p>In the year 1601, the Spaniards, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Doria the Genoeſe admiral, made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt upon Algiers, in which they were more fortunate than uſual, their fleet being only driven back by contrary winds, ſo that they came off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs. In 1609, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able ſailors, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly contributed to render the Algerine fleet ſo formidable as it became ſoon after; though it is probable the frequent attempts made on their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would alſo induce them to increaſe their fleet. In 1616 their fleet conſiſted of 40 ſail of ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 200 and 400 tons, their admiral 500 tons. It was divided into two ſquadrons, one of 18 ſail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the port of Malaga; and the other at the Cape of Santa Maria, between Liſbon and Seville; both of which fell foul of all Chriſtian ſhips, both French and Engliſh, with whom they pretended to be in friendſhip, as well as Spaniards and Portugueſe, with whom they were at war.</p>
               <p>The Algerines now became very formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were moſt in danger, and leaſt able to cope with them, ſolicited the aſſiſtance of England, the pope, and other ſtates. The French, however, were the firſt who dared to ſhew their reſentment of the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behaviour of theſe miſcreants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was ſent againſt them with a fleet of 50 men of war, who defeated their fleet, took two of their veſſels, while their admiral ſunk his own ſhip and crew, rather than fall into his enemies hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:032877_0026_0FF5A82A29D13728"/>
In 1620, a ſquadron of Engliſh men of war was ſent againſt Algiers, under the command of Sir Robert Manſel; but of this expedition we have no other account, than that it returned without doing any thing; and the Algerines becoming more and more inſolent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only accepted; to whom in 1625, they ſent a propoſal, directed to the prince of Orange, that in caſe they would fit out 20 ſail of ſhips the following year, upon any good ſervice againſt the Spaniards, they would join them with 60 ſail of their own.</p>
               <p>The next year, the <hi>Coulolies,</hi> or <hi>Cologlies,</hi> (the children of ſuch Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers), who were enrolled in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, having ſeized on the citadel, had well nigh made themſelves maſters of the city; but were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible ſlaughter. Many ſcores of them were executed, and their heads thrown in heaps upon the city walls, without the eaſtern gate. Part of the citadel was blown up; and the remaining Coulolies were diſmiſſed from the militia, to which they were not again admitted till long after.</p>
               <p>In 1623, the Algerines and other ſtates of Barbary threw off their dependence on the Porte altogether, and ſet up for themſelves. What gave occaſion to this was the 25 years truce which Sultan Amurath IV. was obliged to make with the emperor Ferdinand II. to prevent his being overmatched by carrying on a war againſt him and the Sophi of Perſia at the ſame time. As this put a ſtop to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and reſolved that whoever deſired to be at peace with them, muſt, diſtinctly and ſeparately, apply to their government. No ſooner was this reſolution
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032877_0026_0FF5A82A29D13728"/>
adopted, than the Algerines began to make prizes of ſeveral merchant ſhips belonging to powers at peace with the Porte. Nay, having ſeized a Dutch ſhip and poleacre at Scanderoon, they ventured on ſhore; and finding the town abandoned by the Turkiſh aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and warehouſe and ſet them on fire.</p>
               <p>About this time Lewis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coaſts, inſtead of one formerly built by the Marſilians, and which they had demoliſhed. This, after ſome difficulty, he accompliſhed; and it was called the <hi>Baſtion of France:</hi> but the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being afterwards found inconvenient, the French purchaſed the port of La Calle, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was ſo much embarraſſed with the Perſian war, that there was no leiſure to check the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizir and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a ſhare of their prizes, which were very conſiderable. However, for form's ſake, a ſevere reprimand, accompanied with threats, was ſent them; to which they replied, that "theſe depredations deſerved to be indulged to them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were the only bulwark againſt the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian powers, eſpecially againſt the Spaniards, the ſworn enemies of the Moſlem name. Adding, "that if they ſhould pay a punctilious regard to all that would purchaſe peace, or liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but ſet fire to all their ſhipping, and turn camel-drivers for a livelihood."</p>
               <p>In the year 1635, four young brothers of a good family in France, entered into an undertaking ſo deſperate, that perhaps the annals of knight-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032877_0027_0FF5A82BDD04F480"/>
can ſcarcely furniſh a parallel.—This was no leſs than to retort the piracies of the Algerines upon themſelves; and as they indiſcriminately took the ſhips of all nations, ſo were theſe heroes indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to take the ſhips belonging to Algiers; and this with a ſmall frigate of ten guns!—In this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous undertaking 100 volunteers embarked; a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſe commiſſion was procured, together with an able maſter and 36 mariners. They had the good fortune, on their firſt ſetting out, to take a ſhip laden with wine, on the Spaniſh coaſt: with which they were ſo much elated, that three days after they madly encountered two large Algerine corſairs, one of 20 and the other of 24 guns, both well manned, and commanded by able officers. Theſe two large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels having got the ſmall frigate between them, racked her ſo furiouſly with broadſides, that they ſoon carried away her mainmaſt: notwithſtanding which, the French made ſo deſperate a reſiſtance, that the pirates were not able to take them, till the noiſe of their firing brought up five more Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines; when the French veſſel, being almoſt torn to pieces, was boarded and taken. The young knight-errants were puniſhed for their teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by a dreadful captivity, from which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed themſelves in 1642, at the price of 6000 dollars.</p>

A Dutch merchantman defeats a number of their galleys. Lewis XIV. makes preparations againſt Algiers. The city bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barded and ſet on fire by the French.

The Turkiſh baſhaw expelled. The Spaniſh expedition of 1775.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Algerines continued to proſecute their pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with impunity, to the terror and diſgrace of the European powers, till the year 1652; when a French fleet being accidently driven into Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of all the captives of his nation, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. This being refuſed, the Frenchman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony, carried off the Turkiſh viceroy, and his cadi or judge, who were juſt arrived from the Porte, with all their equipage and retinue. The Algerines, by way of repriſal, ſurpriſed the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of France already mentioned, and carried off the inhabitants to the number of 600, with all their effects; which ſo provoked the admiral, that he ſent them word that he would pay them another viſit the next year with his whole fleet.</p>
               <p>The Algerines, undiſmayed by the threats of the French admiral, fitted out a fleet of 16 galleys
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032877_0028_0FF5A82D68A24C48"/>
and galliots, excellently manned and equipped, under the command of admiral Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i Pinchinin. The chief deſign of this armament was againſt the treaſure of Loretto; which, however, they were prevented by contrary winds from obtaining. Upon this they made a deſcent of Puglia, in the kingdom of Naples; where they ravaged the whole territory of Necotra, carrying off a vaſt number of captives, and among them ſome nuns. From thence ſteering towards Dalmatia, they ſcoured the Adriatic; and loading themſelves with immenſe plunder, left thoſe coaſts in the utmoſt conſternation.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Venetians, alarmed at ſuch terrible depredations, equipped a fleet of 28 ſail, under the command of admiral Capello, with expreſs orders to burn, ſink and take all the Barbary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs he met with, either on the open ſea, or even in the Grand Signior's harbours, purſuant to a late treaty of peace with the Porte. On the other hand, the captain baſhaw, who had been ſent out with the Turkiſh fleet to chaſe the Florentine and Malteſe cruiſers out of the Archipelago, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Algerine ſquadron was ſo near, ſent expreſs orders to the admiral to come to his aſſiſtance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but having firſt reſolved on a deſcent upon the iſland of Liſſa, or Liſina, belonging to the Venetians, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Capello, from whom he retired to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, a ſea port belonging to the Grand Signior, whither the Venetian admiral purſued him, but the Turkiſh governor refuſing to eject the pirates ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the articles of the peace between the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content himſelf with watching them for ſome time. Pinchinin was ſoon weary of reſtraint, and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out; when an engagement immediately enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032877_0028_0FF5A82D68A24C48"/>
in which the Algerines were defeated, and five of their veſſels diſabled; with the loſs of 1500 men, Turks and Chriſtian ſlaves; beſides 1600 galley-ſlaves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello; but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage before he received a letter from the ſenate, deſiring him to make no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the Porte. This was followed by a letter from the governor of Valona, deſiring him to take care leſt he incurred the Sultan's diſpleaſure by ſuch inſults. The brave Venetian was forced to comply; but reſolving to take ſuch a leave of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines as he thought they deſerved, obſerved how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equipage along the ſhore. He then kept firing among the tents, while ſome well-manned galliots and brigantines were ordered among their ſhipping, who attacked them with ſuch bravery, that, without any great loſs, they towed out their 16 galleys, with all their cannon, ſtores &amp;c. In this laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, a ball from one of the Venetian gallies, happening to ſtrike a Turkiſh moſque, the whole action was conſidered as an inſult upon the Grand Signior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to ſink all the Algerine ſhips he had taken, except the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello came off with a ſevere reprimand; but the Venetians were obliged to buy, with 500,000 ducats, a peace from the Porte. The Grand Signior offered to repair the loſs of the Algerines, by building ten galleys for them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that they ſhould continue in his ſervice till the end of the enſuing ſummer; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

lie under obligations to him, civilly declined the offer.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the news of this defeat and loſs filled Algiers with the utmoſt grief and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The whole city was on the point of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inſurrection, when the baſhaw and divan iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a proclamation, forbidding not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and outcries, under the ſevereſt penalties; but all perſons whatever to <hi>take their thumbs from within their girdles,</hi> while they were deliberating on this important point. In the mean time, they applied to the Porte for an order that the Venetians ſettled in the Levant ſhould make up their loſs. But with this the Grand Signior refuſed to comply, and left them to repair their loſſes, as well as build new ſhips, in the beſt manner they could. It was not long, however, before they had the ſatisfaction to ſee one of their corſairs land, with a freſh ſupply of 600 ſlaves, whom he had brought from the coaſt of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant native on board a Daniſh ſhip.</p>
               <p>Our pirates did not long continue in their weak and defenceleſs ſtate; being able, at the end of two years, to appear at ſea with a fleet of 65 ſail. The admiral Pinchinin equipped four galliots at his own expence; with which, in conjunction with the chiayah, or ſecretary of the baſhaw of Tripoli, he made a ſecond excurſion. This ſmall ſquadron, conſiſting of five galleys and two brigantines, and manned with their moſt able ſeaman, fell in with an Engliſh ſhip of 40 guns; which, however, Pinchinin's captains refuſed to engage; but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they ſwore they would attack the next Chriſtian ſhip that came in their way. This happened to be a Dutch merchantman, of 28 guns and 40 men, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032877_0029_0FF5A82EF1A1B040"/>
laden, and unable to uſe her ſails by reaſon of a calm. Pinchinin immediately ſummoned her to ſurrender; but receiving an ironical anſwer, drew up his ſquadron, by means of oars, in the form of a half-moon, that they might pour their ſhot all at once into their adverſary. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were preparing to diſcharge a tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous broadſide into her, a breeze of wind fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſprung up, and enabled him to change his poſition; which threw the Algerine ſquadron into ſuch confuſion that they ran foul of each othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Pinchinin, in the mean time, made ſeveral unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to ſurround the Dutchman with his other galleys: but that ſhip lay ſo deep in the water, that every ſhot did terrible execution among the pirates. Every effort to recover from their confuſion was vain, and the Dutchman continued to pour into them ſuch vollies of grape-ſhot and bars of iron, that in leſs than ten minutes above 200 of them were killed, and a much greater number wounded; among whom was the chiayah himſelf, who received a wound in the belly, of which he died ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſquadron now retired with the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and returned to Algiers in the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal plight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:032877_0030_0FF5A83D9463AE48"/>
But though Pinchinin thus returned in diſgrace, the reſt of the fleet captured vaſt numbers of ſlaves, and an immenſe quantity of rich ſpoils; inſomuch that the Engliſh, French and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the Algerines, who ſometimes vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to be at peace with them; but ſwore eternal war againſt Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greateſt enemies to the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan name. At laſt Lewis XIV. provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coaſts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a conſiderable fleet to be fitted out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, under the Marquis du Queſne, vice-admiral of France. His firſt expedition was againſt a number of Tripolitan corſairs; who had the good fortune to outrow him, and ſhelter themſelves in the iſland of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not, however, prevent him from purſuing them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and making ſuch terrible fire upon them as quickly deſtroyed 14 of their veſſels, beſides bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the walls of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>This ſeverity ſeemed only to be deſigned as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſtill continued their outrages on the French coaſt, he ſailed to Algiers in Auguſt 1682, connonading and bombarding it ſo furiouſly, that the whole town was in flames in a very little time. The great Moſque was battered down, and moſt of the houſes laid in ruins; inſomuch that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a ſudden the wind turned about, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged Du Queſne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made repriſals, by ſending a number of galleys and galliots to the coaſts of Provence, where they committed the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outrages, and brought away a vaſt number of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032877_0030_0FF5A83D9463AE48"/>
captives: upon which a new armament was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be got ready at Toulon and Marſeilles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next year; and the Algerines, having received timely notice, put themſelves into as a good ſtate of defence as the time would allow.</p>
               <p>In May 1683, Du Queſne with his ſquadron caſt anchor before Algiers; when being joined by the Marquis d'Affranville, at the head of five ſtout veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, it was reſolved to bombard the town next day. Accordingly 100 bombs were thrown into it the firſt day, which did terrible execution; while the beſieged made ſome hundred diſcharges of their cannon againſt them, without doing any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damage. The following night the bombs were again thrown into the city in ſuch numbers, that the dey's palace and other great edifices were almoſt deſtroyed; ſome of their batteries were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and ſeveral veſſels ſunk in the port. The dey and Turkiſh baſhaw, as well as the whole ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, alarmed at this dreadful havoc immediately ſued for peace. As a preliminary, the immediate ſurrender was inſiſted on, of all Chriſtian captives who had been taken fighting under the French flag; which being granted, 142 of them were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately delivered up, with a promiſe of ſending him the remainder as ſoon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Du Queſne ſent his commiſſary-general and one of his engineers into the town; but with expreſs orders to inſiſt upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects they had taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hali Rais one of their captains, ſhould be given as hoſtages.</p>
               <p>This laſt demand having embarraſſed the dey, he aſſembled the Divan, and acquainted them with it;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032877_0031_0FF5A83F3B4CD8E0"/>
upon which Mezomorto fell, into a violent paſſion, and told the aſſembly, that the cowardice of thoſe who ſat at the helm, had occaſioned the ruin of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers; but that, for his part, he would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to deliver up any thing that had been taken from the French.</p>
               <p>He immediately acquainted the ſoldiery with what had paſſed; which ſo exaſperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow choſe Mezomorto in his place. This was no ſooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of peace which had been made, and hoſtilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.</p>
               <p>The French admiral now kept pouring in ſuch vollies of bombs, that in leſs than three days, the greateſt part of the city was reduced to aſhes, and the fire burnt with ſuch vehemence, that the ſea was enlightened with it for more than ſix miles round. Mezomorto, unmoved at all theſe diſaſters, and the vaſt number of the ſlain, whoſe blood ran in rivulets along the ſtreets; or rather grown furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and deſperate, ſought only how to wreak his vengeance on the enemy; and not content with cauſing all the French in the city to be cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ordered their conſul to be tied hand and foot, and faſtened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from whence he was ſhot away againſt their navy. By this piece of inhumanity Du Queſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The haughty Algerines were now thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they were not invincible; and, therefore immediately ſent an embaſſy into France, begging

in the moſt humble terms, for peace; which Lewis immediately granted, to their inexpreſſible joy. They now began to pay ſome regard to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to be a little more cautious how they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly incurred their diſpleaſure. The firſt bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the French had ſo far humbled the Algerines, that they condeſcended to enter into a treaty with England; which was renewed, upon terms very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the latter, in 1686. It is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would diſappear on a ſudden: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this treaty, therefore, they loſt no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making prizes of the Engliſh ſhips when they could conveniently come at them. Upon ſome infringement of this kind, captain Beach drove them aſhore and burnt ſeven of their frigates in 1695; which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after: but it was not till the taking of Gibraltar and port Mahon, that Britain could have a ſufficient check upon them to enforce the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of treaties; and theſe have ſince proved ſuch reſtraints upon Algiers, that they ſtill continue to pay a greater deference to the Engliſh than to any other European power.</p>
               <p>The preſent century furniſhes but few very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable events with regard to Algiers. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous city of Oran was, however, taken from the Spaniards in 1708, which they recovered in 1737. In 1710 the Turkiſh baſhaw was expelled, and his office united to that of the dey. This introduced the form of government which ſtill continues in Algiers.</p>
               <p>In 1775 the Spaniards made another deſcent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Algiers. They fitted out this year a very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable fleet conſiſting of ſix ſhips of the line, twelve frigates, nine xebeques, and twenty-four other armed

veſſels, commanded by Don Pedro de Caſtijon; on board of which was embarked a body of 24,447 men, including infantry, cavalry, dragoons, artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery-men, mariners, and 600 deſerters to ſerve as workmen, all under the command of Lieutenant general Conde de O'Reilly, a perſonal favorite of the late king of Spain. They had likewiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, with a ſuitable quantity of military ſtores. The Spaniards entertained the moſt ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſucceſs in this expedition, and a grand ceremonial was performed by the principal officers at the church of St. Franciſco, in honor of <hi>La Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſima Concepcion,</hi> patroneſs of all Spain, imploring her protection, and ſucceſs to the king's arms, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which O'Reilly delivered a pompous oration.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of June the fleet ſet ſail from the port of Carthagena in Spain, and on the 1ſt of July an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in the bay of Algiers. They obſerved a large encampment, placed behind a battery, eaſt of the little river Xarach, which lies to the eaſtward of the city, and ſeveral Moors on horſeback about the beach. On the ſecond of July a council of the principal officers was held, and orders were given that the troops ſhould hold themſelves in readineſs to diſembark the next morning at day-break. But as the ſucceeding night was windy, and a ſwell had ſet in from the ſhore, theſe orders were countermanded. From this day until the 6th was an interval of inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; frequent councils were held, in which violent conteſts aroſe, and a quarrel enſued between O'Reil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and major general Romana, a Spaniard of an impetuous temper, who appearing to thwart the meaſures of the commander in chief, received from him ſome ſevere reproaches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:032877_0032_0FF5A840C8B60E88"/>
On the 6th, all the principal officers were again aſſembled to receive their ultimate inſtructions, when the orders of the 2d of July were ſtrongly recommended; which, however, offended the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in general, by allotting ſevere puniſhments for trivial neglects. In theſe orders the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief enjoined the troops not to break their order; as nothing but united force and diſcipline could enſure them ſucceſs againſt an enemy ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſkilful in deſultory war. He particularly warned them of the practice of the Moors, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways feign a moſt violent attack, and upon the leaſt reſiſtance fly with precipitation, in order to draw their enemy into an ambuſcade. But he pointed out to them the very error which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards committed, and the ſnare into which they were betrayed. On landing, he commanded each brigade to form a column of a company in front, ſix deep; and the guards of half a company in front: and directed them to gain ſome heights which were ſuppoſed requiſite to enſure ſucceſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the city. The diſpoſition of the march was ordered to be in four columns, with the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry in advance, and on the flanks; each column was to have four field pieces in front, to be increaſed as exigencies might require: two redoubts were to be formed at the place of diſembarkation, and a communication to be kept up between the army, thoſe fortifications, and the fleet. In the afternoon of the 6th, ſome ſhips of war were ordered to fire againſt three batteries to the eaſtward of Algiers. But they were ſtationed at ſo great a diſtance, through the fear of being raked by the Algerine batteries, that their ſhot did not reach the ſhore!—except thoſe of the St. Joſeph, of 74 guns, which received ſome damage
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032877_0033_0FF5A84257EFBB38"/>
from the enemy. At ſun-ſet this <hi>very</hi> cautious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack ceaſed.</p>
               <p>On the 7th at day-break, between eight and nine thouſand men were put on board of boats for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They advanced very near the ſhore, about a mile to the weſtward of the river Xarach, under the protection of ſeven galleys, and two long boats with a twelve pounder each; not a Moor appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppoſe their landing. At ſeven o'clock in the morning they <hi>returned</hi> on board the tranſports, and not a ſhot was fired on either ſide the whole day! Orders were then given for the tranſport long boats to be manned with Spaniſh ſeamen, and to be in readineſs at day-break the next morning.</p>
               <p>On the 8th at day-break the ſhips were poſted to batter the different forts to the right and left of the place of diſembarkation, and 8000 troops were put on board of boats, which formed in ſix columns; at the head of which were the grenadiers, preceded by the armed xebeques, galliots, &amp;c. that were to cover their landing. The firing from the ſhips began, and the troops moved on to the place of diſembarkation, where they effected their landing on the beach, (about a league to the eaſtward of the city), between the intervals of firing from the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels; and immediately above 80,000 Moors appeared in ſight, two-thirds of which were caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under the bey of Conſtantina; but they did not attempt to oppoſe the landing of the Spaniſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Turks in the mean time remained to defend the city, and not one of them appeared to diſpute the ground. It is ſaid that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Africans collected on this occaſion was not leſs than 150,000, of which 100,000 were cavalry. As ſoon as the 8000 Spaniards had made good their landing, they formed ſix deep, according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032877_0033_0FF5A84257EFBB38"/>
the armed veſſels divided to the right and left, to cover their flanks; and the boats returned to bring the reſt of the army on ſhore with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. The troops of the firſt diſembarkation had ſcarcely formed, when a detachment of the enemy appeared in their front; but upon obſerving a movement of the Spaniards towards them, they fled in diſorder. The troops then marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the beat of drum, with the volunteers of Arragon and Catolonia in front, until they were engaged in a cloſe country, which the enemy had occupied in ſmall parties; but poſted ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly in ditches and fortreſſes, that they made great havoc among the Spaniards, without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any injury in return. The Spaniſh grenadiers, and light infantry, which had been detached in advance, were repulſed. At this juncture they were reinforced by the troops of the ſecond diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, and ſome heavy cannon coming up which protected their march, they again advanced towards ſome incloſures, where they directed a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy fire; but without being able to diſlodge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Great numbers of the Spaniards fell without gaining the leaſt advantage; in conſequence of which their whole body fell into confuſion. The zeal and intrepidity of the officers was inſufficient to contain the men; ſome advanced, and others retired, in an indiſcriminate manner, juſt as they judged it expedient, without any regard to the command of their officers. While they were in this critical ſituation, a drove of camels appeared, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on their left, conducted by ſome Moors, with a deſign of drawing the fire of the enemy upon them. Great was the ſlaughter of the Spaniards, and in this extremity a cry was ſpread that they were cut off by the Mooriſh horſe. The utmoſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032877_0034_0FF5A85144481D78"/>
confuſion ſucceeded, and the whole body fled with the greateſt precipitation, leaving on the field of battle an immenſe number of wounded, whom they were obliged to abandon to the mercy of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. By this time the workmen and troops of the third diſembarkation were forming entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they had already fortified with three eight pounders; which did great execution; at the ſame time the Tuſcan commanders drew their frigates cloſe into ſhore, and kept up ſuch a well-directed fire, that the Spaniards were enabled to make good their retreat into their entrenchments, which were, however, ſcarcely large enough to contain their army. In this crowded ſituation they were much annoyed by a thirty-ſix pounder which the enemy brought out of one of their batteries, and an elevated fire from the fort of Xarach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to the miſchief. The Moors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them in their trenches, but they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed with great ſlaughter, and in this ſituation the Spaniards remained till dark, when they began their re-imbarkation in great tumult and confuſion; but what diſcovered the ignorance of the Moors, was their neglecting ſo favourable an opportunity of obtaining the completeſt of victories.</p>
               <p>The loſs ſuſtained by the Spaniards on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, amounted to 27 officers killed, and 191 wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 501 men killed, and 2,088 wounded. The Marquis of Romana was killed at the head of his brigade in the commencement of the action. The loſs of the Moors it is ſaid, was between five and ſix thouſand killed, and as many wounded; but this ſeems improbable<note n="*" place="bottom">The above account is agreeable to the Spaniſh court gazettes, (in which truth is ſeldom expected), and agrees with Dalrymple's ſtatement, who ſays it nearly correſponds with a letter from Algiers. But other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtate the Spaniſh loſs much greater, and it is at leaſt evident that there cannot be ſo wide a difference in the loſs between the parties, eſpecially as the Spaniards made ſo little impreſſion on the Moors in their ditches, &amp;c.</note> The government of Algiers
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032877_0034_0FF5A85144481D78"/>
had offered a premium of ten ſequins for every Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard's head, and conſequently the wounded Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who were left on the field of battle, were all murdered. The unfortunate invaders left behind them on their retreat, 15 pieces of cannon, three howitzers, and a great number of ſmall arms and ammunition.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of July, the troops, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the fleet ſet ſail on their return to Spain, and thus terminated this Quixotic expedition; of which a Spaniſh ſerjeant, in giving an account to his wife, ludicrouſly ſays, <hi>Nos mandaron a tierra, como ſi ibemos a beber cafè con los Moros;</hi> "we were commanded a-ſhore as if we were to drink coffee with the Moors."</p>
               <p>When the melancholy intelligence was announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the failure of this expedition, from which the Spaniſh nation had formed ſuch ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſucceſs, the national feelings were indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribable. O'Reilly was in conſequence ſo cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deteſted, that mobs aſſembled upon the road to Alicant with an intent to wreak their vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. They ſtopped many carriages, and that O'Reilly (who was lame) might not be concealed, they made the people get out and walk before them. Had the liberty of the preſs prevailed the world would have known the ſentiments of the Spaniſh nation upon this occaſion. The king was threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if his favorite ſhould ever appear at court again,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032877_0035_0FF5A852CFF83608"/>
and to appeaſe the turbulence of the people he was ſoon after removed from the governorſhip of Madrid.</p>
               <p>Since the failure of this expedition the Spaniards have attempted nothing deciſive againſt Algiers. In the years 1783 and 1784, indeed, they renewed their attacks by ſea to deſtroy the city and galleys; but after ſpending a great quantity of ammunition, bombs, &amp;c. they were obliged to retire without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its capture or extinction.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the eſtabliſhment of the American inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, when the United States had relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed their maritime dependence upon the Engliſh nation, it followed as a natural conſequence, that the American commerce muſt fall a ſacrifice to the ravages of the Algerine corſairs; and no doubt it was through the intrigues of the Britiſh cabinet, who were chagrined at our recent emancipation, that their hoſtile diſpoſition was ſo quickly manifeſted. Various circumſtances concurred to render them eligible objects of piratical rapacity. America was ſituated at the diſtance of more than three thouſand miles from the theatre of their piracies, and as ſhe ſupported no maritime force they were enabled to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032877_0036_0FF5A854584D8308"/>
continue their depredations with impunity. Her extenſive commerce with Europe preſented a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did allurement to the pirates, who were well aware that the prevention of their aggreſſions would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a naval armament greatly ſuperior to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial benefits that could be derived from an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reduce them to ſubmiſſion. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by no means problematical, that the naval force of the United States, with judicious comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, would prove fully competent to reduce their fleet, if not to effect the deſtruction of their city. According to the moſt authentic accounts, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is at preſent extremely inconſiderable, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the American captives concur in the aſſertion, that the fleet of this regency only amounted in 1796 to five frigates, two xebecks, and one half gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley! a force by no means to be put in competition with that which could be raiſed by the United States. But to bring all their ſhips of war to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular engagement at once, would be totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; for whenever an hoſtile armament ſcours the Mediterranean they immediately fly for refuge to the guns of their fortifications.</p>
               <p>When we reflect upon the peculiar encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had to commit depredations on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, it becomes rather a matter of wonder that we ſuffered ſo little, than that we ſuffered ſo much. For this ſecurity we were greatly indebted to the wars which exiſted between the Algerines, the Portugueſe and the Dutch, at the time they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their ravages upon our trade; either of which powers are greatly ſuperior to the corſairs in maritime ſtrength, and they ſo narrowly watched the entrance of the Mediterranean for the protection of their own commerce, that the pirates were ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom able to cruiſe out into the Atlantic. Thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032877_0036_0FF5A854584D8308"/>
American veſſels that ſometimes ventured into the ſtreights were generally ſafe; for they derived their ſecurity either from forged or purchaſed Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean paſſports.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the vigilance with which the Portugueſe guarded the ſtreights, the Algerines ſometimes ſtole out into the Atlantic, and in one of theſe excurſions, which happened while the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe fleet were ordered upon ſome ſecret expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſchooner Maria, captain Stephens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mr. Foſter of Boſton, was captured by a corſair off Cape St. Vincents, on the 25th of July 1785; and five days afterwards, the ſhip Dolphin, captain O'Brien, belonging to Meſſrs. Irvines of Philadelphia, was taken by another about 50 leagues to the weſtward of Liſbon. Theſe veſſels, with their cargoes and crews, about 21 in number, were carried into Algiers, where they were made ſlaves.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of the year 1793, a truce was made between the court of Liſbon and the regency of Algiers, for the period of twelve months, and in conſequence, nine ſail of Algerine cruiſers paſſed out through the Streights of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar into the Atlantic ocean. Their cruiſing ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was between Cape St. Vincents and the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern iſlands, where they continued to cruiſe the greateſt part of the winter, contrary to their former cuſtom of retiring from the ocean in November. In conſequence of this truce, the courts of Liſbon and Madrid granted convoys to American veſſels homeward bound, to a certain latitude where they were free from thè corſairs.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of October 1793, about five leagues from Gibraltar, captain John M'Shane of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva, was boarded by a xebeck of 20 guns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032877_0037_0FF5A855DEC43880"/>
to Algiers, who after coming within muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot, kept a conſtant firing with ſmall-arms until the yards of the American veſſel were manned from thoſe of the cruiſer. The firing then ceaſed; they came down ſword in hand and made the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican crew priſoners; ſtripped them of their clothes, and put them on board the xebeck, which carried them to Algiers, where they arrived the 30th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. As ſoon as they had arrived they were taken before the dey, and after examination, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Bagnio, where the ſlaves are kept lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up at night. The next day they were bound with iron chains, each about 40 pounds weight, which reached from their legs to their hips, and ſent to the marine, where they were kept at hard labour from day-light till dark.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of October, captain William Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, of the ſhip Preſident of Philadelphia, diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, about 9 o'clock in the morning, a ſail to the windward bearing down upon him, which the ſhip's company at firſt imagined to be a Spaniſh privateer. But they were ſoon fatally deceived; for ſhe proved to be an Algerine corſair. As ſoon as ſhe diſcovered the American flag ſhe hoiſted out her boat immediately, and 30 men armed with piſtols and drawn cutlaſſes furiouſly boarded his veſſel. The firſt ſalutation the captain received was a violent ſtroke with a cutlaſs; after which they compelled the whole ſhip's company to jump over the rail of the veſſel into their boat, without ſuffering any one to go below for their clothes, and other neceſſary articles. The crew were then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on board the cruiſer, where they were ſtripped naked, and a few old rags were given them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, neither ſufficient to conceal their nakedneſs, nor protect them from the cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:032877_0037_0FF5A855DEC43880"/>
In this ſituation they were obliged to lie on deck, where they ſuffered great hardſhips from the inclemency of the ſeaſon. Captain Penroſe tells us he was forced to lie on the poop, where he was almoſt periſhed by a bitter north-eaſt wind; till at length an old man, more humane than the reſt, furniſhed him with a blanket. The proviſions given them to eat, were black bread and water, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a few rotten olives, which they regarded as a great dainty.</p>
               <p>In this forlorn ſituation they continued eight days, and on the 30th of October they arrived at Algiers. Here they were ſubjected to a new ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of miſery. They thought themſelves cruelly treated on board the cruiſer; but their treatment there was pleaſure when contraſted with the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they afterwards experienced. They were ſcarcely on ſhore when they were loaded with irons, and immediately put to hard labour like ſo many criminals.</p>
               <p>The number of American priſoners now amounted to about 130, among whom were captains Stephens and O'Brien, whoſe crews had been reduced to ten by the plague, and the ſeverity of their treatment for upwards of eight years. The ſmall pittance they had received from the United States had been withheld about three months before; and their only ſubſiſtence was a little black bread and water, and ſometimes nothing.</p>
               <p>In their October expedition they captured ten ſail of American veſſels, nine of which ſafely entered the harbour of Algiers on the 30th of October where the veſſels anchored, amidſt the ſhouts of the people<note n="*" place="bottom">The names of the American captains and their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of reſidence are as follows:—Captains Wallace, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia; Newman, Boſton; Taylor, Rhode-Iſland; Furnace, New-Hampſhire; Calder, Glouceſter; Burnham, New-York; Bailey, Newbury; Moſs, ditto; M'Shane and Penroſe, Philadelphia.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:032877_0038_0FF5A86419EDFC38"/>
The Algerine corſairs, greatly animated with the ſucceſs of this expedition, immediately ſet ſail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their former ſtation; while others were equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the harbour with the utmoſt ſpeed. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately the miſcreants only captured one Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſel, about a month afterwards, belonging to captain Joſeph Ingraham; for the Americans were extremely cautious how they came within the ſphere of their rapacity; and, after theſe captures, they never fell in with any American veſſels, but thoſe that were protected by convoys.</p>
               <p>After theſe events, the American priſoners were ſubjected to a ſeries of miſery which humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bluſhes to record. As ſoon as they landed in Algiers, they were immediately ordered to the dey's palace, where they were drawn up in files, in a back court, and underwent a ſtrick examination. The dey, attended by his cook, paſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed in front of them, and was extremely pleaſed with their appearance. He ſelected from their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the boys and younger men, whom he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his palace at different occupations, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of a ſervile nature; ſome were ordered to ſweep the apartments, ſome to waſh clothes, and others to wait upon the dey and take care of his wardrobe. The reſt of the priſoners were then diſmiſſed, and as they withdrew from the royal preſence, the dey ſaid to them, in the tone of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage triumph, "<hi>Go now you dogs and eat ſtones."</hi> They were then eſcorted to the Bagnio Baleck,

where they were lodged in different apartments among the old ſlaves, and each priſoner furniſhed with a couple of coarſe blankets for his bedding. In this diſmal region of miſery and oppreſſion, amidſt the clanking of chains and the cries of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering humanity, they were left to brood over their miſfortunes at leiſure.

               <p>About midnight they were rouſed from their meditations by the cry of <hi>Surſa, Surſa,</hi> riſe up all hands. The <hi>Liſbero,</hi> or guardian of the Bagnio, then entered their apartments, and loaded each priſoner with chains of thirty or forty pounds weight. The next morning about day-break they were ordered to the marine, where, after their names were called over, they were employed in diſcharging the cargoes of their own veſſels, which conſiſted of wheat, flour, wine, ſugar, and other articles. Their general employment in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine was the rigging and fitting out of cruiſers, and whenever any foreign veſſel lay in the harbour they were obliged to wear this enormous weight of chains, leſt they ſhould make their eſcape; but at other times they were freed from their load, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe who were turbulent, or by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar miſconduct had forfeited this privilege of the ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The hour of four in the afternoon is called <hi>lazar,</hi> at which time a white flag is hoiſted upon the tops of all the moſques in the city, as a ſignal for the inhabitants to quit their labour, and repair to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip. At this hour the labour of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ceaſed, and they were permitted to go on ſhore, except when any buſineſs of importance occurred,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032877_0039_0FF5A865A4324028"/>
and when that was the caſe they were generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined till dark.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were ordered on ſhore they were provided with inſtruments to carry ſtones from the mole to a grand moſque, which the dey was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the city adjoining his ſeraglio. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were formed of croſs pieces of timber, called <hi>burrils,</hi> to which the ſton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, timber, cannon or whatever elſe was neceſſary to be carried, were ſuſpended beneath by ropes, and borne upon the ſhoulders of four men, who were appointed to carry each burril. A particular load was always aſſigned them, and the weak and the ſtrong were indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately compelled to carry theſe burdens, without any attention being paid to the comparative bodily ſtrength of the labourer. To perſons of robuſt conſtitutions theſe loaded burrils were tolerable, but to thoſe of weak habits of body they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely inſupportable; and hence it happened, that many perſons, by being overſtrained, were either blinded, or extremely injured in their conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>When the proceſſion of loaded burrils was ready to move, the warden baſhaw, who ſtood at the port of the marine, waved his wand as a ſignal for the ſlaves to advance to the port, where they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the wardens of the marine, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of diſcovering whether they had ſtolen any particular articles from the veſſels. After this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination they were permitted to paſs with their loads, which they depoſited at the new moſque, and then retired with their inſtruments to their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive lodgings; ſome to the Bagnio Baleck, and others to the Bagnio Gallaro, where their names were called over by the clerks, and each ſlave as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed received a loaf of black bread for his ſupper.</p>
               <p>For ſome time they were obliged to ſleep upon
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032877_0039_0FF5A865A4324028"/>
the ground; but they ſoon conſtructed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a kind of wooden frames, which were ſwung like hammocks one above another, and upon theſe they threw their clothes and blankets when they were about to retire to reſt: but to add to their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, their ſleep was inceſſantly diſturbed by infinite numbers of vermin with which theſe Bagnios ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In the morning they again repaired with their burrils to the marine, where their names were called over; and in this manner were they conſtantly employed whenever the equipment of the Algerine corſairs was neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Many of the ſlaves, however, were diſtributed in different parts; ſome were ſent into the country, and whenever the ſea was calm, and no particular emergency required their labour in the marine, great numbers of others were employed in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones from a mountain called <hi>Babloet,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bublywhite,</hi> about a league from the city, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to defend the mole from the impetuoſity of the waves. Theſe ſtones were blown by ſlaves from the immenſe rocks which lie depoſited in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſome of them were twelve or fifteen feet in diameter. In order to convey them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently to the water, the ſlaves were engaged for more than a year, in forming a paſſage through a large hill, which they removed and carried into the ſea, where they formed a large mole or wharf to protect their <hi>pantoons,</hi> or carrying boats, from the violence of the waves. In forming this paſſage they dug through a Mooriſh burial ground, from whence they removed immenſe numbers of human bones. Theſe repoſitories of the dead are always regarded as ſacred by the Moors, and the whole neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and particularly the women, were, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, thrown into the greateſt conſternation.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032877_0040_0FF5A8672CB8AF48"/>
They reſorted to this ſcene of ſacrilege, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged the moſt immoderate grief over this devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the relics of their friends. But ſuch were the orders of the dey, and they were obliged to ſubmit patiently to his will.</p>
               <p>After this paſſage was formed, theſe immenſe fragments of rocks were dragged by ſlaves, with great labour and difficulty, from the mountain, and placed upon ſtrong carriages about two feet high; upon which they were conveyed to the wharf, by upwards of two hundred ſlaves to each carriage, where they were thrown into pantoons; from thence they were tranſported by water, and diſcharged at the mole before the city.</p>
               <p>But when the ſea was tempeſtuous and the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons could not be navigated, the ſlaves were then employed in carrying ſmaller ſtones by land. After having ſuſpended a load to their burrils, of ſuch a weight as ſome were ſcarcely able to ſtagger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they proceeded in gangs of different numbers, attended by a crew of ſavage drivers, who goaded them forward whenever they halted or happened to faulter under the preſſure of their burdens. The extremity of their ſufferings in this laborious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is better conceived than expreſſed. The moſt barbarous puniſhments were wantonly inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the violence of a ſcorching ſun, which poured its fervid rays upon them, ſeemed to complete the meaſure of human wretchedneſs. With this enormous weight of ſtones they moved forward, attended by wardens who preceded them in order to clear the ſtreets of the city through which they paſſed, where every perſon was obliged to give way at their approach. After having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their loads at the mole they returned, and in this manner were they employed during the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032877_0040_0FF5A8672CB8AF48"/>
ſummer ſeaſon, when no particular emergencies demanded their labour in the marine. This mole, in conſequence of the encroachments of the ſea du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter, requires an eternal ſupply of ſtones, and in this manner is this Siſyphaean labour conducted by a herd of wretches who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doomed to this abject ſervitude for life. The dey commonly rides out to his country-ſeat about twice a week, where his favorite wife reſides in the ſummer ſeaſon, and in paſſing and repaſſing he would ſometimes condeſcend to diſtribute ſome trifling preſents among the ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The overſeers in their treatment towards the ſlaves ſeemed actuated by a principle of the moſt ſavage cruelty, and inflicted the moſt rigorous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments through mere caprice and wantonneſs, in order to feaſt their malignant ſouls with the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the trembling wretch who ſtood ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire beneath their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The inordinate ferocity of this barbarian had proved the death of many of ſlave, and the miſcreant was moſt cordially deteſted wherever he came. One day as he was purſuing a Genoeſe ſlave through the upper apartments of one of the magazines on the ſea-ſide, he fell, by ſome accident, from a conſiderable eminence upon a heap of ſtones, where he met with ſo hard a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he inſtantly expired. This accident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the moſt extravagant joy among the ſlaves, which was only marred with the apprehenſion that the ſavage would recover: but they ſoon had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing him ſafely lodged in the earth.</p>
               <p>It would perhaps be improper to deſcend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars here, and we muſt therefore refer the reader

for particular anecdotes, occurrences, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which regard our countrymen, to our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the ſlaves.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the ſufferings of our fellow citizens in Algiers were the univerſal ſubject of ſympathy and regret; and meaſures were ſoon adopted to effect their deliverance from this region of unparalleled miſery. Colonel Humphreys, who had been appointed American conſul for Algiers, left America in April 1795, in company with Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Donaldſon, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> of Philadelphia, who had been appointed conſul for Tunis and Tripoli, and whom Colonel Humphreys was authoriſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in the negociation of a treaty of peace and amity with Algiers, while he proceeded to France for the purpoſe of obtaining the co-operation of that government in this negociation.</p>
               <p>They arrived at Gibraltar the 17th of May, where Col. Humphreys concluded that it would be expedient for Mr. Donaldſon to go firſt to Alicant, to the northward of Carthagena in Spain, rather than to Algiers, there to reſide for ſome time, in order that he might be near the ſcene of negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take advantage of any favorable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that might happen. Mr. Donaldſon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his inſtructions accordingly, and immediately ſet out for that place; and in the mean time Col. Humphreys, having alſo given inſtructions to Mr. Simpſon, the American conſul at Gibraltar, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a peace with the emperor of Morocco, ſailed from Gibraltar the 24th of May, and on the 26th of June following arrived at Havre de-Grace in France; from whence he immediately ſet out for Paris, where he ſoon after communicated the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his miſſion to Col. Monroe, the American
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032877_0041_0FF5A868B24A6B90"/>
miniſter, and to the Committee of Public Safety of that Republic.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt of July Col. Humphreys receive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal notification that the French Republic was diſpoſed to exert its influence in forwarding the negociation in queſtion; and on the 28th he received the favorable intelligence, that immediate meaſures ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted for giving particular inſtructions to the agents of the Republic to uſe its influence in the promotion of the treaty in contemplation. The multiplicity of national concerns with which the officers of the French government were then occupied, and the time requiſite for obtaining from London ( where funds had been depoſited) the ſums of money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as peace preſents, retarded the concluſion of arrangements at Paris till ſome time in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it had been deemed expedient by Cols. Monroe and Humphreys, that Joel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> ſhould be conſulted, and if his aſſent could be obtained that he ſhould be employed in negociating with the Barbary States: to which Mr. Barlow conſented. By the 11th of September all the papers on the part of Col. Humphreys relative to Mr. Barlow's miſſion were in readineſs, and as ſoon as the peace preſents were prepared for him, he ſet out, with inſtructions and powers from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of France to its agents in Barbary, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the buſineſs that had been entruſted to him.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of September Col. Humphreys left Paris, and arrived at Havre-de-Grace the 14th; where he found the captain and mate of the United States brig Sophia both ſick with fevers. While he was waiting here with great impatience for their recovery, he received information from the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can conſul at Marſeilles, that Mr. Donaldſon had
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032877_0042_0FF5A8770C40B418"/>
concluded a treaty of peace with the dey of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers. He judged it expedient, notwithſtanding, that Mr. Barlow ſhould proceed with the preſents, and if they were not wanted at Algiers they would be neceſſary in the negociation with Tunis and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli.</p>
               <p>Col. Humphreys ſailed from Havre-de-Grace about the 5th of October, and after a ſtormy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of more than forty days, arrived at Liſbon the 17th of November, where he found captain O'Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, who had arrived about the 1ſt of October, with the treaty with Algiers. Mr. Donaldſon arrived at Algiers on the 3d of September; the treaty was concluded on the 5th, and the peace preſents immediately given by a loan. As Mr. Donaldſon knew that funds had been lodged in London to fulfil the ſtipulations of the treaty, he engaged to make the payments in three or four months.</p>
               <p>Col. Humphreys had received advice, under date of the 30th of July, from the Meſſrs. Barings in London, to whom the funds had been remitted, that having made conſiderable progreſs in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ales of the United States ſtock, they ſhould have at his diſpoſal the whole of the value of 800,000 dollars, meaning to furniſh, by anticipation, the value of that part which remained unſold, if the ſervice of the United States required it. Col. Humphreys, calculating upon the certainty of payment after this period, ſent captain O'Brien from Liſbon to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the brig Sophia to receive the money. But owing to contrary winds he did not leave Liſbon till the 24th of December.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of the diſappointments in the pecuniary arrangements the treaty was in the moſt imminent danger of being ultimately fruſtrated; the dey became impatient, and threatened to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032877_0042_0FF5A8770C40B418"/>
it; and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that it was prevented. Mr. Barlow did not arrive at Alicant until February 1796, where he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>oſed to wait the arrival of the funds; but ſhortly after receiving intelligence from Algiers that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican negociation was in a moſt critical ſituation, he determined to go thither immediately with the hopes of ſoothing the dey. He arrived there the 5th of March. The time for the payment of the ſtipulated ſums had before been prolonged to the 8th of April. On the 3d of that month the dey declared that his final determination was, that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Donaldſon ſhould leave Algiers in eight days; and if the money was not paid in 30 days after, the treaty ſhould be at end, and his corſairs be permitted to bring in American veſſels. Under theſe imperious circumſtances, and as the laſt hope of ſaving the treaty, they were induced to offer the dey the preſent of a frigate; which fortunately ſucceeded. But Col. Humphreys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelf not authoriſed to confirm this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, diſpatched captain O'Brien in the brig So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia to America, for the purpoſe of referring the matter to the executive of the United States, and obtaining his concurrence. There was evidently no alternative, and therefore the executive was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the abſolute neceſſity of confirming the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. This frigate<note n="*" place="bottom">This frigate is to carry 36 guns, is ſheathed with copper, and intended to be a veſſel of 538 tons burden. The whole coſt is above 90,000 dollars.

                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:032877_0043_0FF5A87899421C38"/>
While the buſineſs was in this precarious ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, owing principally to the convulſions in Europe, Mr. Donaldſon ſet out for Leghorn, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a loan of 400,000 dollars of the Meſſrs. Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereau, and as that port was blockaded by the Britiſh fleet, Mr. Donaldſon obtained permiſſion from the court of Great Britain that the money might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from thence without being ſubject to capture, and it was ſoon after ſent in a Venetian veſſel to Algiers.</p>
               <p>Captain O'Brien after he had received the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the executive, ſet ſail from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in June 1796, and arrived in Liſbon ſometime in July. In the mean time Col. Humphreys had advantageouſly negociated bills on London for 225,000 dollars, which he had received, and this ſum was embarked on board the brig Sophia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the care of captain O'Brien. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was inſured at a ſmall premium againſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the ſeas; but againſt all riſks ſo high a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium was demanded that Col. Humphreys judged it inexpedient to give it, ſeeing the Sophia was a veſſel of the United States having a ſpecial paſſport from the Preſident, as well as one in the Turkiſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage under the ſeal of the dey of Algiers.</p>
               <p>On the 4th of Auguſt capt. O'Brien ſet ſail for Algiers, and on the 18th he was captured off that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a Tripolitan corſair, who carried his veſſel, money and crew in triumph to Tripoli, (which lies on the Mediterranean, about 130 miles to the ſouth-eaſtward of Algiers), accompanied by the ſhip Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of Boſton, whoſe crew were made ſlaves. This immenſe ſum in ſpecie, more perhaps than they had ever captured at once before, was landed amidſt the firing of cannon, the diſplay of colours, and the ſhouts of the populace. The extravagance of their
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032877_0043_0FF5A87899421C38"/>
joy, however, was ſoon abated when capt. O'Brien exhibited to them the paſſport of the dey of Algiers; he demonſtrated to them that he was ſtill the ſlave of the dey, and though the money had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him by the United States, yet it was the the ſame in effect as if it had been delivered to the dey himſelf. After an examination of two days the veſſel was liberated, and capt. O'Brien immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet ſail for Algiers, where he arrived the firſt of October, and delivered the money to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can conſul reſiding there; who had previouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the loan of the neceſſary ſums from the Meſſrs. Buckras, a Jewiſh company in Algiers, who had received ſatisfactory information of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of repayment. With this timely loan Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fulfilled his ſtipulations with the dey, who was ſo highly pleaſed with the preſent, and in conſequence repoſed ſuch confidence in the United States, that he offered Mr. Barlow upon their account the loan of ſuch ſums as would enable him to negociate a treaty of peace with the Tuniſian and Tripolitan powers, which he judged proper to accept.</p>
               <p>By the judicious arrangements of Mr. Barlow with the dey, capt. O'Brien was appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner on behalf of the United States to negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a treaty with the regencies of Tunis and Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li. He ſet ſail upon this buſineſs the 10th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and arrived at Tunis on the 16th, where he had an interview with the bey, to whom he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from the dey of Algiers, encloſing a command that he ſhould make peace with the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican commiſſioner upon the terms therein preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. But the bey totally rejected the terms, and demanded the payment of a ſum equal to thrice that amount. After many audiences and conferences, capt. O'Brien, finding that the bey would neither
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032877_0044_0FF5A867105414E70"/>
accept of a leſs ſum, nor accede to the terms of the dey, tranſmitted the Tuniſian demand to Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Algiers, which he communicated to the dey, who was much exaſperated in conſequence, and would not ſuffer him to acquieſce in ſo exorbitant a demand.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation capt. O'Brien left the Tuniſian buſineſs, and proceeded to Tripoli, where, after much difficulty, he concluded a peace with that power upon the 4th of November, and procured the releaſe of the American priſoners who were captu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſhip Betſey. He left captain Joſeph In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graham, the American <hi>charge des affaires,</hi> in that place, and ſailed from thence the 27th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, bringing away the remaining part of the crew of the ſhip Betſey. On the 7th of December, in his return to Algiers, he again touched at Tunis, where he received orders from Mr. Barlow and the dey, by whom he had been inveſted with diſcretionary powers to conduct the negociation, to demand a definitive anſwer from the bey of Tunis, whether he would negociate a treaty of peace with the United States upon the terms preſcribed by the dey? but he found that the bey ſtill perſiſted in the exorbitancy of his demands; and after many conferences and fruitleſs efforts he ſailed from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, and arrived in Algiers the 3d of January 1797, where he communicated to Mr. Barlow and the dey the unſucceſsful reſult of his miſſion. The dey was violently enraged at the inſult offered to his dignity by this rejection of his interceſſion in the affairs of the United States, and actuated by ſome former animoſities that ſtill ſubſiſted between them, he iſſued immediate orders to his eaſtern camp of 60,000 men to enter the Tuniſian terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. This army was ſoon ſet in motion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032877_0044_0FF5A867105414E70"/>
a compliance on the part of the bey. In their rout through the Tuniſian dominions they cut off ſome hundreds of heads and ears, and after commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting great ravages upon the inhabitants, they returned to the territory of Algiers. This harſh expedient was adopted in order to aſcertain the political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the government of Tunis, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide whether they would ſubmit to the controul of the dey; for the powers relative to the American pacification, the dey expreſsly declared, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his immediate guarantee. Capt. O'Brien, by the dey's orders, left Algiers the 14th of February, and arrived in Philadelphia the 1ſt of April 1797.</p>
               <p>The truce which Mr. Barlow concluded with the Tuniſian regency, on the 15th of June 1796, for ſix months, expired on the 15th of December following. This truce had been obtained without any preſents, by Mr. Famin the French agent at Tunis, who had been recommended to Mr. Barlow by the French conſul Herculais. Since its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration the American veſſels have been ſubject to capture by the Tuniſian corſairs, and captain O'Brien, in his publication of April 5th, 1797, ſays, "I now tell you candidly, that no American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhould enter the Mediterranean until our peace with all the Barbary States is fully eſtabliſhed, and publiſhed by the authority of the United States." But with regard to the Tuniſian negociation, little apprehenſion is entertained, and it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Mr. Barlow, through the powerful interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the dey, has already concluded a treaty with that government.</p>
               <p>At the concluſion of the Algerine treaty, an univerſal joy diffuſed itſelf among the American priſoners, and they triumphed in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anticipation of viſiting their native ſhores again.

They had long been the victims of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated calamities, and become familiar with the gloomy proſpect of death. They were haunted with the diſmal apprehenſions of a ſervitude for life, and hope, the pleaſing illuſion that gilds the dark regions of adverſity, ſeemed fled for ever. To add to the catalogue of their miſeries, the plague commenced its awful viſitation; many of their companions fell a ſacrifice to this dreadful contagion, while others invoked the friendly hand of death to terminate their ſufferings and deſpair. When intelligence of the treaty was announced, the captives indulged the animated expectation of an immediate deliverance, and the ſudden tranſition from ſuch a dark ſtate of deſpondence, inſpired them with the moſt ineffable joy. But the fatal delays occaſioned in the remittances of the neceſſary ſums endangered the exiſtence of the treaty, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded the pleaſing proſpect. In conſequence of theſe unfortunate delays, which were principally owing to the convulſions in Europe, the captives were ſtill conſined at hard labour, and the period of their miſery was unfortunately protracted from the 5th of September 1795, the time when the treaty was formed, till the 9th of July following, when the ſtipulated payments were made. Mr. Barlow then paid them a viſit while they were at labour, and when he announced the pleaſing intelligence to them, it was ſo unexpected that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſtate, attended by the caſſan aga, or prime miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the aga and other officers of government. After a ſhort pauſe, the head clerk preſented each captive with a <hi>Tiſcoree,</hi> or paſſport, and informed them they were at liberty to make immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for their return home. Forty-eight Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans were liberated at the ſame time; one of whom, in a tranſport of joy, proſtrated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dey and kiſſed his hands and feet; but the Americans, who were not quite ſo ſervile, repaired with all expedition to the port of the marine, and embarked on board the ſhip La Fortune, which had been chartered for them by the Meſſrs. Buckras, for the purpoſe of conveying them to Marſeilles.</p>
               <p>The original number of the Americans was now reduced to 85. Many of them died with the plague, a few with the ſmall pox, and others with the ſeverity of the labour which had been impoſed upon them. Captain Wallace of Richmond met with an untimely death as he was leaning againſt the banniſters of an ancient building, which gave way, and he fell from a conſiderable height into the ſtreet, where he inſtantly expired. The plague raged with ſuch violence when the captives left Algiers that five of them died within a few weeks previous to their departure; another who was attacked by that fatal malady was left behind, and many others had their conſtitutions much injured by the diſorder. One of them was in a ſtate of total blindneſs, and another was rendered nearly ſo. Three of them carried the marks of unmerciful treatment, in ruptures produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by hard labour; ſeveral of them were render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incapable of gaining their living, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are objects of the benevolence of their countrymen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barlow was fully ſenſible of the neceſſity of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032877_0046_0FF5A88B8EFBE060"/>
their immediate removal from this moſt wretched of all conceivable abodes, and was juſtly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that they could not be embarked without ſome danger of the infection. After his arrival he was moſt ſedulouſly employed in effecting their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and by his benevolence, which was ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the captives, their condition was render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more tolerable, till the final obtainment of their liberty. To this worthy character, whoſe heart vibrated with their finer feelings of philanthropy, while his life was in imminent danger, the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tribute of gratitude is due, and the captives ſpeak in terms of the warmeſt affection for his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form exertions in reſcuing them from this region of horror.</p>
               <p>After preparing the neceſſary articles for their voyage, the Americans ſet ſail, with the 48 Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, in the ſhip La Fortune, under the command of capt. Calder, and ſoon bade an eternal adieu to the land of bondage.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were tranſacting, the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines were proſecuting their piracies againſt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maritime powers in Europe. An attempt at ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation between the "invincible militia" and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal was inſtituted in November 1793, and a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe frigate was diſpatched to Algiers upon this buſineſs. The terms preſcribed by the dey were, 1,200,000 Mexican dollars for the treaſury; 600,000 dollars for the voice of the dey, and the great officers of the regency, ambaſſadorial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular preſents, equal to what Spain gave; and the payment of 150,000 dollars for the redemption of 75 Portugueſe captains. With theſe propoſitions the Portugueſe frigate ſet ſail from Algiers the 7th of November, and arrived at Liſbon ſoon after. But upon further conſideration the dey was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032877_0046_0FF5A88B8EFBE060"/>
with this ſum, and the next day he deſired capt. Logie, an Engliſh agent, to write to Portugal that he demanded 600,000 dollars for his family and friends, in addition to what he had previouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">The above terms were ſet forth in a letter of capt. O'Brien, dated at Algiers, the 28th of November 1793. When the American captives were informed that capt. O'Brien had publiſhed this exorbitant demand upon the Portugueſe, they were highly offended, and arraigned the precipitancy of the publication; becauſe ſuch diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms would have a tendency to retard, if not total<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Dutch truce expired on the 10th of December 1793. But a peace was concluded in April follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all the Dutch priſoners were liberated. The principal powers with which the Algerines are now at war, are the Portugueſe and the Pope. They declared war againſt the republic of Venice on the 26th of October 1796, the iſſue of which we have not heard. But with France, Spain, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and America they now are at peace.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of 1796, the affairs of the Danes aſſumed a very diſaſterous complexion. One of the Neapolitan cruiſers had taken a Daniſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel freighted with 300 Turks, who were bound from the Levant to Algiers. Theſe Turks were carried to Naples, where they were made ſlaves; which ſo exaſperated the dey, that he iſſued immediate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the capture of Daniſh veſſels, and thirteen ſail were ſhortly after brought into Algiers, where they were obliged to lie for four months, till the Daniſh government had negociated the ranſom o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032877_0047_0FF5A88D16110C40"/>
but their cargoes, which conſiſted chiefly of periſhable articles, were moſtly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of 1795, upwards of 200 Corſicans were captured as they were ſeeking for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral off the Barbary coaſts. While they were buſily employed in a number of fiſhing boats, under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of an Engliſh brig<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be remembered here that Corſica was one of the <hi>pearls</hi> in his Britſh Majeſty's crown; but it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evacuated by the Britiſh.</note>, two French frigates hove in ſight, and ſoon after a ſmart engagement took place between the French, and the Engliſh brig; but ſhe was ſoon captured, and the Corſican boats fled for refuge to the Barbary ſhore near Conſtantina, where they were all kidnapped by the Moors, and taken to Algiers, where they were made ſlaves. After they had amuſed themſelves among the rocks of Bublywhite for about a year, Mr. North was ſent as Britiſh agent to negociate their ranſom, and he procured their liberty upon the payment of about 120,000 dollars, beſides the promiſe of an armed veſſel.</p>
               <p>Some time in September 1796, the Engliſh ſent in a French xebeck of inconſiderable value, lately made a prize, which diſpleaſed the dey ſo much that he ordered her immediately out of the port. The commanders of two Engliſh frigates which then lay off the harbour, highly reſenting this piece of conduct, hauled their veſſels cloſe in under the caſtle on the mole, and prepared to pour a broad ſide into the city. When the dey obſerved theſe preparations, he was thrown into the moſt violent conſternation; the ſlaves were immediately ordered to clear away the lumber in the caſtle, and to get the guns in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for defence. At the ſame time the fleet of Admiral Jervis, conſiſting of 25 ſail of the line
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032877_0047_0FF5A88D16110C40"/>
was cruiſing off the harbour, and from this force, the dey expected nothing leſs than the total deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Algiers. At this critical juncture he made application to Mr. Barlow to uſe his influence with the Britiſh commanders, to diſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the beginning of June 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5, a moſt bloody and obſtinate battle was fought near Corſica, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Algerine rover of 34 guns and two Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan frigates of 20 guns each, in conjunction with one of the Pope's garda coſtas, of 10 guns and a number of ſwivels. The action laſted from ten o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon without intermiſſion, and the combatants were for the greateſt part of the time within piſtol ſhot of each other. The corſair fought under the bloody flag, and rode the greateſt part of the time between an inceſſant and well directed fire, which cut away almoſt all her rigging, and made terrible havoc among her c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew; yet the ruſſians fought with the utmoſt fury and deſperation, and attempted ſeveral times to board their enemies; but were repulſed with great loſs. In the heat of the engagement all the officers were killed, and the captain had both his legs carried away by a chain ſhot, as he was firing a blunderbuſs; yet the barbarian ſtill refuſed to be taken from the deck, and died while he was giving the word of command. This loſs did not in the leaſt intimidate the furious crew, who ſwore they would not ſubmit while a ſingle man exiſted. The Chriſtians diſplayed equal fury during the whole conflict, and were to a man determined either to conquer or die. Unfortunately one of the frigates
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032877_0048_0FF5A88E9B14DC80"/>
which made the greateſt impreſſion upon the corſair, blew up with a tremendous exploſion, and moſt of the crew periſhed.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time another diſaſter occurred. The Pope's cruiſer, after a gallant reſiſtance, was ſunk by the enemy's ſhot. The crew of the remaining frigate were then obliged to tow her away; while the corſair lay like a log upon the water, with her fore and main-maſts carried away by the board, and her hull ſo much ſhattered that the ſunk ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the action.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of July following the American priſoners ſet ſail from Algiers, and on the 19th they arrived off Marſeilles, where they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ride quarantine for 80 days; after which they were permitted to go on ſhore at that city, where Stephen Catalon, jun. the American conſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, provided a Swediſh bark for their tranſportation to America, and procured each of them a ſuit of clothes, beſides an allowance of 35 cents a day for their ſubſidence. Fourteen of their number enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board of an American ſhip at Marſeilles, to go on a trading voyage up the Mediterranean, and a few were detained by ſickneſs. Capt. Penroſe, who came with them from Algiers, went to Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant at the requeſt of Mr. Montgomery, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican conſul who reſided there, to take charge of a veſſel intended to ply between that place and Philadelphia; but ſhe not being ready, captain Penroſe returned from thence in another veſſel, and landed at Boſton.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the captives, after a reſidence of 20 days at Marſeilles, ſet ſail for the port of Philadelphia on the 12th of November, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the two ſons of the duke of Orleans, and after a paſſage of near three months, they arrived
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032877_0048_0FF5A88E9B14DC80"/>
at Marcus Hook, where the veſſel was detained by the ice which was then in the Delaware. On the 8th of February 1797, they were brought to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia in carriages, eſcorted by many hundreds of their fellow citizens who went out to meet them. Upon their arrival at the Indian Queen tavern, the ſtreets were ſo thronged as to render their paſſage difficult, and as they entered the houſe, an ardent acclamation expreſſed the ſatisfaction of the people at their return. Thoſe who had friends in the city to provide for them, retired to receive their congratulations; but it has been reported by ſome of the captives, that thoſe who were not ſo fortunately accommodated, were left entirely deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to wander the ſtreets of the city, at that incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeaſon of the year, without friends, or a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle cent to provide for their ſubſiſtence. If this be true, it reflects a diſhonor upon the humanity of our government, that theſe unfortunate men ſhould be reſcued from the regions of miſery to ſtarve in a land of freedom.</p>
               <p>It muſt inſpire the breaſts of the Americans with great regret and mortification, when they reflect upon the exorbitant ſums of money that have been expended in the negociation of the Algerine treaty, beſides the annual payment to the dey of 12,000 Algerine ſequins<note n="*" place="bottom">The value of the Algerine ſequin (pronounced <hi>ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

and would almoſt induce one to arraign the negociation as highly impolitic, were there not a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of incurring the imputation of a want of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                              <head>In the execution of the buſineſs with which Baring and Co. have been entruſted, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Mr. Pinckney, from time to time, every material circumſtance which has occurred; but as the preſent poſition is extremely critical and important, they will endeavor to ſtate as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a narrative as poſſible from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the buſineſs, for the conſideration and determination of Mr. King.</head>
                              <p>March 7, 1795. The Preſident of the Bank re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Baring and Co. 800,000 dollars in certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of 6 per cent ſtock, with orders to ſell the ſame without cauſing a depreſſion in the prices, and thus injuring the credit of American funds. The net proceeds, after deducting the uſual commiſſions, are to be held at the diſpoſal of Col. David Humphreys;
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032877_0052_0FF5A8A2CFC99488"/>
and we are directed to inform Col. Humphreys of the progreſs we may make, from time to time, in the ſales of the ſtock, and alſo of the terms upon which remittances can be made to Cadiz or Leghorn. This contains nearly the whole of our orders, or at leaſt the whole of what we conceive to be neceſſary for the information of Mr. King, in the preſent moment; the further letters from America being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly anſwers to our numerous letters, and do not contain a ſyllable of diſapprobation with regard to our conduct, but the reverſe.</p>
                              <p>March 31. Col. Humphrey writes from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, that we would furniſh him with information, aſſiſtance, &amp;c. directed to him at Liſbon.</p>
                              <p>April 28. We wrote very fully to Col. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys, communicating every information relative to the probable ſale of the ſtock, and the various means by which he could execute his commiſſion through London, Cadiz, Liſbon, and Italy in general.</p>
                              <p>May 19. We wrote ſtill more fully, in anſwer to his letter of the 31ſt March, wherein we offered to anticipate a conſiderable ſum, on the value of the effects in our hands, for which there was no demand at the moment. We explained to him the value of the Italian coin, thoſe of Spain being well known; mentioning that it was eaſier to procure money at Leghorn, where there was no reſtraint, than at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz where dollars were more plentiful, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation was excluſively in the bank of St. Charles, from whom it was difficult to obtain permiſſion. That we could procure any quantity in London: to which we added the names of our correſpondents at the different places, offering every ſervice in our power, direct or indirect.</p>
                              <p>May. 18. Col. Humphreys adviſes his arrival at Gibraltar.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="102" facs="unknown:032877_0053_0FF5A8A4541C5C78"/>
July 21. We adviſe Colonel Humphreys that we had ſold, 300,000 dollars:—that we were ready to pay 100,000, to his order; and if he wanted a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſum, we deſired to be informed.</p>
                              <p>July 27. Colonel Humphrey directs us to pay 40,000 dollars to Mr. Deas, for Mr. Andrews, which was immediately complied with, by a credit on Hamburgh, for that value.</p>
                              <p>July 30. We inform Colonel Humphreys that having made further progreſs in our ſales, we ſhould hold the whole of the value of the 800,000 dollars at his diſpoſal: meaning to furniſh, by anticipation, the value of that part which remained at that time unſold, if the ſervice of the United States requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</p>
                              <p>November 28. Is the next letter from Colonel Humphreys, and the commencement of our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;—he informs us, that he ſhould ſend the Sophia, for the purpoſe of receiving Portugal gold and Spaniſh dollars, in London, to the amount of 650,000 Spaniſh dollars. He further opens credit in favour of Meſſrs. Dohrman, of Liſbon, which from the ſcarcity of paper at the time was effected to a very trifling amount.</p>
                              <p>This letter was followed and confirmed by others from Colonel Humphreys, dated the 16th, 22d, and 24th December, of a ſimilar tenor, or very nearly ſo, and the arrival of the brig Sophia from Liſbon.</p>
                              <p>Although Col. Humphreys has not mentioned to us the reaſons of this proceeding, we may impute it to the advice contained in our letter of the 19th May, and indeed the well known facility with which a ſum of that deſcription could be procured in London, of Spaniſh dollars, having ourſelves never experienced the leaſt difficulty in diſappointments for large ſums.</p>
                              <p>

December 22. We anſwered theſe letters, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Colonel Humphreys of the impoſſibility to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Portugal gold, none having been received for many years. Of the extraordinary turn which had appeared with regard to bullion, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the immenſe drains upon this country, for carrying on the war, and which has finally compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the miniſter to abandon his favorite project of a ſecond loan to the emperor; but as the difficulty had only begun to appear, we hoped that with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, we ſhould be able to collect the dollars for the purpoſe of executing the orders of Col.

Finding it impoſſible to procure gold, and no ſilver arriving, we ſubmitted the whole of the orders and correſpondence to Mr. Pinckney; when it was determined to purchaſe ſuch ſilver as might arrive; but, at all events, to detain the Sophia, which could not be wrong, as the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds would have prevented her ſailing.</p>
                              <p>In the mean while we wrote to Meſſrs. Pariſh and Co. of Hamburgh, to know whether Portugal gold or Spaniſh dollars could be obtained in that place.</p>
                              <p>January 19. 26—February 2, 12. Are letters we wrote to Colonel Humphreys, wherein we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with our proſpects, from time to time, that Pariſh and Co. gave us reaſon to hope for the execution of a part of the order, but that no ſilver had arrived in London.</p>
                              <p>February 16. Having determined, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Mr. Pinckney, to ſend the Sophia to Hamburg, in conſequence of the encouragement of Meſſrs. Pariſh and Co. on applying to capt. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he obſerved that it was contrary to his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were to return to Liſbon: And as conſiderable doubts exiſted about proceeding to

                              <p>On this occaſion, and under this date, we wrote to Colonel Humphreys, by the brig Sophia, and by the packet, acquainting him with our diſappointment in toto; which we accompanied, at the intimation of Mr. O'Brien, with letters of credit on Madrid and Cadiz; and, in order to finiſh this part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as a juſtification for permitting the Sophia to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, we ſhould obſerve, that if ſhe had been detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ſix months, we could not have procured one half of the quantity of Spaniſh dollars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                              <p>March 1. We adviſed Colonel Humphreys that we had received a large ſum in bills, drawn from Leghorn, on the Britiſh government; being for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſent to Algiers, and which appeared afterwards to be for the releaſe of the Corſican priſoners.</p>
                              <p>March 21,—29. Are anſwers to letters from Col. Humphreys, relative to our accounts, chiefly dated the 27th February, and 9th March, which we do not notice, concluding that he was ſatisfied, as nothing appears in reply to us; but as there was reaſon to fear the buſineſs could not be executed in Spain, the government there refuſing a licence, notwithſtanding the endeavors of Meſſrs. Joyes and Sons, aided by the American miniſter or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                              <p>April 1. We wrote to Meſſrs. Fonnereau, of Leghorn, not only to open the neceſſary credit, but to explain to them, in a full and confidential manner, the nature and extent of our preceding diſappointments; requeſting (with the approbation of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032877_0054_0FF5A8B281C798D0"/>
Mr. Pinckney and Col. Humphreys) that they would convey to Algiers ſuch information as ſhould ſatisfy the dey, that the delay in paying the money did not ariſe from the want of funds, credit, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours on the part of the United States, but muſt be ſolely attributed to the political convulſions in Europe, which had annihilated the uſual channels or modes of procuring the coin for the purpoſe.</p>
                              <p>It is unneceſſary to quote dates of letters, as there appears but one opinion on the ſubject, namely, "that the buſineſs muſt finally be done at Leghorn, and both Mr. Pinckney and Col. Humphreys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend moſt earneſtly that the information al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to ſhould be conveyed to Algiers.</p>
                              <p>April 19. Fonnereau anſwer our letter of the 1ſt, promiſing to follow the orders of Col. Humphreys, and that—would communicate to Algiers every thing we had deſired.</p>
                              <p>June 17. Fonnereau adviſe the delivery to them, on that day, of the orders from Col. Humphreys, to pay to the order of Mr. Donaldſon, 400,000 Spaniſh milled dollars, which they acquaint him ſhall be immediately complied.</p>
                              <p>June 19. Mr. Donaldſon acquaints Meſſrs. Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereau, that he ſhould accept the ſum; and on a meeting between them and—, the price of the dollars, with that of Agio, was ſettled to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of—</p>
                              <p>June 20,—24. Fonnereau drew for what money they could procure, and on the 14th write, "en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed you have Mr. Donaldſon's receipt for dols. 140,000, paid to him by order of Col. Humphreys: This buſineſs might have been completely finiſhed by our giving to Mr. Donaldſon bills on you, or on Hamburg, for the remaining 260,000 dollars, which—offered to negociate for him, and to

give him a receipt for the whole 400,000 dollars, which he engaged to ſhip to Algiers; but a certain diffidence on his ſide, would not permit him to ſign receipts to us, for more than he had abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in caſh."</p>
                              <p>June 27. The French entered Leghorn, and Fonnereau embarked on board an Engliſh frigate.</p>
                              <p>July 15. Mr. Donaldſon draws on us for the ſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>This queſtion leads to a ſtate of the account, with an eſtimate of the effects in our hands. On the original ſum ſent to us, we have only ſold 560 m. dollars, the price having fallen at one time ſo low as 82, and believing that government would feel reluctant to ſell under 90, we had determined to anticipate on the value of the remainder, waiting for our reimburſement in the due time.</p>

And conſidering the diſtance between the two countries, eighteen months from the date of this treaty ſhall be allowed for procuring ſuch paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.

In caſe of any diſpute ariſing from a violation of any of the articles of this treaty no appeal ſhall be made to arms, nor ſhall war be declared on any pretext whatever.

And he, by virtue of his ſignature to this treaty, engages for himſelf and his ſucceſſors, to declare the juſtice of the caſe according to the true interpretation of the treaty, and to uſe all the means in his power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the obſervance of the ſame.</p>

               <p>THE kingdom of Algiers is ſituated between 32 and 37 degrees of north latitude, which correſponds to that of the United States from near the ſouthern boundary of Virginia to near the river Savannah in Georgia, and between 76 and 84 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 20 minutes eaſt longitude from Philadelphia. It extends 480 miles in length from eaſt to weſt along the northern coaſt of Africa, and 320 miles in breadth from north to ſouth. It is bounded by the Mediterranean on the north, by the kingdom of Tunis on the eaſt, by mount Atlas on the ſouth, and by the river Mulvia, which ſeparates it from the empire of Morocco, on the weſt, At the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of 120 miles from the ſea-coaſt, that part of Africa becomes a barren d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſart, almoſt entirely uninhabitable either by man or beaſt.</p>
               <p>This country derives its name from its metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, and is at preſent divided into three provinces or diſtricts, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the eaſtern, weſtern, and ſouthern.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032877_0067_0FF5A8E7F569A138"/>
The eaſtern, or Levantine government, which is by far the moſt conſiderable of the three, and is alſo called <hi>Beylick,</hi> contains the towns of Bona, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, Gigeri, Bugia, Steffa, Tebef, Zamoura, Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara, and Necanz, in all which the Turks have their garriſons: beſides which, it includes the two ancient kingdoms of Cuco and Labez, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Algerine government, to whoſe forces their country is inacceſſible; ſo that they ſtill live under their own cheyks, choſen by each of their adowars or hords. To theſe may be added a French factory at Calle, under the direction of the company of the French Baſtion.—The weſtern government includes the towns of Oran, Trem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE moſt conſiderable rivers of Algiers, are 1. The Zha or Ziz, which croſſes the province of Tremeſen, and the deſart of Anguid, along the frontier of Fez, and falls into the Mediterranean near the town of Tabecrita, where it takes the name of Sirut. Its water is clear and full of fiſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Hued-Habra, which falls into the Ziz near the plains of Cirek. Along its banks live ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſperate Arabs, who are troubleſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the province of Oran.</p>

the plains of Bathala, waters that city and Mina, and falls into the ſea near the town of Arzew. This river has lately received the name of <hi>Cena,</hi> from that of a Moabite who repeopled the town of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thala, which had been deſtroyed by the Berime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. The Celef, ſuppoſed to be the Carthena of the ancients, falls into the ſea about three leagues weſt of Algiers, after a ſhort courſe of 18 or 20 leagues.</p>

It abounds with fiſh, of which ſuch immenſe quantities are caught that they are neglected. While they city of Bugia was in the hands of the Chriſtians, as Marmol tells us, the mouth of this river was ſo choaked up with ſand, that no veſſels could came up into it: but in 1555, very ſoon after it was taken by the Moors, the great rains ſwelled it to ſuch a degree, that all the ſand and mud was carried off; ſince which time the galleys and other trading veſſels have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it with eaſe, where they lie ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>SOIL, CLIMATE and PRODUCTIONS.</head>
                  <p>THIS country conſiſts of eighteen provinces, the climate of which, along the ſea-coaſts, is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly delightful, and the air pure and ſerene.</p>
                  <p>The country of Algiers, and the ſtates of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary in general, under the Roman empire were juſtly denominated the garden of the world; and to have a reſidence there was conſidered as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtate of luxury. The produce of their ſoil for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe magazines which furniſhed all Italy, and a great part of the Roman empire with corn, wine and oil.</p>
                  <p>The ſoil is covered with almoſt a perpetual ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and is extremely fertile, particularly on the mountainous parts to the weſt of Tenez, Bugia, and Algiers Proper, which produce wheat and fruit in the greateſt perfection; and the northern parts of Tremeſen, towards the ſea, abound in excellent paſture grounds, But as we advance into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it becomes more parched and barren.</p>
                  <p>Though the lands are now uncultivated, through the barbarity and oppreſſion of their government, yet they ſtill produce not only corn, wine, and oil
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032877_0068_0FF5A8E97B95E418"/>
in the greateſt abundance, but dates, raiſins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, apples, pears, cherries, plums, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, &amp;c. and plenty of roots and herbs grow in their kitchen gardens. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hemp and flax grow on their plains; and by the report of thoſe who have travelled thither, the country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abounds with all that can add to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of life.</p>
                  <p>Extreme heat is not common, and the climate is ſo temperate that the heat of ſummer never dries the leaves of the trees, nor the cold of winter makes them fall; ſo that they are conſtantly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. In February they begin to bud, and in May ſhew their fruit in full growth, which is ripe in June. Their vines are very large and thick, and the bunches of grapes on them are commonly a foot and an half long. The grapes are fit to gather in June, and the figs, peaches, nectarines, olives, nuts, &amp;c. in Auguſt. The people find means to evade the sobriety preſcribed by the Mahometan law, and make free with excellent wines and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their own growth and manufacture. The plains of Moligia produce wheat, barley and oats, two or three times a year. Their melons are of an exquiſite-taſte; ſome of which ripen in ſummer, and others in winter. Algiers produces beſides, ſalt-petre, and great quantities of excellent ſalt; and lead and iron have been found in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>The country round the city of Algiers is very fertile. Country ſeats, gardens and groves of trees are numerous. The Algerines are unacquainted with the art of pruning and grafting trees. Their gardens are not walled, but fenced round with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſpecies of thorns, which, from their prickles, and the compactneſs with which their branches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweave
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032877_0069_0FF5A8EB080085E0"/>
are well adapted for that purpoſe. Among other rich tracts in the province of Algiers Proper, the great plain of Met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ijah is admired for its aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing fertility. It is fifty miles in length, twenty in breadth, and includes many villas, fragant groves, and delightful gardens. The ſoil produces ſuch a profuſion of the moſt delicious fruits, rice, roots, and grain of every ſpecies, that the inhabitants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy annually two, and frequently three crops.</p>

                  <p>NEITHER the elephant nor the rhinoceros are to be found in the States of Barbary; but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts abound with lions, tigers, leopards, hyaenas, and monſtrous ſerpents. The Barbary horſes were formerly very valuable, and thought equal to the Arabian. Camels and dromedaries, aſſes, mules, and kumrahs (a moſt ſerviceable creature, begot by an aſs upon a cow) are their beaſts of burden. Their ſheep yield but indifferent fleeces, but they are very large, as are their goats, Bears, buffaloes, wild boars, porcupines, foxes apes, hares, rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, ferrits, weaſels, moles, cameleons, and moſt kinds of reptiles are found here.</p>
                  <p>There is a peculiar kind of animal, called the <hi>gapard,</hi> which can eaſily be tamed, and is made uſe of for hunting like a dog. The head of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of a cat; the hind legs are longer than the fore, and the tail is finely mottled. It is ſo apt to exhauſt itſelf in running that the hunters are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to carry it now and then on their horſes, till it has recovered itſelf. There is alſo another curious animal which is between a dog and a fox.</p>
                  <p>"Beſides vermin," ſays Dr. Shaw, ſpeaking of his travels through Barbary, "the apprehenſions we were under in ſome parts of this country, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

"They were much bigger than our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graſs-hoppers, having brown ſpotted wings, with legs and bodies of a bright yellow. Their firſt appearance was towards the latter end of March, the wind having been for ſome time ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly; and in the middle of April their numbers were ſo vaſtly increaſed, that in the heat of the day, they formed themſelves into large bodies, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a ſucceſſion of clouds, and darkened the ſun.

Accordingly in the month following, their young brood began gradually to make their appearance, and it was ſurpriſing to obſerve, that no ſooner were any of them hatched, than they immediately collected themſelves together, each of them forming a compact body of ſeveral hundred yards in ſquare: which marching afterwards directly forward, clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed over trees, walls, and houſes, ear up every plant in their way, <hi>and let nothing eſcape them.</hi> The inhabitants, to ſtop their progreſs, made tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches all over their fields and gardens, and filled them with water; or elſe placing in a row great quantities of heath, ſtubble, and ſuch like combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſet them on fire upon the approach of the locuſts. But all this was to no purpoſe; for the trenches were quickly filled up, and the fires put our by infinite ſwarms ſucceeding one another, whilſt the front ſeemed regardleſs of danger, and the rear preſſed on ſo cloſe, that a retreat was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible."</p>

                  <p>THESE matters are well worth the attention of an antiquary, but they are difficult of acceſs. The reader muſt naturally conclude that the countries which were once under the dominion of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenians, and the pride of the Phoenician, Greek, and Roman works, are replete with the moſt curious remains of antiquity, but they lie ſcattered among ignorant and barbarous inhabitants. Some remains of the Mauritanian and Numidian greatneſs are ſtill viſible, and many ruins which bear evidence of their ancient grandeur and populouſneſs. Theſe point out the old Julia Caeſarea of the Romans, which was little inferior in magnificence to Carthage itſelf. A few of the aqueducts of Carthage are ſaid to be ſtill remaining, but no ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The ſame is the fate of Uttica, and many other renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cities of antiquity; and ſo over-run is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with barbariſm, that their very ſcites are not known even by their ruins, amphitheatres, and other public buildings which ſtill remain in tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſervation. Beſides thoſe of claſſical antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many Saracen monuments of the moſt ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous magnificence, are likewiſe found in this tract of country. Theſe were erected under the califs

of Bagdad, and the ancient kings of the country, before it was ſubdued by the Turks, or reduced to its preſent form of government. Their walls form the principal fortifications in the country, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and maratime. We know of few or no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral curioſities belonging to the States of Barbary, except its ſalt pits, which is ſome places take up an area of ſix miles. Doctor Shaw mentions ſprings found here that are ſo hot as to boil a large piece of mutton in a quarter of an hour.</p>
                  <p>The hot baths of Meereega in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the city of Algiers are alſo natural curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities. The principal one is twelve feet ſquare and four feet deep. The water is very hot, and when it has filled the larger baſon, it runs through into another of a ſmaller ſize, where the Jews bathe, for they are not permitted to uſe the ſame bath with Mahometans. Theſe hot fountains are conjectured to proceed from the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſulphur, nitre, and other inflamable ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the bowels of the earth. To this cauſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been aſcribed thoſe earthquakes, to which the whole country, and Algiers in particular, is frequently ſubjected.</p>
                  <p>The city of Algiers has few ſubjects of antiquity, and little that merits the attention of the curious. There are, however, upon the tower of the great moſque ſome broken inſcriptions; but the letters, though ſufficiently large to be ſeen at a diſtance, are ſo filled up with lime and whitewaſh that they cannot be particularly diſtinguiſhed.</p>

                  <p>But the moſt numerous inhabitants are the Moors and Arabs, who trace their deſcent from thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Mahomet, who formerly ſubdued this country; the former compoſe the great body of the inhabitants of the towns. But it may readily be ſuppoſed that among ſuch a variety of different ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, immenſe numbers cannot be ſaid to belong to any particular tribe or nation whatever.</p>
                  <p>In this country there are many wandering bands of theſe Arabs, who live together in camps, and remove from one place to another as they want paſture for their herds and flocks, or as: any other accidental circumſtance happens to make it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. They ſometimes pay rent to landlords in corn, fruit, honey, wax, and other productions; and the dey likewiſe demands a tribute from them. The excellence of the climate renders this ſimple way of living tolerable, though the tents of theſe people are mean, their utenſils of little value, and their lodgings filthy. The family and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals lie promiſcuouſly in the ſame tents together, except their dogs, which are left as guards
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032877_0072_0FF5A8FD846E9908"/>
on the outſide. They raiſe conſiderable numbers of bees, and ſilk worms. They ſubſiſt chiefly on bread, rice and fruit, Wine and ſpiritous liquors are almoſt entirely unknown to them.</p>
                  <p>The dreſs of the men who compoſe theſe tribes is only a long piece of coarſe cloth wrapped round their ſhoulders, and falling down to their ancles, with a cap of the ſame ſtuff. The ſheik, or chief of a tribe, wears a cap a of fine cloth. The women pay ſome more attention to the ornamental part of their dreſs; but their children are ſuffered to go ſtark naked till ſeven or eight years of age.</p>
                  <p>The cuſtoms, language and religion of theſe ſhepherds bear a ſtrict affinity to thoſe of Arabia. They are robuſt, and of a ſwarthy complexion. The men are active, the women prolific and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren healthy. They have neither to encounter the hardſhips incident to the life of a North American ſavage, nor are their conſtitutions enſeebled, as is the caſe in manufacturing towns, by ſedentary and unhealthy employments.</p>
                  <p>When a young man of theſe tribes would marry, he drives a number of cattle to the hut where the parents of his miſtreſs reſide. The bride is ſet on horſeback, and led home amidſt the ſhouts of a croud of young people, who have been invited to the nuptial feaſt. When ſhe arrives at the hut of her lover, a mixture of milk and honey is given her to drink, and a ſong, ſuitable to the occaſion, is ſung. She then alights, and is preſented with a ſtick, which ſhe thruſts into the ground, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats ſome words to the following effect: <q>As this ſtick is faſtened in the earth, ſo am I in duty bound to my huſband; as nothing but violence can remove it, ſo death alone ſhall force me from his love.</q> She then drives his ſtock to
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032877_0072_0FF5A8FD846E9908"/>
water and back again, to ſhew her willingneſs to perform any duty that he may aſſign her. Theſe previous ceremonies being ſettled, all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enter the hut, and the evening concludes with the greateſt feſtivity that theſe people are capable of enjoying. After the marriage the wife is obliged to wear a veil, and ſhe never ſtirs from her hut for the ſpace of a month,</p>
                  <p>The Arabs are ſtout, warlike, and ſkilful horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Their principal arms are a ſhort lance and ſcymitar, and they are likewiſe acquainted with the bow and the muſket. But they are ſo addicted to robbing, that one cannot ſafely travel through the country at a diſtance from the towns without a guard, or at leaſt a marabout or ſaint for a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. For they look upon themſelves to be the original proprietors of the country, and not only as diſpoſſeſſed by the reſt of the inhabitants, but redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them to the loweſt ſtate of poverty, and in conſequence they make no ſcruple to plunder all they meet by way of repriſal.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of this country, eſpecially thoſe near the ſea-coaſts, generally ſubſiſt by piracy; they are allowed to be bold intrepid mariners, and will fight deſperately when they meet with a prize at ſea. They are, notwithſtanding, far inferior to the Engliſh, and other European ſtates, both in the conſtruction and management of their veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of the metropolis are extremely vicious; and it is a general obſervation that the more diſtant the people are from the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the purer are their manners. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their poverty, they have much vivacity about them, eſpecially thoſe who are of Arabic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, which gives them an air of contentment; and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032877_0073_0FF5A8FF0AB322C0"/>
having little to loſe, they are peaceable among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Turks who compoſe the military force, have great privileges, pay no taxes, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from public puniſhment. The loweſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier domineers over the moſt diſtinguiſhed Moors at pleaſure. The people are ſubjected to the moſt abſolute deſpotiſm, and moſt cruelly oppreſſed by a handful of inſolent Turks, the refuſe of the ſtreets of Conſtantinople. If a Turk finds a Moor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mounted than himſelf, he takes the liberty of exchanging horſes without leave or ceremony, and he will take apples, oranges, nuts and other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which the Moors bring to market, with as much indifference as if they were his property. The Turks have the excluſive privilege of carrying fire-arms. Such is the deſpotiſm of the Turkiſh ſoldiers that they not only turn others out of the way in the ſtreets, but will go to the farm houſes in the country for twenty days together, living on free quarters, and making uſe of every thing, not excepting the women. They are uſed more like men of quality than private centinels. They are lodged in ſpacious ſquares, attended by ſlaves, and generally maintained at the public expence.

Some good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, however, diſtinguiſh them, notwithſtanding this exceſs of deſpotiſm. They never game for money, nor even trifles; and what cannot be ſaid of Chriſtians, they never profane the name of the Deity.

                  <p>The Algerines in general, particularly about the ſea-coaſts, have a pretty fair complexion; but thoſe

in the interior parts of the country, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Arabs, are ſwarthy They are robuſt and well proportioned, and expert in the uſe of fire arms. The Algerine women are beautiful in their perſons, and very delicate in their complexions, but the men are ſun-burnt.

                  <p>The Algerines by their law may have four wives, but they uſually content themſelves with two, or three at the moſt.

The arms and legs of the wearer are bare; but they have ſlippers on their feet, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of rank ſometimes wear buſkins. They never move their turbans, but pull off their ſlippers when they attend religious duties, or the perſon of their ſovereign. They are fond of ſtriped and fancied ſilks. The viceroy and great men let their beards

grow; but the common people ſhave both their head and face, and only leave a pair of whiſkers, and a lock of hair upon the top of the head, by which they fancy they are drawn up to paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>The dreſs of the common people is very plain; they wear a pair of linen drawers over their ſhirt, and a looſe white woolen jacket with a hood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, or a mantle which is commonly black, and reaches only down to the knee, in which they wrap themſelves; but in ſummer they only wear two ſhirts.</p>
                  <p>The men of faſhion go more ſumptuouſly clad. Their gowns are made of fur, ſilk, or cloth: they have rich garments finely embroidered with flowers of gold; their turbans are very curiouſly done up, and elegantly adorned with jewels; and their legs are covered with boots of ſhining leather.</p>
                  <p>The women pay more attention to the ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of dreſs than men. There is not, however, much difference between the dreſs of the ſexes; the drawers of the women are longer, and inſtead of a turban, they wear a ſort of cawl on their heads. They tie their hair behind, and ornament it with jewels and other trinkets. They wear fine col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars about their necks, bracelets about their wriſts, large pendants in their ears, and curious caps on their heads. When they go abroad they uſually throw over their faces a fine veil, which they faſten to their breaſt, and over their garments they wear an upper robe; ſo that they are not known, but by the ſlaves that attend them.</p>

                  <p>THE Algerines are void of all literature. The original language of this country appears to have
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032877_0075_0FF5A90FC52853E8"/>
been the Phoenician; after which the Romans obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to exchange it (as they did all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered dominions) for their own. The Arabs af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terwards introduced theirs, and after them the Turks. The native Moors make uſe of the Moreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; but the people of Algiers in general ſpeak a compound of Arabic, Moreſco, and the remains of the ancient Phoenician language. In the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis the Mahometans and Chriſtians uſe the <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> a mixture of Spaniſh, Portugueſe, Italian and French. The natives of all denominations for the moſt part, underſtand this dialect, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being the proper language of any country on the coaſt of the Mediterranean, has a kind of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal currency all over that quarter of the world, as the channel of information for people who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand each other through any other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. The public buſineſs of the nation is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted either in the Arabic or Turkiſh, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the former, in which their late treaty with the United States of America is written.</p>
                  <p>It is curious that in converſation, the Turks tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their nouns and verbs, in the ſame manner that the Greek and Latin writers have done. The Turkiſh is a lofty language, and the Turks when they ſpeak affect a ſingular majeſty of tone, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of their ſuperiority: which, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in nothing but their indolence, for they are neither men of learning, nor warriors,—a truth that the Ruſſians have long taught them.</p>

                  <p>THOUGH Algiers has ſome appearance of a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary republic, yet it is in fact the moſt horrible of all monarchies in the world, and as mutable in its
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:032877_0076_0FF5A91195E6BC38"/>
principles as the temper and diſpoſition of thoſe differ, who happen to be in adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>Algiers was formerly ſubject to the Grand Signior, and is ſtill under his protection; but the dey at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pays no other tribute to him, than that of a certain number of beautiful Arabian horſes, and ſome other preſents which are ſent thither annually. The Grand Signior formerly ſent a baſhaw, or viceroy, to Algiers, in whom the ſovereignty was veſted; but thoſe officers frequently exerciſed the moſt tyrannical power, and exacted from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuch exorbitant taxes, as produced popular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections; till at length the Janiſaries and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia grew ſo powerful that they depoſed them and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected others in their ſtead; at which the Porte was obliged to connive, leſt they ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to an open revolt, and entirely throw off the Turkiſh yoke; ſince which time the power of the Porte has been ſo gradually diminiſhed that he can do nothing here without the concurrence of the dey.</p>

He is elected by the divan, and is compelled to accept the reins of government under penalty of death. He ſeldom ſecures his office without tumult and bloodſhed, and often falls by the dagger of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin: ſo that out of ſix deys that have reigned ſince 1700, four of them have been actually mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and a fifth reſigned to ſave his life. The baſhaws ſeldom fail of forming parties among the ſoldiers againſt him, and they make no ſcruple to aſſaſſinate him even in council, and the ſtrongeſt candidate then fills his place. An unſucceſsful

expedition, or too pacific a conduct, ſeldom fails to put an end to his life and government.</p>
                  <p>The way in which his authority is exerciſed, correſponds with that by which it has been obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When Mr. Bruce, as Britiſh reſident at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, had occaſion to viſit the dey, he ſays he ſometimes found him in his hall of audience, with his clothes all beſpattered with blood like thoſe of a carcaſe butcher. It is a very frequent amuſement with him, to cauſe the heads of his ſubjects to be ſtruck off in his preſence. Mr. Bruce ſaid that he knew of one man who was exceuted for no greater offence than becauſe a gun-flint was found upon him. His indictment and trial were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: "You raſcal, what buſineſs have you with a flint unleſs you were going to conſpire againſt the ſtate?"</p>
                  <p>The firſt deys were elected by the militia; who were then called the divan, or common council; which was at firſt compoſed of 800 militia officers, without whoſe concurrence he could do nothing; and upon ſome urgent occaſions, all the officers, reſiding in Algiers amounting to 1500, were ſummoned to aſſiſt: but at preſent he is perhaps the moſt deſpotic prince in the world. He is abridged of no power whatever in adminiſtration, and the divan, though they have aſſumed a very pompous title, have little elſe to do but to ratify his decrees. The divan is compoſed of perſons entirely of his own election whom he removes at pleaſure. Upon important occaſions he ſometimes aſſembles the divan to receive their advice; but his only motive in this is to ſcreen himſelf againſt popular diſcontents; for his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is unlimited, and he may either ratify or reject their deciſions as he pleaſes. When the Grand
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032877_0077_0FF5A91321B009E8"/>
Signior is at war with a Chriſtian power, he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally requires his aſſiſtance; but he is only obeyed as the dey thinks proper.</p>
                  <p>The dey has a corps of body-guards called foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks. This is a very neceſſary, though ſometimes a fruitleſs precaution, as any Turkiſh ſoldier who has the courage to murder him, ſtands an equal chance of becoming his ſucceſſor. Experiments of this kind are ſometimes made. Since the beginning of the preſent century, ſix private ſoldiers entered into a conſpiracy to kill a dey of one of the ſtates of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary. They gave him a mortal wound in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and in the midſt of a croud of people. He expired, exclaiming, <q>Has nobody the courage to kill the villain?</q> One of the conſpirators, the intended ſucceſſor, inſtantly aſcended the vacant throne, and brandiſhing his naked ſcymitar, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>that he would do juſtice to all!</hi> His five aſſociates went about the hall to enforce the title of their new ſovereign, and none preſent ſeemed to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any diſturbance about what had happened. He kept his ſituation unmoleſted, for about ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, till an old veteran unobſerved took aim at him with a muſket, and ſhot him dead. Upon this the five others were immediately murdered. But what ſhowed the nature of the government in its proper light was the obſervation of the new dey, who ſaid, that if the uſurper could have held his place for twenty minutes longer, he would have obtained the ſovereignty.</p>
                  <p>The officer next in power to the dey is the Caſſan-aga or Caſſan-ajee, the prime miniſter of ſtate. He keeps one ſet of the keys of the treaſury, the dey another, and the aga a third, where they all attend once a month to pay the ſoldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="unknown:032877_0077_0FF5A91321B009E8"/>
The officer next in power is the Aga or general of the Janiſaries, who is one of the oldeſt officers in the army, and holds his poſt as all other officers do, at the pleaſure of the dey. During the time the aga enjoys his dignity, the keys of the metropolis are delivered to him. All military orders are iſſued in his name, and the ſentence of the dey upon any offending ſoldier, whether capital or not, can only he executed in the court of his palace.</p>
                  <p>The next to the aga in dignity, is the Secretary of State, who regiſters all the public acts; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him the Hojecabei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, who is a kind of chief juſtice to ſettle diſputes among the Moors. This officer, and the two laſt mentioned, attend at the door of the dey's palace every morning about day-break, in order to kiſs his hand.</p>
                  <p>The next in dignity is the Vekelard, or rather Vikelhadge of the marine, who is the guardian of the navy, from whom all maritime orders iſſue. He is ſeated beneath an arch near the ſea-ſide called the <hi>ſkiff,</hi> from which he has a full view of the tranſactions in the marine.</p>
                  <p>Below him ſits the Baleck baſhaw, who is a kind of bailiff to execute his commands. He takes charge of the magazines of the marine; all naval articles are under his inſpection, and the keys of all the magazines in the town are entruſted to his care.</p>
                  <p>The Hojee of the Rap has the charge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of wheat in the town; under him are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inferior hojees who execute his orders. No ſlave can riſe higher than this office.</p>
                  <p>The Warden Baſhaw is the next inferior officer. He is chief overſeer of the ſlaves, and takes care that they duly perform their duty. He has charge of the Bagnio Gallaro, the keys of which are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:032877_0078_0FF5A914A6603418"/>
him every night by one of his under wardens who keeps the doors. He has a number of under wardens, who attend the ſlaves at their labour.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe there are 30 chiahs, or chows, a kind of high conſtables, who ſit next to the aga in the divan, and in the ſame gallery with him. Out of this claſs are generally choſen thoſe who go em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to foreign courts, or who diſperſe the dey's orders throughout the realm. Next to them are a number of baleck-baſhaws, or eldeſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who are promoted to that of chiah baſhaws, according to their ſeniority. The oldack-baſhaws, or lieutenants, are next; who amount to 400, and are regularly raiſed to the rank of captains in their turn, and to other employments in the ſtate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilities. Theſe by way of diſtinction wear a leather ſtrap, hanging down to the middle of their back. One rule is ſtrickly obſerved in the rotation of theſe troops from one deputy to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the right of ſeniority; one ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of which would cauſe an inſurrection, and probably coſt the dey his life.</p>
                  <p>The other military officers of note are vekelards, or purveyors of the army; the peys, who are the four oldeſt ſoldiers, and conſequently the neareſt to preferment; the foulacks, who are the next in ſeniority to them, and are part of the dey's body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, always marching before him when he takes the field, and diſtinguiſhed by their carbines and gilt ſcymitars, with a braſs gun on their caps; the kayts, or Turkiſh ſoldiers, each band of whom have the government of one or more adowars, or itenerant villages, and collect their taxes for the dey; and the ſagiards, or Turkiſh lancemen, 100 of whom always attend the army, and watch over the water appointed for it. To theſe we may add
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032877_0078_0FF5A914A6603418"/>
the beys, or governors of the three great provinces of the realm. All the above-mentioned officers ought to compoſe the great divan: but only the 30 chiah-baſhaws have a right to ſit in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery next after the dey. The reſt are obliged to ſtand on the floor of the hall, or council-chamber, with their arms acroſs, and, as much as poſſible, without motion; neither are they permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their ſwords on. As for thoſe who have any matters to tranſact with the divan, they muſt ſtand without, let the weather be ever ſo bad; and there they are commonly preſented with coffee by ſome of the inferior officers, till they are diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Liſberos are the dey's ſpies, who keep watch in different parts of the town, for the purpoſe of obtaining information of what is ſaid or tranſacted. They are perhaps the moſt mercenary and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſet of beings in exiſtence, and ſuch is their ſervility to their ſovereign, that they would betray even their own fathers. When they lodge informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt any perſon, the chows are ſent to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the delinquent, and he is puniſhed according to his crime.</p>
                  <p>The divan, or douwan, is the common council of the nation. It is an elective body, and is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally compoſed of 30 chiah-baſhaws, with now and then the mufti and cadi upon ſome emergencies; and on the election of a dey the whole ſoldiery are allowed to come in and give their votes. All the regulations of ſtate ought to be determined by this aſſembly, before they paſs into a law, or the dey has power to put them in execution. But, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years back, the divan is of ſo little account that it is only convened out of formality, and to give aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what the dey and his favourites have previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerted. They, however, arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032877_0079_0FF5A922EE110F70"/>
the whole power of the ſtate, and in their edicts or national ordinances they aſſume the pompous title of, "We the great and ſmall members of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and invincible militia of Algiers and of the whole kingdom, do ordain," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All cauſes whether civil or criminal, in which the ſoldiers are concerned, are tried in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but thoſe between the citizens are decided before one of the chiah-baſhaws, and the plaintiffs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants always plead their own cauſes without the aſſiſtance of attornies. The evidence of two witneſſes is always required, and he who is caſt upon any trial receives a number of blows with a cudgel, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled beſides to comply with the ſentence that has been paſſed.</p>
                  <p>While the divan are convened the dey holds a fan of feathers in his hand, and ſits croſs-legged, after the manner of taylors, upon a large table about two feet high, covered with a ſhaggy carpet. Six of the principal chiahs are ſeated in the ſame manner on his right, and ſix on his left. The reſt of the members ſtand at both ends of the table, and form a kind of circle.</p>
                  <p>The method of gathering votes in this auguſt aſſembly is perfectly agreeable to the character of thoſe who compoſe it. The aga, or the preſident <hi>pro tempore,</hi> firſt propoſes the queſtion; which is immediately repeated with a loud voice by the chiah-baſhaws, and from them echoed again by four officers called <hi>baſhaldalas;</hi> from theſe the queſtion is repeated from one member of the divan to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſtrange contortions, and the moſt hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous growlings, if it is not to their liking. From the loudneſs of this growling noiſe the aga is left to gueſs, as well as he can, whether the majority of the aſſembly are pleaſed or diſpleaſed with the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032877_0079_0FF5A922EE110F70"/>
queſtion; and from ſuch a prepoſterous method, it is not ſurpriſing that theſe aſſemblies ſhould ſeldom end without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> tumult or diſorder. As the whole body of the militia is concerned in the election of a new dey, it is ſeldom carried on without blows and bloodſhed: but when once the choice is made, the perſon elected is ſaluted with the words <hi>Alla Barick,</hi> "God bleſs and proſper you:" and the new dey uſually cauſes all the officers of the divan who had oppoſed his election to be ſtrangled, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up their places with thoſe who had been moſt zealous in promoting it. It is true it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Porte; but that is ſeldom refuſed, as the diſpoſitions of the people are ſo well known.</p>
                  <p>From this account of the election of the deys, it cannot be expected that their government ſhould be at all ſecure; and as they arrive at the throne by tumult and bloodſhed they are generally deprived of it by the ſame means, ſcarcely one in ten of them having the good fortune to die a natural death.</p>

                  <p>THE Algerines pay but little attention to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the improvement of their country, and their ſingular genius leads them ſo much to the profeſſion or piracy that they neglect all internal reſources or advantages that might be derived from their own country. The corſairs or pirates form each a ſmall republic, of which the rais or captain is the ſupreme baſhaw; who with the officers under him, form a kind of divan, in which every matter relative to the veſſels is decided in an arbitrary way. Theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs are chiefly inſtrumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032877_0080_0FF5A9247606D750"/>
way of merchandize or prizes. Theſe conſiſt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of gold and ſilver ſtuffs, damaſks, cloths, ſpices, tin, iron, plated braſs, lead, quickſilver, cordage, ſailcloth, bullets, cochineal, linen, tartar, allum, rice, ſugar, ſoap, cotton raw and ſpun, copperas, aloes, brazil and logwood, vermilion, &amp;c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world: the oil, wax, hides, pulſe, and corn produced, being but barely ſufficient to ſupply the country; though, before the loſs of Oran, the merchants have been known to ſhip off from one or other the ports of Barbary ſeveral thouſand tons of corn. The conſumption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewiſe ſo conſiderable in this kingdom, that it is ſeldom permitted to be ſhipped off for Europe.</p>
                  <p>The other exports conſiſt chiefly in oſtriches' fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, copper, ruggs, ſilk ſaſhes, embroidered hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs, dates, and Chriſtian ſlaves. Some manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures in ſilk, cotton, wool, leather, &amp;c. are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in this country, but moſtly by the Spaniards ſettled here, eſpecially about the metropolis. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are alſo a manufacture of the country, which, though much inferior to thoſe of Turkey both in beauty and fineneſs, are preferred by the people to lie upon, on account of their being both cheaper and ſofter. There are alſo at Algiers looms for velvet, taffaties, and other wrought ſilks; and a coarſe ſort of linen is likewiſe made in moſt parts of the kingdom. The country furniſhes no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for ſhip-building. They have neither ropes, tar, ſails, anchors, nor even iron. When they can procure enough of new wood of form the main tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a ſhip, they ſupply the reſt from the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of prizes which they have made, and thus find the ſecret of producing new and ſwift ſailing veſſels
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032877_0080_0FF5A9247606D750"/>
from the ruins of the old. The Algerines are more formidable at ſea than any other nation on the coaſt of Barbary, and the ſea-faring people are held in great eſteem for the prizes they capture.</p>
                  <p>The fleet of this regency at preſent does not amount to more than ten or eleven ſail of the line, though they were formerly much more powerful, and in the time of Pinchinin their fleet amounted to 65 ſail of the line. At ſea they have been regarded as the moſt deſperate and ferocious ſet of beings in the world. But this ſeems a falſe prejudice that nations have imbibed, and according to recent accounts they are inferior in naval tactics to every nation in Europe. Almoſt all our late captives concur in the opinion that four American frigates, well manned and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, would be a force ſufficient to reduce them. Though the Turks are ſo proud and arrogant, yet it is well known that they are no warriors. Their greateſt diſplay of bravery is at the firſt onſet, but if they meet with a ſpirited reception from a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent force their vanquiſhment is certain. Even the Moors, though they are an illiterate barbarous race, are ſuperior warriors to the Turks. In their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs the moſt ſervile part of the duty is aſſigned to the Moors, while the Turks ſpend their time in ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and in indolence, except when they come to an engagement with an enemy, when they fight with ſmall arms and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Since the eſtabliſhment of the independence of North America we owe the ſecurity of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in a great meaſure to the wars that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted between the Algerines, the Portugueſe, and the Dutch, either of which nations is much ſuperior

Before the Algerine treaty American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſeldom entered into the Mediterranean; and when they did ſo, they derived their ſecurity either from forged or purchaſed Mediterranean paſſports. A Britiſh ſhip has for her protection a paſs written upon a large ſheet of parchment, which has by way of ornament ſome daſhes engraved or drawn with a pen upon the margin. The Algerines can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read Engliſh, and a captain of a corſair would moſt probably forfeit his head were he to carry a Britiſh veſſel by miſtake, as a prize into the harbour of Algiers.

Dr. Shaw ſays, that the taxes of the whole kingdom produce yearly to the dey no more than 300,000 dollars; but he ſuppoſes that the eighth part of the prizes to which he is entitled, the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:032877_0081_0FF5A92604627F60"/>
property of thoſe perſons who die without children, to whom the dey falls heir, with the preſents from foreign nations, fines and oppreſſions, joined to the yearly contribution raiſed by the government, may amount to as much more. He is beſides entitled to all Chriſtian ſlaves, whoſe ranſoms are his perquiſites, which, with the cuſtoms paid by the Engliſh, French and other nations, who are ſuffered to trade with the Barbary States, will tend conſiderably to augment his revenue. Both the dey, and officers under him, enrich themſelves by the moſt open acts of rapine and fraud; it is therefore no wonder to find the common people impoſing upon one another, and eſpecially upon ſtrangers, ſeeing they themſelves are impoveriſhed by heavy taxes and the injuſtice of thoſe who are in authority.</p>
                  <p>The dey draws immenſe revenues from his own ſubjects, which conſiſt in money, gold, ſilver, corn, cattle, and ſuch other articles as may be moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Turks in Algiers. The prizes which the corſairs take at ſea, ſome years equal the taxes on the people. It is from hence eaſy to collect that any calculation of revenue muſt be extremely queſtionable, and it can hardly be ſuppoſed that the dey himſelf is capable of giving an accurate eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>

They are neither actuated by juſtice nor humanity; but with the aſſiſtance of theſe Turkiſh oppreſſors they not only enforce ſubjection to the dey, but compel the Moors to the payment of ſuch taxes as they think proper. This miſerable race of beings, who are the objects of every indignity and oppreſſion that can be offered to human nature, are hunted like wild beaſts among the mountains: thoſe who diſcover the leaſt reluctance in paying the aſſeſſments of theſe baſhaws, or fly from the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of their purſuers, are beheaded and all their property confiſcated. If they have the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that a Moor has concealed any part of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he is tortured till he makes a complete diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and many of theſe poor wretches who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make any diſcloſure are tortured to death, without being able to ſatisfy their tormentors. In this manner all gold, ſilver and other valuable arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, are extorted from the inhabitants. Some of them, however, have courage enough ſometimes to attack their oppreſſors in ſome of the narrow defiles of the mountains through which they are obliged to paſs, where they frequently make great ſlaughter among the Turks; but generally after the firſt fire they fly for refuge to the craggy receſſes of the mountains. They make theſe tax gathering excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions twice a year, and in every expedition they bring away immenſe numbers of heads and ears, which are ſent to the dey, as an evidence of the baſhaws' exertions in having raiſed the neceſſary contributions.

rebellion; in which caſe they are either hanged on an iron hook, or ſtrangled with a bow-ſtring, which is tied round the neck of the offender, and drawn different ways by two executioners, with all their ſtrength, ſo that he is inſtantly diſpatched. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men guilty of adultery, have a halter tied about their necks, with the other end faſtened to a pole, by which they are held under water till they are ſuffocated.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian ſlaves are liable to a variety of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. They are ſometimes burned or rather roaſted alive. At other times they are impaled. This is done by placing the criminal on the end of a ſharp ſtake, which is thruſt up his poſteriors cloſe by the back-bone, till it appears above his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Crucifixion, by nailing the hands and feet to walls, is often practiſed.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt terrible puniſhments are thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the Jews or Chriſtians who ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Mahometan religion; in which caſe they muſt either turn Mahometan, or be impaled alive. If they afterwards apoſtatize, they are roaſted alive, or elſe thrown down from the top of the city walls, upon iron hooks. Theſe catch by the jaws, the ribs, or other parts of the body, according as they happen to fall, and the ſufferers have been known to hang in different poſitions for ſeveral days alive, in the moſt exquiſite torture; though by accident they are ſometimes put out of pain at once, as was the caſe with John Gaſcon the Spaniſh adventurer, as before related. This terrible puniſhment has frequently been inflicted upon ſlaves, but at preſent it begins to be generally diſuſed.</p>
                  <p>There is a law here, by which any woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of an amorous correſpondence with a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, is tied up in a ſack and thrown into the ſea.

Examples of this kind frequently happen, as the fair ſex, in this part of the world, are remarkably frail.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſingular puniſhment which is inflicted upon a gallows, which ſhews the ſavage diſpoſition of the people. Upon each ſide of the gallows, near the upper angle, are fixed two chains of different lengths, to each of which is faſtened a ſharp hook. The malefactor aſcends the ladder with the executioner, who thruſts the hook on the ſhorteſt chain through the palm of his left hand; after which he thruſts that on the longeſt chain through the ſole of his right foot, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the criminal is left hanging in the moſt excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating torture for the ſpace of three of four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he expires.</p>
                  <p>The weſtern Moors ſtill practiſe the barbarous puniſhment of ſawing the tranſgreſſor aſunder; which is moſtly inflicted upon perſons of diſtinction for crimes againſt the ſtate. For which purpoſe they prepare two boards of the ſame length and breadth with the delinquent, and having tied him between them, they proceed to the execution by beginning at the head. In this manner did Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaſh ſuffer, who was formerly their ambaſſador to the Britiſh court.</p>
                  <p>For clipping or debaſing the public coin, the old Egyptian puniſhment is ſtill inflicted here, which is cutting off both the hands of the tranſgreſſor.</p>

belly, back, or ſoles of the feet, according to the pleaſure of the cadi, who appoints the number, which ſometimes amount to 200 to 300, according to the indulgence the offender can obtain either by bribery or friends; and hence he often dies under this puniſhment, for want of advocates ſufficiently powerful. The moſt uſual mode of baſtinading is upon the ſoles of the feet. The criminal is laid on his back or belly, his feet are raiſed and tied to a ſtake, held faſt by officers for the purpoſe, and in this poſture the puniſhment is inflicted by a number of ſticks tied together, of the thickneſs of one's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger. A Moor convicted of houſe-breaking, has his right hand cut off and faſtened about his neck.

                  <p>Mahomet, or Mohammed, ſtyled, the <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> was born about the end of the 6th century of the Chriſtian aera. He came into the world under many diſadvantages. His father Abd'allah was a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſon of Abd'a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Abd'almotaleb was therefore obliged to take care of his grandchild Mahomet; which he not only did during his life, but at his death enjoined his eldeſt ſon Abu Taleb, who was brother to Abd'allah by the ſame mother, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for him for the future, which he very affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately did, and inſtructed him in the buſineſs of a merchant, which he followed; and to that end he
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032877_0085_0FF5A939B83AF560"/>
took him into Syria when he was but thirteen years old. He afterwards recommended him to Khadijah, a rich widow, for her factor, in whoſe ſervice he behaved himſelf ſo well, that by making him her huſband ſhe ſoon raiſed him to an equality with the richeſt in Mecca.</p>
                  <p>After he began by this advantageous match to live at his eaſe, he formed the ſcheme of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new religion, or, as he expreſſed it, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting the only true and ancient one profeſſed by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moſes, Jeſus, and all the prophets, by deſtroying the groſs idolatry into which the generality of his countrymen had fallen, and weeding out the corruptions and ſuperſtitions which the latter Jews and Chriſtians had, as he thought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into their religion, and reducing it to its primitive purity, which conſiſted chiefly in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of one God.</p>
                  <p>Before he made any attempt abroad, he rightly judged that it was neceſſary for him to begin with the converſion of his own houſehold. Having therefore retired with his family, as he had done ſeveral times before, to a cave in mount Hara, he there opened the ſecret of his miſſion to his wife Khadijah; and acquainted her that the angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel had juſt before appeared to him, and told him that he was appointed the apoſtle of God. Khadijah received the news with great joy: ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him in whoſe hands her ſoul was, that ſhe truſted he would be the prophet of his nation.</p>
                  <p>Encouraged by ſo good a beginning, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed, and try for ſome time what he could do by private perſuaſion; not daring to hazard the whole affair by expoſing it too ſuddenly to the public.</p>

This was done, and about 40 of them came; but Abu Laheb, one of his uncles, making the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany break up before Mahomet had an opportunity of ſpeaking, obliged him to give them a ſecond invitation the next day; and when they were come, he made the following ſpeech to them; "I know no man in all Arabia who can offer his kindred a more excellent thing than I now do to you; I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you happineſs both in this life, and that which is to come; God Almighty hath commanded me to call you unto him: Who, therefore, among you will be aſſiſtant to me herein, and become my brother and my vicegerant?" All of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the matter, Ali at length roſe up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would be his aſſiſtant; and vehemently threatened thoſe who ſhould oppoſe him. Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met upon this embraced Ali with great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of affection, and deſired all thoſe who were preſent to hear and obey him as his deputy;
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032877_0086_0FF5A93B41AA99538"/>
at which all the company broke out into a great laughter.</p>
                  <p>This repulſe, however, was ſo far from diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mahomet, that he began to preach in public to the people, who heard him with ſome patience till he came to upbraid them with the idolatry and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of themſelves and their fathers: which ſo exaſperated them, that they declared themſelves his enemies; and would ſoon have accompliſhed his ruin had he not been protected by Abu Taleb. The chief of the Koreiſh threatened him with an open rupture if he did not prevail on Mahomet to deſiſt. At this Abu Taleb was ſo far moved, that he earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly diſſuaded his nephew from purſuing the affair any farther, repreſenting the great danger of ſuch an undertaking. But Mahomet was not to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated, and told his uncle plainly, <hi>that if they ſet the ſun againſt him on his right hand, and the moon on his left, he would not leave his enterpriſe.</hi> Abu Taleb ſeeing him ſo firmly reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, uſed no further arguments, but promiſed to ſtand by him againſt all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Koreiſh, finding they could neither prevail by fair words, nor by menaces, tried what they could do by force and ill treatment; uſing Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met's followers ſo very injuriouſly, that it was not ſafe for them to continue at Mecca any longer; whereupon Mahomet gave leave to ſuch of them as had not friends to protect them, to ſeek for refuge elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixth year of his miſſion, Mahomet had the pleaſure of ſeeing his party ſtrengthened by the converſion of his uncle Hamza, and Omar Ebn al Kattab, who was at firſt a violent oppoſer of the prophet.

made ſo great a progreſs among the Arab tribes, that the Koreiſh, to ſuppreſs it effectually if poſſible, in the ſeventh year of Mahomet's miſſion, made a ſolemn league againſt the Haſhemites and the family of Abd'almotaleb, engaging themſelves to contract no marriages with any of them; and to give it the greater ſanction, reduced it into wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and laid it up in the Caaba.</p>
                  <p>The families in conſequence continued at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for three years; but in the 10th year of his miſſion Mahomet told his uncle Abu Taleb, that God had manifeſtly ſhewed his diſapprobation of the league which the Koreiſh had made againſt them, by ſending a worm to eat out every word of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument except the name of <hi>God.</hi> Of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Mahomet had probably ſome private notice: for Abu Taleb went immediately to the Koreiſh, and acquainted them with it; offering, if it proved falſe, to deliver his nephew up to them; but in caſe if were true, he inſiſted that they ought to lay aſide their animoſity, and annul the league they had made againſt the Haſhemites. To this they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced; and going to inſpect the writing, to their great aſtoniſhment found it to be as Abu Taleb had ſaid; and the league was thereupon declared void.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year Abu Taleb died at the age of above fourſcore; and about a month, or, as ſome write, three days after his death, Mahomet had the additional mortification to loſe his wife, who had ſo generouſly made his fortune. For which reaſon this year is called <hi>the year of mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the death of theſe two perſons, the Koreiſh began to be more troubleſome than ever to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, inſomuch that he found himſelf obliged to ſeek for ſhelter at Tayef, where he applied himſelf to two of the chief of the tribe of Thakif, who then
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032877_0087_0FF5A94ACA8705C8"/>
were the inhabitants of that place; but they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very coldly: and he was ſoon afterwards obliged to depart from thence and return to Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where he put himſelf under the protection of the Al Motaam Ebn Adi.</p>
                  <p>This repulſe greatly diſcouraged his followers: but Mahomet notwithſtanding boldly continued to preach to the public aſſemblies at the pilgrimage, and gained many proſelytes among them.</p>
                  <p>In the 12th year of his miſſion Mahomet gave out that he made his night-journey from Mecca to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and from thence to heaven, ſo much ſpoken of by all that write of him.</p>
                  <p>This ſtory ſeemed ſo ridiculous that ſeveral of his followers left him in conſequence, and would probably have ruined the whole deſign, had not, Abu Beker vouched for his veracity, and declared, that if Mahomet affirmed it to be true, he verily believed him. Which happy incident not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved the prophet's credit, but encreaſed it to ſuch a degree, that he was afterwards able to make his diſciples ſwallow whatever he pleaſed to impoſe on them. This fiction, notwithſtanding its extravagance, was one of the moſt artful contrivances Mahomet ever deviſed, and what chiefly contributed to the raiſing of his reputation to that great height to which it afterwards arrived.</p>
                  <p>In this year, called by the Mahometans <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted year,</hi> twelve men of Yathreb or Medina, came to Mecca, and took an oath of fidelity to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet at al Akaba, a hill on the north of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; after which Mahomet ſent one of his diſciples, named Maſab Ebn Omair, home with them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them more fully in the grounds and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his new religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="unknown:032877_0088_0FF5A94C51D717C8"/>
Maſab being arrived at Medina, by the aſſiſtance of thoſe who had been formerly converted, gained ſeveral proſelytes, and Mahometaniſm was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ſo rapidly that there was ſcarce a houſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were not ſome who had embraced it.</p>
                  <p>The next year, being the 13th of Mahomet's miſſion, Maſab returned to Mecca, accompanied by 73 men and two women of Medina, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Mahomet their aſſiſtance, which he readily accepted; as he was in the moſt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from his powerful adverſaries in Mecca. Out of this number Mahomet choſe twelve perſons, who were to have the ſame authority among them as the <hi>twelve</hi> apoſtles of Chriſt had among his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto Mahomet had propagated his religion by fair means; ſo that the whole ſucceſs of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, before his flight to Medina, muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed ſolely to perſuaſion. For before his ſecond oath of fealty or inauguration, at al Akaba, he had no permiſſion to uſe any force at all; nor would he ſuffer it. And he was far from allowing it in his followers; but exhorted them to bear patiently thoſe injuries which were offered them on account of their faith. But this great paſſiveneſs ſeemed entirely owing to the great ſuperiority of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers for the firſt twelve years of his miſſion; for no ſooner was he enabled, by the aſſiſtance of thoſe of Medina, to oppoſe his enemies, than he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that God had permitted him and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to attack the inſidels, to deſtroy idolatry, and to eſtabliſh the true faith by the ſword; for he found by experience, that his deſigns would otherwiſe have proceeded very ſlowly, and he well knew that innovators, when they depend ſolely on their own ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

run much riſk; from whence, ſays Machiavel, it follows, that all the armed prophets have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the unarmed ones have failed.</p>
                  <p>That Mahomet had a right to take up arms for his own-defence, may perhaps be allowed; but whether he ought afterwards to have eſtabliſhed his religion by compulſion is not ſo eaſy to determine. Having provided for the ſecurity of his companions as well as his own, by the league offenſive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive which he had now concluded with thoſe of Medina, he directed them to repair thither, which they accordingly did; but he himſelf, with Abu Beker and Ali ſtaid behind, having not yet receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the divine permiſſion, as he pretended, to leave Mecca. The Koreiſh, fearing the conſequence of this new alliance, began to think it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prevent Mahomet's eſcape to Medina; and having held a council thereon, they came to a reſolution that he ſhould be killed: and agreed that a man ſhould be choſen out of every tribe for the execution of this deſign; each of whom ſhould have a blow at him with his ſword, that the guilt of his blood might fall equally on all the tribes, to whoſe united power the Haſhemites were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, and therefore durſt not attempt to revenge their kinſman's death.</p>
                  <p>This conſpiracy was ſcarcely formed, before it came to Mahomet's knowledge; and he gave out that it was revealed to him by the angel Gabriel, who had now ordered him to retire to Medina. Whereupon, to amuſe his enemies, he directed Ali to lie down in his place, and wrap himſelf up in his green cloak, which he did; and Mahomet eſcaped miraculouſly, as they pretend, to Abu Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's houſe, unperceived by the conſpirators, who had already aſſembled at the prophet's door. They,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:032877_0089_0FF5A94DDA4BC020"/>
in the mean time, looking through the crevice, and ſeeing Ali, whom they took to be Mahomet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſleep, continued watching there till morning, when Ali aroſe, and they found themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>From Abu Beker's houſe Mahomet and he went to a cave in mount Thur, to the ſouth-eaſt of Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where they lay hid three days to avoid the ſearch of their enemies; which they very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped, and not without the aſſiſtance of more miracles than one: for ſome ſay that the Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiſh were ſtruck with blindneſs, ſo that they could not find the cave; others, that after Mahomet and his attendants were got in, two pigeons laid their eggs at the entrance, and a ſpider covered the mouth of the cave with her web, which made them look no further. Abu Beker, ſeeing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in imminent danger, became very ſorrowful; whereupon Mahomet comforted him with theſe words recorded in the Koran, <hi>Be not grieved, for God is with us.</hi> Their enemies being retired, they left the cave, and ſet out for Medina, by a by-road; and having fortunately eſcaped ſome who were ſent to purſue them, arrived ſafely at that city; whither Ali followed them in three days, after he had ſettled ſome affairs at Mecca.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing Mahomet did after his arrival at Medina, was to build a temple for his religious worſhip, and a houſe of his own accommodation.</p>
                  <p>After being ſecurely ſettled there, and able not only to defend himſelf againſt the inſults of his enemies, but to attack them, he began to ſend out ſmall parties to make repriſals on the Koreiſh; the firſt party conſiſting of no more than nine men, who intercepted and plundered a caravan belonging to that tribe, and in the action took two priſoners. But,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032877_0089_0FF5A94DDA4BC020"/>
what eſtabliſhed his affairs very much, and was the foundation on which he built his ſucceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was the gaining the battle of Beder, which was fought in the ſecond year of the Hegira, and is famous in the Mahometan hiſtory. Some reckon no leſs than twenty-ſeven expeditions wherein Mahomet was perſonally preſent, in nine of which he gave battle, beſides ſeveral other expeditions in which he was not preſent. His forces he maintained partly by the contributions of his followers for this purpoſe, which he called by the name of <hi>zacat</hi> or <hi>alms,</hi> and the paying of which he very artfully made one main article of his religion; and partly by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a fifth part of the plunder to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the public treaſury for that purpoſe, in which matter he likewiſe pretended to act by the divine direction.</p>
                  <p>In a few years, by the ſucceſs of his arms, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he ſometimes came off by the worſt)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he conſiderably raiſed his credit and power. In the ſixth year of the Hegira he ſet out with 1400 men to viſit the temple of Mecca, not with any intent of committing hoſtilities, but in a peaceable manner. However, when he came to al Hodeibiya, which is ſituated partly within and partly without the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred territory, the Koreiſh ſent to let him know that they would not permit him to enter Mecca, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he forced his way; whereupon he called his troops about him, and they all took a ſolemn oath of homage to him, and he reſolved to attack the city; but thoſe of Mecca ſending Arwa Ebn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſud, prince of the tribe of Thakif, as their ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, to deſire peace, a truce was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them for ten years, by which any perſon was allowed to enter into a league either with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, or with the Koreiſh, as he thought fit.</p>

It may not be improper, in order to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable veneration and reſpect the Mahometans by this time had for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſaid he had been at the courts both of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man emperor and the king of Perſia, and never ſaw any prince ſo highly reſpected by his ſubjects as Mahomet was by his companions: for, whenever he made the ablution, in order to ſay his prayers, they ran and catched the water that he had uſed; and whenever he ſpit they immediately liked it up, and gathered every hair that fell from him with great ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh year of the Hegira, Mahomet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of propagating his religion beyond the bounds of Arabia; and ſent meſſengers to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring princes, with letters to invite them to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm. Nor was this project without ſome ſucceſs. Khoſru Parviz, then king of Perſia, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his letter with great diſdain, and tore it in a paſſion, ſending away the meſſenger very abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which when Mahomet heard, he ſaid <hi>God ſhall tear his kingdom.</hi> And ſoon after a meſſenger came to Mahomet from Badhon king of Yaman, who was a dependent on the Perſians, to acquaint him that he had received orders to ſend him to Khoſru. Mahomet put off his anſwer till the next morning, and then told the meſſenger it had been revealed to him that night that Khoſru was ſlain by his ſon Shiruyeh; adding, that he was well aſſured his new religion and empire should riſe to as great a height as that of Khoſru; and therefore bid him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe his maſter to embrace Mahometaniſm. The meſſenger being returned, Badhan in a few days received a letter from Shiruyeh, informing him of

his father's death, ordering him to give the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet no further diſturbance. Whereupon Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han and the Perſians with him turned Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</p>
                  <p>The emperor Hera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lius, as the Arabian hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans aſſure us, received Mahomet's letter with great reſpect, laying it on his pillow, and diſmiſſed the bearer honorably. And ſome pretend that he would have profeſſed this new faith, had he not been afraid of loſing his crown.</p>
                  <p>Mahomet wrote to the ſame effect to the king of Ethiopia, and to Mohawkas, governor of Egypt, who gave the meſſenger a very favorable reception, and ſent ſeveral valuable preſents to Mahomet, and among the reſt two beautiful girls, one of which, named Mary, became a great favorite with him. He alſo ſent letters of the like purport to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arab princes: particularly one to al Hareth Ebn Abi Shamer king of Ghaſſean, who returning for anſwer that he would go to Mahomet himſelf, the prophet ſaid, <hi>May his kingdom periſh;</hi> another to Hawdha Ebn Ali, king of Yamana, who was a Chriſtian, and, having ſome time before profeſſed Iſlamiſm, had lately returned to his former faith; this prince ſent back a very rough anſwer, upon which Mahomet curſing him, he died ſoon after: and a third to al Mondar Ebn Sawha, king of Bah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, who embraced Mahometaniſm, and all the Arabs of that country followed his example.</p>
                  <p>The eighth year of the Hegira was a very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate year to Mahomet. In the beginning of it, Khaled Ebn al Walid and Amru Ebn al As, both excellent ſoldiers, the firſt of whom afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Syria and other countries, and the latter Egypt, became proſelytes to Mahometaniſm. And ſoon after the prophet ſent 3000 men againſt the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:032877_0091_0FF5A95E4317E690"/>
Grecian forces, to revenge the death of one of his ambaſſadors, who, being ſent to the governor of Boſra on the ſame errand as thoſe who went to the above-mentioned princes, was ſlain by an Arab, of the tribe of Ghaſſan, at Muta, a town in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Balka in Syria, near which they encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Grecians being vaſtly ſuperior in number (for, including the auxiliary Arabs, they had an army of 100,000 men) the Mahometans were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed in the firſt attack, and loſt ſucceſſively three of their generals, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Zeid Ebn Haretha Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met's freedman, Jaafar the ſon of Abu Taleb, and Abdallah Ebn Rawaha: but Khaled Ebn al Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, ſucceeding to the command, overthrew the Greeks with great ſlaughter, and brought away abundance of rich ſpoil; on occaſion of which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet gave him the title of <hi>Seif min ſoyuf Allah,</hi> "one of the ſwords of God."</p>
                  <p>In this year Mahomet took the city of Mecca, the inhabitants whereof had broken the truce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on two years before. For the tribe of Beker, who were confederates with the Koreiſh, attacking thoſe of Khozaah, who were allies of Mahomet, killed ſeveral of them, being ſupported in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a party of the Koreiſh themſelves. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this violation, Abu Soſian himſelf made a journey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o Medina on purpoſe to heal the breach and renew the truce: but in vain: for Mahomet, glad of this opportunity, refuſed to ſee him: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he applied to Abu Beker and Ali: but they giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him no anſwer, he was obliged to return to Mecca as he came.</p>
                  <p>Mahomet immediately gave orders for prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made, that he might ſurprize the Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans while they were unprovided to receive him: in a little time he began his march thither; and by
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032877_0091_0FF5A95E4317E690"/>
the time he came near the city, his forces were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to 10,000 men. Thoſe of Mecca, being not in a condition to defend themſelves againſt ſo formidable an army, ſurrendered at diſcretion, and Abu So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ian ſaved his life by turning Mahometan. About 28 of the idolaters were killed by a party under the command of Khaled; but this happened contrary to Mahomet's orders, who, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the town, pardoned all the Koreiſh on their ſubmiſſion, except three men and one woman who were put to death, the reſt obtaining pardon on their embracing Mahometaniſm.</p>
                  <p>The remainder of this year Mahomet employed in deſtroying the idols in and about Mecca, ſending ſeveral of his generals on expeditions for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to invite the Arabs to Iſlamiſm: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is no wonder if they now met with ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The next year being the ninth of the Hegira, the Mahometans call <hi>the year of embaſſies:</hi> for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabs had been hitherto expecting the iſſue of the war between Mahomet and the Koreiſh: but as ſoon as that tribe, the principal of the whole nation, and the genuine deſcendants of Iſhmael, whoſe prerogatives none offered to diſpute, had ſubmitted, they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that it was not in their power to oppoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet; and therefore began to come into him in great numbers, and to ſend embaſſies to make their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, both to Mecca, while he ſtaid there, and alſo to Medina, whither he returned this year. Among the reſt, five kings of the tribe of Hamyar profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mahometaniſm, and ſent ambaſſadors to notify the ſame.</p>
                  <p>In the tenth year, Ali was ſent into Yaman to propagate the Mahometan faith there, and, as it is ſaid, converted the whole tribe of Hamdan in one day. Their example was quickly followed by all
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032877_0092_0FF5A95FCC84BA28"/>
the inhabitants of that province, except only thoſe of Najran, who, being Chriſtians, choſe rather to pay tribute.</p>
                  <p>In the eleventh year Mahomet died; thus was Mahometaniſm eſtabliſhed, and idolatry rooted out even in Mahomet's time, throughout all Arabia, except only Yamana, where Moſeilama, who ſet up alſo for a prophet as Mahomet's competitor, had a great party, and was not reduced till the kalifat of Abu Beker, and the Arabs being then united in one faith, and under one prince, found themſelves in a condition of making thoſe conqueſts, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Mahometan faith over ſo great part of the world.</p>
                  <p>The moſque which contains Mahomet's tomb, ſtands nearly in the center of Medina, which, in conſequence, is called the <hi>moſt holy city.</hi> It is a magnificent ſtructure, ſupported by 400 ſtately co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, and lighted up with 300 ſuperb lamps of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior luſtre, which are kept continually burning. It has a ſmall tower covered with plates of ſilver, and the floor is covered with a cloth of gold. It is more viſited than any city in the world except Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Mahomet's coffin ſtands under the cupola. It has long been the vulgar opinion that this coffin is made of ſteel, and ſuſpended in the air by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of two magnets, but this notion is erroneous, and has long ago been exploded. The tomb lies expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to view from the middle to the bottom of the dome, and is ſurrounded by a ſmall wall, which is pierced with windows ſenced with ſilver grates. The inſide is adorned with precious ſtones of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe value, eſpecially on that part of the cupola which is over the head of the prophet. Over his feet is placed a golden creſcent of exquiſite work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and ſparkling with the moſt coſtly bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liants.
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032877_0092_0FF5A95FCC84BA28"/>
A canopy of the moſt elegant embroidery is extended above, and over the coffin is thrown a rich pall of gold and ſilver tiſſue, which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſent thither by the baſhaw of Egypt, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Grand Signior, and with the greateſt magnificence. It is commonly carried upon the back of a ſtately camel, and when the precious gift is taken off, the beaſt is no longer uſed in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile drudgery.</p>
                  <p>The place where the coffin lies, is ſupported by pillars of black marble, and encompaſſed with a baluſtrade of ſilver, hung with ſuch a number of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lamps, that the ſmoke darkens the place. The cupola is hung with white and red damaſk, and has theſe words embroidered upon it in Arabic letters of gold, <hi>God is God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</hi> The place is a hundred paces long and ninety broad; it has two gates and a vaulted nave. The concourſe of pilgrims that reſort to this dome is aſtoniſhing, and every Muſſulman is bound by his religion to viſit this tomb at leaſt once in his life; after which he is for ever regarded as a ſaint.</p>
                  <p>The firſt article of the Mahometan religion is that <hi>there is no God but the true God, and Mahomet is his apoſtle.</hi> The Alcoran enjoins the belief of angels; and teaches that they are pure and ſubtle bodies, that there is no diſtinction of ſexes among them, and that they do not propagate their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that they have various forms and offices; that ſome adore God in different poſtures, and others ſing praiſes to him or intercede for mankind.</p>
                  <p>Mahomet named to devil <hi>Eblis</hi> from his deſpair. He was one of the angels called <hi>Azazil,</hi> who are in God's immediate preſence, and he fell for refuſing to pay homage to Adam at God's command.

                  <p>The next article of the Mahometan faith is the doctrine of the reſurrection; but the time is known to none but God alone. Mahomet converſed with Gabriel upon this ſubject; but the angel acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his ignorance of the time.

                  <p>They believe in paradiſe, which they imagine to be ſituated above the ſeven heavens, or in the ſeventh immediately under the throne of God; and to repreſent the amenity of the place they ſay that the earth of it is of the fineſt wheat flour, or of the pureſt muſk; that its ſtones are pearl and jacinths, the walls of its buildings are embelliſhed with gold and ſilver, and that the trunks of all its trees are of pure gold; among which the moſt remarkable is the tree <hi>Tuba,</hi> or the tree of happineſs, which ſtands in Mahomet's palace, and a branch of it extends to the abode of every true believer; that the boughs are loaded with the moſt exquiſite fruits of ſurpriſing bigneſs, and of taſtes unknown to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; of which if a man deſire to eat the branches will bend down and preſent him their fruit; that this tree will ſupply him with the richeſt garments of ſilk; that beaſts will burſt forth from the fruit, adorned with the richeſt trappings ready for true

               </argument>
               <p>THERE are few towns of any conſequence, even along the ſea-coaſts; though when ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively under the dominion of Carthage and Rome, it abounded with populous cities. All the ſea-port towns, except the metropolis, are thinly peopled; thoſe in the interior part of the country ſtill more ſo, and they are inhabited by a haughty robuſt people, who trade into Biledulgerid and the country of the blacks.</p>
               <p>BONA is ſuppoſed to be the ſame place with the antient Hippo, a ſea-port built by the ancients. It was formerly the capital of the province of Bona. It lies on the Mediterranean ſea, and there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fiſhery near it. It is a town of no importance, and of ſlender population. In this part of the world, elegant architecture has, for many centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, been utterly forgotten or deſpiſed. The buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Bona, as every where elſe, are therefore mean. It is expoſed to the incurſions of the Arabs. The name of this people is uſed by travellers in a very indefinite manner. Algiers is at the diſtance of ſome hundreds of leagues from Arabia: but as this part of Africa was formerly conquered by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                  </gap>, the name is ſtill applied to a race of tawny and independent barbarians, who wander in gangs about the country, and unite the double profeſſion of a ſhepherd and a robber. Bona was formerly a magnificent city. Its grandeur is now only to be traced in the ruins of a monaſtery. It has a fortreſs, and a garriſon of three hundred Turks, as theſe banditti chuſe to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; a Turk being the moſt reputable character in that country. Theſe adventurers however are not Turks, but the ſweepings of all nations blended together. They are commanded by an aga, who is likewiſe governor of the town. Bona was taken by Charles V. in his expedition to Tunis, but was not long after recovered by its former maſters.</p>
               <p>CONSTANTINA is ſituated on the river Sef Gomar, forty-eight miles from the ſea-coaſt. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its preſent name from that of a princeſs, the daughter of the emperor Conſtantine, to whom it is indebted for its magnificence. The ſituation is on a peninſula, difficult of acceſs, except towards the ſouth-weſt. It is one mile in circumference, well fortified, and contains many fragments of ancient architecture. In particular there is a part of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bridge; and near it is a large ſubterraneous aqueduct, which terminates in a caſcade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> State cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals are ſometimes precipitated down this place, and daſhed to pieces againſt the rocks at its bottom. A bey reſides here, and has under his command three hundred Turkiſh horſe, and one thouſand five hundred Mooriſh ſoldiers. The inhabitants of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantina are ſaid to be opulent and haughty. This city was formerly the reſidence of a race of kings who governed the province of Conſtantina, of which it is the metropolis; but in the year 1520, the

Some ſplendid ruins exiſt in the vicinity of Conſtantina. Upon the ſea-coaſt, at a ſmall diſtance from it, are the traces of a Roman colony, anciently called Colo. It is ſituated on a high rock, and has a garriſon. Adjoining to it is a French factory, to which the Moors bring hides, wax, and wool, for ſale. At no great diſtance are the remains of the ancient city of Stora. It is ſaid that the mountainous part of this te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>GIGERI is ſituated about fifteen miles from Bona. It contains about fifteen hundred houſes, and the inhabitants are very poor. It is defended by a fort and a ſmall garriſon. The natives of this part of the country are independent and barbarous. They retire, when circumſtances require it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible faſtneſſes, and ſet the dey of Algiers at defiance. Ships, when wrecked on this coaſt, are plundered, and the crews are treated with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſavagenſs. In this reſpect, however, the natives of the territory of Gigeri cannot differ much for the worſe from the reſt of their countrymen; nor is the practice peculiar to Barbary. Scenes of the ſame kind are frequently acted with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, on the coaſt of Cornwall, and other mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time counties of England<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a ſtory of an Engliſh parſon, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, during the time of divine ſervice, heard of a ſhipwreck.

               <p>BUGIA was formerly the capital of a kingdom of the ſame name. It ſtands at the mouth of the river Major, or Zinganor, about twenty leagues to the eaſtward of Algiers. It is little better than a heap of ruins; a deſcription which applies to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every town in that part of the world. It has three caſtles, two at the port, and one upon a rock, at a ſmall diſtance behind them. In the year 1671, a Britiſh admiral took or deſtroyed, in this harbour, nine Algerine ſhips of war. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſeldom that an admiral has been charged with ſuch a laudable commiſſion,</p>
               <p>STESSA, or STEFFA, is ſituated in a fertile valley, ſixty miles to the ſouth of Bugia, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles from the ſea. It exhibits only the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ruins of its former magnificence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about three hundred miſerable families.</p>
               <p>TEBEF was formerly a flouriſhing city, but is at preſent extremely reduced. ZAMOURA is in the ſame condition. It is defended by a fort.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:032877_0096_0FF5A974795A5B98"/>
and deſtroyed every town in it. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have ſtill ſupported their independence, by taking refuge in the mountainous parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which are ſaid to be very fertile; but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines prevent them from holding any intercourſe with foreign nations.</p>
               <p>BISCARA has a fort and garriſon. One of the chief employments of the people here is to catch and tame lions, tigers, and other beaſts of prey, which they carry for ſale to Algiers.</p>
               <p>NECANZ is one of the moſt pleaſant towns in Barbary. It is watered by an agreeable river, whoſe banks are adorned with a variety of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trees. The town contains a magnificent moſque and a college for the education of Mahometan ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>ORAN is ſituated about two hundred and fifty miles weſt of Algiers. It lies partly on a plain, and partly on the aſcent of a hill. It is a mile and half in circumference and tolerably fortified. But it is unfortunately commanded by ſome of the neighbouring eminences; ſo that a garriſon of ten or twelve thouſand men is neceſſary to defend it with ſucceſs againſt a ſkilful enemy. As the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh coaſts and merchant ſhips had ſuffered much from the corſairs of this port, Ferdinand king of Spain determined to attempt its reduction. For this purpoſe he tranſported into Africa an army, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of his prime miniſter cardinal Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, who maintained a correſpondence with ſome of the people of Oran; and when the Moors ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

killed four thouſand of the barbarians, and ſet at liberty twenty thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves. The Algerines, during almoſt two hundred years, made frequent and unſucceſsful attempts to recover the town. At laſt, in 1708, they retook it. In June 1732, a Spaniſh army was diſembarked not far from Oran. The Turkiſh commander, his troops, and the inhabitants were ſeized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without much reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The victors found in the place an hundred and forty-ſix pieces of cannon, beſides mortars, and at leaſt fifty ſhip loads of proviſions. This latter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply contributed much to the preſervation of their new conqueſt. Without it they muſt have run the greateſt hazard of periſhing in the midſt of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; as a tempeſt, which laſted for ſeveral days, cut off all intercourſe between the army upon ſhore, and the fleet at ſea. The Moors not long after attacked the Spaniards with great fury, but were finally repulſed with great ſlaughter on both ſides. The greateſt part of this town has lately been laid in ruins by an earthquake; ſince which it has been evacuated by the Spaniards, and left in poſſeſſion of the Turks. From theſe ruins the dey of Algiers has lately exported great quantities of white ſtone for the purpoſe of building his new moſque.</p>
               <p>TREMESEN was formerly the capital town of a kingdom of that name. It is ſituated ninety miles ſouth-weſt of Oran, ſurrounded by a ſtrong wall and well fortified. It has five gates with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges before them, and a caſtle containing hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome barracks for the Janiſaries who are in garriſon. Tremeſen while a metropolis was a ſplendid city. It contained one hundred and fifty moſques, and
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032877_0097_0FF5A97603F23548"/>
one hundred and ſixty public baths. Since it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the ſeat of an independent government, it has fallen into ruins and deſolation. The moſques are reduced to eight, and its public baths to four. The inhabitants are extremely indigent.</p>
               <p>MOSTAGAN ſtands fifty miles eaſt of Oran. This town is built in the form of a theatre open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſea, and ſurrounded on every other ſide with rocks that hang over it. The ruins of an old Mooriſh caſtle ſtands in a ſpace between the rocks, and there a ſtrong ſtone wall towards the port, with a modern built caſtle, garriſoned by a number of Turks. The citadel is erected upon the ſummit of one of rocks, and commands both city and territory. The haven is commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the town is well ſupplied with water. The neighbouring mountains are inhabited by a people called Magarabas, who live in tents, and poſſeſs a great number of flocks. There is a handſome moſque in this town.</p>
               <p>TENEZ is ſituated about one hundred miles to the eaſtward of Oran, twenty miles eaſt of Moſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and at a league diſtant from the ſea, where it has a convenient port. There is a caſtle that was once a royal palace, and in which the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor reſides. The fortifications are ſtrong, the garriſon numerous, and the neighbouring territory fertile.</p>
               <p>SERCELLI lies between Tenez and Algiers, about twenty-four miles to the weſtward of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is defended by a Turkiſh garriſon, and has a port which will only admit of ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels

                     <head>Its Origin.</head>
                     <p>THE names of the original founders of this city have never been ſatisfactorily aſcertained. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts tranſmitted to us by hiſtorians are involved in much doubt and uncertainty, and its foundation has been aſcribed to various princes generally of Roman extraction.</p>
                     <p>The teſtimony of Strabo, however, ſeems the moſt authentic. In his account of <hi>Mauritania Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarienſis</hi> he informs us, that there was formerly an ancient city on the Mediterranean known by the name of Jol, which was founded by Juba the father of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olemy, and ſon of Juba the firſt king of that name in Mauritania. It is ſituated, according to him, about the thirty-ſeventh degree of north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and has a ſmall iſland in the harbour; and as there is no other place upon the Mediterranean thus circumſtanced, it may be preſumed that the ancient city of Jol is the ſame as that of Algiers.</p>
                     <p>Juba was taken priſoner in the wars between Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey and the Caeſarian party, and carried to Rome, where he was ordered to be educated. He ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf ſo well in his ſtudies, that Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus not only gave him his liberty, but married him to the beautiful Silene, the daughter of Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony and Cleopatra, and reſtored him his father's extenſive kingdom of Mauritania, which at that time included the kingdoms of Morocco, Fez, Tremeſen, Oran, Tunis, Algiers and Bugia. As
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032877_0098_0FF5A9778A1DF358"/>
a grateful acknowledgement for ſo ſignal a favour, he gave the city of Jol the name of Jol Caeſarea, and as he conferred a new name upon this city in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in order to perpetuate the remembrance of his noble friend, we may preſume it was anciently one of the moſt important cities in Mauritania.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of the ſeventh century, the Mahometan Arabs over-ran all Mauritania; and as they ſeemed to have a particular hatred to the works, as well as the names of the Romans which they aboliſhed, they called this city Algezair or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Al Jezier, or Al-Jezerah, an Arabic word which ſignifies <hi>belonging to an iſland,</hi> becauſe there was an iſland before it, which is now joined to it by a mole, and forms one of the ſides of the harbour.

As they are open at top it is eaſy for any one to enter them, but theft and robbery are ſcarcely ever known; for if a ſtranger is apprehended in a houſe without having previouſly ſent in his name, he ſeldom eſcapes capital puniſhment. The tops of the houſes are paved with a kind of brick or tile, and a brick wall is built up about breaſt high to prevent perſons from falling.

Since which time aqueducts have been formed from ſeveral other ſprings in the country; and the water is plentifully conveyed into the city by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits or pipes under ground, which ſupply upwards of 150 fountains; at each of which a bowl is faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened for the uſe of paſſengers. The water which
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032877_0099_0FF5A98B8A264C10"/>
falls to the ground runs off through ſmall holes in the ſtreets near each fountain, and diſcharges itſelf into common ſewers, through which the filth of the city is conveyed away. All theſe pipes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves into the common reſervoir at the end of the mole, where the ſhips take in their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Every one takes his turn at theſe places, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Turks, who are firſt ſerved, and the Jews laſt, who in this particular are poſtponed even to the ſlaves themſelves.</p>

This bagnio was occupied by all ſuch ſlaves as were intended for his galleys. It was a ſpacious building through which there was a narrow paſſage or entry, which led into a large vault, that received only a ſmall portion of light from a grate above; but ſo inſufficient that in ſome of the apartments it was neceſſary to keep lamps burning the whole day. In the upper parts of the building there was a large ſquare, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral galleries two ſtories high, between which were ſeveral apartments, and a church for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſlaves large enough to contain 300 perſons. The roof was flat and terraced according to the Spaniſh mode. This bagnio contained 550 ſlaves belonging to Pinchinin, whom he allowed three hours every day to provide for their own ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which they employed in ſtealing and the practice of every ſpecies of villany.

BABLOET, or as it is rather pronounced <hi>Bublywhite,</hi> ſtands to the north. 4. BABAZIRA, which opens into the harbour. This is the gate where the American priſoners were examined when they paſſed from the marine. 5. BABAZON, or rather <hi>Bubazoon,</hi> is due ſouth: but neither this nor Babloet are of much conſideration. Near this gate is the place of execution for ſlaves: a platform is built on the top, about fifty feet high, from whence criminals are precipitated down an oblique wall, in which are fixed <hi>ganches</hi> or hooks at ſhort diſtances, by which the malefactor is either hung or torn to pieces; and ſhould he eſcape theſe, he is ſure to be daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pieces upon ſharp rocks which lie below.</p>

                     <p>THE harbour is the work of immenſe labour and difficulty. It is about fifteen feet deep, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous for veſſels. It is formed by a mole in the form of a ſemicircle, about 500 paces in length, lying north-eaſt and ſouth-weſt from the town to a ſmall iſland or rock called the Lantern; from which another mole of the ſame length is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended north and ſouth, for the purpoſe of forming a ſhelter. In the angle of theſe two moles ſtands a ſquare edifice, in the middle of which there is a court with rails, and four fountains uſed for ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when the hour of prayer is proclaimed. Round the four ſides is a ſeat covered with a mat, where the admiral and officers of the navy hold their daily meetings. The caſtle called Sardinia, and the caſtle of the Lantern ſtand on the mole; the former of which is mounted with two, and the latter with three tire of guns. The lower tire are 32 pounders; but they are never prepared for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon ſudden emergencies, for the lower apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo filled with large quantities of lumber and naval ſtores, that an enemy, ſuddenly running into the harbour, might deſtroy the city before they could bring their heavier pieces to play. Along the ſide of the mole there is a wharf for loading and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading ſhips, and for mooring galleys and other veſſels. Beneath the mole on one ſide is a ſtone quay, and on the other ſide a ſandy and rocky bank. All veſſels lying along ſide the mole are moored about fifteen yards from the ſhore, and ſecured by a

number of cables which extend in different direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are laſhed faſt to cannon planted in the mole. The moſt boiſterous ſea is occaſioned by a north-eaſt wind. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Beſides theſe there are ſeveral along the ſhore on the weſt ſide of the city. The battery of the mole gate ſtands upon the eaſt angle of the city, and is mounted with ſix pieces of ordnance, one of which has ſeven cylinders, each of them three inches in diameter. About half a league to the weſt ſouth-weſt of the harbour is the battery of the fiſher's gate, which is defended by a double tire of cannon, and commands the entrance of the port and the road be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrongeſt fortifications are at the entrance of the harbour, the ſituation of which adds to its ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; as the northern winds are generally violent, and occaſion ſuch a ſea, that ſhips would be expoſed to great danger, either in the road or along the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>Many former writers, either through ignorance, or a miſgrounded prejudice, have repreſented all theſe fortification ſo impregnable that they bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the confederated powers of the Chriſtians. But recent and more accurate obſervations have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the fallacy of this account: and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of obſervation who have lately reſided there, unanimouſly concur in the opinion, that three or at moſt four Britiſh fifty-gun ſhips, provided they

met with no diſaſter from the elements, would ſoon batter it about the ears of the inhabitants from the harbour. A late writer obſerves, that notwithſtanding their fortifications, the city is ſo commanded by the adjacent kills on every ſide but that of the ſea, that from theſe eminencies, where it is moſt vulnerable, a beſieging army would ſoon batter it into a heap of ruins.</p>
                     <p>It is not a little ſingular, however, that this city has, for ſeveral ages, braved ſome of the greateſt powers in Chriſtendom: but this muſt be imputed to the very injudicious conduct of moſt of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, or the violence of tempeſts which have proved deſtructive to ſo many veſſels in their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Spaniards in their attempts to reduce Algiers, have been the moſt material ſufferers; but the puſilanimity of their forces has long been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial, and Spaniſh diſcomfiture is no kind of crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion to judge of the defenſive powers of the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</p>

                  <p>Inhabitants, cuſtoms and manners of the city of Algiers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE preſent dey of Algiers was originally a Turkiſh ſoldier, and was imported into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers from a place near Smyrna about the year 1786. He was at firſt employed about the old dey's palace, and by his artifice he ſoon after became ſo great a court favorite, that he obtained the office of vichelhadge of the marine. Shortly after this event the caſſan-aga, or prime miniſter, through the intrigues of the baſhaw of Conſtantina with the old dey, fell a victim to the bow-ſtring, and Haſſan Baſhaw, the preſent dey, was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the vacant office of caſſan-aga, Cedelli, who was a Grecian of an enterpriſing ſpirit, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the office of vichelhadge, and the old dey ſhortly after dying a natural death, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delli, who was Haſſan's friend, inſiſted upon his aſſuming the imperial chair. Haſſan diſcovered great reluctance; but Cedelli, who came armed with a party for the purpoſe, forced him into the chair and ſupported him there. The aga ſhortly after made his appearance, intending to conteſt the right of ſovereignty with him, and attempted to aſſaſſinate him him in his ſeat; but he was ſeized by the chiahs, who dragged him to the Logger Baſtion, where he received the bow-ſtring, and one of Haſſan's friends was appointed aga in his ſtead.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032877_0105_0FF5A9C410FFCE80"/>
Haſſan afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> married the daughter of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſſan-aga, who had been executed through the intrigues of the baſhaw of Conſtantina, and after Haſſan was eſtabliſhed in the ſovereignty, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to bow-ſtring this baſhaw; and as ſhe was Haſſan's favorite wife her deſire was granted, and the baſhaw fell a victim to her reſentment.</p>
               <p>Cedelli ſoon after greatly incurred the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Haſſan. The dey had iſſued orders that no Dutch veſſels ſhould be captured within forty days; but Cedelli, either through deſign or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertence, gave inſtructions to the corſairs to make immediate captures, and ſeveral Dutch veſſels were brought into Algiers; which ſo violently exaſperated Haſſan, that he demanded in a vengeful and ſarcaſtic tone, whether he or Cedelli was dey of Algiers? Cedelli fortunately eſcaped the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, but was immediately baniſhed from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers.</p>
               <p>When conſuls, foreign agents, and other official characters enter the dey's palace, they are requeſted to pull off their ſhoes, and this ceremony is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expected. His viſitors then approach him with great reverence and kiſs his hand. The dey and his viſitors are ſeated on ſlabs of marble or ſlate projecting from the wall, about three feet high, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are placed cuſhions elegantly embroidered and fringed with gold, where his viſitors ſit croſs legged. The dey ſits with a large fan of oſtriches' feathers in his hand. All other Turks of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion receive their viſitors in the ſame manner. While they are thus ſeated they are ſerved by ſlaves with coffee, which is conſidered the greateſt treat that can be given, and as a particular mark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction conferred upon his viſitors.</p>

               <p>When the Grand Signior approves of the dey's conduct he ſends him an elegant robe called a <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> to ſignify his approbation of his conduct in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. A preſent of this nature is highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, becauſe it is a great protection to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and conciliates the minds of the people in his favour.</p>
               <p>The preſent dey is about 50 years old. His face is decorated with a long black beard. He is a man of a venerable aſpect and of a mejeſtic perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about ſix feet high, but rather inclining to lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He ſpeaks in a very imperious and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative tone, as is the caſe with all the Turks. He goes bare legged, but with ſlippers on his feet, and cannot be diſtinguiſhed by his dreſs from the reſt of the Turks; but only by the greater veneration that is paid him.</p>
               <p>When he walks the ſtreets of Algiers his <hi>liſberos</hi> go before him with clubs in their hands to clear the way, and as he approaches every perſon flies with precipitation into bye-ways; for if any one comes within the reach of their clubs he is ſure to be knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and trampled under foot. When he rides out, even upon a full gallop, theſe liſberos run before him, and every obſtacle muſt give way at his approach.</p>
               <p>While the American priſoners were in Algiers the dey once condeſcended to viſit the marine, which was looked upon as the moſt ſingular event that ever occurred; for neither the dey, the caſſan-aga,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032877_0106_0FF5A9C597B61568"/>
nor aga, are ever known to pay ſuch viſits. As he approached the ſhore the cannon of the caſtles, and on the walls of the city were fired, trumpets ſounded, and French horns played from the marine. He was attended by all the rais or commanders of veſſels, who regarded this viſit as the very higheſt compliment. He gave the warden baſhaw a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum of money to be diſtributed among the ſlaves. After examining the marine he was invited into the ſkiff of the vichelhadge, where he ſat down with his attendants and after drinking a diſh of coffee retired to his palace.</p>
               <p>The dey keeps about 30 concubines in his ſerag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, who are attended by black enuchs, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are never ſeen by the ſlaves. He has but one child, a daughter about ſeven years old, who is the greateſt favorite imaginable with the dey. She was engaged to be married to the late vichelhadge of the marine, who was the dey's relation. But he was either killed or drowned in his voyage to the Levant, where the dey ſent him with a large ſum of money, for the purpoſe of building a ſuperb moſque at the place of his birth.</p>
               <p>From the moſt authentic accounts it appears that many of the people of Algiers, and the kingdom in general, are hoſpitable, humane, and of ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. A Moor when he finds any articles that have been loſt, never clandeſtinely appropriates them to his own uſe, but has them always cried through the ſtreets that the owner may poſſeſs his property again. But in conſequence of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is exerciſed over them, and their total ſubſerviency to the rapacious views of their Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh oppreſſors, they ſupport perhaps the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous character of any nation in the world. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpark of political liberty is totally extinguiſhed,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032877_0106_0FF5A9C597B61568"/>
and the government has now attained to the very acme of the moſt horrible deſpotiſm. As the Turks maintain their aſcendency by the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous meaſures, their government exhibits a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſcene of jealouſy, apprehenſion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; no man can promiſe himſelf a moment's ſecurity either in his perſon or property; for the power of life and death is veſted in the hands of the dey, which he exerciſes with impunity; and whenever he covets the riches of any of his opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſubjects, he orders them to be diſpatched with a bow-ſtring, and falls heir to what they poſſeſſed. When the order of execution is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to any one, he ſubmits patiently to his fate, which he has perhaps long anticipated, and as ſoon as the order is executed there is an immediate ſcramble among the ſervants for the money, jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and other valuable articles which belonged to their maſter.</p>
               <p>According to the common computation, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants in this city is 100,000 Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, 1500 Jews, and 2000 Chriſtian ſlaves; but no cenſus can be accurate for any length of time, as thouſands are carried off by the plague; and the number of ſlaves is ſtill more fluctuating, as they are ſubject to an uncertain increaſe by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a diminution by ranſom, or death by the ſeverity of their toils.</p>
               <p>The city of Algiers is viſited almoſt every year by the plague, which generally begins in May, and continues for the ſpace of three months. When it commences its viſitation no perſon is at liberty to circulate any report of its exiſtence, or his life would be in danger; but when the contagion becomes more prevalent one of the marabouts viſits the dey
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032877_0107_0FF5A9C71FDF7C20"/>
and informs him of its exiſtence; after which the citizens are at liberty to take every precaution for their preſervation; ſome retire into the country, but the dey and moſt of the people always remain in the city. The firſt ſtage of this diſorder is a violent fever which brings on a delirium, but if the patient can ſurvive this fever he has every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his recovery. The diſeaſe, however, operates differently upon different conſtitutions; ſome blead at the mouth, noſe, and ears; ſome break out in lived ſpots all over their bodies, and many continue in a ſtate of coma, or lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, till they expire, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> generally at the end of the third day after the diſorder ſeizes them. About one half of thoſe who are attacked by this diſorder recover, but they are notwithſtanding always liable to, though not ſo ſuſceptible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection after they have once been ſeized with it.</p>
               <p>A moſt malignant plague raged in Algiers about the year 1787, which carried off immenſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the inhabitants; the diſeaſe was ſo viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that the ſtreets were filled with dead bodies, and the mortality ſo great that a ſufficient number of perſons could ſcarcely be procured to bury them. Slaves are very frequently ſeized with this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their labour, and they are ſuffered to die upon the ground without any aſſiſtance, and with as much unconcern as if they were beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As they have neither medical books, nor men of learning, it muſt naturally be ſuppoſed they have no phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. When a perſon is ſeized with any diſorder the only mode of cure is to rub the patient, and at the ſame time to place his body in a variety of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and if this whimſical treatment does not ſucceed, nothing farther is attempted.</p>

                  </gap>nt citizens uſe ſaucers of gold placed beneath their common ones, for the purpoſe of cooling their coffee. They dine at eleven, and drink coffee again at four in the afternoon. In eating they are ſeated croſs-legged on mats round tables about ſix inches high, and they uſe neither knives nor forks. Their common food is mutton, beef or poultry, boiled to rags, which they eat with cuzcuz. An Algerine never ſuffers his wives to eat with him, but obliges them to ſerve him till he has finiſhed his meal, at which time they are permitted to ſit down to the table. The Turks in particular are very tenacious of this precedence, becauſe they regard women as an inferior order in creation, and conſequently not entitled to ſimilar diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>The uſe of particular meats is ſtrictly forbidden, and in conformity to the cuſtom of the eaſtern na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Alcoran prohibits the uſe of ſwine's fleſh, the eating of blood, and whatever dies of itſelf, or is ſtrangled, or killed by a blow, or fall, or by any other beaſt.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood. The Algerines have ſuch a ſingular averſion
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032877_0108_0FF5A9C8A5014058"/>
to hogs that they will fly at the ſight of one as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as from the moſt ferocious wild beaſt; for they deem it a great contamination even to be touched by a ſwine, and a hundred well diſciplined hogs would take Algiers much ſooner than an army of the very braveſt Spaniards. Many, however, among the leſs conſcientious Moors, who are not ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of pollution, bring conſiderable quantities of pork to market, which they ſell at a very moderate price to the Chriſtian ſlaves, who derive a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from this cuſtom; for a full grown hog is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſold for leſs than a ſequin.</p>
               <p>The people have ſo ſingular an attachment to coffee, or the uſe of it is ſo extremely faſhionable, that tradeſmen and mechanics while they fit engaged at their buſineſs along the platforms in front of their houſes, have their diſhes of coffee before them. The Turks, and eſpecially thoſe who are too conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to make uſe of ſpiritous liquors, ſpend whole days at the coffee houſes in ſmoking and ſipping coffee: and as they devote no part of their time to reading or the improvment of the mind, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear entirely diveſted of all reflection, and become the mere ſlaves of their ſenſual appetites.</p>
               <p>The uſe of coffee firſt took its origin at <hi>Aden</hi> in Arabia Felix about the year 1436; from whence it was gradually introduced into Mecca, Medina, Syria, Europe and other parts of the world. It has been the ſubject of great contention and diſorders; the uſe of it has been often proſcribed, and as often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared lawful and allowed: but at preſent it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally tolerated.</p>
               <p>The drinking of wine, under which name is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all kinds of ſtrong liquors, is forbidden in the Alcoran in more places than one. Some have imagined that exceſs only is therein forbidden, and
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032877_0108_0FF5A9C8A5014058"/>
they allege that the moderate uſe of wine is allowed in two paſſages of the Alcoran; but the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion is, that the uſe of ſtrong liqours either in a greater or leſs quantity is abſolutely unlawful; and though libertines indulge themſelves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice, yet the more conſcientious, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe who have performed a pilgrimage to Mecca, are ſo rigid that they deem it unlawful not only to taſte wine, but to make it, or to maintain themſelves by the purchaſe and ſale of that liquor.</p>
               <p>They are, however, extravagantly fond of wine, and if one aſks them how it happens that they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to drink it when it is ſo ſtrictly forbidden, they anſwer that it is with them as with the Chriſtians, whoſe religion prohibits drunkenneſs, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light notwithſtanding in drinking to exceſs. The dey was formerly much addicted to this practice, but ſince he has been in adminiſtration, he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very exemplary in this reſpect, and it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for any of his viſitors to breath the fumes of wine in his prefence.</p>
               <p>It has been a queſtion whether coffee is not impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly prohibited by the Alcoran, becauſe it has an intoxicating property; and it is probable that the former prohibition of it originated from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alone.</p>
               <p>The more conſcientious reject the uſe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> not only becauſe it intoxicates, but in conſequence of a traditional ſaying of their prophet, which, if it were really his, would prove him a prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <q>That in the latter days there ſhould be men who ſhould bear the name of Muſſulmen, but ſhould not be really ſuch, and that they ſhould ſmoke a certain weed which ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tobacco.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="214" facs="unknown:032877_0109_0FF5A9D7DF4EC540"/>
               <p>Opium, though not mentioned in the Alcoran, is eſteemed unlawful by the more rigid Mahometans, becauſe it intoxicates in a more extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Turks, however, diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all this abſtinence, and as theſe lords of the Algerines are ſupported at the public expence, their whole life, is an uninterrupted ſeries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, debauchery and intoxication: foibles na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all thoſe who have no other purſuit in life to engage their attention. The greateſt tyrants in nature are drunken Turkiſh ſoldiers, who ſeem to be under no reſtraint either of law or conſcience. Great numbers of theſe brutes, after having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated themſelves, iſſue forth into the ſtreets with their <hi>tahans,</hi> or ſwords drawn, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt fly at their approach, or they would be in danger of their lives. The Jews in particular are ever the objects of their indignation, and whenever they diſcover a Jew they immediately purſue him, while the poor deſpiſed wretch flies with the most hideous outcries to avoid the outrage of theſe banditti, who are at liberty to commit any act of violence upon him, with impunity; for ſhould a Jew make application for redreſs of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, he would in all probability be baſtinaded for his preſumption. So cordially is this race of people deſpiſed, that when one wiſhes to caſt any obloquy, or aſperſion of ignominy upon another, he calls him <hi>Judeo</hi> or Jew; and even herdſmen in driving their cattle will call them <hi>Judeo,</hi> which is the moſt ignominious term of reproach that can be given.</p>
               <p>The Turks are ſo proud that, like the American Indians, they deem themſelves ſuperior to all other
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:032877_0109_0FF5A9D7DF4EC540"/>
nations in the world, and the moſt valiant among the race of men. They imagine that the world was made for them alone; and conſequently they entertain a perfect contempt for all other nations in general, eſpecially thoſe who are of a different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and they commonly call Chriſtians, <hi>dogs.</hi> Some carry this ſuperſtitious averſion to ſo great an exceſs, that if the firſt perſon they meet in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they come out of their houſes, be a Chriſtian or Jew, they return home immediately, ſaying, <hi>God preſerve us from the devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Turks are, as is the caſe with many other people, moſt extravagantly fond of money, and they have long been proverbial for their mercenary diſpoſitions. The conſuls of foreign nations find that the Algerines are not to be wrought upon by remonſtrance; they expect ſomething more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and more is to be gained by flattery, and an artful addreſs, than by the moſt powerful arguments: for according to the old adage, <q>Give a Turk mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with one hand, and he will let you pluck his eyes out with the other.</q> This was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably verified in the caſe of a Britiſh conſul, who once made application to Ali Baſhaw, a late dey, and urged a complaint againſt the depredations of the Algerine corſairs, without the grand preliminary, <hi>money.</hi> The dey appeared ſomewhat reſtleſs, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulantly anſwered, <hi>The Algerines are a ſet of rogues and I'm their captain:</hi> ſo that national juſtice and honeſty are great rarities here.</p>
               <p>To complete the picture of human depravity, the Turks are guilty of the moſt unnatural crimes, which are here regarded with ſuch perfect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the poorer ſort of people ſend their children into the ſtreets to ſeek a ſubſiſtence by
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:032877_0110_0FF5A9D979D69848"/>
the moſt nefarious proſtitution, and neither pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment nor the leaſt ſhade of ignominy is the conſequence of detection. A Turk will ſigh with as much ardency for a handſome boy, as old Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, who appears to have been a lover of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, lamented the loſs of the beautiful Alexis. Sodomy is ſo extremely faſhionable among them, and ſo little are they diſpoſed to keep this foible a ſecret, that it is the ſubject of their moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſongs, and they will ſpare no pains in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the gratification of their infamous love. We are told of a Turk who being diſappointed in one of his ignominious amours, and being actuated by the moſt ſingular impulſe, commanded his ſlave to place a red hot brand of fire upon his naked arm, which he ſuffered to be burnt almoſt to the bone.</p>
               <p>It was cuſtomary with former deys to ſend an annual tribute of a number of beautiful boys to the Grand Signiors, who are a little tinctured with this vice; but at preſent this tribute conſiſts of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Arabian horſes. We are credibly informed, that the famous admiral Pinchinin, kept in his houſe forty young boys between nine and fifteen years of age, who were never ſuffered to go into the ſtreets, leſt they might be ſeduced by the Turks. Pinchinin was not, however, addicted to this vice; but what diſcovered the moſt ſingular pride in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, was that he kept theſe boys merely through a principle of vanity and oſtentation.</p>
               <p>One virtuous trait in a Turk's character is that he abſtains from all profane ſwearing, and is never guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch blaſphemous imprecations as a Chriſtian.

               <p>The Algerines never ſhake hands when they meet, but the uſual mode of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Theſe ſwords they call <hi>tahans,</hi> which they always wear in public in a kind of ſaſh or girdle, which is tied round their middle. They receive the neceſſary ſupplies of ammunition generally once a month, and the dey uſes great caution in the diſtribution of this article.

               <p>The Algerines read no other books but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, and the comments of authors who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereon: of courſe the ſphere of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot be expected to be very extenſive. They underſtand a few of the firſt principles of arithmetic, but of geometry, poetry, painting, and the ſublimer ſtrains of muſic, they have ſcarcely any conception. All their books are manuſcripts, and there is not a preſs in all the city. To them the art of printing appears perfectly contemptible: they repoſe no kind of confidence in it, and it is regarded as an impoſition rather than a benefit.</p>
               <p>Painting is ſo much deſpiſed, that many figures, ſuch as men, women, beaſts, &amp;c. are prohibited, and the ſight of them is regarded as a great ſin. They are, however, great admirers of watches and clocks; but if they ſee them embelliſhed with any of theſe figures they cannot refrain from expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their anger. They have a ſimilar averſion to bells, and they are ſo exaſperated at the ſound,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032877_0111_0FF5A9DB0880AE78"/>
that the crews of many foreign nations lying in their harbour have often been beaten for ringing their bells.</p>
               <p>Gaming is prohibited in the ſame paſſages of the Alcoran which prohibit the uſe of wine. The word, as it is there uſed, ſignifies a particular mode of caſting lots by arrows according to the practice of the pagan Arabs. But the commentators agree, that under the name of <hi>lots</hi> are comprehended all games whatſoever which are ſubject to chance or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſuch as cards, dice, tables, &amp;c. which are forbidden. All theſe games are deemed ſo highly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>agitious by the more rigid Mohometans, that they judge the evidence of him who plays at them of no validity in a court of juſtice.</p>
               <p>The only game that is played in Algiers is cheſs, and this the Mahometan doctors allow, (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have doubted its legality) becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſolely upon art and the ſkilful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pieces uſed in playing. But it is never ſuffered to prevent the regular performance of their devotions, and perſons are never permitted to play for money, or things of the moſt trifling va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
               <p>In Algiers the men have no intercourſe with the women before marriage, and marriage contracts are entirely negociated by female confidants employed by the men, who tender the parents a certain ſum of money according to their demand, and the lady is thus purchaſed as though ſhe were an article of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize. Hence it ſeldom happens that marriages thus contracted are cemented with love, and by thus violating the law of nature, they lay a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for intrigue, jealouſy, and the moſt boiſterous paſſions. When the marriage contract is conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032877_0112_0FF5A9DC8E98D8D0"/>
the principal nuptial ceremony conſiſt in eſcort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lady to her huſband. A proceſſion of her female friends and relations is formed about ten o'clock at night, attended by a number of black fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male flaves with burning torches in their hands, and as this proceſſion moves along they make a ſtrange kind of noiſe at intervals till they enter the houſe of the huſband, who for the firſt time beholds his fair bride, whom his imagination had long perhaps portrayed as the paragon of all excellence. The company then retires, and the next day the marks of virginity are triumphantly diſplayed upon the tops of their houſes, in the preſence of the bride's friends and relations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> if this evidence of virtue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced, the huſband returns his wife to her parents, and the marriage is diſſolved without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremony.</p>
               <p>The Algerine women are remarkably amorous, and though all intercourſe between them and the Chriſtians is prohibited under penalty of death, yet it does not deter them from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to circumvent every Chriſtian ſlave who comes in their way, for whom they have a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attachment. Numbers of theſe frail fair ones rove the ſtreets every night for the purpoſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and they make the firſt advances with great effrontery and adroitneſs; but ſuch is the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the liſberos, who are highly rewarded for every Chriſtian that is detected, that thoſe who are ventureſome enough to undertake an amorous correſpondence, are every moment in imminent danger of falling a ſacrifice to their gallantry.</p>
               <p>Some of the former deys had it in contemplation to incorporate the ſlaves with the citizens, and to permit their intermarriages, but the marabouts, who were apprehenſive that ſuch a law would contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032877_0112_0FF5A9DC8E98D8D0"/>
the purity of Mahometan blood, remonſtrated ſo ſtrongly againſt it, that all intercourſe between Chriſtian ſlaves and Mooriſh women was made a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crime.</p>
               <p>The women lead a moſt indolent life; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly amuſe themſelves with needle work or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery; but are never ſubjected to domeſtic drudgery, which is done by ſlaves, and whatever their condition may be, they are never engaged in any employment out of their houſes.</p>
               <p>In their dreſs they diſplay neither taſte nor judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to an American or European they appear extremely uncouth. When they viſit or appear abroad the beauty of their perſons is entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. They wear a clumſy kind of panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons, and according to the phrase of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can captives, they resemble a bundle of rags in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather than women. Like the French ladies they are very fond of <hi>rouge;</hi> but inſtead of their cheeks they have a ſingular fancy in painting their foreheads with a ſtripe of red, which extends above their eye brows.</p>
               <p>Their diſhabille, or rather the manner in which they dreſs in their houſes, is very laſcivious. They wear a cap formed of threads of gold interwoven like net work, round which is tied a fine ſilk hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, and their hair hangs confined in a ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Their breaſts, arms, and legs are naked, but the reſt of their body is covered with a large ſilk mantle, which only reaches down to the knees, and is tied about their middle with a kind of ſaſh. Their ſlippers are elegantly wrought with gold; and round their wriſts and ancles they wear bracelets ſet with jewels. They ride concealed in a large ſquare box covered with a kind of red baize,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032877_0113_0FF5A9ED5AB0BF98"/>
placed upon aſſes or mules, and when they walk the ſtreets they are always veiled. They are extremely cautious of diſcovering their faces to ſtrangers,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to Chriſtian ſlaves, which they deem ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred that they would ſooner diſcloſe any other part of their body. An American ſlave was ordered one day by a Turk, to carry ſome bottles of wine from one of the bagnios to his houſe, and in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through one of the apartments he ſurprized the Turk's lady, whoſe face was perfectly unveiled. The diſconcerted fair one, overcome with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſudden and unexpected appearance of a ſlave, immediately covered her face with her petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats, and in ſo doing diſcloſed thoſe parts which were much more the object of the American's riſibility.</p>
               <p>There is not much difference, as we have before obſerved, between the dreſs of the men and women. The men wear a kind of clumſy trowſers which reach down to the knees, ſomewhat reſembling the Roman habit. Their legs and arms are bear; but in cold or wet weather they wear <hi>capoots;</hi> a kind of great coats which nearly cover the whole body.</p>
               <p>The dreſs of the marabouts is a kind of green coat, or gown which reaches down to the knees. The hats of ſome of them, or rather the covering of their heads, reſembles a large diſh formed of linen drawn over a piece of circular paſteboard: others wear a high cap ſomewhat in the form of a ſugar-loaf with a ſmall part of the top cut off. Some of the marabouts are ſo highly venerated by the Moors, that they run and kiſs their hands as they p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The dreſs of the Jews does not differ much from that of the Turks, and the manner in which they
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:032877_0113_0FF5A9ED5AB0BF98"/>
are principally diſtinguiſhed, conſiſts in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of colour, which is black, a diſtinction they are obliged to obſerve. There is alſo a difference in the form of their turbans, and their ſlippers which have ſuch a ſmall portion of upper leather, that they can ſcarcely keep them on their feet; for they are not ſuffered to wear ſhoes without paying an exorbitant duty to the dey for the privilege.</p>
               <p>They have few funeral ceremonies, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change their dreſs when any of their relations die. They waſh the dead with great care, and burn incenſe about them to drive away evil ſpirits. They have no coffins, but bury them in a clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> open at top and bottom. Before the interment they expoſe their dead in the houſe, upon a bier, under a pall of different colours fringed with gold according to the quality of the perſon. The place of interment is without the walls of the town, and the corps is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thither by four, or ſometimes eight carriers. No women ever attend their funerals, but a few days after, the female relations viſit the grave, over which they weep and ſtrew wreaths of flowers.</p>
               <p>The Algerines believe that when the deceaſed is laid in the ground, two angels come, and make him get upon his knees to render an account of his actions. If he has lived a virtuous life, two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as white as ſnow, ſucceed thoſe who came to examine him, and entertain him with a full account of the pleaſures he is to enjoy in the next world. But if he has lived a vicious life, two angels as black as jet are commiſſioned to inflict the moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el tortures upon him. One, they ſay, ſtrikes him into the earth with a club, and the other pulls him up again with an iron hook; and thus they employ

themſelves in the infliction of this cruel puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the leaſt reſpite till the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>In religion it ſeems that rigorous reſtrictions are no criterion to judge of the political integrity of a nation; for though the Algerines are as punctilious in their religious ſervices as any people whatever, yet they ſupport the moſt infamous national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon earth. They worſhip no leſs than five times in the twenty-four hours; once juſt before day-break, again at one o'clock, and at the time of lazar in the afternoon, and about one o'clock at night. Juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their worſhip commences in the day, a ſmall white flag is raiſed on all the moſques, as a ſignal for preparation; the marabouts ſoon after aſcend the cupola of the moſques, and turning their face to the eaſt and raiſing their hands to their heads, cry out with a loud voice; upon which the male inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants waſh their hands, face, and feet, and repair to the moſques, where they arrange themſelves in files, with their face turned towards the eaſt. None of their moſques have pews, but they are paved with marble. Before each perſon is placed a ſtraw mat, upon which he kneels. After a ſhort pauſe of ſilence, during which their lips are in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they all raiſe their hands to their heads, then place them on their knees, kneel down on their mats, and all proſtrate their heads upon the floor at the ſame inſtant, from which they immediately riſe again into an erect poſture. By continual practice they perform theſe evolutions with the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion imaginable, and all their motions correſpond more perfectly in point of time than the exerciſe of the beſt diſciplined troops. This ceremony conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues about fifteen minutes, after which the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers retire to their buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:032877_0114_0FF5A9EEE2F45958"/>
A fimilar ceremony is obſerved every day in the marine. The marabout who officiates there cries out from the top of one of the caſtles on the mole, which is the ſignal for <hi>diving,</hi> as the Americans facetiouſly termed it. The marabouts have nothing to do in this part of religious duty; but they deliver a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe every Friday in the moſques, from a kind of roſtrum or pulpit. This diſcourſe, and their other religious ceremonies, continue on that day from eleven till one o'clock, during which time the gates of the city and the doors of the bagnios are ſhut. The people do not attend public worſhip at night, but as soon as they hear the voice of the marabout, they riſe up and perform their exerciſe of devotion in their own apartments. All the Mahometans who reſide near the city, immediately proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoon as they ſee the flags raiſed on the moſques; and beſides all this religious ſervitude theſe <hi>very righteous people</hi> daily employ themſelves, like the illiterate among the Roman Catholics, in count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their ſtrings of beads.</p>
               <p>The dey only attends public worſhip on Fridays, at a moſque nearly oppoſite to his palace, where the principal Turks aſſemble, and he paſſes between two files of his Turkiſh guards, who are ſtationed between the door of his palace and that of the moſque.</p>
               <p>After performing the exerciſe of humility, and hearing a diſcourſe from the marabout, he retires to his palace where, as he enters, he is ſprinkled with holy water of a fragrant ſmell.</p>
               <p>Every Friday is devoted to public worſhip, and correſponds to the Jewiſh Saturday, or Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="unknown:032877_0115_0FF5A9F071EA9850"/>
the works of creation; but Mr. Sale remarks, that Mahomet ſeems to have preferred that day princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally becauſe it was the day on which the people were accuſtomed to aſſemble long before his time: though ſuch aſſemblies were perhaps intended for civil rather than religious purpoſes. Though the Mahometans in general do not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obligated to keep that day ſo holy as the Jews and Chriſtians are bound to keep their Sabbath, (there being permiſſion in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 62.</note>, that that they may return to their employments or diverſions after divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is ended,) yet the more devout diſapprove of the practice of applying any part of that day to worldly concerns, and require it to be wholly dedicated to the purpoſes of religion. The ſlaves are neither exempted from labour upon this, nor any other day of the week; but they are generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one Friday in every month for the purpoſe of reſt or recreation.</p>
               <p>All theſe religious reſtrictions are, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and once every year they are ſubjected to a rigorous abſtinence called <hi>Ramadan,</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazan,</hi> which generally begins in May, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues from the time the new moon firſt appears till the appearance of the next new moon, during which time they refrain from women, and neither eat, drink, ſnuff, nor ſmoke tobacco, from day-break, till ſun-ſet. The punctilious obſervance of this duty is enjoined under penalty of death, and thoſe who are detected in indulging their appetites, ſome ſay, are compelled to drink melted lead as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for their crime. About ſun-ſet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of the marabout riſes, as a ſignal for eating, which is looked for with great anxiety; after which they are at liberty to gratify their appetites as they pleaſe. During the time of Ramadan an univerſal moroſeneſs prevails among the people, and the dey, who finds it neceſſary to conform to this cuſtom, is ſo much out of humour, that no buſineſs can be tranſacted with him during the continuance of this faſt. The Turks experience the greateſt mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe they are abridged of all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures their ſenſual natures are capable of enjoying; they are neither permitted to frequent the bagnios, taverns, nor coffee-houſes, and they wait for the termination of this faſt with the greateſt impatience. Towards the expiration of the month the Turks aſcend their cazarees every evening, and look with longing eyes towards the weſt for the diſcovery of the new moon, which is called the moon of <hi>Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This faſt, which is the third point of religious practice, is a duty of ſo much importance, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet uſed to ſay, <hi>It was the gate of religion,</hi> and that <hi>the odour of the mouth of him who faſteth is more grateful to God than that of muſk.</hi>

               <p>According to the Mahometan divines there are three degrees of faſting; 1ſt. The reſtraining the belly and other parts of the body from ſatisfying their luſt. 2d. The reſtraining the ears, eyes, tongue, hands, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eet, and others members from ſin. 3d. The faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart from all worldly cares, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining the thoughts from every thing beſides God. The Mahometans are obliged, by expreſs

command of the Alcoran, to faſt the whole month of Ramadan, and in conſequence of this abſtemious ſeverity, which is a real ſin againſt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an univerſal gloom overwhelms the minds of the people; they are extremely vengeful, and more murders and aſſaſſinations happen then than at any other time. The ſlaves are not compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to any of their religious ceremonies or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions; but during the time of Ramadan they are ſubjected to the infliction of the ſevereſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: for ſuch abſtinence has a tendency to excite the moſt boiſterous paſſions of the human breaſt.</p>
               <p>This faſt is ſucceeded by a <hi>Bairam</hi> or feſtival, called the feaſt of the breaking of the faſt, which continues for three days, during which time the half ſtarved Turks riot in the oppoſite extreme of intemperance. They hold a kind of fair out of town, where they divert themſelves with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, feaſting, muſic, bonfires, wreſtling, ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and feats of horſemanſhip. The colours of all nations are diſplayed in the marine, and during this feſtival the ſlaves are exempted from labour.</p>
               <p>But their greateſt feſtival is on the fifth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, the day of the nativity of their prophet, which is celebrated with great ſolemnity. All the ſchoolmaſters in the city, with their ſcholars, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble at the chief moſque, from which they form a proceſſion through the ſtreets, each carrying a burning torch in his hand, and ſinging an eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in praiſe of their great prophet.

with tapeſtry and burning lamps. The cooks of the divan to the number of 200 alſo form a proceſſion, each carrying a clean napkin or towel on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and a torch in his hand. They parade the ſtreets two by two, from ſeven till eleven o'clock in the day, and the ceremony ends with a hymn in praiſe of their prophet, performed with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of muſic before the doors of ſome of their great men. About midnight torches are kept burning in every houſe, becauſe Mahomet was born at that hour. This feaſt continues for eight days, during which time any perſon is at liberty to walk the ſtreets at night without a lighted torch, which they cannot do at other times without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the penalty of corporal puniſhment.</p>
               <p>There is a ſingular cuſtom eſtabliſhed here, of a religious nature, for the remiſſion of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of offenders who fly to the moſques for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which is called <hi>taking the marabout,</hi> and theſe places are an aſylum for every deſcription of criminals. In the front of every moſque there is ſuſpended a long chain, which the criminal ſeizes; whereupon he is generally taken into the ſanctuary and covered with the marabout's colours, from whence he is not ſuffered to be taken till his pardon is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. One of theſe chains is ſuſpended in front of the dey's palace, who ſometimes pardons offenders who fly thither for refuge, and another is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at the cazarees of the Turks, where crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are more inviolably protected.</p>
               <p>A quarrel took place not long ſince between two lads about twelve years of age, the one a Turk and the other a Moor, as they were paſſing from the marine to the city. When they came oppoſite to the cazarees, the young Turk, taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

               <p>It is a vulgar opinion among the Algerines, and the Mahometans in general, that women have no ſouls; or if they have, that they die like thoſe of the brutes, and will receive no reward in the next life. This is probably the reaſon why they are never ſuffered to go upon a pilgrimage, or to attend public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in their moſques. But whatever may be the vulgar belief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is evident that Mahomet had too great a reſpect for the fair ſex, to inculcate ſuch a doctrine; for there are ſeveral paſſages in the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, which expreſly affirm that women in the next life will not only be puniſhed for their evil deeds, but will be rewarded for their virtues as well as men, and that in this reſpect God will make no diſtinction of ſexes.</p>
               <p>It is true that the general notion is, that they will not be admitted into the ſame abode with the men, becauſe their places will be ſupplied by paradiſiacal females, but that a ſeparate place of happineſs will be aſſigned to good women, where they will enjoy every delight in its fulleſt extent: yet ſome allege that a man will have thoſe who were his wives in this world, or at leaſt ſuch of them as he ſhall deſire. One circumſtance with which Mahomet acquainted his followers, ought to corroborate their belief of the future exiſtence of the female ſoul. An old woman deſired him to intercede with God for her
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032877_0117_0FF5AA03D99B09D8"/>
admiſſion into paradiſe; but Mahomet told her that no old women would ever enter that place; upon which the old woman began to weep immoderately, and Mahomet explained himſelf by aſſuring her, that God would make her young again.</p>
               <p>The Alcoran certainly eſtabliſhes a different be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the following words: <q>Verily the Moſlems (or Muſſulmen) of either ſex, and the true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of either ſex; and the devout men, and the devout women; and the men of veracity and the women of veracity; and the patient men and the patient women; and the humble men and the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble women; and the alms-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Great numbers of the citizens of Algiers perform a journey to Mecca every year, and many veſſels are employed in tranſporting them to this holy city for the purpoſe of manufacturing them into ſaints. This pilgrimage is ſo neceſſary a point in practical religion, that according to a tradition of Mahomet, he who dies without performing it may as well die a Jew or Chriſtian. It is deemed a duty particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly incumbent, and the Alcoran expreſsly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins it upon all thoſe who are of ſufficient abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform the journey<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. III. pag. 48.</note>.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tournefort tells us, that the four places of rendezvous for pilgrims, are Damas, Cairo, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and Zebir. At theſe places they dreſs
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032877_0118_0FF5AA056208A968"/>
themſelves in the ſacred habit, which conſiſts of two woolen wrappers, one about the middle to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their nakedneſs, and the other thrown over their ſhoulders; and in this dreſs they enter the ſacred territory. While they are thus accoutred they are neither ſuffered to hunt nor to fowl, (though they may fiſh) and this precept is punctiliouſly obſerved.</p>
               <p>During his pilgrimage a man muſt keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant guard over all his word and actions; he muſt avoid all quarrelling and abuſive language; he muſt refrain from all obſcene diſcourſe and ſexual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> his whole attention to the pious work in which he is engaged. All the caravans which come from different parts of the Mahometan dominions, concert their meaſures in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they arrive the ſame day at the hill <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fagd,</hi> which is about a day's journey from Mecca: on this celebrated hill they imagine that the angel firſt appeared to their prophet, and in conſequence the Mahometans have founded one of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſanctuaries on this ſpot.</p>
               <p>After having killed and diſtributed ſome ſheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor they proceed to Mecca, and from thence to Medina to viſit the tomb of their prophet, which is covered with a magnificent pall, annually ſent thither by order of the Grand Signior, which pall is every year cut away by the pilgrims, who eſteem the ſmalleſt piece of it as the moſt invaluable relic. The Grand Signior alſo ſends 500 ſequins, an Alcoran covered with gold, ſeveral rich carpets, and a great many pieces of black cloth for hangings, as preſents to the moſques at Mecca. The nobleſt camel that can be found is choſen to carry this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, and at his return he is hung with garlands
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032877_0118_0FF5AA056208A968"/>
of flowers, loaded with benedictions, ſumptuouſly fed, and exempted from labour all the reſt of his life.</p>
               <p>The pilgrims who have performed the tour of Mecca are held in great veneration the remainder of their lives; are abſolved from every ſin, and may commit new crimes with impunity. Mr. Tournefort ſays, according to the Mahometan law they cannot be put to death; but are reputed incorruptible, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable, and ſanctified from this world. It is reported of ſome of the Indians, continues he, that they put out their eyes after they have ſeen what they call the <hi>holy places</hi> of Mecca, pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Slaves of Algiers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHATEVER ſpeculative maniacs or merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enthuſiaſts may allege in favour of ſlavery, it is obviouſly repugnant to the impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible rights of human nature, and an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible evidence of the remains of barbariſm in thoſe nations who ſanction ſo diabolical a principle.</p>
               <p>There appear to be three ſtages in the progreſs of mankind from ſavage rudeneſs to a ſtate of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. Firſt, a ſtate of canibaliſm, in which any tribe or nation of men deal indiſcriminate death and deſtruction among the reſt of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures; ſecond, a ſtate of oppreſſion, in which, though they are exempted from the fangs of ſavage rapacity, yet they are compelled to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the loſs of their liberties; third, the eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of mankind, when the more general diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſcience will teach them the true principles of juſtice and humanity. But the grand ſcience of univerſal benevolence muſt be reſerved for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages; for though many modern nations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves to be eminently enlightened, yet they are in fact but juſt beginning to emerge from the intermediate ſtate between barbarity and true refinement.</p>
               <p>For the practice of ſlavery we are not to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Algerines alone; for the divan of Great Britain are equally reprehenſible, and have more
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032877_0119_0FF5AA06ED2046D0"/>
eminently diſtinguiſhed themſelves in this nefarious commerce. From them we have adopted the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable practice, and the United States, emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the land of liberty, ſwarm with thoſe ſemi-barbarians who enthral their fellow creatures without the leaſt remorſe. With what countenance then can we reproach a ſet of barbarians, who have only retorted our own acts upon ourſelves in making repriſals upon our citizens? For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world, that we are equally culpable, and in whatever terms of opprobrium we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate the piratic diſpoſition of the Africans, yet all our recriminations will recoil upon ourſelves.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed thus much, we ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make a few obſervations upon the ſlaves of Algi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, and as a preliminary we ſhall detail the particulars of the capture of the ſhip Preſident, that the public may have ſome idea of theſe banditti of the ocean.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of October 1793, about nine o'clock in the morning, the crew of the ſhip Preſident, when they were only within a few hours ſail of Cadiz, the port to which they were bound, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an armed xebeck of 16 guns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under Spaniſh colours, bearing down upon them; upon which the American flag was immediately hoiſted, and as a very light breeze prevailed it was a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time before the two veſſels were within hail of each other. When the xebeck came within gun-ſhot of the American veſſel ſhe hauled down her Spaniſh colours, hoiſted the bloody flag, and fired a platoon of ſmall arms. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance threw them into the moſt violent conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imaginable, and their firſt aim was to ſecure their clothes, money, and other articles. The pirates ſoon after hoiſted out their boat, into which
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:032877_0120_0FF5AA08756D8D20"/>
about thirty armed men entered, who rowed with great violence towards the American veſſel, which they boarded with piſtols and drawn ſwords, and with the greateſt fury and ſhouting imaginable, in order to impreſs the minds of the Americans with a conviction of their great intrepidity in a naval attack.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were on deck, they fell foul of the crew like ſo many ravenous wolves that had broken looſe from their kennel; they tore off their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> can be conceived; every one being anxious to appropriate moſt of the booty to himſelf. One American aſſures us that he was ſeized by no leſs than four Algerines at once, who threw him down and ſtripped him naked; but what evinced the moſt ſingular ferocity in human nature, in ſcrambling for his clothes thoſe furies came to blows among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the moment one had torn off his coat, another attempted to wreſt it from him, and a buſtle enſued between them. The two that had ſeized his trowſers tore them in pieces in their ſtruggle for poſſeſſion, and a ſcene of ſimilar rapacity was acted towards every other American. Every part of the veſſel was rifle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> cheſts were broken open, and they ſeized every arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that could be carried off with an avaricious fury, characteriſtic of no other nation under heaven.</p>
               <p>After they had loaded themſelves with plunder, they thruſt all the American crew into their boat, in this naked and inſulted condition, at the point of their cutlaſſes; thoſe who diſcovered any reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, were knocked down and kicked into the boat, where they were trampled under foot by this clan of deſparadoes. They were taken on board the xebeck, and another boat's crew immediately returned to take charge of the American veſſel.
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:032877_0120_0FF5AA08756D8D20"/>
Here they had the pleaſure of being introduced to Rais Mahomet, the commander of the xebeck, an emaciated loathſome figure, who ſat ſmoking his pipe upon a ſheep-ſkin, and ſipping a diſh of coffee which was placed before him. It is not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that ſuch a miſerable object ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of a corſair, and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance muſt evince the futility of their naval policy. He appeared to be upwards of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old, and through age and impotency, was ſcarcely able to ſupport a tottering frame. His hands were palſied; his eyes ſunk deep in his head, and through weakneſs dripped a continual flow of tears. From his ghaſtly viſage flowed a beard of the brighteſt ſilver, except where it was ſullied by the drippings of his coffee, and an involuntary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſpittle. His voice was ſcarcely audible, and in his exterior he reſembled ſome old hermit, that had been immured a hundred ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the commander of the Algerine xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck. When they had feaſted their curioſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very venerable figure, their attention was turned to their new quarters, which they ſurveyed with new aſtoniſhment. Nearly a hundred and fifty Algerines were crowded into this veſſel, and whatever deſcription can be drawn by the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile imagination, of lice, fleas, filth and ſtench, was here nearly realiſed. Their decks were never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be ſwept or waſhed, and they ſeemed to preſerve their dirt with a kind of veneration. Theſe delicate planks they ſubſtituted for tables, upon which they ate their proviſions, which conſiſted of olives, bread, vinegar and oil. When they had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their meals, they threw part of the fragments overboard, and the remainder was trampled into the general maſs of filth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="unknown:032877_0121_0FF5AA18C8B29000"/>
As ſoon as they had ſecured their prize, the moſt extravagant mirth and boiſterous exultation ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; to commemorate the event a ſheep was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and after beſmearing the ſides of the veſſel with its blood, they concluded the ceremony by devouring its fleſh.</p>
               <p>After the termination of this feſtivity, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were arraigned on deck, and a ſecond ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping took place. Thoſe who had not been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all their clothes at firſt, were now ſtripped naked, and in their ſtead they were accommodated with a few dirty rags, which had been the refuſe of this louſy crew. By Mahomet's order, the clothes of the captives were all thrown together in a heap, and ſold at public vendue.</p>
               <p>The moſt laborious part of duty in the xebeck was then aſſigned to the Americans, and the pirates, ſolely intent upon ſecuring their prize, immediately ſtood in for the ſtreights without looking out for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plunder. In their paſſage the Americans could not help remarking the continual dread and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of theſe free-booters, who were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally looking out with their glaſſes, and like a band of thieves who were conſcious of the villany of their profeſſion, they trembled with the moſt viſible conſternation at every ſail that hove in ſight. The Americans repreſent theſe pirates as the moſt undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined and puſilanimous ſailors in the world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that the moſt inconſiderate naval force with Britiſh diſcipline, is ſufficient to defeat or keep any of them at bay. The greateſt diſplay of Algerine bravery, is at the commencement of an engagement, when they endeavour to intimidate their enemies, like the American ſavages, with the moſt horrible yells.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon of the ſame day the Preſident was captured they fell in with a Britiſh frigate, when the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032877_0121_0FF5AA18C8B29000"/>
Americans were ordered below, and on the ſecond day with a Britiſh merchantman, with whom they had before been in company without the ſtreights, whom they requeſted to publiſh an account of their capture at the firſt port they touched.</p>
               <p>On their paſſage up the ſtreights they had it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in contemplation to riſe upon the Algerine crew, to diſarm thoſe upon watch, and to confine the reſt below by ſecuring the hatches; but their ſmall number deterred them from ſuch an attempt.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of October they arrived at Algiers, and were taken aſhore to the vichelhadge's ſkiff, where they were attended by the dey's <hi>ſcrivan</hi> or head clerk, who conducted them to the palace. Here they were lodged in an outer court, which had been occupied as a kind of black-ſmith's ſhop, where they were refreſhed with a meſs of cuzcuz, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the firſt night upon ſome ſacks of ſtraw, they were ordered to the Bagnio Baleck.</p>
               <p>When the crews of the American veſſels were captured they were entirely ſtripped of their dreſs, and preſented in exchange with a parcel of old rags and a pair of coarſe trowſers, which only reached down to their knees. They laboured for ſeveral months in this wretched apparel, which was not ſufficient to protect them from the rays of a ſcorching ſun, till at length each captive was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated by the United States with a hat and a ſuit of blue clothes, which were ſent them from Alicant by Mr. Montgomery the American conſul; a proviſion which they received annually while they continued in this miſerable abode. They were alſo furniſhed with money, which had been depoſited by Mr. Humphreys at Alicant, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Swediſh conſul in Algiers, upon whom the American captains drew every month for the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032877_0122_0FF5AA1A51729938"/>
ſums that were ſeverally allotted to the captives. To each private there was granted an allowance of 3 dollars and 75 cents, to each mate 6 dollars, and to each captain 8 dollars per month—a very unjuſt diſtinction, eſpecially as the privates were ſubjected to much greater hardſhips than either the captains or mates. By this allowance their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was rendered leſs deplorable, and they were enabled to procure a ſupper of meat every night, inſtead of the black bread and oil with which they were daily furniſhed. It is obſervable that no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made any proviſion for their enſlaved coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen but the United States, and in conſequence the Turks gave them the appellation of <hi>cavalero,</hi> or gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Every public ſlave wore an iron ring round his ancle, which was always an evidence of his belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the public, and no Turk could moleſt or even inſult a ſlave of this deſcription with impunity; but this badge was not conferred upon the private ſlaves. To this ring was faſtened a chain with long links, which was bound round their body to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their eſcape whenever foreign veſſels lay is the harbour.</p>
               <p>When there is a public ranſom of ſlaves there is no difference in the price between the officers and men, but in private ranſoms the dey demands 4000 dollars for each captain and mate, and 2000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for every private. All ſlaves who die after the concluſion of treaties are paid for, and the dey ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the uſual ſums for all the American captives who died after the 5th of September 1796.</p>
               <p>When a corſair takes a prize he carries the captives directly to the palace of the dey, where the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean conſuls aſſemble, to ſee if any of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032877_0122_0FF5AA1A51729938"/>
belong to their reſpective nations, who are at peace with Algiers. In that caſe they reclaim them, provided they were only paſſengers; but if they have ſerved on board of the ſhips of any people at war with this regency, they cannot be diſcharged without payment of the full ranſom.</p>
               <p>The deys formerly had their choice only of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery eighth ſlave, and they generally choſe the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſurgeons, carpenters, and the moſt uſeful hands belonging to the ſeveral prizes, beſides perſons of quality, for whom they expected a large ranſom; but at preſent it ſeems that the dey is entitled to any number he thinks proper to make choice of, who are generally employed in menial offices about the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. He alſo is entitled to all captured veſſels and their cargoes, and the rais or captains generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, beſides their monthly pay, a certain premium, or extra-compenſation from the dey for every cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured veſſel.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the ſlaves are ſent into the ſervice of the public; but if they can procure a little mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, they paying to the dey a certain duty in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the wine they ſell; and notwithſtanding this intereſt and duty, many have managed ſo well as to raiſe money enough to purchaſe their liberty, and to carry away a quantity beſides: for they are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a property in what they get. To theſe taverns reſort Turks, Moors, and Chriſtians promiſcuouſly. But a Muſſulman would not keep one of theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns for the world himſelf, and conſequently they are kept by Chriſtians and Jews. And a tavern-keeper, though a ſlave, is empowered to ſtrip any of his gueſts, even the Turks themſelves, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:032877_0123_0FF5AA1BD8EB9F98"/>
to pay their reckoning; and herein he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the dey himſelf.</p>
               <p>The condition of thoſe who are ſlaves to private individuals, depends very much upon the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their maſter, and the ſlaves' own conduct. Some of them fare better in Algiers, than ever they did in their own countries, and if they are good for any thing, are entertained rather as compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than ſervants; though by far the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are barbarous maſters, who treat their ſlaves with great cruelty, and perſons of quality, or thoſe who are ſuſpected to be in affluent circumſtances, experience a greater ſeverity of treatment, in order that they may be compelled to redeem themſelves at an extraordinary price. Their female ſlaves are ſent to the dey's ſeraglio, where they are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, or ſubjected to domeſtic ſervices, unleſs a conſiderable ranſom is expected for them; or if young they are ſold to ſuch as want them for theſe purpoſes.</p>
               <p>They neither force nor tempt any of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſlaves to change their religion; as it is not their intereſt that they ſhould be made converts: for in that caſe they loſe the benefit of their ranſoms. The Chriſtians who are free, generally fare worſe than the ſlaves; becauſe the imperious Turks make it a point to inſult and abuſe them; but they dare not abuſe the ſlaves, becauſe their maſters will reſent it and demand ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſlaves who are ſold into the country are ſubjected to peculiar hardſhips. They are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to carry all kinds of burdens to market, and if they do not render a ſatisfactory account of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles entruſted to their care, they are ſure to be beaten. Some of theſe ſlaves go naked in the fields where they tend cattle, drag ploughs, and do all other kinds of the moſt ſervile drudgery.</p>

Many were formerly conſigned to the galleys chained by one leg, and fed on water and hard biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, and beaten with a large cow-ſkin. When they were on ſhore they were locked up at night in dungeons called <hi>Maſmora,</hi> where they lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the bare earth. But at preſent no ſlaves are confined to the galleys, becauſe they have ſo frequently made their eſcape, or murdered their commanders, and ſet themſelves at liberty.</p>
               <p>While the Americans were enſlaved in Algiers, the moſt exaggerated accounts were circulated reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſeverity of their afflictions. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the tongues of ſome were cut out, that others were emaſculated; and captain Lawrence of the Hull Packet, who is ſaid to have obtained his information at Cadiz, informs us that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans had their heads ſhaved cloſe, and were not permitted to wear any kind of covering on their heads. Their calamities were indeed without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, but the above accounts were entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <p>The greateſt ſeverity of their toils conſiſted in the removal of the fragments of rocks from Bubly-white, as before mentioned<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 75.</note>. It has been found by repeated experiments, that the larger theſe ſtones, the more effectually they reſiſt the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of the ſea, and conſequently the great art of the ſlaves who are appointed to blow them, conſiſts in boring them in ſuch a manner that an explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of gun-powder will ſever the largeſt maſſes poſſible: ſo that the holes which are bored into the rock ſometimes extend to the depth of twenty feet. Round theſe huge fragments they laſh ropes,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:032877_0124_0FF5AA1D5E621F38"/>
or rather cables, of ſufficient ſtrength to drag them, and three or four hundred ſlaves, and ſometimes a greater number, are engaged in rolling one of theſe ſtones upon a <hi>carette,</hi> or ſtrong four wheel car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in order to tranſport it to the mole.</p>
               <p>The Turks make the moſt aſtoniſhing noiſe, not only in the removal of theſe ſtones, but in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any weight whatever which requires a number of hands. They ſeem to imagine that the greater their vociferation, the greater will be the exertions of the ſlaves or labourers; it is immaterial how ſlowly the work proceeds, provided there is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient noiſe, and the cry of <hi>Hyomoly,</hi> or heave away, is often heard at the diſtance of more than a league.</p>
               <p>When they have launched theſe unweildy maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſtone upon the carriages, the cables are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and four files of ſlaves are compelled, like ſo many beaſts of burden, to drag them from the mountain to the city. In their paſſage they are obliged to aſcend a ſteep hill, where their utmoſt efforts are ſometimes inſufficient to drag the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous weight. The ſeverity of their toils in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſummit of this hill is ſometimes incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; the ſun pours down the moſt intolerable heat upon them, and they are drenched in ſweat, and involved in clouds of duſt which attend them in their paſſage. Thus many become perfectly exhauſted with their toils; and to complete the climax of their ſufferings, their brutal overſeers, the wardens, ſcourge them for the leaſt remiſſneſs with the moſt ſavage ſeverity.</p>
               <p>When they have aſcended the hill, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to reverſe the ropes, and their utmoſt efforts are then required to prevent the carette from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:032877_0124_0FF5AA1D5E621F38"/>
the hill with the greateſt rapidity. Thus, after great labour and difficulty, they tranſport theſe ſtones to the wharf, where the pantoons are moored, which is about a league from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a ſtone's throw from the walls of the city. Here they depoſit them, and by means of pulleys and a kind of ſleds, which deſcend upon gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d pieces of timber, they diſcharge them into the pantoons, which convey them to the mole.</p>
               <p>Theſe pantoons are neceſſary, becauſe the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtreets renders the paſſage of theſe huge ſtones through the city impracticable. They are a ſpecies of large flat bottomed boats, that cover about as much water as a ſeventy-four gun ſhip. They have low gunwhales, and long pieces of timber are nailed acroſs the deck, to prevent the great preſſure of the ſtones from-injuring the planks. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally carry three or four of theſe huge ſtones at a load, with a number of ſmaller ones, which are diſtributed over different parts of the deck.</p>
               <p>The pantoons are navigated by caſting anchors and cables a-head. Fifty or ſixty ſlaves are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to man them, and by means of theſe cables and anchors, which are continually carried a-head as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires, they warp the pantoons to the mole. In their paſſage they are ſometimes ſubjected to great danger from ſudden ſqualls of wind, which either blow them out to ſea, or wreck them on the ſhore. When this happens the greateſt buſtle ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable enſues, and the clamour of the Turks is ſuch, that one would ſuppoſe that the city itſelf was upon the verge of deſtruction. The ſtones are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged at the mole by means of a <hi>ſkyler,</hi> which is a kind of platform reſembling the leaf of a table, projecting from the ſtern of the pantoon, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:032877_0125_0FF5AA2D85B55590"/>
by pulleys; upon this the ſtones are placed in ſucceſſion, by means of crowbars, and depoſited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch parts of the mole as the ſea makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Thus have the fooliſh Turks continued this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labour for upwards of 250 years, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived the project of forming a wall of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength to defend the mole from the violence, of the waves; but it is ſaid that the dey has now ſuch a project in contemplation, which he intends ſhortly to put in execution.</p>
               <p>The impetuoſity of the ſea has a continual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bury theſe ſtones in the ſand. An eaſtern, or as it is called a Levant wind will roll ſuch a heavy ſea into the harbour, that in the courſe of three or four days, the labour of a whole ſeaſon will be ſwept away. The ſea at ſuch times breaks with great violence over the mole, and even the walls of the magazines are ſometimes nearly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Two pantoons and two carettes, with a gang of ſlaves to each of them, are employed in tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſtones, and the carettes generally bring each two loads in a day.</p>
               <p>Many ſlaves are employed at other places in the country. Some at a mountain called Bubazoon, ſome at the gardens of different conſuls, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the country, and others in the marine. But on Fridays they are ordered to Bublywhite, where the vickelhadge and warden baſhaws attend, and where, on thoſe days, there is a general collection of all the ſlaves.</p>
               <p>After they finiſh their daily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> labour they all repair to town to their common lodgings the bagnios, where they are locked up every night, and prohibited all intercourſe with the citizens. The private ſlaves are not, however, deprived of this privilege, and they
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:032877_0125_0FF5AA2D85B55590"/>
are permitted to walk the ſtreets at night, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they conform to the common cuſtom of carrying a light with them, without which every perſon is ſubject to being arreſted by the watchmen of the city, and to chaſtiſement by the baſtinado.</p>
               <p>In the bagnios, the chief aim of the ſlaves is to drown the reflection of their abject ſituation by the moſt cheerful converſation. They have few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements here to divert their attention; but ſome of them, when they have leiſure, follow their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, in order to obtain a little money. The principal ſtudy of the more humorous Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, was to diſpel the gloom of their companions and to excite one another to laughter by ludicrous and ſatirical remarks upon their ſituation. Some of them played upon the violin, and frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the toils of the day, they would divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all night by dancing, drinking and ſinging, in order to baniſh the reflection of ſlavery. In their frolics they were often very clamorous, and interrupted the repoſe of the whole bagnio; at which time ſome of the ſlaves would often lodge complaints againſt them, and the corporal would then put an end to the frolic by ordering them to retire to reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſlaves are let out of the bagnios at an early hour in the morning, and they proceed to their labour with penſive hearts and reluctant ſteps. When they are employed in the marine they repair every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o a place near the gate of Babazira, which opens to the harbour, where they are paraded in files along the platforms of the houſes on each ſide of the ſtreet. Here they wait the arrival of the vickelhadge, who ſoon makes his appearance, and as he paſſes between them they are compelled to pull off their hats as a token of reſpect. After him a proceſſion of the

ſlaves is immediately formed, and as he takes his ſeat in the ſkiff, a trumpet is ſounded from the marine. They are then embarked on board the Baleck boats, which are kept for the purpoſe, and tranſported to the cruiſers which are ſtationed in different parts of the harbour.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of the marine is the leaſt laborious employment of the ſlaves. But even here they are ſubjected at times to great hardſhips, and eſpecially when an expedition is on foot; at which time they are compelled to labour all night in making the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparations for the cruiſe. The ſhore is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with lamps, and Turkiſh guards are ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned on the mole, and in other parts, to prevent their eſcape.</p>
               <p>Their food conſiſts of bread, oil, and vinegar. To each perſon is diſtributed two ſmall loaves of about half a pound each, and a jill of oil a day. Theſe articles are brought to Bublywhite by mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who are daily employed in carrying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to the ſlaves. The bread is of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different quality, and is made of unboulted meal, ground in mills in the city which are turned by horſes. The general employment of the mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

bread, and medicines are preſcribed according to their ſeveral complaints. The upper apartments of this hoſpital are occupied by ſuch as have the plague, and the lower parts by thoſe who are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with other diſorders. It is ſaid that the ſupport of this hoſpital coſts the Spaniſh nation 40,000 dollars per annum, which are annualy tranſmitted to Algiers for this benevolent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It has been reported that the officers and men of the American veſſels were treated with equal ſeverity; but this was a miſtake. Neither the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican captains nor mates were ſubjected to the labour of the common ſlaves; but were employed in the ſail-loft in making ſails, or in boring pumps for veſſels, and ſometimes after lazar in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon they were ſent to aſſiſt in unloading the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons. This was the general routine of busineſs aſſigned to the captains and mates of veſſels; but the ſailors were indiſcriminately empolyed in every kind of labour.</p>
               <p>The Americans ſupported the beſt characters of any ſlaves in Algiers, and the moſt of them could always obtain credit in the bagnios for wine and other liquors; a favour that was conferred upon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Turks nor Moors, of whom the tavern-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were always obliged to be extremely watchful; otherwiſe they would frequently ſteal away without pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing for the liquors they drank.</p>
               <p>The moſt turbulent of the ſlaves are the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who frequently quarrel at night, and fight in the bagnios with drawn daggers; at which times the corporals ſettle diſturbances among them with a ſhort rope with a knot in the end, or confine them in chains till morning.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſlaves who have incurred the penalty of death are generally executed at the fountain in front
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:032877_0127_0FF5AA30C045CB30"/>
of the dey's palace, where the Turkiſh execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers attend. The criminal is made to kneel down; one of the Turks then touches him on the back part of the head, and as he turns round to ſee what was the cauſe, the other with a ſharp ſword at the ſame inſtant ſevers his head from his ſhoulders. After the execution, the blood is waſhed through the ground into the common ſewer, and his body is buried in the ſand near the ſea ſhore, as they are not ſuffered the privilege of a Mahometan burial.</p>
               <p>The American captives generally bore their ſufferings with great fortitude, and conducted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuperior decorum; but notwithſtanding, frequent and ſevere puniſhments were inflicted upon them for the moſt trivial remiſſneſs, and a thouſand inadvertencies, which are natural to thoſe who have been accuſtomed to the enjoyment of their liberties.</p>
               <p>Soon after their arrival in Algiers they drew up an affecting addreſs to Colonel Humphreys, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at Madrid, which was duly anſwered; and as this correſpondence details ſome particulars that have not been hitherto enumerated, we ſhall cloſe the preſent chapter with its inſertion.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been favoured by the receipt of your joint letter, dated 29th December, and, as I am about to ſet out immediately for Liſbon, I ſhall be able to do little more than aſſure you, that your memorials to the Senate and Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the United States ſhall be forwarded to them in the earlieſt and ſafeſt manner poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Having communicated to Mr. Carmichael, and Mr. Short, your apprehenſion that the plague may again be introduced to Algiers, from the adjacent countries, where it is already ſaid to prevail; we have not heſitated to concur with you in ſentiment, that in caſe of that dreadful event, it might be uſeful for you to have a houſe hired in the country; in order to endeavour, by all human precautions, to prevent your falling victims to that terrible diſorder. Whereupon Mr. Robert Montgomery, conſul of the United States at Alicant, has been empowered, in caſe that dreadful event ſhould happen, to furniſh
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:032877_0129_0FF5AA324AFAB310"/>
ſufficient money to pay for the hire of a houſe, in the manner, and for the purpoſe you propoſe. This proviſional arrangement to continue in force, until Mr. Montgomery ſhall receive ulterior inſtructions from the government of the United States, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing or ſuſpending the ſame.</p>
                  <p>I entreat you will be perſuaded, my dear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate countrymen, that I receive with great ſatisfaction the marks of your approbation, of the honeſt, but ineffectual efforts I have made in your favor. Would to Heaven, they had been as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful as they were diſintereſted and ſincere.</p>
                  <p>I have only to repeat, that you may at all times, and on all occaſions, count upon the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic regard And eſteem of</p>

Though I have repeatedly remarked, that it may perhaps, (for particular reaſons) be inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for me to keep up a regular correſpondence with you; yet it is proper I ſhould add, that I ſhall always be glad to hear from you; and that it may be particularly intereſting to the government of our country, to receive at the earlieſt poſſible period, all intelligence of importance.

               <p>IT is impoſſible for any ſlave to eſcape from Algiers by land: for if he is diſcovered by the Moors he is apprehended and brought back to the city, where they receive a reward for their trouble. Thoſe that can get on board of French or Engliſh ſhips ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their liberties, and no demand is made upon the commanders to deliver them up: and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>Attempt of fifteen ſlaves to eſcape.</head>
                  <p>WHILE the American captives were employed at Bublywhite, a ſcheme was concerted between fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Genoeſe, Portugueſe, and Neapolitan ſlaves, to make their eſcape in one of the boats that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the pantoons. This plot had been in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſeveral weeks, and in the mean time they
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:032877_0130_0FF5AA4287EE3E30"/>
had prepared themſelves with weapons of defence, and all neceſſary articles for their voyage. About nine o'clock one very hot morning, in the time of Ramadan, while <hi>Montenegro,</hi> the warden of the pantoon, lay aſleep, theſe fifteen ſlaves, at the word of command, jumped into the boat which lay along ſide the pantoon, and put to ſea in an inſtant. The portezero, or boatſwain of the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon, immediately waked Montenegro, who was aſtoniſhed beyond meaſure when he ſaw them under weigh, and hallowed to them in a furious tone of voice to return; upon which one of the Portugueſe waved his naked ſword in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the crew gave three loud huzzas, and rowed with all their might towards the Spaniſh coaſt. Montenegro, dreading the conſequences of this piece of neglect, immediately fled for ſafety to the grand moſque which ſtands out of the town.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the news was announced to the dey, he ordered men to be ſtationed on eminences with ſpy-glaſſes, to obſerve the courſe they ſteered; and in the mean time a Spaniſh built boat, a ſwift runner (which is always moored near the ſeat of the vichelhadge of the marine to be in readineſs upon any particular emergency) was inſtantly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to purſue them. The vichelhadge manned the boat with a double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ire of piſcorees, or rowers, and that they might purſue them with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition he embarked himself. By this time the fugitives were out of ſight; but the piſcorees ſteered directly towards that part of the ocean where they had diſappeared. The vichelhadge, in order to encourage them to greater exertions, frequently threw them money, and they rowed with ſuch expedition that about noon they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the fugitives, who had ſo completely exhauſted
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:032877_0130_0FF5AA4287EE3E30"/>
themſelves in their endeavours to eſcape, that they were ſcarcely able to move their oars. As ſoon as their purſuers had overtaken them they ſubmitted without the leaſt reſiſtance, and paſſively reſigned themſelves to the fury of their purſuers, who beat them moſt unmercifully, and after ſecuring them in chains, brought them back to the city, where they arrived about four o'clock in he afternoon. They were immediately taken before the dey, who order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two of the principals to be executed: and they were accordingly led to the fountain in front of the dey's palace, where they kneeled down, and one of the dey's guards with a ſharp tahan ſevered their heads from their body.</p>
                  <p>The dey obſerved, that had a greater number em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked he would not have pretended to have ſent in purſuit of them; but he naturally concluded that ſo ſmall a number would ſoon exhauſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>One is apt naturally to arraign their impolicy in taking their departure with ſo ſmall a number. But we ought to reflect upon the great difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of detection in affecting an eſcape of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for the very air of the country ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the principles of villany and deception; ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any ſcheme can be concerted without detection, and there are many miſcreants of ſlaves here, who would feel no remorſe whatever in betraying their moſt intimate friends for a trifling reward.</p>
                  <p>Montenegro, though he was pardoned after this event, yet he forfeited the royal favor, and was turned out of office; and the pantoons have ſince been ſo well guarded that an eſcape is totally impracticable.</p>

                  <p>THE moſt turbulent and intemperate ſlaves in Algiers are the Spaniards, who go armed with a dagger or long knife, and a quarrel with each other generally terminates in aſſaſſination.</p>
                  <p>About ten o'clock one night, after the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſlaves had retired to reſt in the Bagnio Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laro, a violent quarrel happened between two Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, which made ſuch an uproar in the bagnio, that one of the corporals, or guardians, entered the room with a lantern in his hand, in order to quell the diſturbance; and with his rope he fell to beating the Spaniards moſt unmercifully. One of them, who did not reliſh the chaſtiſement very well, deſired him to deſiſt, and threatened to ſtab him if he perſiſted in beating him; which ſo irritated the corporal, that he deal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> out his blows more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly than ever. The Spaniard grown outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous with ſuch treatment, drew his dagger and gave him four or five wounds, of which he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expired. By this time the ſecond corporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the apartment, and as he entered, the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Spaniard ruſhed furiouſly upon him, and in attempting to ward off the blow he received a wound in his arm; upon which he immediately retreated, and locked himſelf up in one of the taverns that ſtand near the bagnio.</p>
                  <p>The two Spaniards were now at liberty to decide their diſpute, and they ruſhed furiouſly upon each other with their knives; but the leaſt deſperate of the two, after receiving ſeveral wounds, made his eſcape, and left his antagoniſt complete maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the bagnio. He now paraded the paſſage
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:032877_0131_0FF5AA44152FD400"/>
flouriſhing his dagger, and threatening venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to any one who ſhould attempt to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt him. Of five or ſix hundred ſlaves and others who reſided there not one durſt approach him, and he maintained the undiſputed poſſeſſion of the paſſage. At this juncture the corporal of the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Baleck, who was then confined by fickneſs in the Spaniſh hoſpital, hallowed to him from his window, and ordered him to put up his knife and go to bed; but the Spaniard, who was little diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obey him, challenged him with the moſt abuſive language to come down.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time intelligence of this uproar was communicated to the warden of the bagnio, who imagined that the whole body of ſlaves had broken looſe, and he inſtantly came armed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a number of men in order to quell the diſturbance. When he arrived at the entrance into the bagnio, he commanded the Spaniard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſubmit; but he was now grown more furious than ever, and defied the whole city. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this conference one of his own countrymen ſtole ſoftly up behind him and knocked him down with a club. A number of men then inſtantly ſeized him, and chained him to the wall, where he remained till the next morning, when he was taken before the dey, where he received ſentence of death, and in a few minutes after his head was chopped off in front of the dey's palace.</p>

dey's liſberos or ſpies who chanced to ride that way. Several other ſlaves who happened to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the ſame time fortunately made their eſcape; but the Neapolitan ſtood motionleſs with the ſudden ſurprize. The liſberos diſmounted and inſtantly ſeized both him and the woman, and immediately carried them before the dey, who inſtantly paſſed ſentence of death pon them both. Through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of ſome powerful friends the ſentence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Neapolitan was remitted; but he total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forfeited the privilege of keeping a tavern, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiving 500 ſtrokes upon different parts of his body, he was conſigned to hard labour among the common ſlaves. But the woman, after receiving ſentence, was immediately carried to the ſea-ſide by two executioners, who tied a large bomb-ſhell round one of her legs, and threw her into ſhe ſea ſome diſtance from the ſhore, in the preſence of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican captives, who were then employed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.

                  <p>Some days after, by ſome means or other, the bomb-ſhell was diſengaged from her leg, and ſhe floated upon the ſurface of the water.

                  <head>Diſappointment of the American ſlaves.</head>
                  <p>SOME time in 1795 an Engliſh cutter from Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralter arrived in Algiers with a number of ſmall pieces of braſs cannon, which were purchaſed by the dey and carried to his palace. The American ſlaves, who were then at work in the marine, ſoon recogniſed ſeveral perſons of their former acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the crew of the cutter. A general inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy took place, and they ſympathiſed ſo feelingly for the diſtreſs of the Americans, that a ſcheme was concerted among them to effect their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from this region of miſery. The crew deeply intereſted themſelves in the accompliſhment of this project, and communicated their intentions to their captain, who perfectly approved of their plan, and promiſed every aſſiſtance in his power to facilitate their deſign.</p>
                  <p>The ſcheme deviſed between the parties was as follows: The Americans were to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the firſt fair wind, and in either going to, or returning from their labour in the marine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the wind ſhould favor them, they were to take poſſeſſion of the Baleck boats which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them, and inſtantly row themſelves on board the cutter; which being a very ſwift ſailing veſſel would ſoon have waſted them beyond the reach of their purſuers. The inſtant they had boarded the cutter they were to take poſſeſſion of her apparently by force, and the Britiſh crew were to affect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that the dey might entertain no ſuſpicion of their being privy to the conſpiracy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="unknown:032877_0133_0FF5AA47259CE030"/>
The cutter was in conſequence put into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete order, and the neceſſary inſtructions were given that they might caſt off and get under weigh in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>No ſlaves were perhaps ever preſented with ſo favorable an opportunity as the preſent. But the moſt ſingular occurrence imaginable fruſtrated the whole ſcheme, when it was upon the point of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>The captain of the cutter, on the day of their intended departure, went up to one of the bagnios in the city, were he accidentally fell in company with two renegado Iriſhmen of his acquaintance, who were dreſſed, as uſual, in the Turkiſh habit. It was reſolved of courſe to celebrate this unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted interview with a courſe of wine; and they drank till they were all pretty well intoxicated. While they were in this animated mood they found themſelves ſo well diſpoſed for adventures, that one of the renegados made a propoſal to viſit ſome of the Algerine courtezans, which was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceded to, and our captain, who was not, as may well be ſuppoſed, over burthened with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, was conducted to a Mooriſh brothel in the upper parts of the city, where theſe Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had previouſly formed an acquaintance. Some of the liſberos, who had ſuſpected their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſecretly watched their motions, and diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the retreat of our frolicſome adventurers. Soon after their entry theſe liſberos ruſhed into the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and ſurpriſed our amorous captain and his friends in the height of their mirth. He was inſtantly ſeized and carried before the dey, who ſentenced him to immediate execution; but as he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to receive the reward of his folly, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh conſul, who had received intelligence of the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:032877_0133_0FF5AA47259CE030"/>
event, interceded in his behalf, and the dey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſentence, upon condition that he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took his departure from Algiers. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he was eſcorted on board his cutter, which was ordered immediately out of the harbour, and ſhe was not even permitted to remain to take in the leaſt ballaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus was this ſcheme moſt completely defeated by this trivial incident, and the hopes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans entirely fruſtrated. When they ſaw the departure of the cutter, and were informed of the captain's folly, they were thrown into a ſtate of inconceivable deſpondency. The moſt fortunate breeze imaginable prevailed when they returned from the marine; but inſtead of triumphing in the poſſeſſion of their liberties, they were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the gloomy cells of the bagnio, to indulge at leiſure the poignancy of their reflections.</p>
                  <p>Theſe renegados were afterwards baniſhed to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis; not becauſe their intercourſe with the Mooriſh women was prohibited, (for the renegados are not deprived of this privilege) but becauſe they had been acceſſory to an infraction of the law. All the Turks were greatly rejoiced at this event, becauſe theſe turbulent Iriſhmen were a terror to all that frequented the bagnios and other public places in the city.</p>

After they are initiated into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their new faith, they officiate in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarees in the capacity of Turkiſh ſoldiers, and are admitted to the participation of ſimilar privileges; but they are prohibited from leaving the kingdom of Algiers under penalty of death, and are never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up upon the demand of their nation.</p>

As the Turk was engaged the principal part of the day in the marine, it afforded the Couloly a moſt favorable opportunity for frequent interviews, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this amorous correſpondence, till ſome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it was whiſpered to the huſband, who hired two Mooriſh ſpies, to keep watch near his houſe in his abſence.</p>
                  <p>After continuing their watch a few hours the Couloly made his appearance, and entered the houſe; upon which intelligence was immediately conveyed to the Turk, who haſtened with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition from the marine, boiling with revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his rival, whom he detected in the paſſage of his houſe. An immediate conflict enſued, and the Couloly, after receiving ſeveral flight wounds, made his eſcape. The Turk then ſeized his wife by the neck, and as an expiation for the crime of which he had ſuppoſed her guilty, he choaked her to death.</p>
                  <p>When the dey received intelligence of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action he inſtituted a ſtrict enquiry into the matter. He acknowledged the right of the Turks to put their wives to death; they being conſidered as merely the property of their huſbands; but when it appeared, upon examination, that the woman
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:032877_0141_0FF5AA7246CEA148"/>
was in a ſtate of pregnancy at her death, he was violently enraged, and obſerved, that though the Turk might exerciſe this privilege with impunity upon his wife, yet he had no power whatever over the life of the infant. In conſequence of this crime he was excluded from his office; but he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promoted to the command of a cruiſer, by whom captain M'Shane and his crew were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured.</p>

                  <p>THE principal part of the Neapolitan ſlaves were exchanged for Turks at the time the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can captives were ranſomed, and embarked with the Americans in the ſhip La Fortune, under the command of captain Calder, which was originally deſtined for Leghorn.</p>
                  <p>From the 11th to the 13th of July 1796, they were engaged in making the neceſſary preparations for their voyage.

At this time a freſh weſterly breeze prevailed, and owing to ſome neglect in bracing the yards, the ſhip was very near being driven ſtern foremoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rocks near Porta Piſcou, which obliged them to let go their anchor immediately; upon which the captain of the port came aboard in a great rage, and ſtruck captain Calder ſeveral blows; called him a ſans ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>About two hours after they had hoiſted ſail, one of the Neapolitans was ſeized with the plague, and
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:032877_0143_0FF5AA82DC935A78"/>
being apprehenſive that the contagion would ſpread among the crew, they put about the ſhip and ſtood in for Algiers, with an intention to land the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan. As ſoon as they had hoiſted a ſignal a boat came off and took him aſhore; but the vichelhadge would not ſuffer him to be landed, and ordered him immediately back to the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
                  <p>After they had been under weigh about half an hour, the dey, receiving information of what had paſſed, ordered a number of the piſcorees to go in purſuit of her, who ſoon after returned and brought back the ſick Neapolitan.</p>
                  <p>But their misfortune, did not terminate here: for the day after another Neapolitan was diſcovered to have the plague, of which, he died ſhortly after; and the ſucceeding day captain Baily was ſeized with the diſorder, and alſo died.

                  <p>Siccinct account of Algiers in the time of Pinchinin.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE city of Algiers has undergone conſiderable alterations in the ſtate of its fortifications, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, cuſtoms, and manners, &amp;c. ſince the year 1640, the time of their famous admiral Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Pinchinin.</p>
               <p>The ancient wall of the city ſtill remains; but ſcarcely any viſible veſtiges exiſt of the ditch which extended the whole length of the wall on the land ſide. This ditch was about ſixteen feet wide, and of a proportionable depth; and ſerved as a recepticle for the filth of the city. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants derived but little advantage from this wall, as no military force was ſtationed behind it for the defence of the city.</p>
               <p>All the ſtreets were chained up at night; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which extended the whole length of the city from the port of Babloet, between the great moſque and the dey's palace, to the gate of Buba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoon.</p>
               <p>The principal part of the garriſon was lodged in five large public edifices, with ſpacious courts in the middle, which ſerved as armories. Each of theſe contained about 600 ſoldiers, who were ſupported at the public expence; each of whom were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with a ſeparate apartment. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the principal Turks were lodged in large houſes called <hi>Fonducas,</hi> which belonged to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="unknown:032877_0144_0FF5AA84677DD918"/>
The caſtle called <hi>Alcazabar</hi> was that part of the city which lay to the ſouthward, divided by a wall which began at the rampart on the eaſt ſide, and extended to that on the weſt.</p>
               <p>About three hundred paces from the ſhore ſtood a ſmall iſland, that was joined to the city by a mole which was finiſhed in the year 1533, and intended for the protection of veſſels. This mole was carried away by a violent tempeſt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1662, which occaſioned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe deſtruction among the ſhipping.</p>
               <p>Without the city there were ſeveral inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fortreſſes; the principal of which was that built by Haſſan Baſhaw in the year 1545 at the place where Charles V. pitched his tent in 1541. This fortreſs is ſtill in exiſtence, and is called the <hi>imperial caſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants amounted to about 100,000; of which 12,000 were Turkiſh ſoldiers, 30,000 ſlaves of various nations, and the remainder citizens of Algiers, who conſiſted of Moors, Moreſcos, Jews, and ſome Chriſtian merchants.</p>
               <p>The ſupreme authority was, as at preſent, veſted in the dey, or, as he was then called, the baſhaw, who was frequently honored with the appellation of <hi>Sultan,</hi> with which he was highly pleaſed.</p>
               <p>His ſituation appears to have been more precarious then than at preſent, and he was in continual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of mutiny among the Turkiſh ſoldiers; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if their monthly wages were withheld. His principal ſtudy, therefore, was to make punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at every new moon, and if he delayed theſe payments three hours after they were due, he was in great danger either of being murdered or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="unknown:032877_0144_0FF5AA84677DD918"/>
The dey was obliged to be very circumſpect in taking no more than his due proportion of all prizes; for otherwiſe he was in danger of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate execution by an incenſed ſoldiery; as happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in September 1661, when Ramadan Baſhaw, who then preſided, adjudged to himſelf a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion of prize-wheat than was his due. This proceeding cauſed an immediate inſurrection of the ſoldiers, who cut his throat, and maſſacred twenty-eight of the divan, whoſe bodies were thrown to the dogs in the ſtreets. The reſt were obliged to make their eſcape in a fiſhing boat, to avoid the fury of the ſoldiers, in which they were afterwards captured by the Malteſe and made ſlaves.</p>
               <p>After the death of Ramadan, another Baſhaw, whom they had impriſoned ſome years before for neglect in making punctual payments, was brought out and elected to the ſovereignty of Algiers, whom they exhorted to a more virtuous conduct in admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration.</p>
               <p>But within three days after, he forgot their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, and meditated nothing but the deſtruction of an aga, who had been acceſſory to his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the execution of this deſign he promiſed 10,000 patacoons<note n="*" place="bottom">The patacoon is a Spaniſh coin about 84 cents in value.</note> to two ſoldiers if they would murder him. With this intention they went to the aga's houſe, and requeſted to ſpeak with him. But the ſlave who came out, ſuſpecting their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their countenances, anſwered that his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not at home.</p>
               <p>When intelligence was announced to the aga of the dey's deſigns, he urged a complaint to the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who ſeized him and threw him into a dark dungeon, where he received his food through a ſmall hole, and only had room enough to ſit down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="unknown:032877_0145_0FF5A9A35D6C8C08"/>
The neceſſity of punctual payment, often obliged the dey to procure money by every ſiniſter means in his power: even by the violation or miſconſtruction of treaties. And this imperious neceſſity induced him to riſk a rupture with Great Britain in 1661, by making prize (contrary to their treaty of peace) of the property and perſons of foreigners that had been ſhipped on board of Britiſh veſſels. In conſequence of this infraction of the treaty, the earl of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick was diſpatched to Algiers, with a fleet of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſail of the line, to demand reſtitution. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral entered the harbour the 22d of Auguſt, and diſpatched his lieutenant with his credentials on ſhore to demand ſatisfaction, which the dey and divan were not diſpoſed to grant. In conſequence, the Britiſh conſul was brought on board the fleet, and the admiral, after pouring a volley of grape ſhot into the city, and battering down ſeveral houſes, took his departure.</p>
               <p>The principal ſtudy of the dey was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of impoſition upon nations with whom he was in alliance. Their veſſels were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeized, and the captains conſtrained, by corporal puniſhment, to confeſs that the property belonged to other nations. Indeed it was an arduous taſk for him to avoid foreign diſputes, and at the ſame time promote harmony at home. He was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the eſtabliſhment of peace with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have a tendency to abridge his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, and a want of finances to diſcharge the neceſſary demands, would expoſe him to the fury of a mutinous ſoldiery. Treaties of peace were therefore neceſſarily violated, and as he derived the principal part of his revenue from captured veſſels, he was ſeldom at peace with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="unknown:032877_0145_0FF5A9A35D6C8C08"/>
The 12,000 men that conſtituted his ordinary forces, conſiſted chiefly of the refuſe of Turkey, and of renegados who had fled for refuge from Europe; for Algiers was ſuch a perfect aſylum for villany, that even thoſe who had offended the Grand Signior himſelf found protection upon their arrival there, as was the caſe in 1640.</p>
               <p>One Sigala, the ſon of a Genoeſe renegado a famous admiral of the ſame name, had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of a ſquadron of galleys belonging to the Grand Signior Morad IV. which brought home the annual tribute of Egypt. Sigala on his return anchored his fleet in ſome of the ports of Greece, where he went on ſhore to devote part of his time to the women. While he was here indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in every gratification, the Malteſe ran into the port, and captured the veſſel which was freighted with the treaſure. Sigala, to avoid the bow ſtring, ſet ſail immediately with his galley to Algiers, where he ſubſiſted by piracy till he was pardoned by Ibrahim the ſucceſſor of Morad.</p>
               <p>Algiers was at this time a kind of military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and the dey was ſo perfectly under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of the ſoldiery, that without their concurrence he could do nothing. If they approved of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they were executed, and if not, the dey was compelled to relinquiſh them.</p>
               <p>In the year 1642, a tributory king, refuſing to pay tribute, appeared with an army to ſhake off the Algerine yoke. Yuſef, the reigning dey, deſirous of being exempted from the command of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, pretended indiſpoſition. But the ſoldiers were not diſpoſed to receive his excuſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to embark in one of his galleys; and leſt he ſhould deſert them, he was eſcorted by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:032877_0146_0FF5A990222DC950"/>
other galley, and was obliged to ſubmit to being diſembarked with his army at the place appointed.</p>
               <p>At this time there were, according to ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, about three thouſand French renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos in Algiers. Before this time the renegados were prohibited from ſerving in the capacity of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh ſoldiers; but Mahomet Baſhaw firſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be incorporated with the Turks in 1568.</p>
               <p>The pay of each ſoldier was eight Moreſco doubles<note n="*" place="bottom">This double is about 25 cents in value.</note> a month; but their pay was enhanced upon extraordinary emergencies, and in proportion to the number of years they had ſerved. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Sultaneſs was delivered of a ſon, or they had any remarkable engagement with the Arabs, or any ſoldier had killed his enemy in an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and brought away his head, their pay was augmented a double a month: provided the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of doubles did not exceed forty.</p>
               <p>The unmarried ſoldiers enjoyed greater privileges than thoſe who were married. To the former were diſtributed four loaves of bread a day, but to the latter none.</p>
               <p>The ſoldiers kept no guard in the city; but a watch called <hi>Meſuart,</hi> conſiſting of twenty-five perſons, paraded the ſtreets. In the ſummer the city was nearly deſtitute of a garriſon, as the army was then diſperſed into various parts of the country to enforce the payment of taxes.</p>
               <p>The divan were convened twice a week in a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the palace, and conſiſted of 40 perſons. All matters were decided here by a majority; but what was remarkable, the votes were collected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:032877_0146_0FF5A990222DC950"/>
the debate was cloſed. All cauſes between the ſoldiers were decided in this council, but thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the citizens were determined before the chiah, who was the dey's lieutenant.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>EMANUEL D'ARANDA was a native of Dunkirk i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

On the firſt of Auguſt 1640, he left Madrid, and proceeded by land to St. Sebaſtian, where he embarked on board an Engliſh veſſel, in order to return to his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, after having viſited various parts of Spain. After being at ſea a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> days, they diſcovered a large ſhip bearing down upon them, which proved to be a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel. The maſter of the Engliſh veſſel immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ordered his ſails to be furled up, and alledged for a reaſon that it was not cuſtomary for an Engliſh veſſel to run away at ſea. The caravel ſoon came within gun ſhot, but without hoiſting her colours; whereupon it was concluded that ſhe was a pirate.</p>
               <p>But night coming on both veſſels lay to, waiting the events that were to take place the next morning. The paſſengers of the Engliſh veſſel uſed every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in their power to induce the captain to make his eſcape; but he was inflexibly determined to maintain his ſtation. About ten o'clock next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Turkiſh veſſels hove in ſight, and were ſoon within gun ſhot. In this ſituation reſiſtance was vain. One of the Turkiſh veſſels hailed her, and ordered her to ſtrike her colours; upon which a boat's crew was ſent out, who immediately took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:032877_0147_0FF5AA6DA7CE8D40"/>
of the Engliſh veſſel, and her crew were ſent on board of one of the Turkiſh ſhips, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after ſtood for Algiers.</p>
               <p>On the eleventh day after their capture, they paſſed the ſtreights of Gibralter, where the Turks, as they paſſed, obſerved many ſuperſtitious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Among a variety the following was obſerved; they caſt a veſſel of oil into the ſea, which they imagined ſwam to a mountain called <hi>La montagne des Signes,</hi> where a great ſanton or ſaint reſided, who ſubſiſted upon the oil, and in conſequence of this gift diſpenſed various bleſſings to them. During the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the oil, lighted candles were placed upon the great guns (a ceremony that was particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by veſſels that paſſed the ſtreights in the night) which burnt for the purpoſe of affording light to the oil in its paſſage. All theſe ceremonies were performed with prayers and great devotion.</p>
               <p>The third day after paſſing the ſtreights, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored oppoſite the city of Algiers; the guns of the veſſel were fired, and their report brought a large concourſe of people to the ſhore. D'Aranda with the reſt of the crew were now freed from their chains, and taken to the market where the Chriſtian ſlaves were ſold, in order to ſee if any of them were known; from thence they were conducted to the palace of the dey, (who was entitled to every eighth priſoner) that he might make his choice out of the number of captives.</p>
               <p>He was ſeated in his hall of audience, and ſat croſs-l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gged on an elegant ſeat, covered with blue tapeſtry, holding in his hand a number of plumes, reſembling a fan. His dreſs was a long gown of red ſilk, and a turban neatly interwoven.</p>
               <p>After the dey had made choice of his ſhare of the captives, the remainder were taken to the houſe of
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:032877_0148_0FF5A99EC0895C10"/>
one of the Turks whoſe veſſel had taken the prize. As D'Aranda was going into the houſe, the Turk aſked him in Italian, if he was hungry, he anſwered in the affirmative; whereupon a Chriſtian ſlave brought the priſoners ſome bread and a baſket of grapes, with which they regaled themſelves. The houſe was built in the Italian manner; the galleries were formed of white marble, and the pavement, the pillars and the arches were well proportioned, according to the laws of architecture. They were confined in this houſe, where they were obliged to ſleep on the floor in the galleries, and were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to leave the houſe till they were ſold.</p>
               <p>After they had been confined here ſeven days, they were viſited by Pinchinin and ſome of the richeſt Turks, who came with an intention to purchaſe ſlaves. They aſked the priſoners whether they were able to pay the price of their ranſom; but they anſwered in the negative, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no purchaſe was made. They were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought to the market, where an old man, with a ſtaff in his hand, took D'Aranda by the arm, and led him ſeveral times round the market-place. A number of perſons, deſirous of purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, appeared, who aſked D'Aranda his profeſſion and the place of his nativity. They took him by the hand to examine if it was hard; and ordered him to open his mouth, to ſee whether his teeth were ſufficiently good for chewing hard biſkets on board the galleys. They were then all ordered to be ſeated in a row. The old man took the firſt in order and led him three or four times round the market, crying <hi>arrache, arrache,</hi> who offers moſt? After the ſale he was placed upon the other ſide of the market, and in the ſame manner all the others were ſold. D'Aranda was purchaſed by a rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:032877_0148_0FF5A99EC0895C10"/>
named Saban Gallan, who gave 200 pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons for him.</p>
               <p>The dey being entitled to any ſlave at the price offered for him in the market, they were in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence once more taken to the palace: each one having in his hat a piece of paper, on which was written the price at which he was ſold. The dey thought proper to purchaſe D'Aranda, and Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>em that he had heard they were perſons of quality, and that he expected a large ſum for their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. He then ordered them to the ſtables of the palace, where they found 250 other ſlaves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a ſupply to the galleys. In theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they were confined one and twenty days, and their daily allowance here was two ſmall loaves of bread a-piece.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of September, when their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys make their laſt cruiſe, theſe ſlaves began to prepare for ſea. To each one was diſtributed, by the dey's order, ſome coarſe cloth, for the purpoſe of making them ſuch clothes as were worn in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys. On the day appointed for the ſlaves to go on board, a number of barbers attended the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſhaved the heads and beards of thoſe who were intended as rowers. After they were ſhaved, the dey's ſteward, and the captain of one of the galleys entered the ſtables, and ordered the ſlaves into an adjoining court, where each one had his office and ſtation aſſigned him. After this there remained twenty ſlaves more than ſufficient to man the galleys. D'Aranda was among this number, and the captain of the galley ſaid to the ſteward as he paſſed them, <hi>We will leave theſe raſcals on ſhore, for they are ſavages yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were then ordered back to the dey's ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:032877_0149_0FF5A9A04BBC93E0"/>
and the ſame day four galleys thus manned, left the harbour. The dey finding D'Aranda and his companions neither rich nor perſons of quality, ordered them to be brought into his preſence in the hall of audience, where they found Pinchinin, who ſaid to them, <hi>Chriſtians I have bought you of the dey, but at a very great price.</hi> He then ſent them to his houſe, where they found twenty female ſlaves who attended his wife, beſides twelve male ſlaves, and a ſeraglio of forty young boys between nine and fifteen years of age.</p>
               <p>From Pinchinin's houſe they were ſent to his bagnio, the place appointed for ſuch of his ſlaves as were intended for the galleys. This bangio was a ſtreet or large entry i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his houſe, where pirates and Turkiſh ſoldiers reſorted, who ſpent their time in drinking, and the commiſſion of the moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural crimes. D'Aranda not being acquainted with any one in this ſeminary of <hi>virtue,</hi> was obliged to ſleep the firſt night upon the terrace of the bagnio, and the next morning when he roſe he ſaw an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſlave bringing in a great variety of articles and houſehold ſtuff, and crying <hi>arrache, arrache.</hi> D'Aranda enquired of a certain knight of Malta with whom he had become acquainted, what the Italian meant. "As our maſter Pinchinin," replied the knight, <q>allows his ſlaves nothing for their ſubſiſtence, the greateſt part of them live upon ſtealing, and the booty of the preceding day is every morning thus ſold for their ſupport.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning before ſun-riſe the guardian coming into the bagnio, ſaluted D'Aranda and his companions with <hi>Surſa cani, abaſo canal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> get up you dogs, come down you ſcoundrels. After this coarſe ſalutation, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ducted them to Babloet, in the ſuburbs of the city, where they
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:032877_0149_0FF5A9A04BBC93E0"/>
were employed in a large rope-walk. D'Aranda and Saldens were appointed to turn a large wheel. Upon their turning the wheel too ſwiftly, their guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian cried out to them in Lingua Franca, <hi>forti, forti,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>gently;</hi> but they miſunderſtanding the term, turned the wheel with all their might, which ſo exaſperated their guardian, that he ran up to them in a rage, and with a huge cudgel taught them the ſignification of <hi>forti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After they were thus initiated into the knowledge or rope making, they were compelled to pound wheat in a mortar; a much more laborious employment, in which D'Aranda acquitted himſelf but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently; upon which his guardian ſaid to him, <hi>give over that work you dog, you are too ſavage yet.</hi> In putting the wheat into bags after it had been pounded, a little happened to be ſpilt on the ground; whereupon their guardian ſaid, <hi>Pilla eſſe cani,</hi> take that up you dog: but D'Aranda not underſtanding him, his keeper gave him a moſt unmerciful blow over the back with a billet of wood, which gave him a dangerous wound, from which a copious ſtream of blood iſſued.</p>
               <p>A very heavy bag of wheat was then placed upon each one's ſhoulder, which they had to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a conſiderable diſtance, and D'Aranda's ſtrength failing him after he had gone a few paces, the bag began to ſlide down his back; upon which his keeper ſtruck him in the face ſeveral times with his fiſt, and the blood ſtreamed plentifully from his mouth and noſe; which compelled him to greater exertions, and he ſtaggered under the load till he arrived at Pinchinin's houſe, where he fell down, perfectly exhauſted with the burden. But the moſt arduous part of their labour was yet to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They were under the neceſſity of carrying
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:032877_0150_0FF5A9A1D2EE86F0"/>
theſe bags up into a granary forty feet high; ae taſk which D'Aranda would have found totally impracticable, had not his companion Saldens, who was much ſtronger, compaſſionately carried it up for him, while he lay upon the ground beſmeared with ſweat, duſt and blood, and ſtill unmercifully pounded by his keeper, who threatened to murder him. In this lamentable condition he returned to the bagnio.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Caloen, his other companion, had been employed in leading a mule, laden with biſket, from Pinchinin's houſe to the water ſide. In conſequence of the narrowneſs of the ſtreets, it was a cuſtom in Algiers, when one led a loaded mule or camel, to cry <hi>Belec,</hi> take care there. But our new mule-driver, ignorant of the cuſtom, gave no warning of his approach, and in paſſing, threw a Turk into the mud. The Turk getting up in a great rage, drew his knife, (which they carried about them inſtead of a ſword) and would have murdered Caloen, had he not been prevented by ſome other Turks, who hallowed out to him, <hi>don't you ſee that Chriſtian is a ſavage yet, and don't underſtand the cuſtom;</hi> the word SAVAGE being a term of reproach which was given him becauſe he was dreſſed in a Chriſtian habit.</p>
               <p>While they were in a ſtate of the moſt extreme indigence, expecting nothing from Pinchinin, and not verſed in the art of ſtealing, the common profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the bagnio, they had the good fortune to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſeventy-five patacoons from an Italian merchant in Algiers, to whom they became jointly bound for the payment of a hundred at Antwerp.</p>
               <p>Their next employment was in a vine-yard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one of Pinchinin's country-houſes, where very laborious taſks were aſſigned them; for which
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:032877_0150_0FF5A9A1D2EE86F0"/>
D'Aranda, being but indifferently qualified, agreed with his guardian to allow him four rials a month if he would give him a more eaſy employment: and in conſequence his next buſineſs was to carry ſome large pots of water to the lodgings of the chief guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. D'Aranda now fared pretty well, and was much pleaſed with his new employment; but a trivial occurrence ſhortly after excluded him from this buſineſs; for as he was pouring a pot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one day into the <hi>Tin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ga,</hi> or great ciſtern, he accoſted a Turkiſh woman who entered the houſe, and aſked her if ſhe would drink a glaſs of ſack. This queſtion being overheard, he was diſmiſſed from his employment, and compelled the next day to work with ſome other ſlaves in attending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>This happened in the month of December, when the corſairs cruiſed along the coaſt of Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſia, in order to capture Engliſh veſſels laden with wine and fruits. Theſe corſairs had taken a frigate of Dunkirk, in which there was a young man who was ſold to Pinchinin, with whom D'Aranda had been formerly acquainted. This young man ſhortly after had an interview with D'Aranda, and being moved at the recital of his misfortunes, gave him ſome jewels, which he pawned for ten crowns. This was a very ſeaſonable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as his ſeventy-five patacoons were by this time ſpent, and his credit was in conſequence very much raiſed at the bagnio, which was more than uſually crouded at this time by great numbers of Turks and Chriſtian ſlaves who came to drink ſack, a cargo of which had been lately taken in one their prizes. About thirty ſlaves were taken in this frigate who were employed in unloading her. Some of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe had the good fortune to be afterwards
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:032877_0151_0FF5AA95587D1E88"/>
employed as tavern keepers, a buſineſs which was prohibited to Turks; others of the crew were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the galleys, where they were chained to the outermoſt oar, men whom the Algerines called <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavands.</hi> Theſe ſlaves conſiſted of Spanards, Italians and Ruſſians, and being a little intoxicated one night a quarrel enſued between ſome of them, which made a great uproar in the bagnio. Whereupon a prieſt came into the room with a wax candle in his hand, and quelled the diſturbance. The news of this riot ſoon came to the ears of the patron of the bagnio, who came attended by ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with creſſet lights and lanthrons, and armed with cudgels. They all fled at the approach of the patron; but one of the rioters was ſeized, ſtripped naked, and held by the hands and feet by four ſlaves with his belly on the floor, where he received a hundred blows on the back with a cudgel.</p>
               <p>D'Aranda had now reſided ſix months in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, at which time he and his companions went to Pinchinin, and kiſſing his robe and the ſleeve of his inner garment, the Turkiſh mode of paying homage, they told him they had come to agree with him about the price of their ranſom. After ſome converſation Pinchinin told them he was then going out of town with ſome ſlaves to fell timber for a new frigate which was building, and that he would talk further with them upon the ſubject at his return.</p>
               <p>In the mean time D'Aranda was employed at a new houſe belonging to Pinchinin in the upper part of the city, where he was obiged to carry materials on his back up a ſteep hill where mules and camels could not be uſed. While he was at work two Turks came to the bagnio and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for D'Aranda, Caloen, and Saldens; but as
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:032877_0151_0FF5AA95587D1E88"/>
they had changed their names, nobody could give any account of them. The Turks then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Brabant ſlave called <hi>Francis the ſtudent,</hi> to examine ſome papers which were written in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, giving ſome account of the ſlaves. Francis, upon examination, concluded that D'Aranda and his companions were the perſons they were enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and told them he knew the ſlaves very well. Whereupon he went with them to the bagnio, where they found D'Aranda and his companions, whom they informed they were no longer ſlaves; at which the were greatly overjoyed.</p>
               <p>The next day a Jew came to the bagnio, and by order of Pinchinin's wife, told D'Aranda and his companions that the dey wiſhed to ſpeak to them. When they were brought before him, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to go into a ſmall drawing room of the palace, where they continued about three hours with ſome young Chriſtian ſlaves. At length the ſteward made his appearance with a cudgel, and ſaid to them, <hi>You dogs which of you wrote home to be exchanged for Turks?</hi> They all excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the ſteward not much diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their excuſes, gave them all a ſevere beating, and told them he would come again at night and cut off their ears and noſes. They were here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in this ſmall apartment in extreme miſery for eighteen days; during which time they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited by the ſteward, who always carried his cudgel in his hand, and ſometimes beat them for his diverſion. The Turks now waited upon Pinchinin, who had returned, and told him they had engaged to procure an exchange of D'Aranda and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for ſeven of their Turkiſh friends, who were priſoners in Flanders, and offered him by way of ranſom the ſame ſum he had given for them. But
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:032877_0152_0FF5AA93D2A96B88"/>
Pinchinin told them theſe ſlaves were perſons of quality, for each of whom he demanded 6000 pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons as the price of ranſom.</p>
               <p>While the Turks were endeavouring to effect an exchange of priſoners nine weeks paſſed away, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time D'Aranda and his companions were confined in the dey's palace. After much delay the Turks agreed with Pinchinin upon the price of their ranſom; upon which they were releaſed from confinement, and lodged in the houſe of <hi>Cataborn Muſtapha,</hi> one of the Turks, who became their new patron. Caloen was ſoon after ſent in a veſſel bound to Leghorn, in order to procure the liberty of the Turkiſh priſoners in exchange, according to the agreement made between theſe Turks and the friends of D'Aranda and his companions, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Turkiſh priſoners in Flanders.</p>
               <p>D'Aranda ſtill continued with Muſtapha, but his reſidence here was of ſhort duration; for Muſtapha getting drunk one day quarrelled with a <hi>Bulcebas,</hi> a captain of foot, whom he called a Chriſtian. For this offence Muſtapha ſuffered impriſonment, and by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the divan received a hundred blows on the back with a cudgel; after which he was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſerve ſix months in the field againſt king Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali.</p>
               <p>After the departure of Muſtapha, D'Aranda was received into the family of Mahomet Celibi Oiga, where he was employed in the capacity of a ſervant. Here he ſoon became very intimate with his new miſtreſs who granted him many liberties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to attend public worſhip every day at Pinchinin's bagnio.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Caloen, who was not ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, was impriſoned in the houſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

apartment with nearly 80 weight of iron about his legs, and frequently ſent into the country, where his keepers were inſtructed to torture him with the moſt oppreſſive hunger in order to expedite the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ranſom.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of ſix months after D'Aranda had reſided at Oiga's houſe, he received a letter from Saldens, dated at Ceuta, who requeſted his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate attendance at Tetuan in the kingdom of Fez, according to contract with the two Turks. This letter contained information that Caloen's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had abſolutely refuſed to pay the 700 patacoons that were demanded for his ranſom, but made no particular mention of the five Turks who were to be given in exchange for D'Aranda and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this information Muſtapha's grandmother immediately ordered Caloen to be confined with a hundred weight of iron about his legs, in a ſmall cellar, where D'Aranda frequently viſited him; and one day while he was with him, the old woman entered the cellar, and aſked Caloen if he was willing yet to pay the 700 patacoons. He made no anſwer, but laughed at her; which ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enraged the old lady, that ſhe ordered D'Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to be ſeized and loaded with irons in the ſame cell, becauſe ſhe had imputed Caloen's conduct entirely to his advice. Here they remained till the time fixed for the departure of a veſſel deſtined for Tetuan, when, by the interceſſion of three Chriſtian ſlaves who intended to embark in this veſſel, they were releaſed upon a promiſe that her grandſon Muſtapha, who was at Ceuta, ſhould be liberated in exchange.</p>
               <p>About this time (which was the firſt of January 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) terminated the faſt of Ramadan, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:032877_0153_0FF5AAA2022CCB10"/>
for a month, during which time they were prohibited from eating or drinking in the day; and thoſe who were detected in violating this law were compelled to ſwallow melted lead. About the time of ſun-ſet the people were permitted to eat, and drums were beaten as a ſignal to ceaſe from faſting.</p>
               <p>To this faſt ſucceeded the feſtival or Eaſter of Ramadan, which continued for eight days, and was celebrated with great pomp and feſtivity. Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades were formed without the city, and feats of horſemanſhip were diſplayed. The Turkiſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were drawn in ſmall triumphal chariots, to which Chriſtian ſlaves were harnaſſed. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal amuſement was wreſtling, at which the Moors were very expert. The prohibitions of the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran ſeemed very little regarded at this time, and wine and brandy were drank in the greateſt exceſs. In the time of this feſtival gifts were diſtributed to the ſlaves, and for the three or four firſt days they were exempted from every kind of labour.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of January D'Aranda and Caloen, after ſettling all preliminaries, embarked with a number of Turks and Chriſtian ſlaves on board the veſſel bound for Tetuan. On the eighth day after they arrived at Oran, which is about forty leagues from Algiers, and on the twelfth at Tremeſen, where they lay at anchor three days, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged part of their Mooriſh crew.</p>
               <p>Tremeſen was formerly a powerful kingdom, to which the dey of Algiers was tributory. It is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated at the extremity of the Grand Signior's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and is bounded by the empire of Morocco and Fez, with which the Grand Signior is in alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but notwithſtanding this empire is often at war with the Algerines, and this happens without any
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:032877_0153_0FF5AAA2022CCB10"/>
violation to the confederacy. The ſame is the caſe with Tunis, which is included in the Grand Signior's dominions; but he does not concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the affairs of the baſhaws, and they are not conſidered at war till ſome place of importance is taken.</p>
               <p>From Tremeſen they ſet ſail upon their voyage, and ſhortly after, in conſequence of the diſcharge of a number of Moors, a conſpiracy was formed among the Chriſtian ſlaves to murder all the Turks on board, and to render themſelves maſter of the veſſel. But the whole deſign miſcarried in conſequence of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of a Spaniard, who was the principal in the conſpiracy, and neglected to give the ſignal of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, as had been previouſly concerted.</p>
               <p>On the twelfth of February in the evening they caſt anchor in a bay within half a league of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan, and the next day a violent eaſt-wind aroſe which ſubjected them to imminent danger. The Turks terrified at the ſtorm began to ſay their <hi>ſala</hi> or prayers, and promiſed to diſtribute alms as ſoon as they were on ſhore. But the tempeſt ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in violence, and the veſſel was every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in danger of being driven upon the rocks. In this extremity the Turks reſolved to offer a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Mahomet as their laſt reſource; a number of ſheep being always taken on board the Turkiſh veſſels for this purpoſe. They cut one of theſe ſheep into four parts, and with a variety of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ceremonies they caſt the parts into the ſea on different quarters of the veſſel.</p>
               <p>The tempeſt continued to increaſe till midnight, at which time the veſſel began to drag her anchors. The Turks all aſſembled at the ſtern in the utmoſt conſternation, and implored the aſſiſtance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet with the loudeſt lamentations. The veſſel
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:032877_0154_0FF5AA96E4738718"/>
continued to drag her anchors, and ſoon after ſhe was wrecked upon the ſhore, but the principal part of the crew were ſaved.</p>
               <p>D'Aranda and Caloen were greatly overjoyed at their deliverance, and the next morning they ſet out for Tetuan, where they arrived about noon. While they continued here they received a letter from Don Martin de Pegnaloſo a Spaniſh merchant at Ceuta, who informed them that Saldens had gone to Gibraltar, and had left orders with him to furniſh them with every thing neceſſary.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Turkiſh priſoners who had been detained at Flanders had arrived at Ceuta. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapha Ingles one of the priſoners, imagining that Saldens had returned to Flanders, wrote to Tetuan to the Turk who had charge of D'Aranda and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loen, that Saldens had promiſed when he was in Flanders to pay 700 patacoons towards the ranſom which his relations had paid for Caloen, and that he ſhould put them in the <hi>Maſmora.</hi> The perſon who concerted this buſineſs was Abraham Arrais one of the Turkiſh priſoners, who reported at Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta that D'Aranda and Caloen had promiſed 700 patacoons before their departure from Algiers.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this letter they were put into the Maſmora, which was a large vault about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feet under ground, where 170 Chriſtian ſlaves were confined. While they were in this ſituation D'Aranda wrote to Saldens, who returned to Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, and by his interceſſion they were liberated from confinement, and ſoon after took their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for their native country.</p>
