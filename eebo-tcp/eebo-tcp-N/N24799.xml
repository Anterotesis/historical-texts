            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AFRICA, though contiguous to the mo≈øt commercial nations in the world, from whom one would naturally ≈øuppo≈øe it might derive ≈øome portion of refinement, is yet involved in a ≈øtate of the mo≈øt deplorable barbari≈øm; and its very atmo≈øphere ≈øeems fraught with the mo≈øt dete≈øtable depravity in human nature. Hence the ≈øpirit of di≈øcovery will ever be retarded, and travellers will have but little inducement to explore a region where they mu≈øt be expo≈øed to ≈øuch a con≈øtant ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of dangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since the de≈øtruction of Carthage, civilization ≈øeems not an attribute of the kingdom of Algiers, or of any of the ≈øtates of Barbary; and ≈øuch is the virulence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan antipathy to every thing that bears the name of Chri≈øtian, that their contiguous to Europe has perhaps tended to render them even more ferocious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In rendering an account of this famous regency who have ≈øo long ≈øignali≈øed them≈øelves by their villany, the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032877_0005_0FF5A7B1742BE560"/>

                  </gap>ed him≈øelf of the mo≈øt unexceptionable documents that could be procured, and per≈øpicuity in≈øtead of elegance and the complete developement of TRUTH have been his primary objects in the compilation of the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In its execution he has laboured under ≈øeveral di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages. The fir≈øt ≈øheets were put to pre≈øs but a few days after the work was commenced, and before half the materials were collected. Great expedition was therefore indi≈øpen≈øibly requi≈øite, and this circum≈øtance will apologize for inaccuracies or de≈øultory arrangements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The work is, however, much more perfect than was originally contemplated. It exhibits a more circum≈øtantial detail of Algerine affairs of a recent date than was ever before publi≈øhed, and will we pre≈øume afford the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can reader a tolerable idea of this famous piratical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, to which the United States have lately had the mortification of becoming tributory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It comprehends, be≈øides an ample account of the late American negociation, a variety of original ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the government, fortifications, cu≈øtoms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, puni≈øhments, religion, &amp;c. of the Algerines; and for this original matter the public are under con≈øiderable obligations to Mr. ISAAC BROOKS, a gentleman of veracity and intelligence, who was one of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate number who were ≈øubjected to the mi≈øeries of this unparalleled ≈øervitude. The ≈øeverity of his afflictions
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032877_0005_0FF5A7B1742BE560"/>
has reduced him nearly to a ≈øtate of blindne≈øs; a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which afforded him ample lei≈øure for rendering a more minute account. In all his communications he has con≈øcientiou≈øly adhered to the truth, detected mi≈ørepre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and related nothing but what will bear the te≈øt of the ≈øtricte≈øt examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ≈øubject is particularly intere≈øting to the American people, and as the author has recorded events which are recent in the memory of all the captives, he has been ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulou≈øly circum≈øpect in admitting nothing but matters of undi≈øputed authenticity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The la≈øt chapter is an ab≈øtract or compendium of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Emanuel D'Aranda, "a poor ≈øoldier" as he was plea≈øed to call him≈øelf, probably with a de≈øign to evade the payment of the exorbitant ≈øum demanded for the ran≈øom of all per≈øons of quality. We find, however, by a Latin eulogium in ver≈øe prefixed to the French edition of his work, that he is called</hi> nobili con≈øulti≈ø≈øimoque Emanueli D'Aranda, I. V. L.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The≈øe adventures were written above</hi> 150 <hi>years ago, and are now perhaps unknown in the literary world. In this work there is every appearance of candor, and the concurrence of various circum≈øtances corroborate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption of its truth.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THERE is perhaps no problem in hi≈øtory ≈øo ≈øingular and unaccountable as the decadence of the power and ≈øplendor of the exten≈øive States of Barbary; which, while Carthage was in the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of its glory, were the ≈øeat of unrivalled great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and anterior ≈øo Rome it≈øelf in arts, in ≈øcience, in magnificence and refinement.</p>
               <p>The original inhabitants of this country, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mo≈øt authentic hi≈øtorians, were the Phoenecians, and after them the Carthagenians, the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032877_0009_0FF5A7C5D6EF7D90"/>
formidable rivals of the Romans, and one of the mo≈øt warlike nations of antiquity. The beginning of the Carthagenian hi≈øtory, like that of all other nations, is extremely ob≈øcure and uncertain. In the 7th year of Pygmalion king of Tyre, his ≈øi≈øter Eliza, or Dido, is ≈øaid to have fled, with ≈øome of her companions and va≈ø≈øals, from the cruelty and avarice of her brother Sichaeus.</p>
               <p>She fir≈øt touched at the i≈øland of Cyprus, where ≈øhe met with a prie≈øt of Jupiter, who was de≈øirous of attending her; to which ≈øhe con≈øented. At that time it was a cu≈øtom in the i≈øland of Cyprus, for the young women to go, on certain ≈øtated days before marriage, to the ≈øea-≈øide, and there to look for ≈øtrangers, that might po≈ø≈øibly arrive on their coa≈øts, in order to pro≈øtitute them≈øelves for gain, that they might thereby acquire a dowry. Out of the≈øe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Tyrians ≈øelected eighty, whom they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with them, and then ≈øailed directly for the coa≈øt of Africa: and at la≈øt ≈øafely landed in the province called <hi>Africa Propria,</hi> not far from Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, a Phoenician city of great antiquity. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fable is, that the Phoenecians impo≈øed upon the Africans in the following manner: They de≈øired for their intended ≈øettlement, only as much ground as an ox's hide would encompa≈øs. This reque≈øt the Africans laughed at; but they were ≈øurprized when, upon granting it, they ≈øaw Eliza cut the hide into the ≈ømalle≈øt ≈øhreds, by which means it ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded a large territory; in which ≈øhe built the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel called <hi>Byr≈øa.</hi> The learned, however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode this fable; but it is certain that the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians for many years paid an annual tribute to the Africans for the ground they po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>From this period commences the hi≈øtory of the Carthagenians, one of the mo≈øt celebrated nations of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032877_0009_0FF5A7C5D6EF7D90"/>
antiquity, who≈øe armies under the command of Hannibal, and other eminent generals, invaded the Roman territory, and threatened the downfal of Rome it≈øelf. But it is not the de≈øign of the pre≈øent work to enter into a detail of this hi≈øtory, which would form of it≈øelf a large and intere≈øting volume.</p>
               <p>The city of Carthage, by order of the Roman Senate, was plundered and de≈øtroyed by the Roman army under AEmilianus. Before he proceeded to execute their order, he performed tho≈øe religious ceremonies which were required on ≈øuch occa≈øions. He fir≈øt ≈øacrificed to the gods, and then cau≈øed a plough to be drawn round the walls of the city. After this, the towers, rampa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ts, walls, and all the works which the Carthagenians had rai≈øed in the cour≈øe of many ages, were levelled with the ground. The edifices of this proud metropolis were ≈øet on fire, which con≈øumed them all, not a ≈øingle hou≈øe e≈øcaping the flames. The ≈øire began in all quarters of the city at the ≈øame time, and continued to burn with incredible fury for the ≈øpace of ≈øeventeen days, at the end of which time the whole city was reduced to a≈øhes.</p>
               <p>Thus ≈øell Carthage, about 146 years before the birth of Chri≈øt. The trea≈øure carried off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

About twenty-four years after this event C. Gracchus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to rebuild it.

century, ≈øo completely de≈øtroyed it, that there are now ≈øcarce any ve≈øtiges of it remaining.</p>
               <p>After the reduction of the Carthagenian empire, the Romans for a long time maintained their power in Africa. But in the year 426, Bonifacius ≈øupreme governor of all the Roman dominions in this quarter, being compelled to revolt by the treachery of another general called Aetius, and finding him≈øelf unable to contend with the whole ≈øtrength of the Roman empire, invited Gen≈øeric king of the Vandals to his aid; who thereupon abandoned his conque≈øts in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and pa≈ø≈øed over into Africa. Bonifacius, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being ≈øoon after reconciled to his empre≈øs Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia, endeavoured in vain to per≈øuade the Vandals to retire. Hereupon a war en≈øued, in which the barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans proved victorious, and quickly over-ran all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man provinces in Africa. In the year 435, a peace was concluded; whereby Numidia and ≈øome other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were ceded to the Vandals, who ≈øoon after ≈øeized the re≈øt. But the≈øe barbarians did not long enjoy their conque≈øts: for about the year 535, Beli≈øarus, the Greek emperor Ju≈øtinian's general, drove them out, and annexed the provinces to the ea≈øtern empire.</p>
               <p>In the years 647, the Saracens, having conquered Me≈øopotamia, Egypt, Phoenicia, Arabia and Pales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, broke like a torrent into Africa, which they quickly ≈øubdued. This la≈øt revolution happened about the middle of the ≈øeventh century; and the Arabs continued ma≈øters of the country till the year 1051. This year, one Abubeker-ben-Omar, or as the Spaniards call him, Abu-Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øien, an Arab of the Zinhagian tribe, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at the tyranny of tho≈øe de≈øpots, gathered, by the help of his marabouts or ≈øaints, a mo≈øt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful army of malcontents, in the ≈øouthern provinces of Numidia and Lybia. His followers were nick-named

                  <hi>Marabites</hi> or <hi>Morabites;</hi> by the Spaniards <hi>Almoravides;</hi> probably from their being a≈ø≈øembled principally by the ≈øaints, who were al≈øo called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabites. The khalif of Keyem's forces were at this time engaged in quelling other revolts in Syria, Me≈øopotamia, &amp;c. and the Arabs in Spain entered into the mo≈øt bloody wars; ≈øo that Texe≈øien having nothing to fear from them, had all the ≈øucce≈øs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but out of all the we≈øtern parts, reducing the whole province of Tingitania under his dominion.</p>
               <p>Texe≈øien was ≈øucceeded by his ≈øon Yu≈øef, or Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph, who was a warlike prince. In the beginning of his reign he laid the foundation of the city of Morocco, which he intended as the capital of his empire During the building of this city he ≈øent an emba≈ø≈øy of marabouts to Treme≈øen, a province of Algiers, for the purpo≈øe of re≈øtoring the Zeneti, a Mahometan ≈øect, to the true faith, as it was called. But the Zeneti contemning all overtures of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a≈ø≈øembled at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Jo≈øeph ju≈øtly exa≈øperated at the≈øe proceedings, levied an army with all po≈ø≈øible expedition, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their territory, and de≈øtroyed all before him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire and ≈øword. The Zeneti in≈øtead of repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the inva≈øion, retreated towards Fez, where they expected a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. But they were fatally di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in this expectation; for the Fezz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s marched out again≈øt them, and meeting the mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Zeneti, encumbered with their families and baggage, and ready to expire with hunger and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032877_0011_0FF5A7D736EDC868"/>
fell upon them and cut them all to pieces, except a few who were either drowned in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ≈øwim acro≈øs a river, or da≈øhed to pieces from the precipices of rocks to which their enemy had pur≈øued them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the march of Jo≈øeph's army was marked by havoc and de≈øolation; the territory of the unhappy Zeneti was de≈øolated and reduced to a heap of ≈ømoking ruins. Their country was, however, ≈øoon after re-peopled by numerous immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations of Fezzans, who formed colonies under the protection of the reigning princes. According to the mo≈øt authentic accounts it appears, that nearly a millon of men, women and children, of the Zeneti, lo≈øt their lives in this murderous campaign.</p>
               <p>Jo≈øeph, who was a prince of re≈øtle≈øs ambition, was not long di≈øpo≈øed for peace. He proclaimed war again≈øt the Fezzans whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e rendered tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and extended his conque≈øts along the coa≈øts of the Mediterranean. His next attack was upon ≈øome Arabian cheyks, whom he pur≈øued through the Lybian de≈øarts with ≈øuch fury, that neither the clifts of the mo≈øt craggy rocks, nor ≈øecret rece≈ø≈øes, afforded them ≈øhelter from the vengeance of their pur≈øuers. He reduced all their ca≈øtles and fortre≈ø≈øes, which till then were deemed impregnable, and the extent of his conque≈øts ≈øpread general con≈øternation and grief through the other nations of Africa.</p>
               <p>Thus was the empire of the Morabites founded; but its exi≈øtance was of ≈øhort duration; for they were expelled from their new po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions in the 12th century by Mohavedin a marabout. This race of prie≈øts was ≈øubdued by Abdulac, governor of Fez, who was dive≈øted in his turn of his new conque≈øta, in the 13th century, by the Shariffs of Ha≈øcen, who
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032877_0011_0FF5A7D736EDC868"/>
were the de≈øcendants of tho≈øe Arabian princes whom Abu-Texe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ien had formerly conquered.</p>
               <p>The Shariffs divided their new acquired domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into ≈øeveral petty provinces, and the kingdom of Algiers was divided into Treme≈øen, Tenez, Algiers Proper, and Bujeyah, for their greater ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity again≈øt the inva≈øions of neighbouring princes. The four fir≈øt monarchs laid ≈øo ≈øolid a foundation to their empire, by a judicious balance of power, that they continued in mutual peace and harmony for ≈øeveral ≈øucceeding centuries; but the king of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øen having violated ≈øome articles of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, Abul-Farez declared war again≈øt him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Treme≈øen to a tributory kingdom.</p>
               <p>Abul-Farez did not long ≈øurvive this event. His kingdom was divided among his three ≈øons, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual di≈øcord and animo≈øity was the con≈øequence of this divi≈øion. Debilitated by the≈øe commotions, they became an ea≈øy conque≈øt to the Spani≈øh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who tran≈øported a powerful fleet and army again≈øt Barbary, under the command of the Count of Navarre, in the year 1505. This commander ≈øoon completed the conque≈øt of Oran, Bujeyah, and other important cities; which ≈øpread ≈øuch an alarm among the Algerines, that they invited the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Selim Eutemi, an Arabian prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for the prowe≈øs of his arms. He came to their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance with a large army of his mo≈øt warlike ≈øubjects, attended by Zaphira his queen, and a ≈øon about twelve years of age. This force was not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ≈øufficient to repel the incur≈øions of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; they effected the landing of an army the ≈øame year near the city of Algiers, and compelled the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis to become tributory to Spain. Nor could all the powers of Eutemi prevent the e≈øtabli≈øhment of a formidable Spani≈øh garri≈øon of 200 men on the i≈øland,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032877_0012_0FF5A7D8C43DF7D0"/>
in front of the city, which did immen≈øe damage to the cor≈øairs that attempted to ≈øail either in or out of the harbour.</p>
               <p>To this galling yoke the Algerines were obliged to ≈øubmit, and they continued tributory till the death of Ferdinand king of Spain, which happened in the year 1516. They were then determined to ≈øhake off their Spani≈øh yoke, and in order to effectuate this de≈øign, they ≈øent an emba≈ø≈øay to Aruch Barbaro≈ø≈øa, to ≈øolicit his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance again≈øt the Spaniards, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed him an adequate compen≈øation for his ≈øervices.</p>
               <p>Barbaro≈ø≈øa, ≈øo called from the red colour of his beard, was the ≈øon of a potter in the i≈øle of Le≈øbos, being prompted by a re≈øtle≈øs and enterpri≈øing ≈øpirit, he and his brother Hayradin for≈øook their father, and joined a crew of pirates. In this new profe≈ø≈øion they ≈øoon di≈øtingui≈øhed them≈øelves by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and prowe≈øs; they became ma≈øters of a ≈ømall brigantine, and conducted their piracies with ≈øuch ≈øucce≈øs, that they ≈øoon a≈ø≈øembled a fleet of twelve galleys, be≈øides many ve≈ø≈øels of ≈ømaller force. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baro≈ø≈øa was admiral of this fleet, and Hayradin ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in command. Their names ≈øoon became terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Straits of the Dardanelles to tho≈øe of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar. Their ambitious views extended with their power: being no le≈øs dreaded for their valour than their ≈øurpri≈øing ≈øucce≈øs, and while acting as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øairs, they a≈ø≈øumed the ideas, and acquired the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes they had taken on the coa≈øts of Spain and Italy, into the ports of Barbary. The convenient ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the≈øe harbours, lying ≈øo near the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ≈øtates of Chri≈øtendom, prompted them to the de≈øire of effecting an e≈øtabli≈øhment in the country of Barbary. An opportunity of accompli≈øhing this
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032877_0012_0FF5A7D8C43DF7D0"/>
project ≈øoon pre≈øented it≈øelf, and they did not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to pa≈øs unimproved.</p>
               <p>Barbaro≈ø≈øa received the Algerine emba≈ø≈øy at Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gir, about 170 miles to the ea≈øtward of Algiers. He promi≈øed them every a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in his power, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly exulted in ≈øo favourable an opportunity of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him≈øelf ma≈øter of their city. To carry his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns into execution, he fitted out a fleet of 18 gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, on board of which was embarked a powerful Turki≈øh army, with a fine train of artillery, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply provided with military ≈øtores, and di≈øpatched them to the city of Algiers.</p>
               <p>Barbaro≈ø≈øa in the mean time advanced toward the city by land, with an army of 800 Turks, 3000 Jigelites, and 2000 Moori≈øh volunteers. But in≈øtead of taking the neare≈øt road to Algiers, he directed his cour≈øe towards <hi>Shar≈øhel,</hi> (about 60 miles we≈øt of Algiers), where Ha≈ø≈øan, another famous cor≈øair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command, had ≈øettled him≈øelf; and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a me≈ø≈øenger to his fleet, which by this time had anchored at Algiers, with orders to repair im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Shar≈øhel. His de≈øign by this march was to puni≈øh the treachery of Ha≈ø≈øan, who had ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a con≈øiderable part of the fleet ≈øtationed there into his ≈øervice, and was upon the point of making a de≈øcent upon the Spani≈øh coa≈øt. But he was much a≈øtoni≈øhed when he found Barbaro≈ø≈øa was ≈øo near, and in≈øtantly prepared to oppo≈øe the approach of his army; but di≈øcovering the inefficiency of the force he had rai≈øed, he deemed it mo≈øt prudent to adju≈øt all differences by an amicable compromi≈øe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had received a promi≈øe of pardon from his commander, ≈øurrendered him≈øelf a pri≈øoner.

               <p>His death was, however, generally imputed to the cruelty of Barbaro≈ø≈øa, and the citizens, who were panic ≈øtruck at this event, ≈øeemed more anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to ≈øcreen them≈øelves from oppre≈ø≈øion, than to avenge the death of their ≈øovereign.</p>

               <p>The pride of Barbaro≈ø≈øa was greatly elated at this di≈øa≈øter, and though he had nothing to boa≈øt on this occa≈øion, yet his vanity and in≈øolence were now ≈øwelled to ≈øuch a degree, that he imagined him≈øelf invincible, and fancied that the very elements had con≈øpired to render him ≈øo.

               <p>Barbaro≈ø≈øa's tyranny became at length ≈øo in≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, that the Arabians, who inhabited the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the country, implored the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Hamidel Abdes king of Tenez to drive the Turks out of Algiers.

               <p>The fame of this deci≈øive victory was ≈øoon ≈øpread over all Africa, and no ≈øooner had Barbaro≈ø≈øa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ma≈øter of Tenez, than he received an emba≈ø≈øy from the inhabitants of Treme≈øen, (about 50 leagues we≈øtward), who were di≈ø≈øatisfied with the admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their king, principally on account of his having dethroned his nephew; whom he obliged to fly to Oran; and they offered to inve≈øt Barbaro≈ø≈øa even with the ≈øovereignty, in ca≈øe he accepted their propo≈øal.

The garri≈øon of Calau in the mean time made a vigorous defence, and in a fortie they made in the night killed 300 Spaniards.

               <p>THE news of Barbaro≈ø≈øa's death ≈øpread the utmo≈øt con≈øternation among the Turks at Algiers; and his brother Hayradin was immediately proclaimed king. The Spani≈øh commander very imprudently neglected to follow up his victories at this au≈øpicious juncture, and ≈øent back the emperor's forces without attempting the reduction of Algiers. Hayradin in his pre≈øent critical ≈øituation, apprehen≈øive of a Spani≈øh inva≈øion, and dreading the con≈øequences of his tyrany and that of his officers, ≈øent an emba≈ø≈øy to ≈øolicit the protection of the Grand Signior; which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted. He was appointed Ba≈øhaw or Viceroy of Algiers, and received ≈øuch con≈øiderable rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements

In con≈øequence of the≈øe reinforcements, his armies were further aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by ≈øuch numbers of Turks that continually re≈øorted to him, that he was enabled not only to keep the Moors and Arabs in ≈øubjection at home, but to annoy the Chri≈øtians at ≈øea.</p>
               <p>His next ≈øtep was the reduction of the Spani≈øh fortre≈øs in front of the city, which was a great nui≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the metropolis, and of which the Spaniards held po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion till the year 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reduce it, and his fir≈øt attempt was by ≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem. Having made choice of two Moo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The lads were received and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great kindne≈øs: and one Ea≈øter Sunday, while Martin de Vargas, the commander, and his men were at church, the≈øe lads a≈øcended a tower that commanded a pro≈øpect of the city, from whence they waved a flag, as a ≈øignal, that the Spaniards were off their guard. The flag being ob≈øerved by the commander's ≈øervant maid, ≈øhe ran immediately and acquainted her ma≈øter with the circum≈øtance. Vargas and his men repaired to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

brought out, and at the command of Vargas, were both hanged upon an eminence in ≈øight of the city. Hayradin was greatly exa≈øperated at the ≈øight, and was re≈øolved upon the immediate reduction of the fort. Whereupon he di≈øpatched a renegado to the fort to acquaint Vargas, that if he would deliver up the garri≈øon, he and his men ≈øhould be well treated, and ≈øent to Spain; but if not, they ≈øhould all be put to death. Vargas returned for an≈øwer, that he would hold out to the la≈øt extremity. Haraydin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt of this an≈øwer, rai≈øed a formidable battery, and commenced a vigorous cannonade upon the i≈øland, which continued for fifteen days and nights without intermi≈ø≈øion; at the end of which time almo≈øt all the walls of the garri≈øon were bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered down, and the greate≈øt part of the be≈øieged were killed. Hayradin now ordered a de≈øcent to be made upon the i≈øland, which was effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppo≈øition, and the whole garri≈øon were made pri≈øoners. Vargas ≈øuffered impri≈øonment for about three months, at the end of which time he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into the pre≈øence of Hayradin, and ba≈øtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed to death.</p>
               <p>After this event he ≈øet about building a ≈øtrong mole from the i≈øland to the city, for the protection of his ≈øhips, and in this he employed 30,000 Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ≈ølaves, who were engaged in this work for three years without intermi≈ø≈øion, in which time the work was completed. He then cau≈øed the fort ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Spaniards to be repaired, and placed a ≈øtrong garri≈øon in it to prevent foreign ve≈ø≈øels from entering the harbour without giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them≈øelves. By the≈øe two important works, Hayradin ≈øoon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but al≈øo by the maritime
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032877_0019_0FF5A8021D6E4958"/>
Chri≈øtian powers, e≈øpecially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the Grand Signior with his ≈øucce≈øs, and obtained from him a fre≈øh ≈øupply of money, by which he was enabled to build a ≈øtronger fort, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of the enemy. All the≈øe have ≈øince received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occa≈øion for them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Sultan, either out of a ≈øen≈øe of the great ≈øervices Hayradin had done, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps out of jealou≈øy le≈øt he ≈øhould make him≈øelf independent, rai≈øed Hayradin to the dignity of ba≈øhaw of the empire, and appointed Ha≈øtan Aga, a Sardinian renegado, an intrepid warrior, and an experienced officer, to ≈øucceed him as ba≈øhaw of Algiers. Ha≈ø≈øan had no ≈øooner taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his new government, than he began to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øue his ravages on the Spani≈øh coa≈øt with greater fury than ever; extending them to the eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ≈øtates, and other parts of Italy. But Pope Paul III. being alarmed at this, exhorted the emperor Charles V. to ≈øend a powerful fleet to ≈øuppre≈øs the≈øe frequent and cruel piracies; and, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting to render the enterpri≈øe ≈øucce≈øsful, a bull was publi≈øhed by his holine≈øs, wherein a plenary ab≈øolution of ≈øins, and the crown of martyrdom, were promi≈øed to all tho≈øe who either fell in battle, or were made ≈ølaves. The emperor on his part needed no ≈øpur; and therefore ≈øet ≈øail at the head of a powerful fleet, con≈øi≈øting of 120 ≈øhips and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 cho≈øen troops, an immen≈øe quantity of money, arms, amunition, &amp;c. In this expedition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young nobility and gentry attended as volunteers, and among the≈øe many knights of Malta, ≈øo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

for their valour again≈øt the enemies of Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles in his expedition, and the wives and daughters of the officers and ≈øoldiers followed them with a de≈øign to ≈øettle in Barbary after the conque≈øt was completed. All the≈øe meeting with a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wind, ≈øoon appeared before Algiers: every ≈øhip di≈øplaying the Spani≈øh colours on the ≈øt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this prodigious armament the Algerines were thrown into the utmo≈øt con≈øternation. The city was ≈øurrounded only by a wall with ≈øcarce any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. The whole garri≈øon con≈øi≈øted of 800 Turks and 6000 Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly di≈øciplined and acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Spaniards landed without oppo≈øition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the cour≈øe of a ≈øpring which ≈øupplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmo≈øt di≈øtre≈øs, Ha≈ø≈øan receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ≈øummons to ≈øurrender at di≈øcretion, on pain of being put to the ≈øword with all the garri≈øon. The herald was ordered to extol the va≈øt power of the emperor both by ≈øea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Chri≈øtian religion. But to this Ha≈ø≈øan only replied, that he mu≈øt be a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that would pretend to advi≈øe an enemy, and that the advi≈øed mu≈øt ≈øtill act more madly who would take coun≈øel of ≈øuch an advi≈øor. He was, however, on the point of ≈øurrendering the city, when advice was brought him, that the forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the we≈øtern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032877_0020_0FF5A803A6F075C8"/>
to defend it to the utmo≈øt. Charles, in the mean time, re≈øolving upon a general a≈ø≈øault, kept a con≈øtant firing upon the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garri≈øon, he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as already in his hands. But while the <hi>divan,</hi> or Algerine ≈øenate, were deliberating upon the mo≈øt proper means of obtaining an honorable capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, a mad prophet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the a≈ø≈øembly, and foretold the ≈øpeedy de≈øtruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was ≈øoon verified in a mo≈øt ≈øurpri≈øing and unexpected manner: for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful ≈øtorm of wind, rain, and hail, aro≈øe from the north, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with violent ≈øhocks of earthquakes, and a di≈ømal univer≈øal darkne≈øs both by ≈øea and land; ≈øo that the ≈øun, moon and elements ≈øeemed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine together for the de≈øtruction of the Spaniards. In one night, ≈øome ≈øay in le≈øs than half an hour, 86 ≈øhips and 15 galleys were de≈øtroyed, with all their crews and military ≈øtores; by which the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or ≈øhore was deprived of all means of ≈øub≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Their camp al≈øo, which ≈øpread it≈øelf along the plain under the fort, was laid quite under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the torrents which de≈øcended from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into ≈øome better ≈øituation, were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the Moors and Arabs; while ≈øeveral gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and other ve≈ø≈øels, endeavouring to gain ≈øome neighbouring creek along the coa≈øts, were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately plundered, and their crews ma≈ø≈øacred by the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The next morning Charles beheld the ≈øea co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the fragments of ≈øhips, and the bodies of men, hor≈øes and other creatures ≈øwimming on

the waves; at which he was ≈øo di≈øheartened that he abandoned his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, and marched at the head of his army, though in no ≈ømall di≈øorder, towards cape <hi>Malabux,</hi> in order to reimbark in tho≈øe ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels which had weathered out the ≈øtorm.

               <p>Soon after this the prophet <hi>Yu≈øef,</hi> who had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the de≈øtruction of the Spaniards, was not only declared the deliverer of his country, but had a con≈øiderable gratuity decreed him, with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of exerci≈øing his prophetic function unmole≈øted.

               </p>
               <p>The unhappy Spaniards had ≈øcarce reached their ≈øhips, when they were attacked by a fre≈øh ≈øtorm, in which ≈øeveral more of them peri≈øhed; one ≈øhip in particular, containing 700 ≈øoldiers, be≈øides ≈øailors, ≈øunk in the emperor's ≈øight, without a po≈ø≈øibility of ≈øaving a ≈øingle man. At length, with much labour, they reached the port of <hi>Bujeyah,</hi> at that time po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed by the Spaniards, whither Ha≈ø≈øan king of Tunis ≈øoon after repaired, with a ≈øupply of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions for the emperor, who received him graciou≈øly, with fre≈øh a≈ø≈øurances of his favour and protection. Here he di≈ømi≈ø≈øed the few remains of the Malte≈øe knights and their forces, who embarked in three ≈øhattered galleys, and with much difficulty and danger reached their own country. Charles him≈øelf ≈øtaid no longer than till the 16th of November, when he ≈øailed for Carthagena, and reached it on the 25th of the ≈øame month. In this unfortunate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition upwards of 120 ≈øhips and galleys were lo≈øt, above 300 colonels and other land and ≈øea officers, 8000 ≈øoldiers and mariners, be≈øides tho≈øe de≈øtroyed by the enemy on the reimbarkation, or drowned in the la≈øt ≈øtorm. The number of pri≈øoners was ≈øo great, that the Algerines ≈øold ≈øome of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.</p>
               <p>Ha≈ø≈øan, elated with this victory, in which he had very little ≈øhare, undertook an expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the king of Treme≈øen, who, being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Spaniards, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to procure a peace by paying a va≈øt ≈øum of money, and becoming tributory to him. The ba≈øhaw returned to Algiers, laden with riches; and ≈øoon after died of a fever, in the 66th year of his age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:032877_0022_0FF5A816C857C5D0"/>
From this time the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines in any con≈øiderable degree. In 1555, they lo≈øt the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salha Rais, Ha≈ø≈øan's ≈øucce≈ø≈øor; who next year ≈øet out on a new expedition, which he kept a ≈øecret, but was ≈øu≈øpected to be intended again≈øt Oran: but he was ≈øcarcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged violently in the city, broke out in his groin, and carried him off in 24 hours.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his death the Algerine ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery cho≈øe a Cor≈øican renegado, Ha≈ø≈øan Cor≈øo, in his room, till they ≈øhould receive further orders from the Porte. He did not accept the ba≈øhaw≈øhip without a good deal of difficulty; but immediately pro≈øecuted the intended expedition to Oran, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching a me≈ø≈øenger to acquaint the Porte with what had happened. They had hardly begun their ho≈øtilities again≈øt the place, when orders came from the Porte, expre≈øsly forbidding Ha≈ø≈øan Cor≈øo to begin the ≈øiege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to rai≈øe it immediately. This news was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great grief by the whole fleet and army, as they thought them≈øelves ≈øure of ≈øucce≈øs, the garri≈øon being at that time very weak. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, as they dared not di≈øobey, the ≈øiege was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rai≈øed.</p>
               <p>Cor≈øo had hardly enjoyed the dignity four months, before news came, that eight galleys were bringing a new ba≈øhaw to ≈øucceed him; one Tekel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, a principal Turk of the Grand Signior's court; upon which the Algerines unanimou≈øly re≈øolved not to admit him. By the treachery of the Levantine ≈øoldiers, however, he was admitted at la≈øt, and the unfortunate Cor≈øo was thrown over a wall, in which a number of iron hooks were fixed; one of which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032877_0022_0FF5A816C857C5D0"/>

Immediately on his arrival, he engaged in a war with the Arabs, by whom he was defeated with great lo≈øs.

This di≈øa≈øter was owing to the incon≈øiderate ra≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, or rather madne≈øs, of the commander; which was ≈øo great, that after finding it impo≈ø≈øible to rally his ≈øcattered forces, he ru≈øhed, ≈øword in hand, into the thicke≈øt of the enemy's ranks, at the head of a ≈ømall number of men, crying out, <hi>"St. Jago!

               <p>Ha≈ø≈øan having had the misfortune to di≈øplea≈øe his ≈øubjects, by allowing the mountaineers of Cuco to buy ammunition at Algiers, was ≈øent in irons to Con≈øtantinople, while the aga of the Jani≈øaries, and general of the land forces, ≈øupplied his place.

was no ≈øooner arrived, than he ≈øent the two deputy-ba≈øhaws to Con≈øtantinople, where their heads were ≈øtruck off. Achmet was a man of ≈øuch in≈øatiable avarice, that upon his arrival at Algiers, all ranks of people came in ≈øhoals to make him pre≈øents; which he the more greedily accepted, as he had bought his dignity by the money he had ama≈ø≈øed while head gardener to the Sultan. He enjoyed it, however, only four months; and after his death, the ≈øtate was governed other four months by his lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant; when Ha≈ø≈øan was a third time ≈øent viceroy to Algiers, where he was received with the greate≈øt demon≈øtrations of joy.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt enterpri≈øe in which Ha≈ø≈øan engaged, was the ≈øiege of Mar≈øalquiver, ≈øituated near the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Oran, which he de≈øigned to inve≈øt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after. The army employed in this ≈øiege con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted of 26,000 foot and 10,000 hor≈øe, be≈øides which he had a fleet con≈øi≈øting of 32 galleys and galliots, together with three French ve≈ø≈øels laden with bi≈øcuit, oil, and other provi≈øions. The city was defended by Don Martin de Cordova, brother of the count d'Alcandela, who had been taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner in the battle where that nobleman was killed, but had obtained his liberty from the Algerines with immen≈øe ≈øums, and now made a mo≈øt gallant defence again≈øt the Turks. The city was attacked with the utmo≈øt fury by ≈øea and land, and ≈øeveral breaches were made in the walls.

               <p>In 1567, Ha≈ø≈øan was again recalled to Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, where he died three years after. He was ≈øucceeded by Mahomet, who gained the love of the Algerines by ≈øeveral public ≈øpirited actions. He incorporated the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He likewi≈øe added ≈øome con≈øiderable fortifications to the city and ca≈øtle, which he de≈øigned to render impregnable.</p>
               <p>But while he was thus ≈øtudying the intere≈øt of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, one John Ga≈øcon, a bold Spani≈øh adventurer, formed a de≈øign of ≈øurpri≈øing the whole piratic navy in the bay, and ≈øetting them on fire in the night time, when they lay defencele≈øs, and in their fir≈øt ≈øleep. For this he had not only the permi≈ø≈øion of king Philip II. but was furni≈øhed by him with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ve≈ø≈øels, mariners, and fire-works, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his plot. With the≈øe he ≈øet ≈øail for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers in the beginning of October, the mo≈øt proper ≈øea≈øon, when mo≈øt, if not all the ≈øhips lay at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor there, and ea≈øily ≈øailed near enough, un≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to view their manner of riding, in order to ≈øurpri≈øe them at a time when the greater part of their crews were di≈øper≈øed in their quarters. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole-gate, and di≈øper≈øed his men with their fire-works; but to their great ≈øurpri≈øe, they found them ≈øo ill mixed, that they could not with all their art make them take fire. In the mean time, Ga≈øcon took it into his head, by way of bravado, to go to the mole-gate, and give three loud knocks at it with

the pommel of his dagger, and to leave it fixed in the gate by its point, that the Algerines might have cau≈øe to remember him. This he had the good fortune to do without meeting any di≈øturbance or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition; but it was not ≈øo with his men; for no ≈øooner did they find their endeavours fru≈øtrated, than they made ≈øuch a bu≈øtle as quickly alarmed the guard po≈øted on the adjacent ba≈øtion, from which the uproar quickly ≈øpread it≈øelf through the whole garri≈øon. Ga≈øcon now finding him≈øelf in the utmo≈øt danger, ≈øailed away with all po≈ø≈øible ha≈øte; but was pur≈øued, overtaken, and brought back a pri≈øoner to Mahomet; who no ≈øooner got him into his power, than he immediately cau≈øed a gibbet of con≈øiderable height to be erected on the ≈øpot where Ga≈øcon had landed, ordering him to be hoi≈øted up, and hung by the feet to a hook, that he might die in extreme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to ≈øhow his re≈øentment and contempt of the king his ma≈øter, he ordered his commi≈ø≈øion to be tied to his toes. He had not, however, hung long in that ≈øtate, when the captain who took him, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a number of other cor≈øairs, interceded ≈øo ≈øtrongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of a Chri≈øtian ≈øurgeon; but two days after, ≈øome Moors reporting that it was the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines dur≈øt not hurt a hair of Ga≈øcon's head, the unfortunate Spaniard was hoi≈øted up by a pully to the top of the execution-wall, and from thence thrown down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hooks which were fa≈øtened in it, one of which caught him by the ribs as he fell, and gave him ≈øuch a wound that he expired without a groan.‚ÄîThus ended the expedition of John Ga≈øcon, which has procured him a place among the Spani≈øh martyrs; while on the other hand, the Algerines look upon his di≈øappointment to have been miraculous, and

On their part, they engaged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to acknowledge the Grand Signiors as their ≈øovereigns, and to pay them their u≈øual allegiance and tribute, to re≈øpect their ba≈øhaws, and even to lodge and maintain them and their retinue, in a manner ≈øuitable to their dignity, at their own charge. The ba≈øhaws, however, were for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be excluded from a≈ø≈øi≈øting at any but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral divans, unle≈øs invited to it; and from having the liberty of voting in them, unle≈øs when their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was a≈øked, or the intere≈øt of the Porte was likely to ≈øuffer by their ≈øilence.

               <p>The≈øe propo≈øals having been accepted by the Porte, the deputies returned highly ≈øatisfied; and having notified their new privileges, the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van immediately proceeded to the election of a dey from among them≈øelves.

and di≈øcontents at the Ottoman court, as made them frequently repent their compliance.</p>
               <p>In the year 1601, the Spaniards, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Doria the Genoe≈øe admiral, made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt upon Algiers, in which they were more fortunate than u≈øual, their fleet being only driven back by contrary winds, ≈øo that they came off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lo≈øs. In 1609, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able ≈øailors, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly contributed to render the Algerine fleet ≈øo formidable as it became ≈øoon after; though it is probable the frequent attempts made on their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would al≈øo induce them to increa≈øe their fleet. In 1616 their fleet con≈øi≈øted of 40 ≈øail of ≈øhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 200 and 400 tons, their admiral 500 tons. It was divided into two ≈øquadrons, one of 18 ≈øail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the port of Malaga; and the other at the Cape of Santa Maria, between Li≈øbon and Seville; both of which fell foul of all Chri≈øtian ≈øhips, both French and Engli≈øh, with whom they pretended to be in friend≈øhip, as well as Spaniards and Portugue≈øe, with whom they were at war.</p>
               <p>The Algerines now became very formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were mo≈øt in danger, and lea≈øt able to cope with them, ≈øolicited the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of England, the pope, and other ≈øtates. The French, however, were the fir≈øt who dared to ≈øhew their re≈øentment of the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behaviour of the≈øe mi≈øcreants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was ≈øent again≈øt them with a fleet of 50 men of war, who defeated their fleet, took two of their ve≈ø≈øels, while their admiral ≈øunk his own ≈øhip and crew, rather than fall into his enemies hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:032877_0026_0FF5A82A29D13728"/>
In 1620, a ≈øquadron of Engli≈øh men of war was ≈øent again≈øt Algiers, under the command of Sir Robert Man≈øel; but of this expedition we have no other account, than that it returned without doing any thing; and the Algerines becoming more and more in≈øolent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only accepted; to whom in 1625, they ≈øent a propo≈øal, directed to the prince of Orange, that in ca≈øe they would fit out 20 ≈øail of ≈øhips the following year, upon any good ≈øervice again≈øt the Spaniards, they would join them with 60 ≈øail of their own.</p>
               <p>The next year, the <hi>Coulolies,</hi> or <hi>Cologlies,</hi> (the children of ≈øuch Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers), who were enrolled in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, having ≈øeized on the citadel, had well nigh made them≈øelves ma≈øters of the city; but were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible ≈ølaughter. Many ≈øcores of them were executed, and their heads thrown in heaps upon the city walls, without the ea≈øtern gate. Part of the citadel was blown up; and the remaining Coulolies were di≈ømi≈ø≈øed from the militia, to which they were not again admitted till long after.</p>
               <p>In 1623, the Algerines and other ≈øtates of Barbary threw off their dependence on the Porte altogether, and ≈øet up for them≈øelves. What gave occa≈øion to this was the 25 years truce which Sultan Amurath IV. was obliged to make with the emperor Ferdinand II. to prevent his being overmatched by carrying on a war again≈øt him and the Sophi of Per≈øia at the ≈øame time. As this put a ≈øtop to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and re≈øolved that whoever de≈øired to be at peace with them, mu≈øt, di≈øtinctly and ≈øeparately, apply to their government. No ≈øooner was this re≈øolution

adopted, than the Algerines began to make prizes of ≈øeveral merchant ≈øhips belonging to powers at peace with the Porte. Nay, having ≈øeized a Dutch ≈øhip and poleacre at Scanderoon, they ventured on ≈øhore; and finding the town abandoned by the Turki≈øh aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and warehou≈øe and ≈øet them on fire.</p>
               <p>About this time Lewis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coa≈øts, in≈øtead of one formerly built by the Mar≈øilians, and which they had demoli≈øhed. This, after ≈øome difficulty, he accompli≈øhed; and it was called the <hi>Ba≈øtion of France:</hi> but the ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being afterwards found inconvenient, the French purcha≈øed the port of La Calle, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was ≈øo much embarra≈ø≈øed with the Per≈øian war, that there was no lei≈øure to check the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizir and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a ≈øhare of their prizes, which were very con≈øiderable. However, for form's ≈øake, a ≈øevere reprimand, accompanied with threats, was ≈øent them; to which they replied, that "the≈øe depredations de≈øerved to be indulged to them, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were the only bulwark again≈øt the Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian powers, e≈øpecially again≈øt the Spaniards, the ≈øworn enemies of the Mo≈ølem name. Adding, "that if they ≈øhould pay a punctilious regard to all that would purcha≈øe peace, or liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but ≈øet fire to all their ≈øhipping, and turn camel-drivers for a livelihood."</p>
               <p>In the year 1635, four young brothers of a good family in France, entered into an undertaking ≈øo de≈øperate, that perhaps the annals of knight-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry

can ≈øcarcely furni≈øh a parallel.‚ÄîThis was no le≈øs than to retort the piracies of the Algerines upon them≈øelves; and as they indi≈øcriminately took the ≈øhips of all nations, ≈øo were the≈øe heroes indi≈øcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to take the ≈øhips belonging to Algiers; and this with a ≈ømall frigate of ten guns!‚ÄîIn this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous undertaking 100 volunteers embarked; a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øe commi≈ø≈øion was procured, together with an able ma≈øter and 36 mariners.

On the other hand, the captain ba≈øhaw, who had been ≈øent out with the Turki≈øh fleet to cha≈øe the Florentine and Malte≈øe crui≈øers out of the Archipelago, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding that the Algerine ≈øquadron was ≈øo near, ≈øent expre≈øs orders to the admiral to come to his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but having fir≈øt re≈øolved on a de≈øcent upon the i≈øland of Li≈ø≈øa, or Li≈øina, belonging to the Venetians, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Capello, from whom he retired to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, a ≈øea port belonging to the Grand Signior, whither the Venetian admiral pur≈øued him, but the Turki≈øh governor refu≈øing to eject the pirates ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the articles of the peace between the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content him≈øelf with watching them for ≈øome time. Pinchinin was ≈øoon weary of re≈øtraint, and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out; when an engagement immediately en≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

in which the Algerines were defeated, and five of their ve≈ø≈øels di≈øabled; with the lo≈øs of 1500 men, Turks and Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves; be≈øides 1600 galley-≈ølaves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello; but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage before he received a letter from the ≈øenate, de≈øiring him to make no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the Porte. This was followed by a letter from the governor of Valona, de≈øiring him to take care le≈øt he incurred the Sultan's di≈øplea≈øure by ≈øuch in≈øults. The brave Venetian was forced to comply; but re≈øolving to take ≈øuch a leave of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines as he thought they de≈øerved, ob≈øerved how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equipage along the ≈øhore. He then kept firing among the tents, while ≈øome well-manned galliots and brigantines were ordered among their ≈øhipping, who attacked them with ≈øuch bravery, that, without any great lo≈øs, they towed out their 16 galleys, with all their cannon, ≈øtores &amp;c. In this la≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, a ball from one of the Venetian gallies, happening to ≈øtrike a Turki≈øh mo≈øque, the whole action was con≈øidered as an in≈øult upon the Grand Signior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to ≈øink all the Algerine ≈øhips he had taken, except the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello came off with a ≈øevere reprimand; but the Venetians were obliged to buy, with 500,000 ducats, a peace from the Porte. The Grand Signior offered to repair the lo≈øs of the Algerines, by building ten galleys for them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that they ≈øhould continue in his ≈øervice till the end of the en≈øuing ≈øummer; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time, the news of this defeat and lo≈øs filled Algiers with the utmo≈øt grief and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. The whole city was on the point of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in≈øurrection, when the ba≈øhaw and divan i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued a proclamation, forbidding not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and outcries, under the ≈øevere≈øt penalties; but all per≈øons whatever to <hi>take their thumbs from within their girdles,</hi> while they were deliberating on this important point. In the mean time, they applied to the Porte for an order that the Venetians ≈øettled in the Levant ≈øhould make up their lo≈øs. But with this the Grand Signior refu≈øed to comply, and left them to repair their lo≈ø≈øes, as well as build new ≈øhips, in the be≈øt manner they could. It was not long, however, before they had the ≈øatisfaction to ≈øee one of their cor≈øairs land, with a fre≈øh ≈øupply of 600 ≈ølaves, whom he had brought from the coa≈øt of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant native on board a Dani≈øh ≈øhip.</p>
               <p>Our pirates did not long continue in their weak and defencele≈øs ≈øtate; being able, at the end of two years, to appear at ≈øea with a fleet of 65 ≈øail. The admiral Pinchinin equipped four galliots at his own expence; with which, in conjunction with the chiayah, or ≈øecretary of the ba≈øhaw of Tripoli, he made a ≈øecond excur≈øion. This ≈ømall ≈øquadron, con≈øi≈øting of five galleys and two brigantines, and manned with their mo≈øt able ≈øeaman, fell in with an Engli≈øh ≈øhip of 40 guns; which, however, Pinchinin's captains refu≈øed to engage; but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they ≈øwore they would attack the next Chri≈øtian ≈øhip that came in their way. This happened to be a Dutch merchantman, of 28 guns and 40 men, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032877_0029_0FF5A82EF1A1B040"/>
laden, and unable to u≈øe her ≈øails by rea≈øon of a calm. Pinchinin immediately ≈øummoned her to ≈øurrender; but receiving an ironical an≈øwer, drew up his ≈øquadron, by means of oars, in the form of a half-moon, that they might pour their ≈øhot all at once into their adver≈øary. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were preparing to di≈øcharge a tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous broad≈øide into her, a breeze of wind fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ≈øprung up, and enabled him to change his po≈øition; which threw the Algerine ≈øquadron into ≈øuch confu≈øion that they ran foul of each othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Pinchinin, in the mean time, made ≈øeveral un≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to ≈øurround the Dutchman with his other galleys: but that ≈øhip lay ≈øo deep in the water, that every ≈øhot did terrible execution among the pirates. Every effort to recover from their confu≈øion was vain, and the Dutchman continued to pour into them ≈øuch vollies of grape-≈øhot and bars of iron, that in le≈øs than ten minutes above 200 of them were killed, and a much greater number wounded; among whom was the chiayah him≈øelf, who received a wound in the belly, of which he died ≈øhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ≈øquadron now retired with the utmo≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and returned to Algiers in the mo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal plight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:032877_0030_0FF5A83D9463AE48"/>
But though Pinchinin thus returned in di≈øgrace, the re≈øt of the fleet captured va≈øt numbers of ≈ølaves, and an immen≈øe quantity of rich ≈øpoils; in≈øomuch that the Engli≈øh, French and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the Algerines, who ≈øometimes vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafed to be at peace with them; but ≈øwore eternal war again≈øt Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greate≈øt enemies to the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan name. At la≈øt Lewis XIV. provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coa≈øts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a con≈øiderable fleet to be fitted out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, under the Marquis du Que≈øne, vice-admiral of France. His fir≈øt expedition was again≈øt a number of Tripolitan cor≈øairs; who had the good fortune to outrow him, and ≈øhelter them≈øelves in the i≈øland of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not, however, prevent him from pur≈øuing them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and making ≈øuch terrible fire upon them as quickly de≈øtroyed 14 of their ve≈ø≈øels, be≈øides bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the walls of the ca≈øtle.</p>
               <p>This ≈øeverity ≈øeemed only to be de≈øigned as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ≈øtill continued their outrages on the French coa≈øt, he ≈øailed to Algiers in Augu≈øt 1682, connonading and bombarding it ≈øo furiou≈øly, that the whole town was in flames in a very little time. The great Mo≈øque was battered down, and mo≈øt of the hou≈øes laid in ruins; in≈øomuch that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a ≈øudden the wind turned about, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged Du Que≈øne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made repri≈øals, by ≈øending a number of galleys and galliots to the coa≈øts of Provence, where they committed the mo≈øt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outrages, and brought away a va≈øt number of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032877_0030_0FF5A83D9463AE48"/>
captives: upon which a new armament was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be got ready at Toulon and Mar≈øeilles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the next year; and the Algerines, having received timely notice, put them≈øelves into as a good ≈øtate of defence as the time would allow.</p>
               <p>In May 1683, Du Que≈øne with his ≈øquadron ca≈øt anchor before Algiers; when being joined by the Marquis d'Affranville, at the head of five ≈øtout ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, it was re≈øolved to bombard the town next day. Accordingly 100 bombs were thrown into it the fir≈øt day, which did terrible execution; while the be≈øieged made ≈øome hundred di≈øcharges of their cannon again≈øt them, without doing any con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damage. The following night the bombs were again thrown into the city in ≈øuch numbers, that the dey's palace and other great edifices were almo≈øt de≈øtroyed; ≈øome of their batteries were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and ≈øeveral ve≈ø≈øels ≈øunk in the port. The dey and Turki≈øh ba≈øhaw, as well as the whole ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, alarmed at this dreadful havoc immediately ≈øued for peace. As a preliminary, the immediate ≈øurrender was in≈øi≈øted on, of all Chri≈øtian captives who had been taken fighting under the French flag; which being granted, 142 of them were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately delivered up, with a promi≈øe of ≈øending him the remainder as ≈øoon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Du Que≈øne ≈øent his commi≈ø≈øary-general and one of his engineers into the town; but with expre≈øs orders to in≈øi≈øt upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects they had taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hali Rais one of their captains, ≈øhould be given as ho≈øtages.</p>
               <p>This la≈øt demand having embarra≈ø≈øed the dey, he a≈ø≈øembled the Divan, and acquainted them with it;

upon which Mezomorto fell, into a violent pa≈ø≈øion, and told the a≈ø≈øembly, that the cowardice of tho≈øe who ≈øat at the helm, had occa≈øioned the ruin of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers; but that, for his part, he would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to deliver up any thing that had been taken from the French.</p>
               <p>He immediately acquainted the ≈øoldiery with what had pa≈ø≈øed; which ≈øo exa≈øperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow cho≈øe Mezomorto in his place. This was no ≈øooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of peace which had been made, and ho≈øtilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.</p>
               <p>The French admiral now kept pouring in ≈øuch vollies of bombs, that in le≈øs than three days, the greate≈øt part of the city was reduced to a≈øhes, and the fire burnt with ≈øuch vehemence, that the ≈øea was enlightened with it for more than ≈øix miles round. Mezomorto, unmoved at all the≈øe di≈øa≈øters, and the va≈øt number of the ≈ølain, who≈øe blood ran in rivulets along the ≈øtreets; or rather grown furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and de≈øperate, ≈øought only how to wreak his vengeance on the enemy; and not content with cau≈øing all the French in the city to be cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ordered their con≈øul to be tied hand and foot, and fa≈øtened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from whence he was ≈øhot away again≈øt their navy.

               <p>The haughty Algerines were now thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they were not invincible; and, therefore immediately ≈øent an emba≈ø≈øy into France, begging

in the mo≈øt humble terms, for peace; which Lewis immediately granted, to their inexpre≈ø≈øible joy. They now began to pay ≈øome regard to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to be a little more cautious how they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly incurred their di≈øplea≈øure. The fir≈øt bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the French had ≈øo far humbled the Algerines, that they conde≈øcended to enter into a treaty with England; which was renewed, upon terms very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the latter, in 1686. It is not to be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would di≈øappear on a ≈øudden: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding this treaty, therefore, they lo≈øt no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making prizes of the Engli≈øh ≈øhips when they could conveniently come at them. Upon ≈øome infringement of this kind, captain Beach drove them a≈øhore and burnt ≈øeven of their frigates in 1695; which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after: but it was not till the taking of Gibraltar and port Mahon, that Britain could have a ≈øufficient check upon them to enforce the ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of treaties; and the≈øe have ≈øince proved ≈øuch re≈øtraints upon Algiers, that they ≈øtill continue to pay a greater deference to the Engli≈øh than to any other European power.</p>
               <p>The pre≈øent century furni≈øhes but few very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable events with regard to Algiers. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous city of Oran was, however, taken from the Spaniards in 1708, which they recovered in 1737. In 1710 the Turki≈øh ba≈øhaw was expelled, and his office united to that of the dey. This introduced the form of government which ≈øtill continues in Algiers.</p>
               <p>In 1775 the Spaniards made another de≈øcent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Algiers. They fitted out this year a very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable fleet con≈øi≈øting of ≈øix ≈øhips of the line, twelve frigates, nine xebeques, and twenty-four other armed

               <p>On the 23d of June the fleet ≈øet ≈øail from the port of Carthagena in Spain, and on the 1≈øt of July an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in the bay of Algiers. They ob≈øerved a large encampment, placed behind a battery, ea≈øt of the little river Xarach, which lies to the ea≈øtward of the city, and ≈øeveral Moors on hor≈øeback about the beach. On the ≈øecond of July a council of the principal officers was held, and orders were given that the troops ≈øhould hold them≈øelves in readine≈øs to di≈øembark the next morning at day-break. But as the ≈øucceeding night was windy, and a ≈øwell had ≈øet in from the ≈øhore, the≈øe orders were countermanded.

                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:032877_0032_0FF5A840C8B60E88"/>
On the 6th, all the principal officers were again a≈ø≈øembled to receive their ultimate in≈øtructions, when the orders of the 2d of July were ≈øtrongly recommended; which, however, offended the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in general, by allotting ≈øevere puni≈øhments for trivial neglects. In the≈øe orders the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief enjoined the troops not to break their order; as nothing but united force and di≈øcipline could en≈øure them ≈øucce≈øs again≈øt an enemy ≈øo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ≈økilful in de≈øultory war. He particularly warned them of the practice of the Moors, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways feign a mo≈øt violent attack, and upon the lea≈øt re≈øi≈øtance fly with precipitation, in order to draw their enemy into an ambu≈øcade. But he pointed out to them the very error which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards committed, and the ≈ønare into which they were betrayed. On landing, he commanded each brigade to form a column of a company in front, ≈øix deep; and the guards of half a company in front: and directed them to gain ≈øome heights which were ≈øuppo≈øed requi≈øite to en≈øure ≈øucce≈øs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the city. The di≈øpo≈øition of the march was ordered to be in four columns, with the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry in advance, and on the flanks; each column was to have four field pieces in front, to be increa≈øed as exigencies might require: two redoubts were to be formed at the place of di≈øembarkation, and a communication to be kept up between the army, tho≈øe fortifications, and the fleet. In the afternoon of the 6th, ≈øome ≈øhips of war were ordered to fire again≈øt three batteries to the ea≈øtward of Algiers. But they were ≈øtationed at ≈øo great a di≈øtance, through the fear of being raked by the Algerine batteries, that their ≈øhot did not reach the ≈øhore!‚Äîexcept tho≈øe of the St. Jo≈øeph, of 74 guns, which received ≈øome damage

from the enemy. At ≈øun-≈øet this <hi>very</hi> cautious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack cea≈øed.</p>
               <p>On the 7th at day-break, between eight and nine thou≈øand men were put on board of boats for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They advanced very near the ≈øhore, about a mile to the we≈øtward of the river Xarach, under the protection of ≈øeven galleys, and two long boats with a twelve pounder each; not a Moor appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppo≈øe their landing.

               <p>On the 8th at day-break the ≈øhips were po≈øted to batter the different forts to the right and left of the place of di≈øembarkation, and 8000 troops were put on board of boats, which formed in ≈øix columns; at the head of which were the grenadiers, preceded by the armed xebeques, galliots, &amp;c. that were to cover their landing. The firing from the ≈øhips began, and the troops moved on to the place of di≈øembarkation, where they effected their landing on the beach, (about a league to the ea≈øtward of the city), between the intervals of firing from the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ve≈ø≈øels; and immediately above 80,000 Moors appeared in ≈øight, two-thirds of which were caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under the bey of Con≈øtantina; but they did not attempt to oppo≈øe the landing of the Spani≈øh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Turks in the mean time remained to defend the city, and not one of them appeared to di≈øpute the ground. It is ≈øaid that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Africans collected on this occa≈øion was not le≈øs than 150,000, of which 100,000 were cavalry.

the armed ve≈ø≈øels divided to the right and left, to cover their flanks; and the boats returned to bring the re≈øt of the army on ≈øhore with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. The troops of the fir≈øt di≈øembarkation had ≈øcarcely formed, when a detachment of the enemy appeared in their front; but upon ob≈øerving a movement of the Spaniards towards them, they fled in di≈øorder. The troops then marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the beat of drum, with the volunteers of Arragon and Catolonia in front, until they were engaged in a clo≈øe country, which the enemy had occupied in ≈ømall parties; but po≈øted ≈øo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geou≈øly in ditches and fortre≈ø≈øes, that they made great havoc among the Spaniards, without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any injury in return. The Spani≈øh grenadiers, and light infantry, which had been detached in advance, were repul≈øed. At this juncture they were reinforced by the troops of the ≈øecond di≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, and ≈øome heavy cannon coming up which protected their march, they again advanced towards ≈øome inclo≈øures, where they directed a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy fire; but without being able to di≈ølodge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Great numbers of the Spaniards fell without gaining the lea≈øt advantage; in con≈øequence of which their whole body fell into confu≈øion. The zeal and intrepidity of the officers was in≈øufficient to contain the men; ≈øome advanced, and others retired, in an indi≈øcriminate manner, ju≈øt as they judged it expedient, without any regard to the command of their officers. While they were in this critical ≈øituation, a drove of camels appeared, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on their left, conducted by ≈øome Moors, with a de≈øign of drawing the fire of the enemy upon them. Great was the ≈ølaughter of the Spaniards, and in this extremity a cry was ≈øpread that they were cut off by the Moori≈øh hor≈øe. The utmo≈øt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032877_0034_0FF5A85144481D78"/>
confu≈øion ≈øucceeded, and the whole body fled with the greate≈øt precipitation, leaving on the field of battle an immen≈øe number of wounded, whom they were obliged to abandon to the mercy of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. By this time the workmen and troops of the third di≈øembarkation were forming entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they had already fortified with three eight pounders; which did great execution; at the ≈øame time the Tu≈øcan commanders drew their frigates clo≈øe into ≈øhore, and kept up ≈øuch a well-directed fire, that the Spaniards were enabled to make good their retreat into their entrenchments, which were, however, ≈øcarcely large enough to contain their army. In this crowded ≈øituation they were much annoyed by a thirty-≈øix pounder which the enemy brought out of one of their batteries, and an elevated fire from the fort of Xarach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to the mi≈øchief. The Moors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them in their trenches, but they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øed with great ≈ølaughter, and in this ≈øituation the Spaniards remained till dark, when they began their re-imbarkation in great tumult and confu≈øion; but what di≈øcovered the ignorance of the Moors, was their neglecting ≈øo favourable an opportunity of obtaining the complete≈øt of victories.</p>
               <p>The lo≈øs ≈øu≈øtained by the Spaniards on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, amounted to 27 officers killed, and 191 wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 501 men killed, and 2,088 wounded. The Marquis of Romana was killed at the head of his brigade in the commencement of the action. The lo≈øs of the Moors it is ≈øaid, was between five and ≈øix thou≈øand killed, and as many wounded; but this ≈øeems improbable<note n="*" place="bottom">The above account is agreeable to the Spani≈øh court gazettes, (in which truth is ≈øeldom expected), and agrees with Dalrymple's ≈øtatement, who ≈øays it nearly corre≈øponds with a letter from Algiers. But other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ≈øtate the Spani≈øh lo≈øs much greater, and it is at lea≈øt evident that there cannot be ≈øo wide a difference in the lo≈øs between the parties, e≈øpecially as the Spaniards made ≈øo little impre≈ø≈øion on the Moors in their ditches, &amp;c.</note> The government of Algiers

had offered a premium of ten ≈øequins for every Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard's head, and con≈øequently the wounded Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who were left on the field of battle, were all murdered. The unfortunate invaders left behind them on their retreat, 15 pieces of cannon, three howitzers, and a great number of ≈ømall arms and ammunition.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of July, the troops, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt part of the fleet ≈øet ≈øail on their return to Spain, and thus terminated this Quixotic expedition; of which a Spani≈øh ≈øerjeant, in giving an account to his wife, ludicrou≈øly ≈øays, <hi>Nos mandaron a tierra, como ≈øi ibemos a beber caf√® con los Moros;</hi> "we were commanded a-≈øhore as if we were to drink coffee with the Moors."</p>
               <p>When the melancholy intelligence was announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the failure of this expedition, from which the Spani≈øh nation had formed ≈øuch ≈øanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ≈øucce≈øs, the national feelings were indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribable. O'Reilly was in con≈øequence ≈øo cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dete≈øted, that mobs a≈ø≈øembled upon the road to Alicant with an intent to wreak their vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. They ≈øtopped many carriages, and that O'Reilly (who was lame) might not be concealed, they made the people get out and walk before them. Had the liberty of the pre≈øs prevailed the world would have known the ≈øentiments of the Spani≈øh nation upon this occa≈øion. The king was threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if his favorite ≈øhould ever appear at court again,

and to appea≈øe the turbulence of the people he was ≈øoon after removed from the governor≈øhip of Madrid.</p>
               <p>Since the failure of this expedition the Spaniards have attempted nothing deci≈øive again≈øt Algiers. In the years 1783 and 1784, indeed, they renewed their attacks by ≈øea to de≈øtroy the city and galleys; but after ≈øpending a great quantity of ammunition, bombs, &amp;c. they were obliged to retire without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its capture or extinction.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the American inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, when the United States had relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øhed their maritime dependence upon the Engli≈øh nation, it followed as a natural con≈øequence, that the American commerce mu≈øt fall a ≈øacrifice to the ravages of the Algerine cor≈øairs; and no doubt it was through the intrigues of the Briti≈øh cabinet, who were chagrined at our recent emancipation, that their ho≈øtile di≈øpo≈øition was ≈øo quickly manife≈øted. Various circum≈øtances concurred to render them eligible objects of piratical rapacity. America was ≈øituated at the di≈øtance of more than three thou≈øand miles from the theatre of their piracies, and as ≈øhe ≈øupported no maritime force they were enabled to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032877_0036_0FF5A854584D8308"/>
continue their depredations with impunity. Her exten≈øive commerce with Europe pre≈øented a ≈øplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did allurement to the pirates, who were well aware that the prevention of their aggre≈ø≈øions would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a naval armament greatly ≈øuperior to the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantial benefits that could be derived from an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reduce them to ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by no means problematical, that the naval force of the United States, with judicious comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, would prove fully competent to reduce their fleet, if not to effect the de≈øtruction of their city. According to the mo≈øt authentic accounts, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is at pre≈øent extremely incon≈øiderable, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the American captives concur in the a≈ø≈øertion, that the fleet of this regency only amounted in 1796 to five frigates, two xebecks, and one half gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley! a force by no means to be put in competition with that which could be rai≈øed by the United States. But to bring all their ≈øhips of war to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular engagement at once, would be totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; for whenever an ho≈øtile armament ≈øcours the Mediterranean they immediately fly for refuge to the guns of their fortifications.</p>
               <p>When we reflect upon the peculiar encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had to commit depredations on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, it becomes rather a matter of wonder that we ≈øuffered ≈øo little, than that we ≈øuffered ≈øo much. For this ≈øecurity we were greatly indebted to the wars which exi≈øted between the Algerines, the Portugue≈øe and the Dutch, at the time they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their ravages upon our trade; either of which powers are greatly ≈øuperior to the cor≈øairs in maritime ≈øtrength, and they ≈øo narrowly watched the entrance of the Mediterranean for the protection of their own commerce, that the pirates were ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom able to crui≈øe out into the Atlantic. Tho≈øe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032877_0036_0FF5A854584D8308"/>
American ve≈ø≈øels that ≈øometimes ventured into the ≈øtreights were generally ≈øafe; for they derived their ≈øecurity either from forged or purcha≈øed Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean pa≈ø≈øports.</p>
               <p>Notwith≈øtanding the vigilance with which the Portugue≈øe guarded the ≈øtreights, the Algerines ≈øometimes ≈øtole out into the Atlantic, and in one of the≈øe excur≈øions, which happened while the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugue≈øe fleet were ordered upon ≈øome ≈øecret expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ≈øchooner Maria, captain Stephens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mr. Fo≈øter of Bo≈øton, was captured by a cor≈øair off Cape St. Vincents, on the 25th of July 1785; and five days afterwards, the ≈øhip Dolphin, captain O'Brien, belonging to Me≈ø≈ørs. Irvines of Philadelphia, was taken by another about 50 leagues to the we≈øtward of Li≈øbon. The≈øe ve≈ø≈øels, with their cargoes and crews, about 21 in number, were carried into Algiers, where they were made ≈ølaves.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of the year 1793, a truce was made between the court of Li≈øbon and the regency of Algiers, for the period of twelve months, and in con≈øequence, nine ≈øail of Algerine crui≈øers pa≈ø≈øed out through the Streights of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar into the Atlantic ocean. Their crui≈øing ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was between Cape St. Vincents and the we≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern i≈ølands, where they continued to crui≈øe the greate≈øt part of the winter, contrary to their former cu≈øtom of retiring from the ocean in November. In con≈øequence of this truce, the courts of Li≈øbon and Madrid granted convoys to American ve≈ø≈øels homeward bound, to a certain latitude where they were free from th√® cor≈øairs.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of October 1793, about five leagues from Gibraltar, captain John M'Shane of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva, was boarded by a xebeck of 20 guns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032877_0037_0FF5A855DEC43880"/>
to Algiers, who after coming within mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-≈øhot, kept a con≈øtant firing with ≈ømall-arms until the yards of the American ve≈ø≈øel were manned from tho≈øe of the crui≈øer. The firing then cea≈øed; they came down ≈øword in hand and made the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican crew pri≈øoners; ≈øtripped them of their clothes, and put them on board the xebeck, which carried them to Algiers, where they arrived the 30th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. As ≈øoon as they had arrived they were taken before the dey, and after examination, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Bagnio, where the ≈ølaves are kept lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up at night. The next day they were bound with iron chains, each about 40 pounds weight, which reached from their legs to their hips, and ≈øent to the marine, where they were kept at hard labour from day-light till dark.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of October, captain William Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro≈øe, of the ≈øhip Pre≈øident of Philadelphia, di≈øcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, about 9 o'clock in the morning, a ≈øail to the windward bearing down upon him, which the ≈øhip's company at fir≈øt imagined to be a Spani≈øh privateer. But they were ≈øoon fatally deceived; for ≈øhe proved to be an Algerine cor≈øair. As ≈øoon as ≈øhe di≈øcovered the American flag ≈øhe hoi≈øted out her boat immediately, and 30 men armed with pi≈øtols and drawn cutla≈ø≈øes furiou≈øly boarded his ve≈ø≈øel. The fir≈øt ≈øalutation the captain received was a violent ≈øtroke with a cutla≈øs; after which they compelled the whole ≈øhip's company to jump over the rail of the ve≈ø≈øel into their boat, without ≈øuffering any one to go below for their clothes, and other nece≈ø≈øary articles. The crew were then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on board the crui≈øer, where they were ≈øtripped naked, and a few old rags were given them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, neither ≈øufficient to conceal their nakedne≈øs, nor protect them from the cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:032877_0037_0FF5A855DEC43880"/>
In this ≈øituation they were obliged to lie on deck, where they ≈øuffered great hard≈øhips from the inclemency of the ≈øea≈øon. Captain Penro≈øe tells us he was forced to lie on the poop, where he was almo≈øt peri≈øhed by a bitter north-ea≈øt wind; till at length an old man, more humane than the re≈øt, furni≈øhed him with a blanket. The provi≈øions given them to eat, were black bread and water, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a few rotten olives, which they regarded as a great dainty.</p>
               <p>In this forlorn ≈øituation they continued eight days, and on the 30th of October they arrived at Algiers. Here they were ≈øubjected to a new ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of mi≈øery. They thought them≈øelves cruelly treated on board the crui≈øer; but their treatment there was plea≈øure when contra≈øted with the mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they afterwards experienced. They were ≈øcarcely on ≈øhore when they were loaded with irons, and immediately put to hard labour like ≈øo many criminals.</p>
               <p>The number of American pri≈øoners now amounted to about 130, among whom were captains Stephens and O'Brien, who≈øe crews had been reduced to ten by the plague, and the ≈øeverity of their treatment for upwards of eight years. The ≈ømall pittance they had received from the United States had been withheld about three months before; and their only ≈øub≈øi≈øtence was a little black bread and water, and ≈øometimes nothing.</p>
               <p>In their October expedition they captured ten ≈øail of American ve≈ø≈øels, nine of which ≈øafely entered the harbour of Algiers on the 30th of October where the ve≈ø≈øels anchored, amid≈øt the ≈øhouts of the people<note n="*" place="bottom">The names of the American captains and their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of re≈øidence are as follows:‚ÄîCaptains Wallace, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia; Newman, Bo≈øton; Taylor, Rhode-I≈øland; Furnace, New-Hamp≈øhire; Calder, Glouce≈øter; Burnham, New-York; Bailey, Newbury; Mo≈øs, ditto; M'Shane and Penro≈øe, Philadelphia.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:032877_0038_0FF5A86419EDFC38"/>
The Algerine cor≈øairs, greatly animated with the ≈øucce≈øs of this expedition, immediately ≈øet ≈øail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume their former ≈øtation; while others were equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the harbour with the utmo≈øt ≈øpeed. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately the mi≈øcreants only captured one Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ve≈ø≈øel, about a month afterwards, belonging to captain Jo≈øeph Ingraham; for the Americans were extremely cautious how they came within the ≈øphere of their rapacity; and, after the≈øe captures, they never fell in with any American ve≈ø≈øels, but tho≈øe that were protected by convoys.</p>
               <p>After the≈øe events, the American pri≈øoners were ≈øubjected to a ≈øeries of mi≈øery which humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty blu≈øhes to record. As ≈øoon as they landed in Algiers, they were immediately ordered to the dey's palace, where they were drawn up in files, in a back court, and underwent a ≈øtrick examination. The dey, attended by his cook, pa≈ø≈øed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øed in front of them, and was extremely plea≈øed with their appearance. He ≈øelected from their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the boys and younger men, whom he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his palace at different occupations, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of a ≈øervile nature; ≈øome were ordered to ≈øweep the apartments, ≈øome to wa≈øh clothes, and others to wait upon the dey and take care of his wardrobe. The re≈øt of the pri≈øoners were then di≈ømi≈ø≈øed, and as they withdrew from the royal pre≈øence, the dey ≈øaid to them, in the tone of ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage triumph, "<hi>Go now you dogs and eat ≈øtones."</hi> They were then e≈øcorted to the Bagnio Baleck,

where they were lodged in different apartments among the old ≈ølaves, and each pri≈øoner furni≈øhed with a couple of coar≈øe blankets for his bedding. In this di≈ømal region of mi≈øery and oppre≈ø≈øion, amid≈øt the clanking of chains and the cries of ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering humanity, they were left to brood over their mi≈øfortunes at lei≈øure.

               <p>About midnight they were rou≈øed from their meditations by the cry of <hi>Sur≈øa, Sur≈øa,</hi> ri≈øe up all hands. The <hi>Li≈øbero,</hi> or guardian of the Bagnio, then entered their apartments, and loaded each pri≈øoner with chains of thirty or forty pounds weight. The next morning about day-break they were ordered to the marine, where, after their names were called over, they were employed in di≈øcharging the cargoes of their own ve≈ø≈øels, which con≈øi≈øted of wheat, flour, wine, ≈øugar, and other articles. Their general employment in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine was the rigging and fitting out of crui≈øers, and whenever any foreign ve≈ø≈øel lay in the harbour they were obliged to wear this enormous weight of chains, le≈øt they ≈øhould make their e≈øcape; but at other times they were freed from their load, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept tho≈øe who were turbulent, or by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mi≈øconduct had forfeited this privilege of the ≈ølaves.</p>
               <p>The hour of four in the afternoon is called <hi>lazar,</hi> at which time a white flag is hoi≈øted upon the tops of all the mo≈øques in the city, as a ≈øignal for the inhabitants to quit their labour, and repair to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic wor≈øhip. At this hour the labour of the pri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cea≈øed, and they were permitted to go on ≈øhore, except when any bu≈øine≈øs of importance occurred,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032877_0039_0FF5A865A4324028"/>
and when that was the ca≈øe they were generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined till dark.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as they were ordered on ≈øhore they were provided with in≈øtruments to carry ≈øtones from the mole to a grand mo≈øque, which the dey was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the city adjoining his ≈øeraglio. The≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments were formed of cro≈øs pieces of timber, called <hi>burrils,</hi> to which the ≈øton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, timber, cannon or whatever el≈øe was nece≈ø≈øary to be carried, were ≈øu≈øpended beneath by ropes, and borne upon the ≈øhoulders of four men, who were appointed to carry each burril. A particular load was always a≈ø≈øigned them, and the weak and the ≈øtrong were indi≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately compelled to carry the≈øe burdens, without any attention being paid to the comparative bodily ≈øtrength of the labourer. To per≈øons of robu≈øt con≈øtitutions the≈øe loaded burrils were tolerable, but to tho≈øe of weak habits of body they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in≈øupportable; and hence it happened, that many per≈øons, by being over≈øtrained, were either blinded, or extremely injured in their con≈øtitutions.</p>
               <p>When the proce≈ø≈øion of loaded burrils was ready to move, the warden ba≈øhaw, who ≈øtood at the port of the marine, waved his wand as a ≈øignal for the ≈ølaves to advance to the port, where they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the wardens of the marine, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe of di≈øcovering whether they had ≈øtolen any particular articles from the ve≈ø≈øels. After this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination they were permitted to pa≈øs with their loads, which they depo≈øited at the new mo≈øque, and then retired with their in≈øtruments to their re≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive lodgings; ≈øome to the Bagnio Baleck, and others to the Bagnio Gallaro, where their names were called over by the clerks, and each ≈ølave as he pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed received a loaf of black bread for his ≈øupper.</p>
               <p>For ≈øome time they were obliged to ≈øleep upon
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032877_0039_0FF5A865A4324028"/>
the ground; but they ≈øoon con≈øtructed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves a kind of wooden frames, which were ≈øwung like hammocks one above another, and upon the≈øe they threw their clothes and blankets when they were about to retire to re≈øt: but to add to their mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, their ≈øleep was ince≈ø≈øantly di≈øturbed by infinite numbers of vermin with which the≈øe Bagnios ≈øwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In the morning they again repaired with their burrils to the marine, where their names were called over; and in this manner were they con≈øtantly employed whenever the equipment of the Algerine cor≈øairs was nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
               <p>Many of the ≈ølaves, however, were di≈øtributed in different parts; ≈øome were ≈øent into the country, and whenever the ≈øea was calm, and no particular emergency required their labour in the marine, great numbers of others were employed in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øtones from a mountain called <hi>Babloet,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bublywhite,</hi> about a league from the city, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to defend the mole from the impetuo≈øity of the waves. The≈øe ≈øtones were blown by ≈ølaves from the immen≈øe rocks which lie depo≈øited in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ≈øome of them were twelve or fifteen feet in diameter. In order to convey them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently to the water, the ≈ølaves were engaged for more than a year, in forming a pa≈ø≈øage through a large hill, which they removed and carried into the ≈øea, where they formed a large mole or wharf to protect their <hi>pantoons,</hi> or carrying boats, from the violence of the waves. In forming this pa≈ø≈øage they dug through a Moori≈øh burial ground, from whence they removed immen≈øe numbers of human bones. The≈øe repo≈øitories of the dead are always regarded as ≈øacred by the Moors, and the whole neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and particularly the women, were, in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, thrown into the greate≈øt con≈øternation.

They re≈øorted to this ≈øcene of ≈øacrilege, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged the mo≈øt immoderate grief over this deva≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the relics of their friends. But ≈øuch were the orders of the dey, and they were obliged to ≈øubmit patiently to his will.</p>
               <p>After this pa≈ø≈øage was formed, the≈øe immen≈øe fragments of rocks were dragged by ≈ølaves, with great labour and difficulty, from the mountain, and placed upon ≈øtrong carriages about two feet high; upon which they were conveyed to the wharf, by upwards of two hundred ≈ølaves to each carriage, where they were thrown into pantoons; from thence they were tran≈øported by water, and di≈øcharged at the mole before the city.</p>
               <p>But when the ≈øea was tempe≈øtuous and the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons could not be navigated, the ≈ølaves were then employed in carrying ≈ømaller ≈øtones by land. After having ≈øu≈øpended a load to their burrils, of ≈øuch a weight as ≈øome were ≈øcarcely able to ≈øtagger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they proceeded in gangs of different numbers, attended by a crew of ≈øavage drivers, who goaded them forward whenever they halted or happened to faulter under the pre≈ø≈øure of their burdens. The extremity of their ≈øufferings in this laborious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is better conceived than expre≈ø≈øed. The mo≈øt barbarous puni≈øhments were wantonly inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the violence of a ≈øcorching ≈øun, which poured its fervid rays upon them, ≈øeemed to complete the mea≈øure of human wretchedne≈øs. With this enormous weight of ≈øtones they moved forward, attended by wardens who preceded them in order to clear the ≈øtreets of the city through which they pa≈ø≈øed, where every per≈øon was obliged to give way at their approach. After having di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their loads at the mole they returned, and in this manner were they employed during the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032877_0040_0FF5A8672CB8AF48"/>
≈øummer ≈øea≈øon, when no particular emergencies demanded their labour in the marine. This mole, in con≈øequence of the encroachments of the ≈øea du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter, requires an eternal ≈øupply of ≈øtones, and in this manner is this Si≈øyphaean labour conducted by a herd of wretches who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doomed to this abject ≈øervitude for life. The dey commonly rides out to his country-≈øeat about twice a week, where his favorite wife re≈øides in the ≈øummer ≈øea≈øon, and in pa≈ø≈øing and repa≈ø≈øing he would ≈øometimes conde≈øcend to di≈øtribute ≈øome trifling pre≈øents among the ≈ølaves.</p>
               <p>The over≈øeers in their treatment towards the ≈ølaves ≈øeemed actuated by a principle of the mo≈øt ≈øavage cruelty, and inflicted the mo≈øt rigorous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments through mere caprice and wantonne≈øs, in order to fea≈øt their malignant ≈øouls with the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the trembling wretch who ≈øtood ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire beneath their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for particular anecdotes, occurrences, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which regard our countrymen, to our ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the ≈ølaves.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the ≈øufferings of our fellow citizens in Algiers were the univer≈øal ≈øubject of ≈øympathy and regret; and mea≈øures were ≈øoon adopted to effect their deliverance from this region of unparalleled mi≈øery. Colonel Humphreys, who had been appointed American con≈øul for Algiers, left America in April 1795, in company with Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph Donald≈øon, <abbr>E≈øq.</abbr> of Philadelphia, who had been appointed con≈øul for Tunis and Tripoli, and whom Colonel Humphreys was authori≈øed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in the negociation of a treaty of peace and amity with Algiers, while he proceeded to France for the purpo≈øe of obtaining the co-operation of that government in this negociation.</p>
               <p>They arrived at Gibraltar the 17th of May, where Col. Humphreys concluded that it would be expedient for Mr. Donald≈øon to go fir≈øt to Alicant, to the northward of Carthagena in Spain, rather than to Algiers, there to re≈øide for ≈øome time, in order that he might be near the ≈øcene of negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take advantage of any favorable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that might happen. Mr. Donald≈øon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his in≈øtructions accordingly, and immediately ≈øet out for that place; and in the mean time Col. Humphreys, having al≈øo given in≈øtructions to Mr. Simp≈øon, the American con≈øul at Gibraltar, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a peace with the emperor of Morocco, ≈øailed from Gibraltar the 24th of May, and on the 26th of June following arrived at Havre de-Grace in France; from whence he immediately ≈øet out for Paris, where he ≈øoon after communicated the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his mi≈ø≈øion to Col. Monroe, the American

mini≈øter, and to the Committee of Public Safety of that Republic.</p>
               <p>On the 1≈øt of July Col. Humphreys receive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal notification that the French Republic was di≈øpo≈øed to exert its influence in forwarding the negociation in que≈øtion; and on the 28th he received the favorable intelligence, that immediate mea≈øures ≈øhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted for giving particular in≈øtructions to the agents of the Republic to u≈øe its influence in the promotion of the treaty in contemplation. The multiplicity of national concerns with which the officers of the French government were then occupied, and the time requi≈øite for obtaining from London ( where funds had been depo≈øited) the ≈øums of money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as peace pre≈øents, retarded the conclu≈øion of arrangements at Paris till ≈øome time in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it had been deemed expedient by Cols. Monroe and Humphreys, that Joel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <abbr>E≈øq.</abbr> ≈øhould be con≈øulted, and if his a≈ø≈øent could be obtained that he ≈øhould be employed in negociating with the Barbary States: to which Mr. Barlow con≈øented. By the 11th of September all the papers on the part of Col. Humphreys relative to Mr. Barlow's mi≈ø≈øion were in readine≈øs, and as ≈øoon as the peace pre≈øents were prepared for him, he ≈øet out, with in≈øtructions and powers from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of France to its agents in Barbary, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the bu≈øine≈øs that had been entru≈øted to him.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of September Col. Humphreys left Paris, and arrived at Havre-de-Grace the 14th; where he found the captain and mate of the United States brig Sophia both ≈øick with fevers. While he was waiting here with great impatience for their recovery, he received information from the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can con≈øul at Mar≈øeilles, that Mr. Donald≈øon had
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032877_0042_0FF5A8770C40B418"/>
concluded a treaty of peace with the dey of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers. He judged it expedient, notwith≈øtanding, that Mr. Barlow ≈øhould proceed with the pre≈øents, and if they were not wanted at Algiers they would be nece≈ø≈øary in the negociation with Tunis and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli.</p>
               <p>Col. Humphreys ≈øailed from Havre-de-Grace about the 5th of October, and after a ≈øtormy pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of more than forty days, arrived at Li≈øbon the 17th of November, where he found captain O'Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, who had arrived about the 1≈øt of October, with the treaty with Algiers. Mr. Donald≈øon arrived at Algiers on the 3d of September; the treaty was concluded on the 5th, and the peace pre≈øents immediately given by a loan. As Mr. Donald≈øon knew that funds had been lodged in London to fulfil the ≈øtipulations of the treaty, he engaged to make the payments in three or four months.</p>
               <p>Col. Humphreys had received advice, under date of the 30th of July, from the Me≈ø≈ørs. Barings in London, to whom the funds had been remitted, that having made con≈øiderable progre≈øs in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Col. Humphreys, calculating upon the certainty of payment after this period, ≈øent captain O'Brien from Li≈øbon to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the brig Sophia to receive the money. But owing to contrary winds he did not leave Li≈øbon till the 24th of December.</p>
               <p>In con≈øequence of the di≈øappointments in the pecuniary arrangements the treaty was in the mo≈øt imminent danger of being ultimately fru≈øtrated; the dey became impatient, and threatened to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

He arrived there the 5th of March. The time for the payment of the ≈øtipulated ≈øums had before been prolonged to the 8th of April. On the 3d of that month the dey declared that his final determination was, that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Donald≈øon ≈øhould leave Algiers in eight days; and if the money was not paid in 30 days after, the treaty ≈øhould be at end, and his cor≈øairs be permitted to bring in American ve≈ø≈øels. Under the≈øe imperious circum≈øtances, and as the la≈øt hope of ≈øaving the treaty, they were induced to offer the dey the pre≈øent of a frigate; which fortunately ≈øucceeded. But Col.

While the bu≈øine≈øs was in this precarious ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, owing principally to the convul≈øions in Europe, Mr. Donald≈øon ≈øet out for Leghorn, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a loan of 400,000 dollars of the Me≈ø≈ørs. Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereau, and as that port was blockaded by the Briti≈øh fleet, Mr. Donald≈øon obtained permi≈ø≈øion from the court of Great Britain that the money might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from thence without being ≈øubject to capture, and it was ≈øoon after ≈øent in a Venetian ve≈ø≈øel to Algiers.</p>
               <p>Captain O'Brien after he had received the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the executive, ≈øet ≈øail from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in June 1796, and arrived in Li≈øbon ≈øometime in July. In the mean time Col. Humphreys had advantageou≈øly negociated bills on London for 225,000 dollars, which he had received, and this ≈øum was embarked on board the brig Sophia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned to the care of captain O'Brien. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was in≈øured at a ≈ømall premium again≈øt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the ≈øeas; but again≈øt all ri≈øks ≈øo high a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium was demanded that Col.

               <p>On the 4th of Augu≈øt capt. O'Brien ≈øet ≈øail for Algiers, and on the 18th he was captured off that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a Tripolitan cor≈øair, who carried his ve≈ø≈øel, money and crew in triumph to Tripoli, (which lies on the Mediterranean, about 130 miles to the ≈øouth-ea≈øtward of Algiers), accompanied by the ≈øhip Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øy of Bo≈øton, who≈øe crew were made ≈ølaves. This immen≈øe ≈øum in ≈øpecie, more perhaps than they had ever captured at once before, was landed amid≈øt the firing of cannon, the di≈øplay of colours, and the ≈øhouts of the populace. The extravagance of their
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032877_0043_0FF5A87899421C38"/>
joy, however, was ≈øoon abated when capt. O'Brien exhibited to them the pa≈ø≈øport of the dey of Algiers; he demon≈øtrated to them that he was ≈øtill the ≈ølave of the dey, and though the money had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him by the United States, yet it was the the ≈øame in effect as if it had been delivered to the dey him≈øelf. After an examination of two days the ve≈ø≈øel was liberated, and capt. O'Brien immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ≈øet ≈øail for Algiers, where he arrived the fir≈øt of October, and delivered the money to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can con≈øul re≈øiding there; who had previou≈øly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the loan of the nece≈ø≈øary ≈øums from the Me≈ø≈ørs. Buckras, a Jewi≈øh company in Algiers, who had received ≈øatisfactory information of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of repayment. With this timely loan Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fulfilled his ≈øtipulations with the dey, who was ≈øo highly plea≈øed with the pre≈øent, and in con≈øequence repo≈øed ≈øuch confidence in the United States, that he offered Mr. Barlow upon their account the loan of ≈øuch ≈øums as would enable him to negociate a treaty of peace with the Tuni≈øian and Tripolitan powers, which he judged proper to accept.</p>
               <p>By the judicious arrangements of Mr. Barlow with the dey, capt. O'Brien was appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner on behalf of the United States to negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a treaty with the regencies of Tunis and Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li. He ≈øet ≈øail upon this bu≈øine≈øs the 10th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and arrived at Tunis on the 16th, where he had an interview with the bey, to whom he pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from the dey of Algiers, enclo≈øing a command that he ≈øhould make peace with the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican commi≈ø≈øioner upon the terms therein pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. But the bey totally rejected the terms, and demanded the payment of a ≈øum equal to thrice that amount. After many audiences and conferences, capt. O'Brien, finding that the bey would neither
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032877_0044_0FF5A867105414E70"/>
accept of a le≈øs ≈øum, nor accede to the terms of the dey, tran≈ømitted the Tuni≈øian demand to Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Algiers, which he communicated to the dey, who was much exa≈øperated in con≈øequence, and would not ≈øuffer him to acquie≈øce in ≈øo exorbitant a demand.</p>
               <p>In this ≈øituation capt. O'Brien left the Tuni≈øian bu≈øine≈øs, and proceeded to Tripoli, where, after much difficulty, he concluded a peace with that power upon the 4th of November, and procured the relea≈øe of the American pri≈øoners who were captu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ≈øhip Bet≈øey. He left captain Jo≈øeph In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graham, the American <hi>charge des affaires,</hi> in that place, and ≈øailed from thence the 27th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, bringing away the remaining part of the crew of the ≈øhip Bet≈øey. On the 7th of December, in his return to Algiers, he again touched at Tunis, where he received orders from Mr. Barlow and the dey, by whom he had been inve≈øted with di≈øcretionary powers to conduct the negociation, to demand a definitive an≈øwer from the bey of Tunis, whether he would negociate a treaty of peace with the United States upon the terms pre≈øcribed by the dey? but he found that the bey ≈øtill per≈øi≈øted in the exorbitancy of his demands; and after many conferences and fruitle≈øs efforts he ≈øailed from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, and arrived in Algiers the 3d of January 1797, where he communicated to Mr. Barlow and the dey the un≈øucce≈øsful re≈øult of his mi≈ø≈øion. The dey was violently enraged at the in≈øult offered to his dignity by this rejection of his interce≈ø≈øion in the affairs of the United States, and actuated by ≈øome former animo≈øities that ≈øtill ≈øub≈øi≈øted between them, he i≈ø≈øued immediate orders to his ea≈øtern camp of 60,000 men to enter the Tuni≈øian terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. This army was ≈øoon ≈øet in motion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force

a compliance on the part of the bey. In their rout through the Tuni≈øian dominions they cut off ≈øome hundreds of heads and ears, and after commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting great ravages upon the inhabitants, they returned to the territory of Algiers. This har≈øh expedient was adopted in order to a≈øcertain the political di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of the government of Tunis, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide whether they would ≈øubmit to the controul of the dey; for the powers relative to the American pacification, the dey expre≈øsly declared, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his immediate guarantee. Capt. O'Brien, by the dey's orders, left Algiers the 14th of February, and arrived in Philadelphia the 1≈øt of April 1797.</p>
               <p>The truce which Mr. Barlow concluded with the Tuni≈øian regency, on the 15th of June 1796, for ≈øix months, expired on the 15th of December following. This truce had been obtained without any pre≈øents, by Mr. Famin the French agent at Tunis, who had been recommended to Mr. Barlow by the French con≈øul Herculais. Since its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration the American ve≈ø≈øels have been ≈øubject to capture by the Tuni≈øian cor≈øairs, and captain O'Brien, in his publication of April 5th, 1797, ≈øays, "I now tell you candidly, that no American ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel ≈øhould enter the Mediterranean until our peace with all the Barbary States is fully e≈øtabli≈øhed, and publi≈øhed by the authority of the United States." But with regard to the Tuni≈øian negociation, little apprehen≈øion is entertained, and it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Mr. Barlow, through the powerful interce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the dey, has already concluded a treaty with that government.</p>
               <p>At the conclu≈øion of the Algerine treaty, an univer≈øal joy diffu≈øed it≈øelf among the American pri≈øoners, and they triumphed in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anticipation of vi≈øiting their native ≈øhores again.

They had long been the victims of the mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated calamities, and become familiar with the gloomy pro≈øpect of death. They were haunted with the di≈ømal apprehen≈øions of a ≈øervitude for life, and hope, the plea≈øing illu≈øion that gilds the dark regions of adver≈øity, ≈øeemed fled for ever. To add to the catalogue of their mi≈øeries, the plague commenced its awful vi≈øitation; many of their companions fell a ≈øacrifice to this dreadful contagion, while others invoked the friendly hand of death to terminate their ≈øufferings and de≈øpair. When intelligence of the treaty was announced, the captives indulged the animated expectation of an immediate deliverance, and the ≈øudden tran≈øition from ≈øuch a dark ≈øtate of de≈øpondence, in≈øpired them with the mo≈øt ineffable joy. But the fatal delays occa≈øioned in the remittances of the nece≈ø≈øary ≈øums endangered the exi≈øtence of the treaty, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded the plea≈øing pro≈øpect. In con≈øequence of the≈øe unfortunate delays, which were principally owing to the convul≈øions in Europe, the captives were ≈øtill con≈øined at hard labour, and the period of their mi≈øery was unfortunately protracted from the 5th of September 1795, the time when the treaty was formed, till the 9th of July following, when the ≈øtipulated payments were made. Mr. Barlow then paid them a vi≈øit while they were at labour, and when he announced the plea≈øing intelligence to them, it was ≈øo unexpected that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The original number of the Americans was now reduced to 85. Many of them died with the plague, a few with the ≈ømall pox, and others with the ≈øeverity of the labour which had been impo≈øed upon them. Captain Wallace of Richmond met with an untimely death as he was leaning again≈øt the banni≈øters of an ancient building, which gave way, and he fell from a con≈øiderable height into the ≈øtreet, where he in≈øtantly expired. The plague raged with ≈øuch violence when the captives left Algiers that five of them died within a few weeks previous to their departure; another who was attacked by that fatal malady was left behind, and many others had their con≈øtitutions much injured by the di≈øorder. One of them was in a ≈øtate of total blindne≈øs, and another was rendered nearly ≈øo. Three of them carried the marks of unmerciful treatment, in ruptures produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by hard labour; ≈øeveral of them were render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incapable of gaining their living, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are objects of the benevolence of their countrymen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barlow was fully ≈øen≈øible of the nece≈ø≈øity of

their immediate removal from this mo≈øt wretched of all conceivable abodes, and was ju≈øtly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive that they could not be embarked without ≈øome danger of the infection. After his arrival he was mo≈øt ≈øedulou≈øly employed in effecting their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and by his benevolence, which was ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the captives, their condition was render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more tolerable, till the final obtainment of their liberty. To this worthy character, who≈øe heart vibrated with their finer feelings of philanthropy, while his life was in imminent danger, the mo≈øt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tribute of gratitude is due, and the captives ≈øpeak in terms of the warme≈øt affection for his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form exertions in re≈øcuing them from this region of horror.</p>
               <p>After preparing the nece≈ø≈øary articles for their voyage, the Americans ≈øet ≈øail, with the 48 Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, in the ≈øhip La Fortune, under the command of capt. Calder, and ≈øoon bade an eternal adieu to the land of bondage.</p>
               <p>While the≈øe things were tran≈øacting, the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines were pro≈øecuting their piracies again≈øt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maritime powers in Europe. An attempt at ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation between the "invincible militia" and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal was in≈øtituted in November 1793, and a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugue≈øe frigate was di≈øpatched to Algiers upon this bu≈øine≈øs. The terms pre≈øcribed by the dey were, 1,200,000 Mexican dollars for the trea≈øury; 600,000 dollars for the voice of the dey, and the great officers of the regency, amba≈ø≈øadorial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øular pre≈øents, equal to what Spain gave; and the payment of 150,000 dollars for the redemption of 75 Portugue≈øe captains. With the≈øe propo≈øitions the Portugue≈øe frigate ≈øet ≈øail from Algiers the 7th of November, and arrived at Li≈øbon ≈øoon after. But upon further con≈øideration the dey was not ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

with this ≈øum, and the next day he de≈øired capt.

O'Brien, dated at Algiers, the 28th of November 1793. When the American captives were informed that capt. O'Brien had publi≈øhed this exorbitant demand upon the Portugue≈øe, they were highly offended, and arraigned the precipitancy of the publication; becau≈øe ≈øuch di≈øcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms would have a tendency to retard, if not total<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Dutch truce expired on the 10th of December 1793. But a peace was concluded in April follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all the Dutch pri≈øoners were liberated. The principal powers with which the Algerines are now at war, are the Portugue≈øe and the Pope. They declared war again≈øt the republic of Venice on the 26th of October 1796, the i≈ø≈øue of which we have not heard. But with France, Spain, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and America they now are at peace.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of 1796, the affairs of the Danes a≈ø≈øumed a very di≈øa≈øterous complexion. One of the Neapolitan crui≈øers had taken a Dani≈øh ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel freighted with 300 Turks, who were bound from the Levant to Algiers.

but their cargoes, which con≈øi≈øted chiefly of peri≈øhable articles, were mo≈øtly de≈øtroyed.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of 1795, upwards of 200 Cor≈øicans were captured as they were ≈øeeking for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral off the Barbary coa≈øts. While they were bu≈øily employed in a number of fi≈øhing boats, under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of an Engli≈øh brig<note n="*" place="bottom">It mu≈øt be remembered here that Cor≈øica was one of the <hi>pearls</hi> in his Brit≈øh Maje≈øty's crown; but it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evacuated by the Briti≈øh.</note>, two French frigates hove in ≈øight, and ≈øoon after a ≈ømart engagement took place between the French, and the Engli≈øh brig; but ≈øhe was ≈øoon captured, and the Cor≈øican boats fled for refuge to the Barbary ≈øhore near Con≈øtantina, where they were all kidnapped by the Moors, and taken to Algiers, where they were made ≈ølaves. After they had amu≈øed them≈øelves among the rocks of Bublywhite for about a year, Mr. North was ≈øent as Briti≈øh agent to negociate their ran≈øom, and he procured their liberty upon the payment of about 120,000 dollars, be≈øides the promi≈øe of an armed ve≈ø≈øel.</p>
               <p>Some time in September 1796, the Engli≈øh ≈øent in a French xebeck of incon≈øiderable value, lately made a prize, which di≈øplea≈øed the dey ≈øo much that he ordered her immediately out of the port. The commanders of two Engli≈øh frigates which then lay off the harbour, highly re≈øenting this piece of conduct, hauled their ve≈ø≈øels clo≈øe in under the ca≈øtle on the mole, and prepared to pour a broad ≈øide into the city. When the dey ob≈øerved the≈øe preparations, he was thrown into the mo≈øt violent con≈øternation; the ≈ølaves were immediately ordered to clear away the lumber in the ca≈øtle, and to get the guns in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈øs for defence. At the ≈øame time the fleet of Admiral Jervis, con≈øi≈øting of 25 ≈øail of the line
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032877_0047_0FF5A88D16110C40"/>
was crui≈øing off the harbour, and from this force, the dey expected nothing le≈øs than the total de≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Algiers. At this critical juncture he made application to Mr. Barlow to u≈øe his influence with the Briti≈øh commanders, to di≈ø≈øu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the heat of the engagement all the officers were killed, and the captain had both his legs carried away by a chain ≈øhot, as he was firing a blunderbu≈øs; yet the barbarian ≈øtill refu≈øed to be taken from the deck, and died while he was giving the word of command. This lo≈øs did not in the lea≈øt intimidate the furious crew, who ≈øwore they would not ≈øubmit while a ≈øingle man exi≈øted.

which made the greate≈øt impre≈ø≈øion upon the cor≈øair, blew up with a tremendous explo≈øion, and mo≈øt of the crew peri≈øhed.</p>
               <p>In a ≈øhort time another di≈øa≈øter occurred. The Pope's crui≈øer, after a gallant re≈øi≈øtance, was ≈øunk by the enemy's ≈øhot.

at Marcus Hook, where the ve≈ø≈øel was detained by the ice which was then in the Delaware. On the 8th of February 1797, they were brought to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia in carriages, e≈øcorted by many hundreds of their fellow citizens who went out to meet them. Upon their arrival at the Indian Queen tavern, the ≈øtreets were ≈øo thronged as to render their pa≈ø≈øage difficult, and as they entered the hou≈øe, an ardent acclamation expre≈ø≈øed the ≈øatisfaction of the people at their return.

                              <p>March 7, 1795. The Pre≈øident of the Bank re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Baring and Co. 800,000 dollars in certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of 6 per cent ≈øtock, with orders to ≈øell the ≈øame without cau≈øing a depre≈ø≈øion in the prices, and thus injuring the credit of American funds. The net proceeds, after deducting the u≈øual commi≈ø≈øions, are to be held at the di≈øpo≈øal of Col. David Humphreys;
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032877_0052_0FF5A8A2CFC99488"/>
and we are directed to inform Col. Humphreys of the progre≈øs we may make, from time to time, in the ≈øales of the ≈øtock, and al≈øo of the terms upon which remittances can be made to Cadiz or Leghorn. This contains nearly the whole of our orders, or at lea≈øt the whole of what we conceive to be nece≈ø≈øary for the information of Mr. King, in the pre≈øent moment; the further letters from America being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt wholly an≈øwers to our numerous letters, and do not contain a ≈øyllable of di≈øapprobation with regard to our conduct, but the rever≈øe.</p>
                              <p>March 31. Col. Humphrey writes from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, that we would furni≈øh him with information, a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, &amp;c. directed to him at Li≈øbon.</p>
                              <p>April 28. We wrote very fully to Col. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys, communicating every information relative to the probable ≈øale of the ≈øtock, and the various means by which he could execute his commi≈ø≈øion through London, Cadiz, Li≈øbon, and Italy in general.</p>
                              <p>May 19. We wrote ≈øtill more fully, in an≈øwer to his letter of the 31≈øt March, wherein we offered to anticipate a con≈øiderable ≈øum, on the value of the effects in our hands, for which there was no demand at the moment. We explained to him the value of the Italian coin, tho≈øe of Spain being well known; mentioning that it was ea≈øier to procure money at Leghorn, where there was no re≈øtraint, than at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz where dollars were more plentiful, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation was exclu≈øively in the bank of St. Charles, from whom it was difficult to obtain permi≈ø≈øion. That we could procure any quantity in London: to which we added the names of our corre≈øpondents at the different places, offering every ≈øervice in our power, direct or indirect.</p>
                              <p>May. 18. Col. Humphreys advi≈øes his arrival at Gibraltar.</p>
                              <p>

July 21. We advi≈øe Colonel Humphreys that we had ≈øold, 300,000 dollars:‚Äîthat we were ready to pay 100,000, to his order; and if he wanted a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øum, we de≈øired to be informed.</p>
                              <p>July 27. Colonel Humphrey directs us to pay 40,000 dollars to Mr. Deas, for Mr. Andrews, which was immediately complied with, by a credit on Hamburgh, for that value.</p>
                              <p>July 30. We inform Colonel Humphreys that having made further progre≈øs in our ≈øales, we ≈øhould hold the whole of the value of the 800,000 dollars at his di≈øpo≈øal: meaning to furni≈øh, by anticipation, the value of that part which remained at that time un≈øold, if the ≈øervice of the United States requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</p>
                              <p>November 28. Is the next letter from Colonel Humphreys, and the commencement of our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;‚Äîhe informs us, that he ≈øhould ≈øend the Sophia, for the purpo≈øe of receiving Portugal gold and Spani≈øh dollars, in London, to the amount of 650,000 Spani≈øh dollars. He further opens credit in favour of Me≈ø≈ørs. Dohrman, of Li≈øbon, which from the ≈øcarcity of paper at the time was effected to a very trifling amount.</p>
                              <p>This letter was followed and confirmed by others from Colonel Humphreys, dated the 16th, 22d, and 24th December, of a ≈øimilar tenor, or very nearly ≈øo, and the arrival of the brig Sophia from Li≈øbon.</p>
                              <p>Although Col. Humphreys has not mentioned to us the rea≈øons of this proceeding, we may impute it to the advice contained in our letter of the 19th May, and indeed the well known facility with which a ≈øum of that de≈øcription could be procured in London, of Spani≈øh dollars, having our≈øelves never experienced the lea≈øt difficulty in di≈øappointments for large ≈øums.</p>

December 22. We an≈øwered the≈øe letters, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing Colonel Humphreys of the impo≈ø≈øibility to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Portugal gold, none having been received for many years. Of the extraordinary turn which had appeared with regard to bullion, in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the immen≈øe drains upon this country, for carrying on the war, and which has finally compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the mini≈øter to abandon his favorite project of a ≈øecond loan to the emperor; but as the difficulty had only begun to appear, we hoped that with ≈øome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, we ≈øhould be able to collect the dollars for the purpo≈øe of executing the orders of Col. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys.</p>
                              <p>Jan. 17, 1796. Finding it impo≈ø≈øible to procure gold, and no ≈øilver arriving, we ≈øubmitted the whole of the orders and corre≈øpondence to Mr. Pinckney; when it was determined to purcha≈øe ≈øuch ≈øilver as might arrive; but, at all events, to detain the Sophia, which could not be wrong, as the we≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds would have prevented her ≈øailing.</p>
                              <p>In the mean while we wrote to Me≈ø≈ørs. Pari≈øh and Co. of Hamburgh, to know whether Portugal gold or Spani≈øh dollars could be obtained in that place.</p>
                              <p>January 19. 26‚ÄîFebruary 2, 12. Are letters we wrote to Colonel Humphreys, wherein we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with our pro≈øpects, from time to time, that Pari≈øh and Co. gave us rea≈øon to hope for the execution of a part of the order, but that no ≈øilver had arrived in London.</p>
                              <p>February 16. Having determined, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Mr. Pinckney, to ≈øend the Sophia to Hamburg, in con≈øequence of the encouragement of Me≈ø≈ørs. Pari≈øh and Co. on applying to capt.

                              <p>On this occa≈øion, and under this date, we wrote to Colonel Humphreys, by the brig Sophia, and by the packet, acquainting him with our di≈øappointment in toto; which we accompanied, at the intimation of Mr. O'Brien, with letters of credit on Madrid and Cadiz; and, in order to fini≈øh this part of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as a ju≈øtification for permitting the Sophia to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, we ≈øhould ob≈øerve, that if ≈øhe had been detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ≈øix months, we could not have procured one half of the quantity of Spani≈øh dollars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                              <p>March 1. We advi≈øed Colonel Humphreys that we had received a large ≈øum in bills, drawn from Leghorn, on the Briti≈øh government; being for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ≈øent to Algiers, and which appeared afterwards to be for the relea≈øe of the Cor≈øican pri≈øoners.</p>
                              <p>March 21,‚Äî29. Are an≈øwers to letters from Col. Humphreys, relative to our accounts, chiefly dated the 27th February, and 9th March, which we do not notice, concluding that he was ≈øatisfied, as nothing appears in reply to us; but as there was rea≈øon to fear the bu≈øine≈øs could not be executed in Spain, the government there refu≈øing a licence, notwith≈øtanding the endeavors of Me≈ø≈ørs.

                              <p>April 1. We wrote to Me≈ø≈ørs. Fonnereau, of Leghorn, not only to open the nece≈ø≈øary credit, but to explain to them, in a full and confidential manner, the nature and extent of our preceding di≈øappointments; reque≈øting (with the approbation of

Mr. Pinckney and Col.

                              <p>It is unnece≈ø≈øary to quote dates of letters, as there appears but one opinion on the ≈øubject, namely, "that the bu≈øine≈øs mu≈øt finally be done at Leghorn, and both Mr. Pinckney and Col.

                              <p>June 17. Fonnereau advi≈øe the delivery to them, on that day, of the orders from Col. Humphreys, to pay to the order of Mr. Donald≈øon, 400,000 Spani≈øh milled dollars, which they acquaint him ≈øhall be immediately complied.</p>
                              <p>June 19. Mr. Donald≈øon acquaints Me≈ø≈ørs. Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereau, that he ≈øhould accept the ≈øum; and on a meeting between them and‚Äî, the price of the dollars, with that of Agio, was ≈øettled to the ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of‚Äî</p>

                              <p>June 27. The French entered Leghorn, and Fonnereau embarked on board an Engli≈øh frigate.</p>

                  <p>THIS country con≈øi≈øts of eighteen provinces, the climate of which, along the ≈øea-coa≈øts, is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly delightful, and the air pure and ≈øerene.</p>
                  <p>The country of Algiers, and the ≈øtates of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary in general, under the Roman empire were ju≈øtly denominated the garden of the world; and to have a re≈øidence there was con≈øidered as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ≈øtate of luxury.

                  <p>The ≈øoil is covered with almo≈øt a perpetual ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and is extremely fertile, particularly on the mountainous parts to the we≈øt of Tenez, Bugia, and Algiers Proper, which produce wheat and fruit in the greate≈øt perfection; and the northern parts of Treme≈øen, towards the ≈øea, abound in excellent pa≈øture grounds, But as we advance into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it becomes more parched and barren.</p>
                  <p>Though the lands are now uncultivated, through the barbarity and oppre≈ø≈øion of their government, yet they ≈øtill produce not only corn, wine, and oil

in the greate≈øt abundance, but dates, rai≈øins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, apples, pears, cherries, plums, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, &amp;c. and plenty of roots and herbs grow in their kitchen gardens.

                  <p>Extreme heat is not common, and the climate is ≈øo temperate that the heat of ≈øummer never dries the leaves of the trees, nor the cold of winter makes them fall; ≈øo that they are con≈øtantly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. In February they begin to bud, and in May ≈øhew their fruit in full growth, which is ripe in June. Their vines are very large and thick, and the bunches of grapes on them are commonly a foot and an half long. The grapes are fit to gather in June, and the figs, peaches, nectarines, olives, nuts, &amp;c. in Augu≈øt. The people find means to evade the sobriety pre≈øcribed by the Mahometan law, and make free with excellent wines and ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their own growth and manufacture. The plains of Moligia produce wheat, barley and oats, two or three times a year. Their melons are of an exqui≈øite-ta≈øte; ≈øome of which ripen in ≈øummer, and others in winter. Algiers produces be≈øides, ≈øalt-petre, and great quantities of excellent ≈øalt; and lead and iron have been found in ≈øeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>The country round the city of Algiers is very fertile. Country ≈øeats, gardens and groves of trees are numerous.

                  <p>Below him ≈øits the Baleck ba≈øhaw, who is a kind of bailiff to execute his commands. He takes charge of the magazines of the marine; all naval articles are under his in≈øpection, and the keys of all the magazines in the town are entru≈øted to his care.</p>
                  <p>The Hojee of the Rap has the charge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of wheat in the town; under him are ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inferior hojees who execute his orders. No ≈ølave can ri≈øe higher than this office.</p>
                  <p>The Warden Ba≈øhaw is the next inferior officer. He is chief over≈øeer of the ≈ølaves, and takes care that they duly perform their duty. He has charge of the Bagnio Gallaro, the keys of which are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>Be≈øides the≈øe there are 30 chiahs, or chows, a kind of high con≈øtables, who ≈øit next to the aga in the divan, and in the ≈øame gallery with him. Out of this cla≈øs are generally cho≈øen tho≈øe who go em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors to foreign courts, or who di≈øper≈øe the dey's orders throughout the realm. Next to them are a number of baleck-ba≈øhaws, or elde≈øt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who are promoted to that of chiah ba≈øhaws, according to their ≈øeniority. The oldack-ba≈øhaws, or lieutenants, are next; who amount to 400, and are regularly rai≈øed to the rank of captains in their turn, and to other employments in the ≈øtate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilities. The≈øe by way of di≈øtinction wear a leather ≈øtrap, hanging down to the middle of their back. One rule is ≈øtrickly ob≈øerved in the rotation of the≈øe troops from one deputy to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the right of ≈øeniority; one ≈øingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of which would cau≈øe an in≈øurrection, and probably co≈øt the dey his life.</p>
                  <p>The other military officers of note are vekelards, or purveyors of the army; the peys, who are the four olde≈øt ≈øoldiers, and con≈øequently the neare≈øt to preferment; the foulacks, who are the next in ≈øeniority to them, and are part of the dey's body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, always marching before him when he takes the field, and di≈øtingui≈øhed by their carbines and gilt ≈øcymitars, with a bra≈øs gun on their caps; the kayts, or Turki≈øh ≈øoldiers, each band of whom have the government of one or more adowars, or itenerant villages, and collect their taxes for the dey; and the ≈øagiards, or Turki≈øh lancemen, 100 of whom always attend the army, and watch over the water appointed for it. To the≈øe we may add
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032877_0078_0FF5A914A6603418"/>
the beys, or governors of the three great provinces of the realm. All the above-mentioned officers ought to compo≈øe the great divan: but only the 30 chiah-ba≈øhaws have a right to ≈øit in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery next after the dey. The re≈øt are obliged to ≈øtand on the floor of the hall, or council-chamber, with their arms acro≈øs, and, as much as po≈ø≈øible, without motion; neither are they permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their ≈øwords on. As for tho≈øe who have any matters to tran≈øact with the divan, they mu≈øt ≈øtand without, let the weather be ever ≈øo bad; and there they are commonly pre≈øented with coffee by ≈øome of the inferior officers, till they are di≈ømi≈ø≈øed.</p>
                  <p>The Li≈øberos are the dey's ≈øpies, who keep watch in different parts of the town, for the purpo≈øe of obtaining information of what is ≈øaid or tran≈øacted. They are perhaps the mo≈øt mercenary and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ≈øet of beings in exi≈øtence, and ≈øuch is their ≈øervility to their ≈øovereign, that they would betray even their own fathers. When they lodge informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again≈øt any per≈øon, the chows are ≈øent to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt the delinquent, and he is puni≈øhed according to his crime.</p>
                  <p>The divan, or douwan, is the common council of the nation. It is an elective body, and is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally compo≈øed of 30 chiah-ba≈øhaws, with now and then the mufti and cadi upon ≈øome emergencies; and on the election of a dey the whole ≈øoldiery are allowed to come in and give their votes. All the regulations of ≈øtate ought to be determined by this a≈ø≈øembly, before they pa≈øs into a law, or the dey has power to put them in execution. But, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years back, the divan is of ≈øo little account that it is only convened out of formality, and to give a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to what the dey and his favourites have previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly concerted. They, however, arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032877_0079_0FF5A922EE110F70"/>
the whole power of the ≈øtate, and in their edicts or national ordinances they a≈ø≈øume the pompous title of, "We the great and ≈ømall members of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and invincible militia of Algiers and of the whole kingdom, do ordain," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All cau≈øes whether civil or criminal, in which the ≈øoldiers are concerned, are tried in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but tho≈øe between the citizens are decided before one of the chiah-ba≈øhaws, and the plaintiffs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants always plead their own cau≈øes without the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of attornies. The evidence of two witne≈ø≈øes is always required, and he who is ca≈øt upon any trial receives a number of blows with a cudgel, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled be≈øides to comply with the ≈øentence that has been pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
                  <p>While the divan are convened the dey holds a fan of feathers in his hand, and ≈øits cro≈øs-legged, after the manner of taylors, upon a large table about two feet high, covered with a ≈øhaggy carpet. Six of the principal chiahs are ≈øeated in the ≈øame manner on his right, and ≈øix on his left. The re≈øt of the members ≈øtand at both ends of the table, and form a kind of circle.</p>
                  <p>The method of gathering votes in this augu≈øt a≈ø≈øembly is perfectly agreeable to the character of tho≈øe who compo≈øe it. The aga, or the pre≈øident <hi>pro tempore,</hi> fir≈øt propo≈øes the que≈øtion; which is immediately repeated with a loud voice by the chiah-ba≈øhaws, and from them echoed again by four officers called <hi>ba≈øhaldalas;</hi> from the≈øe the que≈øtion is repeated from one member of the divan to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ≈øtrange contortions, and the mo≈øt hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous growlings, if it is not to their liking. From the loudne≈øs of this growling noi≈øe the aga is left to gue≈øs, as well as he can, whether the majority of the a≈ø≈øembly are plea≈øed or di≈øplea≈øed with the

As the whole body of the militia is concerned in the election of a new dey, it is ≈øeldom carried on without blows and blood≈øhed: but when once the choice is made, the per≈øon elected is ≈øaluted with the words <hi>Alla Barick,</hi> "God ble≈øs and pro≈øper you:" and the new dey u≈øually cau≈øes all the officers of the divan who had oppo≈øed his election to be ≈øtrangled, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up their places with tho≈øe who had been mo≈øt zealous in promoting it. It is true it mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Porte; but that is ≈øeldom refu≈øed, as the di≈øpo≈øitions of the people are ≈øo well known.</p>
                  <p>From this account of the election of the deys, it cannot be expected that their government ≈øhould be at all ≈øecure; and as they arrive at the throne by tumult and blood≈øhed they are generally deprived of it by the ≈øame means, ≈øcarcely one in ten of them having the good fortune to die a natural death.</p>

                  <p>THE Algerines pay but little attention to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the improvement of their country, and their ≈øingular genius leads them ≈øo much to the profe≈ø≈øion or piracy that they neglect all internal re≈øources or advantages that might be derived from their own country. The cor≈øairs or pirates form each a ≈ømall republic, of which the rais or captain is the ≈øupreme ba≈øhaw; who with the officers under him, form a kind of divan, in which every matter relative to the ve≈ø≈øels is decided in an arbitrary way. The≈øe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øairs are chiefly in≈øtrumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by

way of merchandize or prizes. The≈øe con≈øi≈øt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of gold and ≈øilver ≈øtuffs, dama≈øks, cloths, ≈øpices, tin, iron, plated bra≈øs, lead, quick≈øilver, cordage, ≈øailcloth, bullets, cochineal, linen, tartar, allum, rice, ≈øugar, ≈øoap, cotton raw and ≈øpun, copperas, aloes, brazil and logwood, vermilion, &amp;c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world: the oil, wax, hides, pul≈øe, and corn produced, being but barely ≈øufficient to ≈øupply the country; though, before the lo≈øs of Oran, the merchants have been known to ≈øhip off from one or other the ports of Barbary ≈øeveral thou≈øand tons of corn. The con≈øumption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewi≈øe ≈øo con≈øiderable in this kingdom, that it is ≈øeldom permitted to be ≈øhipped off for Europe.</p>
                  <p>The other exports con≈øi≈øt chiefly in o≈øtriches' fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, copper, ruggs, ≈øilk ≈øa≈øhes, embroidered hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs, dates, and Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves. Some manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures in ≈øilk, cotton, wool, leather, &amp;c. are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in this country, but mo≈øtly by the Spaniards ≈øettled here, e≈øpecially about the metropolis. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are al≈øo a manufacture of the country, which, though much inferior to tho≈øe of Turkey both in beauty and finene≈øs, are preferred by the people to lie upon, on account of their being both cheaper and ≈øofter. There are al≈øo at Algiers looms for velvet, taffaties, and other wrought ≈øilks; and a coar≈øe ≈øort of linen is likewi≈øe made in mo≈øt parts of the kingdom. The country furni≈øhes no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for ≈øhip-building. They have neither ropes, tar, ≈øails, anchors, nor even iron. When they can procure enough of new wood of form the main tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a ≈øhip, they ≈øupply the re≈øt from the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of prizes which they have made, and thus find the ≈øecret of producing new and ≈øwift ≈øailing ve≈ø≈øels

from the ruins of the old. The Algerines are more formidable at ≈øea than any other nation on the coa≈øt of Barbary, and the ≈øea-faring people are held in great e≈øteem for the prizes they capture.</p>
                  <p>The fleet of this regency at pre≈øent does not amount to more than ten or eleven ≈øail of the line, though they were formerly much more powerful, and in the time of Pinchinin their fleet amounted to 65 ≈øail of the line. At ≈øea they have been regarded as the mo≈øt de≈øperate and ferocious ≈øet of beings in the world. But this ≈øeems a fal≈øe prejudice that nations have imbibed, and according to recent accounts they are inferior in naval tactics to every nation in Europe. Almo≈øt all our late captives concur in the opinion that four American frigates, well manned and di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, would be a force ≈øufficient to reduce them. Though the Turks are ≈øo proud and arrogant, yet it is well known that they are no warriors. Their greate≈øt di≈øplay of bravery is at the fir≈øt on≈øet, but if they meet with a ≈øpirited reception from a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent force their vanqui≈øhment is certain. Even the Moors, though they are an illiterate barbarous race, are ≈øuperior warriors to the Turks. In their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øairs the mo≈øt ≈øervile part of the duty is a≈ø≈øigned to the Moors, while the Turks ≈øpend their time in ≈ømo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and in indolence, except when they come to an engagement with an enemy, when they fight with ≈ømall arms and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Since the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the independence of North America we owe the ≈øecurity of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in a great mea≈øure to the wars that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øted between the Algerines, the Portugue≈øe, and the Dutch, either of which nations is much ≈øuperior

                  <p>Mahomet, or Mohammed, ≈øtyled, the <hi>Impo≈øtor,</hi> was born about the end of the 6th century of the Chri≈øtian aera. He came into the world under many di≈øadvantages.

Abd'almotaleb was therefore obliged to take care of his grandchild Mahomet; which he not only did during his life, but at his death enjoined his elde≈øt ≈øon Abu Taleb, who was brother to Abd'allah by the ≈øame mother, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for him for the future, which he very affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately did, and in≈øtructed him in the bu≈øine≈øs of a merchant, which he followed; and to that end he
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032877_0085_0FF5A939B83AF560"/>
took him into Syria when he was but thirteen years old. He afterwards recommended him to Khadijah, a rich widow, for her factor, in who≈øe ≈øervice he behaved him≈øelf ≈øo well, that by making him her hu≈øband ≈øhe ≈øoon rai≈øed him to an equality with the riche≈øt in Mecca.</p>
                  <p>After he began by this advantageous match to live at his ea≈øe, he formed the ≈øcheme of e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new religion, or, as he expre≈ø≈øed it, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting the only true and ancient one profe≈ø≈øed by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Mo≈øes, Je≈øus, and all the prophets, by de≈øtroying the gro≈øs idolatry into which the generality of his countrymen had fallen, and weeding out the corruptions and ≈øuper≈øtitions which the latter Jews and Chri≈øtians had, as he thought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into their religion, and reducing it to its primitive purity, which con≈øi≈øted chiefly in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of one God.</p>
                  <p>Before he made any attempt abroad, he rightly judged that it was nece≈ø≈øary for him to begin with the conver≈øion of his own hou≈øehold. Having therefore retired with his family, as he had done ≈øeveral times before, to a cave in mount Hara, he there opened the ≈øecret of his mi≈ø≈øion to his wife Khadijah; and acquainted her that the angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel had ju≈øt before appeared to him, and told him that he was appointed the apo≈øtle of God. Khadijah received the news with great joy: ≈øwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him in who≈øe hands her ≈øoul was, that ≈øhe tru≈øted he would be the prophet of his nation.</p>
                  <p>Encouraged by ≈øo good a beginning, he re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed, and try for ≈øome time what he could do by private per≈øua≈øion; not daring to hazard the whole affair by expo≈øing it too ≈øuddenly to the public.</p>

This was done, and about 40 of them came; but Abu Laheb, one of his uncles, making the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany break up before Mahomet had an opportunity of ≈øpeaking, obliged him to give them a ≈øecond invitation the next day; and when they were come, he made the following ≈øpeech to them; "I know no man in all Arabia who can offer his kindred a more excellent thing than I now do to you; I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you happine≈øs both in this life, and that which is to come; God Almighty hath commanded me to call you unto him: Who, therefore, among you will be a≈ø≈øi≈øtant to me herein, and become my brother and my vicegerant?"

<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032877_0086_0FF5A93B41AA99538"/>
at which all the company broke out into a great laughter.</p>
                  <p>This repul≈øe, however, was ≈øo far from di≈øcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mahomet, that he began to preach in public to the people, who heard him with ≈øome patience till he came to upbraid them with the idolatry and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øene≈øs of them≈øelves and their fathers: which ≈øo exa≈øperated them, that they declared them≈øelves his enemies; and would ≈øoon have accompli≈øhed his ruin had he not been protected by Abu Taleb. The chief of the Korei≈øh threatened him with an open rupture if he did not prevail on Mahomet to de≈øi≈øt. At this Abu Taleb was ≈øo far moved, that he earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øtly di≈ø≈øuaded his nephew from pur≈øuing the affair any farther, repre≈øenting the great danger of ≈øuch an undertaking. But Mahomet was not to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated, and told his uncle plainly, <hi>that if they ≈øet the ≈øun again≈øt him on his right hand, and the moon on his left, he would not leave his enterpri≈øe.</hi> Abu Taleb ≈øeeing him ≈øo firmly re≈øolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, u≈øed no further arguments, but promi≈øed to ≈øtand by him again≈øt all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Korei≈øh, finding they could neither prevail by fair words, nor by menaces, tried what they could do by force and ill treatment; u≈øing Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met's followers ≈øo very injuriou≈øly, that it was not ≈øafe for them to continue at Mecca any longer; whereupon Mahomet gave leave to ≈øuch of them as had not friends to protect them, to ≈øeek for refuge el≈øewhere.</p>
                  <p>In the ≈øixth year of his mi≈ø≈øion, Mahomet had the plea≈øure of ≈øeeing his party ≈øtrengthened by the conver≈øion of his uncle Hamza, and Omar Ebn al Kattab, who was at fir≈øt a violent oppo≈øer of the prophet.

<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032877_0087_0FF5A94ACA8705C8"/>
made ≈øo great a progre≈øs among the Arab tribes, that the Korei≈øh, to ≈øuppre≈øs it effectually if po≈ø≈øible, in the ≈øeventh year of Mahomet's mi≈ø≈øion, made a ≈øolemn league again≈øt the Ha≈øhemites and the family of Abd'almotaleb, engaging them≈øelves to contract no marriages with any of them; and to give it the greater ≈øanction, reduced it into wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and laid it up in the Caaba.</p>
                  <p>The families in con≈øequence continued at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for three years; but in the 10th year of his mi≈ø≈øion Mahomet told his uncle Abu Taleb, that God had manife≈øtly ≈øhewed his di≈øapprobation of the league which the Korei≈øh had made again≈øt them, by ≈øending a worm to eat out every word of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument except the name of <hi>God.</hi> Of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Mahomet had probably ≈øome private notice: for Abu Taleb went immediately to the Korei≈øh, and acquainted them with it; offering, if it proved fal≈øe, to deliver his nephew up to them; but in ca≈øe if were true, he in≈øi≈øted that they ought to lay a≈øide their animo≈øity, and annul the league they had made again≈øt the Ha≈øhemites. To this they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie≈øced; and going to in≈øpect the writing, to their great a≈øtoni≈øhment found it to be as Abu Taleb had ≈øaid; and the league was thereupon declared void.</p>
                  <p>In the ≈øame year Abu Taleb died at the age of above four≈øcore; and about a month, or, as ≈øome write, three days after his death, Mahomet had the additional mortification to lo≈øe his wife, who had ≈øo generou≈øly made his fortune. For which rea≈øon this year is called <hi>the year of mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the death of the≈øe two per≈øons, the Korei≈øh began to be more trouble≈øome than ever to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in≈øomuch that he found him≈øelf obliged to ≈øeek for ≈øhelter at Tayef, where he applied him≈øelf to two of the chief of the tribe of Thakif, who then

were the inhabitants of that place; but they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very coldly: and he was ≈øoon afterwards obliged to depart from thence and return to Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where he put him≈øelf under the protection of the Al Motaam Ebn Adi.</p>
                  <p>This repul≈øe greatly di≈øcouraged his followers: but Mahomet notwith≈øtanding boldly continued to preach to the public a≈ø≈øemblies at the pilgrimage, and gained many pro≈øelytes among them.</p>
                  <p>In the 12th year of his mi≈ø≈øion Mahomet gave out that he made his night-journey from Mecca to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem, and from thence to heaven, ≈øo much ≈øpoken of by all that write of him.</p>
                  <p>This ≈øtory ≈øeemed ≈øo ridiculous that ≈øeveral of his followers left him in con≈øequence, and would probably have ruined the whole de≈øign, had not, Abu Beker vouched for his veracity, and declared, that if Mahomet affirmed it to be true, he verily believed him. Which happy incident not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved the prophet's credit, but encrea≈øed it to ≈øuch a degree, that he was afterwards able to make his di≈øciples ≈øwallow whatever he plea≈øed to impo≈øe on them. This fiction, notwith≈øtanding its extravagance, was one of the mo≈øt artful contrivances Mahomet ever devi≈øed, and what chiefly contributed to the rai≈øing of his reputation to that great height to which it afterwards arrived.</p>
                  <p>In this year, called by the Mahometans <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted year,</hi> twelve men of Yathreb or Medina, came to Mecca, and took an oath of fidelity to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet at al Akaba, a hill on the north of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; after which Mahomet ≈øent one of his di≈øciples, named Ma≈øab Ebn Omair, home with them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct them more fully in the grounds and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his new religion.</p>

Ma≈øab being arrived at Medina, by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of tho≈øe who had been formerly converted, gained ≈øeveral pro≈øelytes, and Mahometani≈øm was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ≈øo rapidly that there was ≈øcarce a hou≈øe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were not ≈øome who had embraced it.</p>
                  <p>The next year, being the 13th of Mahomet's mi≈ø≈øion, Ma≈øab returned to Mecca, accompanied by 73 men and two women of Medina, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Mahomet their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, which he readily accepted; as he was in the mo≈øt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from his powerful adver≈øaries in Mecca. Out of this number Mahomet cho≈øe twelve per≈øons, who were to have the ≈øame authority among them as the <hi>twelve</hi> apo≈øtles of Chri≈øt had among his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

run much ri≈øk; from whence, ≈øays Machiavel, it follows, that all the armed prophets have ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the unarmed ones have failed.</p>
                  <p>That Mahomet had a right to take up arms for his own-defence, may perhaps be allowed; but whether he ought afterwards to have e≈øtabli≈øhed his religion by compul≈øion is not ≈øo ea≈øy to determine. Having provided for the ≈øecurity of his companions as well as his own, by the league offen≈øive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen≈øive which he had now concluded with tho≈øe of Medina, he directed them to repair thither, which they accordingly did; but he him≈øelf, with Abu Beker and Ali ≈øtaid behind, having not yet receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the divine permi≈ø≈øion, as he pretended, to leave Mecca. The Korei≈øh, fearing the con≈øequence of this new alliance, began to think it ab≈øolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to prevent Mahomet's e≈øcape to Medina; and having held a council thereon, they came to a re≈øolution that he ≈øhould be killed: and agreed that a man ≈øhould be cho≈øen out of every tribe for the execution of this de≈øign; each of whom ≈øhould have a blow at him with his ≈øword, that the guilt of his blood might fall equally on all the tribes, to who≈øe united power the Ha≈øhemites were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, and therefore dur≈øt not attempt to revenge their kin≈øman's death.</p>
                  <p>This con≈øpiracy was ≈øcarcely formed, before it came to Mahomet's knowledge; and he gave out that it was revealed to him by the angel Gabriel, who had now ordered him to retire to Medina. Whereupon, to amu≈øe his enemies, he directed Ali to lie down in his place, and wrap him≈øelf up in his green cloak, which he did; and Mahomet e≈øcaped miraculou≈øly, as they pretend, to Abu Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's hou≈øe, unperceived by the con≈øpirators, who had already a≈ø≈øembled at the prophet's door.

in the mean time, looking through the crevice, and ≈øeeing Ali, whom they took to be Mahomet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf a≈øleep, continued watching there till morning, when Ali aro≈øe, and they found them≈øelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>From Abu Beker's hou≈øe Mahomet and he went to a cave in mount Thur, to the ≈øouth-ea≈øt of Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where they lay hid three days to avoid the ≈øearch of their enemies; which they very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly e≈øcaped, and not without the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of more miracles than one: for ≈øome ≈øay that the Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei≈øh were ≈øtruck with blindne≈øs, ≈øo that they could not find the cave; others, that after Mahomet and his attendants were got in, two pigeons laid their eggs at the entrance, and a ≈øpider covered the mouth of the cave with her web, which made them look no further. Abu Beker, ≈øeeing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in imminent danger, became very ≈øorrowful; whereupon Mahomet comforted him with the≈øe words recorded in the Koran, <hi>Be not grieved, for God is with us.</hi> Their enemies being retired, they left the cave, and ≈øet out for Medina, by a by-road; and having fortunately e≈øcaped ≈øome who were ≈øent to pur≈øue them, arrived ≈øafely at that city; whither Ali followed them in three days, after he had ≈øettled ≈øome affairs at Mecca.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt thing Mahomet did after his arrival at Medina, was to build a temple for his religious wor≈øhip, and a hou≈øe of his own accommodation.</p>
                  <p>After being ≈øecurely ≈øettled there, and able not only to defend him≈øelf again≈øt the in≈øults of his enemies, but to attack them, he began to ≈øend out ≈ømall parties to make repri≈øals on the Korei≈øh; the fir≈øt party con≈øi≈øting of no more than nine men, who intercepted and plundered a caravan belonging to that tribe, and in the action took two pri≈øoners.

what e≈øtabli≈øhed his affairs very much, and was the foundation on which he built his ≈øucceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, was the gaining the battle of Beder, which was fought in the ≈øecond year of the Hegira, and is famous in the Mahometan hi≈øtory. Some reckon no le≈øs than twenty-≈øeven expeditions wherein Mahomet was per≈øonally pre≈øent, in nine of which he gave battle, be≈øides ≈øeveral other expeditions in which he was not pre≈øent. His forces he maintained partly by the contributions of his followers for this purpo≈øe, which he called by the name of <hi>zacat</hi> or <hi>alms,</hi> and the paying of which he very artfully made one main article of his religion; and partly by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a fifth part of the plunder to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the public trea≈øury for that purpo≈øe, in which matter he likewi≈øe pretended to act by the divine direction.</p>

                  <p>Mahomet wrote to the ≈øame effect to the king of Ethiopia, and to Mohawkas, governor of Egypt, who gave the me≈ø≈øenger a very favorable reception, and ≈øent ≈øeveral valuable pre≈øents to Mahomet, and among the re≈øt two beautiful girls, one of which, named Mary, became a great favorite with him.

                  <p>In this year Mahomet took the city of Mecca, the inhabitants whereof had broken the truce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on two years before.

                  <p>Mahomet immediately gave orders for prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made, that he might ≈øurprize the Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans while they were unprovided to receive him: in a little time he began his march thither; and by

About 28 of the idolaters were killed by a party under the command of Khaled; but this happened contrary to Mahomet's orders, who, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the town, pardoned all the Korei≈øh on their ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, except three men and one woman who were put to death, the re≈øt obtaining pardon on their embracing Mahometani≈øm.</p>

                  <p>In the tenth year, Ali was ≈øent into Yaman to propagate the Mahometan faith there, and, as it is ≈øaid, converted the whole tribe of Hamdan in one day. Their example was quickly followed by all

                  <p>In the eleventh year Mahomet died; thus was Mahometani≈øm e≈øtabli≈øhed, and idolatry rooted out even in Mahomet's time, throughout all Arabia, except only Yamana, where Mo≈øeilama, who ≈øet up al≈øo for a prophet as Mahomet's competitor, had a great party, and was not reduced till the kalifat of Abu Beker, and the Arabs being then united in one faith, and under one prince, found them≈øelves in a condition of making tho≈øe conque≈øts, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Mahometan faith over ≈øo great part of the world.</p>

It has long been the vulgar opinion that this coffin is made of ≈øteel, and ≈øu≈øpended in the air by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of two magnets, but this notion is erroneous, and has long ago been exploded. The tomb lies expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to view from the middle to the bottom of the dome, and is ≈øurrounded by a ≈ømall wall, which is pierced with windows ≈øenced with ≈øilver grates. The in≈øide is adorned with precious ≈øtones of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe value, e≈øpecially on that part of the cupola which is over the head of the prophet.

The cupola is hung with white and red dama≈øk, and has the≈øe words embroidered upon it in Arabic letters of gold, <hi>God is God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</hi> The place is a hundred paces long and ninety broad; it has two gates and a vaulted nave. The concour≈øe of pilgrims that re≈øort to this dome is a≈øtoni≈øhing, and every Mu≈ø≈øulman is bound by his religion to vi≈øit this tomb at lea≈øt once in his life; after which he is for ever regarded as a ≈øaint.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt article of the Mahometan religion is that <hi>there is no God but the true God, and Mahomet is his apo≈øtle.</hi> The Alcoran enjoins the belief of angels; and teaches that they are pure and ≈øubtle bodies, that there is no di≈øtinction of ≈øexes among them, and that they do not propagate their ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that they have various forms and offices; that ≈øome adore God in different po≈øtures, and others ≈øing prai≈øes to him or intercede for mankind.</p>

               <p>THERE are few towns of any con≈øequence, even along the ≈øea-coa≈øts; though when ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øively under the dominion of Carthage and Rome, it abounded with populous cities. All the ≈øea-port towns, except the metropolis, are thinly peopled; tho≈øe in the interior part of the country ≈øtill more ≈øo, and they are inhabited by a haughty robu≈øt people, who trade into Biledulgerid and the country of the blacks.</p>
               <p>BONA is ≈øuppo≈øed to be the ≈øame place with the antient Hippo, a ≈øea-port built by the ancients. It was formerly the capital of the province of Bona. It lies on the Mediterranean ≈øea, and there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fi≈øhery near it. It is a town of no importance, and of ≈ølender population. In this part of the world, elegant architecture has, for many centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, been utterly forgotten or de≈øpi≈øed. The buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Bona, as every where el≈øe, are therefore mean. It is expo≈øed to the incur≈øions of the Arabs. The name of this people is u≈øed by travellers in a very indefinite manner. Algiers is at the di≈øtance of ≈øome hundreds of leagues from Arabia: but as this part of Africa was formerly conquered by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Bona was formerly a magnificent city. Its grandeur is now only to be traced in the ruins of a mona≈øtery. It has a fortre≈øs, and a garri≈øon of three hundred Turks, as the≈øe banditti chu≈øe to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; a Turk being the mo≈øt reputable character in that country. The≈øe adventurers however are not Turks, but the ≈øweepings of all nations blended together. They are commanded by an aga, who is likewi≈øe governor of the town. Bona was taken by Charles V. in his expedition to Tunis, but was not long after recovered by its former ma≈øters.</p>
               <p>CONSTANTINA is ≈øituated on the river Sef Gomar, forty-eight miles from the ≈øea-coa≈øt. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its pre≈øent name from that of a prince≈øs, the daughter of the emperor Con≈øtantine, to whom it is indebted for its magnificence. The ≈øituation is on a penin≈øula, difficult of acce≈øs, except towards the ≈øouth-we≈øt. It is one mile in circumference, well fortified, and contains many fragments of ancient architecture. In particular there is a part of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bridge; and near it is a large ≈øubterraneous aqueduct, which terminates in a ca≈øcade<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> State cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals are ≈øometimes precipitated down this place, and da≈øhed to pieces again≈øt the rocks at its bottom.

The inhabitants of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantina are ≈øaid to be opulent and haughty.

Some ≈øplendid ruins exi≈øt in the vicinity of Con≈øtantina. Upon the ≈øea-coa≈øt, at a ≈ømall di≈øtance from it, are the traces of a Roman colony, anciently called Colo. It is ≈øituated on a high rock, and has a garri≈øon. Adjoining to it is a French factory, to which the Moors bring hides, wax, and wool, for ≈øale.

               <p>GIGERI is ≈øituated about fifteen miles from Bona. It contains about fifteen hundred hou≈øes, and the inhabitants are very poor. It is defended by a fort and a ≈ømall garri≈øon. The natives of this part of the country are independent and barbarous. They retire, when circum≈øtances require it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acce≈ø≈øible fa≈øtne≈ø≈øes, and ≈øet the dey of Algiers at defiance. Ships, when wrecked on this coa≈øt, are plundered, and the crews are treated with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt ≈øavagen≈øs. In this re≈øpect, however, the natives of the territory of Gigeri cannot differ much for the wor≈øe from the re≈øt of their countrymen; nor is the practice peculiar to Barbary.

               <p>BUGIA was formerly the capital of a kingdom of the ≈øame name. It ≈øtands at the mouth of the river Major, or Zinganor, about twenty leagues to the ea≈øtward of Algiers. It is little better than a heap of ruins; a de≈øcription which applies to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt every town in that part of the world. It has three ca≈øtles, two at the port, and one upon a rock, at a ≈ømall di≈øtance behind them. In the year 1671, a Briti≈øh admiral took or de≈øtroyed, in this harbour, nine Algerine ≈øhips of war.

and de≈øtroyed every town in it. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have ≈øtill ≈øupported their independence, by taking refuge in the mountainous parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which are ≈øaid to be very fertile; but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines prevent them from holding any intercour≈øe with foreign nations.</p>
               <p>BISCARA has a fort and garri≈øon. One of the chief employments of the people here is to catch and tame lions, tigers, and other bea≈øts of prey, which they carry for ≈øale to Algiers.</p>
               <p>NECANZ is one of the mo≈øt plea≈øant towns in Barbary. It is watered by an agreeable river, who≈øe banks are adorned with a variety of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trees. The town contains a magnificent mo≈øque and a college for the education of Mahometan ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>ORAN is ≈øituated about two hundred and fifty miles we≈øt of Algiers. It lies partly on a plain, and partly on the a≈øcent of a hill. It is a mile and half in circumference and tolerably fortified. But it is unfortunately commanded by ≈øome of the neighbouring eminences; ≈øo that a garri≈øon of ten or twelve thou≈øand men is nece≈ø≈øary to defend it with ≈øucce≈øs again≈øt a ≈økilful enemy. As the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh coa≈øts and merchant ≈øhips had ≈øuffered much from the cor≈øairs of this port, Ferdinand king of Spain determined to attempt its reduction.

killed four thou≈øand of the barbarians, and ≈øet at liberty twenty thou≈øand Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves. The Algerines, during almo≈øt two hundred years, made frequent and un≈øucce≈øsful attempts to recover the town. At la≈øt, in 1708, they retook it. In June 1732, a Spani≈øh army was di≈øembarked not far from Oran. The Turki≈øh commander, his troops, and the inhabitants were ≈øeized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without much re≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The victors found in the place an hundred and forty-≈øix pieces of cannon, be≈øides mortars, and at lea≈øt fifty ≈øhip loads of provi≈øions. This latter ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply contributed much to the pre≈øervation of their new conque≈øt. Without it they mu≈øt have run the greate≈øt hazard of peri≈øhing in the mid≈øt of ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs; as a tempe≈øt, which la≈øted for ≈øeveral days, cut off all intercour≈øe between the army upon ≈øhore, and the fleet at ≈øea. The Moors not long after attacked the Spaniards with great fury, but were finally repul≈øed with great ≈ølaughter on both ≈øides. The greate≈øt part of this town has lately been laid in ruins by an earthquake; ≈øince which it has been evacuated by the Spaniards, and left in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Turks. From the≈øe ruins the dey of Algiers has lately exported great quantities of white ≈øtone for the purpo≈øe of building his new mo≈øque.</p>
               <p>TREMESEN was formerly the capital town of a kingdom of that name. It is ≈øituated ninety miles ≈øouth-we≈øt of Oran, ≈øurrounded by a ≈øtrong wall and well fortified.

               <p>MOSTAGAN ≈øtands fifty miles ea≈øt of Oran. This town is built in the form of a theatre open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ≈øea, and ≈øurrounded on every other ≈øide with rocks that hang over it. The ruins of an old Moori≈øh ca≈øtle ≈øtands in a ≈øpace between the rocks, and there a ≈øtrong ≈øtone wall towards the port, with a modern built ca≈øtle, garri≈øoned by a number of Turks. The citadel is erected upon the ≈øummit of one of rocks, and commands both city and territory. The haven is commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the town is well ≈øupplied with water. The neighbouring mountains are inhabited by a people called Magarabas, who live in tents, and po≈ø≈øe≈øs a great number of flocks. There is a hand≈øome mo≈øque in this town.</p>
               <p>TENEZ is ≈øituated about one hundred miles to the ea≈øtward of Oran, twenty miles ea≈øt of Mo≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and at a league di≈øtant from the ≈øea, where it has a convenient port.

                     <p>The te≈øtimony of Strabo, however, ≈øeems the mo≈øt authentic. In his account of <hi>Mauritania Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarien≈øis</hi> he informs us, that there was formerly an ancient city on the Mediterranean known by the name of Jol, which was founded by Juba the father of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is ≈øituated, according to him, about the thirty-≈øeventh degree of north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and has a ≈ømall i≈øland in the harbour; and as there is no other place upon the Mediterranean thus circum≈øtanced, it may be pre≈øumed that the ancient city of Jol is the ≈øame as that of Algiers.</p>
                     <p>Juba was taken pri≈øoner in the wars between Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey and the Cae≈øarian party, and carried to Rome, where he was ordered to be educated. He ≈øoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted him≈øelf ≈øo well in his ≈øtudies, that Augu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus not only gave him his liberty, but married him to the beautiful Silene, the daughter of Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony and Cleopatra, and re≈øtored him his father's exten≈øive kingdom of Mauritania, which at that time included the kingdoms of Morocco, Fez, Treme≈øen, Oran, Tunis, Algiers and Bugia.

                     <p>Towards the end of the ≈øeventh century, the Mahometan Arabs over-ran all Mauritania; and as they ≈øeemed to have a particular hatred to the works, as well as the names of the Romans which they aboli≈øhed, they called this city Algezair or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Al Jezier, or Al-Jezerah, an Arabic word which ≈øignifies <hi>belonging to an i≈øland,</hi> becau≈øe there was an i≈øland before it, which is now joined to it by a mole, and forms one of the ≈øides of the harbour.

Round the four ≈øides is a ≈øeat covered with a mat, where the admiral and officers of the navy hold their daily meetings. The ca≈øtle called Sardinia, and the ca≈øtle of the Lantern ≈øtand on the mole; the former of which is mounted with two, and the latter with three tire of guns. The lower tire are 32 pounders; but they are never prepared for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon ≈øudden emergencies, for the lower apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ≈øo filled with large quantities of lumber and naval ≈øtores, that an enemy, ≈øuddenly running into the harbour, might de≈øtroy the city before they could bring their heavier pieces to play. Along the ≈øide of the mole there is a wharf for loading and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading ≈øhips, and for mooring galleys and other ve≈ø≈øels.

                     <p>It is not a little ≈øingular, however, that this city has, for ≈øeveral ages, braved ≈øome of the greate≈øt powers in Chri≈øtendom: but this mu≈øt be imputed to the very injudicious conduct of mo≈øt of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiegers, or the violence of tempe≈øts which have proved de≈øtructive to ≈øo many ve≈ø≈øels in their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

Shortly after this event the ca≈ø≈øan-aga, or prime mini≈øter, through the intrigues of the ba≈øhaw of Con≈øtantina with the old dey, fell a victim to the bow-≈øtring, and Ha≈ø≈øan Ba≈øhaw, the pre≈øent dey, was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the vacant office of ca≈ø≈øan-aga, Cedelli, who was a Grecian of an enterpri≈øing ≈øpirit, ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the office of vichelhadge, and the old dey ≈øhortly after dying a natural death, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delli, who was Ha≈ø≈øan's friend, in≈øi≈øted upon his a≈ø≈øuming the imperial chair. Ha≈ø≈øan di≈øcovered great reluctance; but Cedelli, who came armed with a party for the purpo≈øe, forced him into the chair and ≈øupported him there. The aga ≈øhortly after made his appearance, intending to conte≈øt the right of ≈øovereignty with him, and attempted to a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øinate him him in his ≈øeat; but he was ≈øeized by the chiahs, who dragged him to the Logger Ba≈øtion, where he received the bow-≈øtring, and one of Ha≈ø≈øan's friends was appointed aga in his ≈øtead.

               <p>Cedelli ≈øoon after greatly incurred the di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of Ha≈ø≈øan. The dey had i≈ø≈øued orders that no Dutch ve≈ø≈øels ≈øhould be captured within forty days; but Cedelli, either through de≈øign or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertence, gave in≈øtructions to the cor≈øairs to make immediate captures, and ≈øeveral Dutch ve≈ø≈øels were brought into Algiers; which ≈øo violently exa≈øperated Ha≈ø≈øan, that he demanded in a vengeful and ≈øarca≈øtic tone, whether he or Cedelli was dey of Algiers? Cedelli fortunately e≈øcaped the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtring, but was immediately bani≈øhed from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers.</p>
               <p>When con≈øuls, foreign agents, and other official characters enter the dey's palace, they are reque≈øted to pull off their ≈øhoes, and this ceremony is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expected.

A pre≈øent of this nature is highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, becau≈øe it is a great protection to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and conciliates the minds of the people in his favour.</p>
               <p>The pre≈øent dey is about 50 years old. His face is decorated with a long black beard. He is a man of a venerable a≈øpect and of a meje≈øtic per≈øon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about ≈øix feet high, but rather inclining to lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. He ≈øpeaks in a very imperious and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative tone, as is the ca≈øe with all the Turks. He goes bare legged, but with ≈ølippers on his feet, and cannot be di≈øtingui≈øhed by his dre≈øs from the re≈øt of the Turks; but only by the greater veneration that is paid him.</p>
               <p>When he walks the ≈øtreets of Algiers his <hi>li≈øberos</hi> go before him with clubs in their hands to clear the way, and as he approaches every per≈øon flies with precipitation into bye-ways; for if any one comes within the reach of their clubs he is ≈øure to be knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and trampled under foot. When he rides out, even upon a full gallop, the≈øe li≈øberos run before him, and every ob≈øtacle mu≈øt give way at his approach.</p>
               <p>While the American pri≈øoners were in Algiers the dey once conde≈øcended to vi≈øit the marine, which was looked upon as the mo≈øt ≈øingular event that ever occurred; for neither the dey, the ca≈ø≈øan-aga,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032877_0106_0FF5A9C597B61568"/>
nor aga, are ever known to pay ≈øuch vi≈øits. As he approached the ≈øhore the cannon of the ca≈øtles, and on the walls of the city were fired, trumpets ≈øounded, and French horns played from the marine. He was attended by all the rais or commanders of ve≈ø≈øels, who regarded this vi≈øit as the very highe≈øt compliment. He gave the warden ba≈øhaw a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable ≈øum of money to be di≈øtributed among the ≈ølaves. After examining the marine he was invited into the ≈økiff of the vichelhadge, where he ≈øat down with his attendants and after drinking a di≈øh of coffee retired to his palace.</p>
               <p>The dey keeps about 30 concubines in his ≈øerag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, who are attended by black enuchs, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are never ≈øeen by the ≈ølaves. He has but one child, a daughter about ≈øeven years old, who is the greate≈øt favorite imaginable with the dey. She was engaged to be married to the late vichelhadge of the marine, who was the dey's relation. But he was either killed or drowned in his voyage to the Levant, where the dey ≈øent him with a large ≈øum of money, for the purpo≈øe of building a ≈øuperb mo≈øque at the place of his birth.</p>
               <p>From the mo≈øt authentic accounts it appears that many of the people of Algiers, and the kingdom in general, are ho≈øpitable, humane, and of ≈øtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. A Moor when he finds any articles that have been lo≈øt, never clande≈øtinely appropriates them to his own u≈øe, but has them always cried through the ≈øtreets that the owner may po≈ø≈øe≈øs his property again. But in con≈øequence of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is exerci≈øed over them, and their total ≈øub≈øerviency to the rapacious views of their Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh oppre≈ø≈øors, they ≈øupport perhaps the mo≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous character of any nation in the world. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øpark of political liberty is totally extingui≈øhed,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032877_0106_0FF5A9C597B61568"/>
and the government has now attained to the very acme of the mo≈øt horrible de≈øpoti≈øm. As the Turks maintain their a≈øcendency by the mo≈øt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous mea≈øures, their government exhibits a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ≈øcene of jealou≈øy, apprehen≈øion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion; no man can promi≈øe him≈øelf a moment's ≈øecurity either in his per≈øon or property; for the power of life and death is ve≈øted in the hands of the dey, which he exerci≈øes with impunity; and whenever he covets the riches of any of his opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ≈øubjects, he orders them to be di≈øpatched with a bow-≈øtring, and falls heir to what they po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed. When the order of execution is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to any one, he ≈øubmits patiently to his fate, which he has perhaps long anticipated, and as ≈øoon as the order is executed there is an immediate ≈øcramble among the ≈øervants for the money, jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and other valuable articles which belonged to their ma≈øter.</p>
               <p>According to the common computation, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants in this city is 100,000 Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, 1500 Jews, and 2000 Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves; but no cen≈øus can be accurate for any length of time, as thou≈øands are carried off by the plague; and the number of ≈ølaves is ≈øtill more fluctuating, as they are ≈øubject to an uncertain increa≈øe by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a diminution by ran≈øom, or death by the ≈øeverity of their toils.</p>
               <p>The city of Algiers is vi≈øited almo≈øt every year by the plague, which generally begins in May, and continues for the ≈øpace of three months. When it commences its vi≈øitation no per≈øon is at liberty to circulate any report of its exi≈øtence, or his life would be in danger; but when the contagion becomes more prevalent one of the marabouts vi≈øits the dey

and informs him of its exi≈øtence; after which the citizens are at liberty to take every precaution for their pre≈øervation; ≈øome retire into the country, but the dey and mo≈øt of the people always remain in the city. The fir≈øt ≈øtage of this di≈øorder is a violent fever which brings on a delirium, but if the patient can ≈øurvive this fever he has every a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance of his recovery. The di≈øea≈øe, however, operates differently upon different con≈øtitutions; ≈øome blead at the mouth, no≈øe, and ears; ≈øome break out in lived ≈øpots all over their bodies, and many continue in a ≈øtate of coma, or lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, till they expire, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

About one half of tho≈øe who are attacked by this di≈øorder recover, but they are notwith≈øtanding always liable to, though not ≈øo ≈øu≈øceptible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection after they have once been ≈øeized with it.</p>
               <p>A mo≈øt malignant plague raged in Algiers about the year 1787, which carried off immen≈øe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the inhabitants; the di≈øea≈øe was ≈øo viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that the ≈øtreets were filled with dead bodies, and the mortality ≈øo great that a ≈øufficient number of per≈øons could ≈øcarcely be procured to bury them. Slaves are very frequently ≈øeized with this di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their labour, and they are ≈øuffered to die upon the ground without any a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and with as much unconcern as if they were bea≈øts<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> As they have neither medical books, nor men of learning, it mu≈øt naturally be ≈øuppo≈øed they have no phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.

to hogs that they will fly at the ≈øight of one as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as from the mo≈øt ferocious wild bea≈øt; for they deem it a great contamination even to be touched by a ≈øwine, and a hundred well di≈øciplined hogs would take Algiers much ≈øooner than an army of the very brave≈øt Spaniards. Many, however, among the le≈øs con≈øcientious Moors, who are not ≈øo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive of pollution, bring con≈øiderable quantities of pork to market, which they ≈øell at a very moderate price to the Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves, who derive a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from this cu≈øtom; for a full grown hog is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ≈øold for le≈øs than a ≈øequin.</p>
               <p>The people have ≈øo ≈øingular an attachment to coffee, or the u≈øe of it is ≈øo extremely fa≈øhionable, that trade≈ømen and mechanics while they fit engaged at their bu≈øine≈øs along the platforms in front of their hou≈øes, have their di≈øhes of coffee before them. The Turks, and e≈øpecially tho≈øe who are too con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to make u≈øe of ≈øpiritous liquors, ≈øpend whole days at the coffee hou≈øes in ≈ømoking and ≈øipping coffee: and as they devote no part of their time to reading or the improvment of the mind, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear entirely dive≈øted of all reflection, and become the mere ≈ølaves of their ≈øen≈øual appetites.</p>
               <p>The u≈øe of coffee fir≈øt took its origin at <hi>Aden</hi> in Arabia Felix about the year 1436; from whence it was gradually introduced into Mecca, Medina, Syria, Europe and other parts of the world. It has been the ≈øubject of great contention and di≈øorders; the u≈øe of it has been often pro≈øcribed, and as often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared lawful and allowed: but at pre≈øent it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øally tolerated.</p>
               <p>The drinking of wine, under which name is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all kinds of ≈øtrong liquors, is forbidden in the Alcoran in more places than one. Some have imagined that exce≈øs only is therein forbidden, and
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032877_0108_0FF5A9C8A5014058"/>
they allege that the moderate u≈øe of wine is allowed in two pa≈ø≈øages of the Alcoran; but the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion is, that the u≈øe of ≈øtrong liqours either in a greater or le≈øs quantity is ab≈øolutely unlawful; and though libertines indulge them≈øelves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice, yet the more con≈øcientious, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially tho≈øe who have performed a pilgrimage to Mecca, are ≈øo rigid that they deem it unlawful not only to ta≈øte wine, but to make it, or to maintain them≈øelves by the purcha≈øe and ≈øale of that liquor.</p>
               <p>They are, however, extravagantly fond of wine, and if one a≈øks them how it happens that they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to drink it when it is ≈øo ≈øtrictly forbidden, they an≈øwer that it is with them as with the Chri≈øtians, who≈øe religion prohibits drunkenne≈øs, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light notwith≈øtanding in drinking to exce≈øs. The dey was formerly much addicted to this practice, but ≈øince he has been in admini≈øtration, he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very exemplary in this re≈øpect, and it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for any of his vi≈øitors to breath the fumes of wine in his prefence.</p>
               <p>It has been a que≈øtion whether coffee is not impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly prohibited by the Alcoran, becau≈øe it has an intoxicating property; and it is probable that the former prohibition of it originated from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance alone.</p>
               <p>The more con≈øcientious reject the u≈øe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> not only becau≈øe it intoxicates, but in con≈øequence of a traditional ≈øaying of their prophet, which, if it were really his, would prove him a prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <q>That in the latter days there ≈øhould be men who ≈øhould bear the name of Mu≈ø≈øulmen, but ≈øhould not be really ≈øuch, and that they ≈øhould ≈ømoke a certain weed which ≈øhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tobacco.</hi>

               <p>The greate≈øt part of the Turks, however, di≈øre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all this ab≈øtinence, and as the≈øe lords of the Algerines are ≈øupported at the public expence, their whole life, is an uninterrupted ≈øeries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, debauchery and intoxication: foibles na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all tho≈øe who have no other pur≈øuit in life to engage their attention.

So cordially is this race of people de≈øpi≈øed, that when one wi≈øhes to ca≈øt any obloquy, or a≈øper≈øion of ignominy upon another, he calls him <hi>Judeo</hi> or Jew; and even herd≈ømen in driving their cattle will call them <hi>Judeo,</hi> which is the mo≈øt ignominious term of reproach that can be given.</p>

The con≈øuls of foreign nations find that the Algerines are not to be wrought upon by remon≈øtrance; they expect ≈øomething more ≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and more is to be gained by flattery, and an artful addre≈øs, than by the mo≈øt powerful arguments: for according to the old adage, <q>Give a Turk mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with one hand, and he will let you pluck his eyes out with the other.</q> This was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably verified in the ca≈øe of a Briti≈øh con≈øul, who once made application to Ali Ba≈øhaw, a late dey, and urged a complaint again≈øt the depredations of the Algerine cor≈øairs, without the grand preliminary, <hi>money.</hi> The dey appeared ≈øomewhat re≈øtle≈øs, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulantly an≈øwered, <hi>The Algerines are a ≈øet of rogues and I'm their captain:</hi> ≈øo that national ju≈øtice and hone≈øty are great rarities here.</p>
               <p>To complete the picture of human depravity, the Turks are guilty of the mo≈øt unnatural crimes, which are here regarded with ≈øuch perfect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the poorer ≈øort of people ≈øend their children into the ≈øtreets to ≈øeek a ≈øub≈øi≈øtence by

the mo≈øt nefarious pro≈øtitution, and neither pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment nor the lea≈øt ≈øhade of ignominy is the con≈øequence of detection. A Turk will ≈øigh with as much ardency for a hand≈øome boy, as old Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, who appears to have been a lover of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription, lamented the lo≈øs of the beautiful Alexis. Sodomy is ≈øo extremely fa≈øhionable among them, and ≈øo little are they di≈øpo≈øed to keep this foible a ≈øecret, that it is the ≈øubject of their mo≈øt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ≈øongs, and they will ≈øpare no pains in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the gratification of their infamous love. We are told of a Turk who being di≈øappointed in one of his ignominious amours, and being actuated by the mo≈øt ≈øingular impul≈øe, commanded his ≈ølave to place a red hot brand of fire upon his naked arm, which he ≈øuffered to be burnt almo≈øt to the bone.</p>
               <p>It was cu≈øtomary with former deys to ≈øend an annual tribute of a number of beautiful boys to the Grand Signiors, who are a little tinctured with this vice; but at pre≈øent this tribute con≈øi≈øts of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Arabian hor≈øes. We are credibly informed, that the famous admiral Pinchinin, kept in his hou≈øe forty young boys between nine and fifteen years of age, who were never ≈øuffered to go into the ≈øtreets, le≈øt they might be ≈øeduced by the Turks. Pinchinin was not, however, addicted to this vice; but what di≈øcovered the mo≈øt ≈øingular pride in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, was that he kept the≈øe boys merely through a principle of vanity and o≈øtentation.</p>
               <p>One virtuous trait in a Turk's character is that he ab≈øtains from all profane ≈øwearing, and is never guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ≈øuch bla≈øphemous imprecations as a Chri≈øtian. The American ≈ølaves were much addicted to this vice, and did not he≈øitate to reproach their Turki≈øh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeers with the mo≈øt opprobrious language; ≈øo tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Algerines read no other books but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, and the comments of authors who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereon: of cour≈øe the ≈øphere of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot be expected to be very exten≈øive. They under≈øtand a few of the fir≈øt principles of arithmetic, but of geometry, poetry, painting, and the ≈øublimer ≈øtrains of mu≈øic, they have ≈øcarcely any conception.

               <p>Painting is ≈øo much de≈øpi≈øed, that many figures, ≈øuch as men, women, bea≈øts, &amp;c. are prohibited, and the ≈øight of them is regarded as a great ≈øin.

               <p>Gaming is prohibited in the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øages of the Alcoran which prohibit the u≈øe of wine.

               <p>The only game that is played in Algiers is che≈øs, and this the Mahometan doctors allow, (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have doubted its legality) becau≈øe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ≈øolely upon art and the ≈økilful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pieces u≈øed in playing. But it is never ≈øuffered to prevent the regular performance of their devotions, and per≈øons are never permitted to play for money, or things of the mo≈øt trifling va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
               <p>In Algiers the men have no intercour≈øe with the women before marriage, and marriage contracts are entirely negociated by female confidants employed by the men, who tender the parents a certain ≈øum of money according to their demand, and the lady is thus purcha≈øed as though ≈øhe were an article of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize. Hence it ≈øeldom happens that marriages thus contracted are cemented with love, and by thus violating the law of nature, they lay a ≈øure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for intrigue, jealou≈øy, and the mo≈øt boi≈øterous pa≈ø≈øions. When the marriage contract is conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

the principal nuptial ceremony con≈øi≈øt in e≈øcort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lady to her hu≈øband. A proce≈ø≈øion of her female friends and relations is formed about ten o'clock at night, attended by a number of black fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male flaves with burning torches in their hands, and as this proce≈ø≈øion moves along they make a ≈øtrange kind of noi≈øe at intervals till they enter the hou≈øe of the hu≈øband, who for the fir≈øt time beholds his fair bride, whom his imagination had long perhaps portrayed as the paragon of all excellence. The company then retires, and the next day the marks of virginity are triumphantly di≈øplayed upon the tops of their hou≈øes, in the pre≈øence of the bride's friends and relations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> if this evidence of virtue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced, the hu≈øband returns his wife to her parents, and the marriage is di≈ø≈øolved without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremony.</p>
               <p>The Algerine women are remarkably amorous, and though all intercour≈øe between them and the Chri≈øtians is prohibited under penalty of death, yet it does not deter them from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to circumvent every Chri≈øtian ≈ølave who comes in their way, for whom they have a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attachment. Numbers of the≈øe frail fair ones rove the ≈øtreets every night for the purpo≈øe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and they make the fir≈øt advances with great effrontery and adroitne≈øs; but ≈øuch is the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the li≈øberos, who are highly rewarded for every Chri≈øtian that is detected, that tho≈øe who are venture≈øome enough to undertake an amorous corre≈øpondence, are every moment in imminent danger of falling a ≈øacrifice to their gallantry.</p>
               <p>Some of the former deys had it in contemplation to incorporate the ≈ølaves with the citizens, and to permit their intermarriages, but the marabouts, who were apprehen≈øive that ≈øuch a law would contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

the purity of Mahometan blood, remon≈øtrated ≈øo ≈øtrongly again≈øt it, that all intercour≈øe between Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves and Moori≈øh women was made a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crime.</p>
               <p>The women lead a mo≈øt indolent life; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly amu≈øe them≈øelves with needle work or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery; but are never ≈øubjected to dome≈øtic drudgery, which is done by ≈ølaves, and whatever their condition may be, they are never engaged in any employment out of their hou≈øes.</p>
               <p>In their dre≈øs they di≈øplay neither ta≈øte nor judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to an American or European they appear extremely uncouth. When they vi≈øit or appear abroad the beauty of their per≈øons is entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. They wear a clum≈øy kind of panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons, and according to the phrase of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can captives, they resemble a bundle of rags in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather than women. Like the French ladies they are very fond of <hi>rouge;</hi> but in≈øtead of their cheeks they have a ≈øingular fancy in painting their foreheads with a ≈øtripe of red, which extends above their eye brows.</p>
               <p>Their di≈øhabille, or rather the manner in which they dre≈øs in their hou≈øes, is very la≈øcivious.

Their brea≈øts, arms, and legs are naked, but the re≈øt of their body is covered with a large ≈øilk mantle, which only reaches down to the knees, and is tied about their middle with a kind of ≈øa≈øh. Their ≈ølippers are elegantly wrought with gold; and round their wri≈øts and ancles they wear bracelets ≈øet with jewels. They ride concealed in a large ≈øquare box covered with a kind of red baize,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032877_0113_0FF5A9ED5AB0BF98"/>
placed upon a≈ø≈øes or mules, and when they walk the ≈øtreets they are always veiled. They are extremely cautious of di≈øcovering their faces to ≈øtrangers,<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves, which they deem ≈øo ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred that they would ≈øooner di≈øclo≈øe any other part of their body. An American ≈ølave was ordered one day by a Turk, to carry ≈øome bottles of wine from one of the bagnios to his hou≈øe, and in pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing through one of the apartments he ≈øurprized the Turk's lady, who≈øe face was perfectly unveiled. The di≈øconcerted fair one, overcome with a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ≈øudden and unexpected appearance of a ≈ølave, immediately covered her face with her petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats, and in ≈øo doing di≈øclo≈øed tho≈øe parts which were much more the object of the American's ri≈øibility.</p>
               <p>There is not much difference, as we have before ob≈øerved, between the dre≈øs of the men and women. The men wear a kind of clum≈øy trow≈øers which reach down to the knees, ≈øomewhat re≈øembling the Roman habit.

               <p>The dre≈øs of the marabouts is a kind of green coat, or gown which reaches down to the knees. The hats of ≈øome of them, or rather the covering of their heads, re≈øembles a large di≈øh formed of linen drawn over a piece of circular pa≈øteboard: others wear a high cap ≈øomewhat in the form of a ≈øugar-loaf with a ≈ømall part of the top cut off.

               <p>They have few funeral ceremonies, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change their dre≈øs when any of their relations die.

The place of interment is without the walls of the town, and the corps is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thither by four, or ≈øometimes eight carriers. No women ever attend their funerals, but a few days after, the female relations vi≈øit the grave, over which they weep and ≈øtrew wreaths of flowers.</p>
               <p>The Algerines believe that when the decea≈øed is laid in the ground, two angels come, and make him get upon his knees to render an account of his actions. If he has lived a virtuous life, two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as white as ≈ønow, ≈øucceed tho≈øe who came to examine him, and entertain him with a full account of the plea≈øures he is to enjoy in the next world.

them≈øelves in the infliction of this cruel puni≈øhment<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> without the lea≈øt re≈øpite till the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>In religion it ≈øeems that rigorous re≈øtrictions are no criterion to judge of the political integrity of a nation; for though the Algerines are as punctilious in their religious ≈øervices as any people whatever, yet they ≈øupport the mo≈øt infamous national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon earth. They wor≈øhip no le≈øs than five times in the twenty-four hours; once ju≈øt before day-break, again at one o'clock, and at the time of lazar in the afternoon, and about one o'clock at night. Ju≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their wor≈øhip commences in the day, a ≈ømall white flag is rai≈øed on all the mo≈øques, as a ≈øignal for preparation; the marabouts ≈øoon after a≈øcend the cupola of the mo≈øques, and turning their face to the ea≈øt and rai≈øing their hands to their heads, cry out with a loud voice; upon which the male inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants wa≈øh their hands, face, and feet, and repair to the mo≈øques, where they arrange them≈øelves in files, with their face turned towards the ea≈øt. None of their mo≈øques have pews, but they are paved with marble. Before each per≈øon is placed a ≈øtraw mat, upon which he kneels. After a ≈øhort pau≈øe of ≈øilence, during which their lips are in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they all rai≈øe their hands to their heads, then place them on their knees, kneel down on their mats, and all pro≈øtrate their heads upon the floor at the ≈øame in≈øtant, from which they immediately ri≈øe again into an erect po≈øture. By continual practice they perform the≈øe evolutions with the greate≈øt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion imaginable, and all their motions corre≈øpond more perfectly in point of time than the exerci≈øe of the be≈øt di≈øciplined troops.

A fimilar ceremony is ob≈øerved every day in the marine. The marabout who officiates there cries out from the top of one of the ca≈øtles on the mole, which is the ≈øignal for <hi>diving,</hi> as the Americans facetiou≈øly termed it. The marabouts have nothing to do in this part of religious duty; but they deliver a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe every Friday in the mo≈øques, from a kind of ro≈øtrum or pulpit. This di≈øcour≈øe, and their other religious ceremonies, continue on that day from eleven till one o'clock, during which time the gates of the city and the doors of the bagnios are ≈øhut. The people do not attend public wor≈øhip at night, but as soon as they hear the voice of the marabout, they ri≈øe up and perform their exerci≈øe of devotion in their own apartments. All the Mahometans who re≈øide near the city, immediately pro≈øtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves as ≈øoon as they ≈øee the flags rai≈øed on the mo≈øques; and be≈øides all this religious ≈øervitude the≈øe <hi>very righteous people</hi> daily employ them≈øelves, like the illiterate among the Roman Catholics, in count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their ≈øtrings of beads.</p>

the works of creation; but Mr. Sale remarks, that Mahomet ≈øeems to have preferred that day princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally becau≈øe it was the day on which the people were accu≈øtomed to a≈ø≈øemble long before his time: though ≈øuch a≈ø≈øemblies were perhaps intended for civil rather than religious purpo≈øes. Though the Mahometans in general do not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves obligated to keep that day ≈øo holy as the Jews and Chri≈øtians are bound to keep their Sabbath, (there being permi≈ø≈øion in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ≈øuppo≈øed<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 62.</note>, that that they may return to their employments or diver≈øions after divine ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is ended,) yet the more devout di≈øapprove of the practice of applying any part of that day to worldly concerns, and require it to be wholly dedicated to the purpo≈øes of religion. The ≈ølaves are neither exempted from labour upon this, nor any other day of the week; but they are generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one Friday in every month for the purpo≈øe of re≈øt or recreation.</p>
               <p>All the≈øe religious re≈øtrictions are, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufficient, and once every year they are ≈øubjected to a rigorous ab≈øtinence called <hi>Ramadan,</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazan,</hi> which generally begins in May, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues from the time the new moon fir≈øt appears till the appearance of the next new moon, during which time they refrain from women, and neither eat, drink, ≈ønuff, nor ≈ømoke tobacco, from day-break, till ≈øun-≈øet. The punctilious ob≈øervance of this duty is enjoined under penalty of death, and tho≈øe who are detected in indulging their appetites, ≈øome ≈øay, are compelled to drink melted lead as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment for their crime.

During the time of Ramadan an univer≈øal moro≈øene≈øs prevails among the people, and the dey, who finds it nece≈ø≈øary to conform to this cu≈øtom, is ≈øo much out of humour, that no bu≈øine≈øs can be tran≈øacted with him during the continuance of this fa≈øt. The Turks experience the greate≈øt mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becau≈øe they are abridged of all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures their ≈øen≈øual natures are capable of enjoying; they are neither permitted to frequent the bagnios, taverns, nor coffee-hou≈øes, and they wait for the termination of this fa≈øt with the greate≈øt impatience. Towards the expiration of the month the Turks a≈øcend their cazarees every evening, and look with longing eyes towards the we≈øt for the di≈øcovery of the new moon, which is called the moon of <hi>Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This fa≈øt, which is the third point of religious practice, is a duty of ≈øo much importance, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet u≈øed to ≈øay, <hi>It was the gate of religion,</hi> and that <hi>the odour of the mouth of him who fa≈øteth is more grateful to God than that of mu≈øk.</hi>

command of the Alcoran, to fa≈øt the whole month of Ramadan, and in con≈øequence of this ab≈øtemious ≈øeverity, which is a real ≈øin again≈øt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an univer≈øal gloom overwhelms the minds of the people; they are extremely vengeful, and more murders and a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øinations happen then than at any other time. The ≈ølaves are not compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to any of their religious ceremonies or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrictions; but during the time of Ramadan they are ≈øubjected to the infliction of the ≈øevere≈øt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments: for ≈øuch ab≈øtinence has a tendency to excite the mo≈øt boi≈øterous pa≈ø≈øions of the human brea≈øt.</p>
               <p>This fa≈øt is ≈øucceeded by a <hi>Bairam</hi> or fe≈øtival, called the fea≈øt of the breaking of the fa≈øt, which continues for three days, during which time the half ≈øtarved Turks riot in the oppo≈øite extreme of intemperance. They hold a kind of fair out of town, where they divert them≈øelves with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fea≈øting, mu≈øic, bonfires, wre≈øtling, ≈øwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and feats of hor≈øeman≈øhip. The colours of all nations are di≈øplayed in the marine, and during this fe≈øtival the ≈ølaves are exempted from labour.</p>
               <p>But their greate≈øt fe≈øtival is on the fifth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, the day of the nativity of their prophet, which is celebrated with great ≈øolemnity. All the ≈øchoolma≈øters in the city, with their ≈øcholars, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemble at the chief mo≈øque, from which they form a proce≈ø≈øion through the ≈øtreets, each carrying a burning torch in his hand, and ≈øinging an eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in prai≈øe of their great prophet.

with tape≈øtry and burning lamps. The cooks of the divan to the number of 200 al≈øo form a proce≈ø≈øion, each carrying a clean napkin or towel on his ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and a torch in his hand. They parade the ≈øtreets two by two, from ≈øeven till eleven o'clock in the day, and the ceremony ends with a hymn in prai≈øe of their prophet, performed with in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mu≈øic before the doors of ≈øome of their great men. About midnight torches are kept burning in every hou≈øe, becau≈øe Mahomet was born at that hour. This fea≈øt continues for eight days, during which time any per≈øon is at liberty to walk the ≈øtreets at night without a lighted torch, which they cannot do at other times without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the penalty of corporal puni≈øhment.</p>
               <p>There is a ≈øingular cu≈øtom e≈øtabli≈øhed here, of a religious nature, for the remi≈ø≈øion of the puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of offenders who fly to the mo≈øques for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which is called <hi>taking the marabout,</hi> and the≈øe places are an a≈øylum for every de≈øcription of criminals. In the front of every mo≈øque there is ≈øu≈øpended a long chain, which the criminal ≈øeizes; whereupon he is generally taken into the ≈øanctuary and covered with the marabout's colours, from whence he is not ≈øuffered to be taken till his pardon is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. One of the≈øe chains is ≈øu≈øpended in front of the dey's palace, who ≈øometimes pardons offenders who fly thither for refuge, and another is ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at the cazarees of the Turks, where crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are more inviolably protected.</p>
               <p>A quarrel took place not long ≈øince between two lads about twelve years of age, the one a Turk and the other a Moor, as they were pa≈ø≈øing from the marine to the city. When they came oppo≈øite to the cazarees, the young Turk, taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

of the Moori≈øh lad, ran up to him with his drawn tahan, and gave him a wound through the back, of which he in≈øtantly expired, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fled for refuge to the cazarees, where he was protected, till the friends of the Turki≈øh lad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his pardon by paying the parents of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea≈øed a ≈øum of money as a compen≈øation for their lo≈øs.</p>
               <p>It is a vulgar opinion among the Algerines, and the Mahometans in general, that women have no ≈øouls; or if they have, that they die like tho≈øe of the brutes, and will receive no reward in the next life. This is probably the rea≈øon why they are never ≈øuffered to go upon a pilgrimage, or to attend public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip in their mo≈øques. But whatever may be the vulgar belief<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it is evident that Mahomet had too great a re≈øpect for the fair ≈øex, to inculcate ≈øuch a doctrine; for there are ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages in the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, which expre≈øly affirm that women in the next life will not only be puni≈øhed for their evil deeds, but will be rewarded for their virtues as well as men, and that in this re≈øpect God will make no di≈øtinction of ≈øexes.</p>
               <p>It is true that the general notion is, that they will not be admitted into the ≈øame abode with the men, becau≈øe their places will be ≈øupplied by paradi≈øiacal females, but that a ≈øeparate place of happine≈øs will be a≈ø≈øigned to good women, where they will enjoy every delight in its fulle≈øt extent: yet ≈øome allege that a man will have tho≈øe who were his wives in this world, or at lea≈øt ≈øuch of them as he ≈øhall de≈øire. One circum≈øtance with which Mahomet acquainted his followers, ought to corroborate their belief of the future exi≈øtence of the female ≈øoul. An old woman de≈øired him to intercede with God for her

admi≈ø≈øion into paradi≈øe; but Mahomet told her that no old women would ever enter that place; upon which the old woman began to weep immoderately, and Mahomet explained him≈øelf by a≈ø≈øuring her, that God would make her young again.</p>

               <p>Great numbers of the citizens of Algiers perform a journey to Mecca every year, and many ve≈ø≈øels are employed in tran≈øporting them to this holy city for the purpo≈øe of manufacturing them into ≈øaints. This pilgrimage is ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary a point in practical religion, that according to a tradition of Mahomet, he who dies without performing it may as well die a Jew or Chri≈øtian.

               <p>Mr. Tournefort tells us, that the four places of rendezvous for pilgrims, are Damas, Cairo, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and Zebir. At the≈øe places they dre≈øs

While they are thus accoutred they are neither ≈øuffered to hunt nor to fowl, (though they may fi≈øh) and this precept is punctiliou≈øly ob≈øerved.</p>
               <p>During his pilgrimage a man mu≈øt keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant guard over all his word and actions; he mu≈øt avoid all quarrelling and abu≈øive language; he mu≈øt refrain from all ob≈øcene di≈øcour≈øe and ≈øexual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

All the caravans which come from different parts of the Mahometan dominions, concert their mea≈øures in ≈øuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they arrive the ≈øame day at the hill <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fagd,</hi> which is about a day's journey from Mecca: on this celebrated hill they imagine that the angel fir≈øt appeared to their prophet, and in con≈øequence the Mahometans have founded one of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ≈øanctuaries on this ≈øpot.</p>
               <p>After having killed and di≈øtributed ≈øome ≈øheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor they proceed to Mecca, and from thence to Medina to vi≈øit the tomb of their prophet, which is covered with a magnificent pall, annually ≈øent thither by order of the Grand Signior, which pall is every year cut away by the pilgrims, who e≈øteem the ≈ømalle≈øt piece of it as the mo≈øt invaluable relic. The Grand Signior al≈øo ≈øends 500 ≈øequins, an Alcoran covered with gold, ≈øeveral rich carpets, and a great many pieces of black cloth for hangings, as pre≈øents to the mo≈øques at Mecca.

               <p>The pilgrims who have performed the tour of Mecca are held in great veneration the remainder of their lives; are ab≈øolved from every ≈øin, and may commit new crimes with impunity.

               <p>WHATEVER ≈øpeculative maniacs or merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enthu≈øia≈øts may allege in favour of ≈ølavery, it is obviou≈øly repugnant to the impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcriptible rights of human nature, and an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtible evidence of the remains of barbari≈øm in tho≈øe nations who ≈øanction ≈øo diabolical a principle.</p>
               <p>There appear to be three ≈øtages in the progre≈øs of mankind from ≈øavage rudene≈øs to a ≈øtate of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.

But the grand ≈øcience of univer≈øal benevolence mu≈øt be re≈øerved for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages; for though many modern nations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them≈øelves to be eminently enlightened, yet they are in fact but ju≈øt beginning to emerge from the intermediate ≈øtate between barbarity and true refinement.</p>

With what countenance then can we reproach a ≈øet of barbarians, who have only retorted our own acts upon our≈øelves in making repri≈øals upon our citizens?

               <p>Having premi≈øed thus much, we ≈øhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make a few ob≈øervations upon the ≈ølaves of Algi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 23d of October 1793, about nine o'clock in the morning, the crew of the ≈øhip Pre≈øident, when they were only within a few hours ≈øail of Cadiz, the port to which they were bound, di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an armed xebeck of 16 guns<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> under Spani≈øh colours, bearing down upon them; upon which the American flag was immediately hoi≈øted, and as a very light breeze prevailed it was a con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time before the two ve≈ø≈øels were within hail of each other.

               <p>After they had loaded them≈øelves with plunder, they thru≈øt all the American crew into their boat, in this naked and in≈øulted condition, at the point of their cutla≈ø≈øes; tho≈øe who di≈øcovered any reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, were knocked down and kicked into the boat, where they were trampled under foot by this clan of de≈øparadoes.

Here they had the plea≈øure of being introduced to Rais Mahomet, the commander of the xebeck, an emaciated loath≈øome figure, who ≈øat ≈ømoking his pipe upon a ≈øheep-≈økin, and ≈øipping a di≈øh of coffee which was placed before him. It is not a little ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that ≈øuch a mi≈øerable object ≈øhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of a cor≈øair, and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance mu≈øt evince the futility of their naval policy.

               <p>Such was the commander of the Algerine xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck. When they had fea≈øted their curio≈øity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very venerable figure, their attention was turned to their new quarters, which they ≈øurveyed with new a≈øtoni≈øhment. Nearly a hundred and fifty Algerines were crowded into this ve≈ø≈øel, and whatever de≈øcription can be drawn by the mo≈øt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile imagination, of lice, fleas, filth and ≈øtench, was here nearly reali≈øed. Their decks were never ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be ≈øwept or wa≈øhed, and they ≈øeemed to pre≈øerve their dirt with a kind of veneration. The≈øe delicate planks they ≈øub≈øtituted for tables, upon which they ate their provi≈øions, which con≈øi≈øted of olives, bread, vinegar and oil. When they had fini≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their meals, they threw part of the fragments overboard, and the remainder was trampled into the general ma≈øs of filth.</p>

As ≈øoon as they had ≈øecured their prize, the mo≈øt extravagant mirth and boi≈øterous exultation ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; to commemorate the event a ≈øheep was ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and after be≈ømearing the ≈øides of the ve≈ø≈øel with its blood, they concluded the ceremony by devouring its fle≈øh.</p>
               <p>After the termination of this fe≈øtivity, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners were arraigned on deck, and a ≈øecond ≈øtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping took place. Tho≈øe who had not been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all their clothes at fir≈øt, were now ≈øtripped naked, and in their ≈øtead they were accommodated with a few dirty rags, which had been the refu≈øe of this lou≈øy crew. By Mahomet's order, the clothes of the captives were all thrown together in a heap, and ≈øold at public vendue.</p>
               <p>The mo≈øt laborious part of duty in the xebeck was then a≈ø≈øigned to the Americans, and the pirates, ≈øolely intent upon ≈øecuring their prize, immediately ≈øtood in for the ≈øtreights without looking out for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plunder. In their pa≈ø≈øage the Americans could not help remarking the continual dread and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of the≈øe free-booters, who were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally looking out with their gla≈ø≈øes, and like a band of thieves who were con≈øcious of the villany of their profe≈ø≈øion, they trembled with the mo≈øt vi≈øible con≈øternation at every ≈øail that hove in ≈øight. The Americans repre≈øent the≈øe pirates as the mo≈øt undi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined and pu≈øilanimous ≈øailors in the world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt that the mo≈øt incon≈øiderate naval force with Briti≈øh di≈øcipline, is ≈øufficient to defeat or keep any of them at bay. The greate≈øt di≈øplay of Algerine bravery, is at the commencement of an engagement, when they endeavour to intimidate their enemies, like the American ≈øavages, with the mo≈øt horrible yells.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon of the ≈øame day the Pre≈øident was captured they fell in with a Briti≈øh frigate, when the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032877_0121_0FF5AA18C8B29000"/>
Americans were ordered below, and on the ≈øecond day with a Briti≈øh merchantman, with whom they had before been in company without the ≈øtreights, whom they reque≈øted to publi≈øh an account of their capture at the fir≈øt port they touched.</p>
               <p>On their pa≈ø≈øage up the ≈øtreights they had it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in contemplation to ri≈øe upon the Algerine crew, to di≈øarm tho≈øe upon watch, and to confine the re≈øt below by ≈øecuring the hatches; but their ≈ømall number deterred them from ≈øuch an attempt.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of October they arrived at Algiers, and were taken a≈øhore to the vichelhadge's ≈økiff, where they were attended by the dey's <hi>≈øcrivan</hi> or head clerk, who conducted them to the palace. Here they were lodged in an outer court, which had been occupied as a kind of black-≈ømith's ≈øhop, where they were refre≈øhed with a me≈øs of cuzcuz, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing the fir≈øt night upon ≈øome ≈øacks of ≈øtraw, they were ordered to the Bagnio Baleck.</p>
               <p>When the crews of the American ve≈ø≈øels were captured they were entirely ≈øtripped of their dre≈øs, and pre≈øented in exchange with a parcel of old rags and a pair of coar≈øe trow≈øers, which only reached down to their knees. They laboured for ≈øeveral months in this wretched apparel, which was not ≈øufficient to protect them from the rays of a ≈øcorching ≈øun, till at length each captive was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated by the United States with a hat and a ≈øuit of blue clothes, which were ≈øent them from Alicant by Mr. Montgomery the American con≈øul; a provi≈øion which they received annually while they continued in this mi≈øerable abode. They were al≈øo furni≈øhed with money, which had been depo≈øited by Mr. Humphreys at Alicant, and tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Swedi≈øh con≈øul in Algiers, upon whom the American captains drew every month for the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032877_0122_0FF5AA1A51729938"/>
≈øums that were ≈øeverally allotted to the captives. To each private there was granted an allowance of 3 dollars and 75 cents, to each mate 6 dollars, and to each captain 8 dollars per month‚Äîa very unju≈øt di≈øtinction, e≈øpecially as the privates were ≈øubjected to much greater hard≈øhips than either the captains or mates. By this allowance their ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was rendered le≈øs deplorable, and they were enabled to procure a ≈øupper of meat every night, in≈øtead of the black bread and oil with which they were daily furni≈øhed. It is ob≈øervable that no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made any provi≈øion for their en≈ølaved coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen but the United States, and in con≈øequence the Turks gave them the appellation of <hi>cavalero,</hi> or gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Every public ≈ølave wore an iron ring round his ancle, which was always an evidence of his belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the public, and no Turk could mole≈øt or even in≈øult a ≈ølave of this de≈øcription with impunity; but this badge was not conferred upon the private ≈ølaves. To this ring was fa≈øtened a chain with long links, which was bound round their body to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their e≈øcape whenever foreign ve≈ø≈øels lay is the harbour.</p>
               <p>When there is a public ran≈øom of ≈ølaves there is no difference in the price between the officers and men, but in private ran≈øoms the dey demands 4000 dollars for each captain and mate, and 2000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for every private. All ≈ølaves who die after the conclu≈øion of treaties are paid for, and the dey ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the u≈øual ≈øums for all the American captives who died after the 5th of September 1796.</p>
               <p>When a cor≈øair takes a prize he carries the captives directly to the palace of the dey, where the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean con≈øuls a≈ø≈øemble, to ≈øee if any of the pri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

               <p>The deys formerly had their choice only of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery eighth ≈ølave, and they generally cho≈øe the ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ≈øurgeons, carpenters, and the mo≈øt u≈øeful hands belonging to the ≈øeveral prizes, be≈øides per≈øons of quality, for whom they expected a large ran≈øom; but at pre≈øent it ≈øeems that the dey is entitled to any number he thinks proper to make choice of, who are generally employed in menial offices about the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.

               <p>The condition of tho≈øe who are ≈ølaves to private individuals, depends very much upon the di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ma≈øter, and the ≈ølaves' own conduct. Some of them fare better in Algiers, than ever they did in their own countries, and if they are good for any thing, are entertained rather as compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than ≈øervants; though by far the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are barbarous ma≈øters, who treat their ≈ølaves with great cruelty, and per≈øons of quality, or tho≈øe who are ≈øu≈øpected to be in affluent circum≈øtances, experience a greater ≈øeverity of treatment, in order that they may be compelled to redeem them≈øelves at an extraordinary price. Their female ≈ølaves are ≈øent to the dey's ≈øeraglio, where they are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, or ≈øubjected to dome≈øtic ≈øervices, unle≈øs a con≈øiderable ran≈øom is expected for them; or if young they are ≈øold to ≈øuch as want them for the≈øe purpo≈øes.</p>
               <p>They neither force nor tempt any of the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ≈ølaves to change their religion; as it is not their intere≈øt that they ≈øhould be made converts: for in that ca≈øe they lo≈øe the benefit of their ran≈øoms.

               <p>Tho≈øe ≈ølaves who are ≈øold into the country are ≈øubjected to peculiar hard≈øhips.

Many were formerly con≈øigned to the galleys chained by one leg, and fed on water and hard bi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, and beaten with a large cow-≈økin.

               <p>While the Americans were en≈ølaved in Algiers, the mo≈øt exaggerated accounts were circulated re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ≈øeverity of their afflictions. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the tongues of ≈øome were cut out, that others were ema≈øculated; and captain Lawrence of the Hull Packet, who is ≈øaid to have obtained his information at Cadiz, informs us that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans had their heads ≈øhaved clo≈øe, and were not permitted to wear any kind of covering on their heads.

or rather cables, of ≈øufficient ≈øtrength to drag them, and three or four hundred ≈ølaves, and ≈øometimes a greater number, are engaged in rolling one of the≈øe ≈øtones upon a <hi>carette,</hi> or ≈øtrong four wheel car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in order to tran≈øport it to the mole.</p>
               <p>The Turks make the mo≈øt a≈øtoni≈øhing noi≈øe, not only in the removal of the≈øe ≈øtones, but in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any weight whatever which requires a number of hands. They ≈øeem to imagine that the greater their vociferation, the greater will be the exertions of the ≈ølaves or labourers; it is immaterial how ≈ølowly the work proceeds, provided there is ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient noi≈øe, and the cry of <hi>Hyomoly,</hi> or heave away, is often heard at the di≈øtance of more than a league.</p>
               <p>When they have launched the≈øe unweildy ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of ≈øtone upon the carriages, the cables are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and four files of ≈ølaves are compelled, like ≈øo many bea≈øts of burden, to drag them from the mountain to the city. In their pa≈ø≈øage they are obliged to a≈øcend a ≈øteep hill, where their utmo≈øt efforts are ≈øometimes in≈øufficient to drag the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous weight. The ≈øeverity of their toils in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ≈øummit of this hill is ≈øometimes incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; the ≈øun pours down the mo≈øt intolerable heat upon them, and they are drenched in ≈øweat, and involved in clouds of du≈øt which attend them in their pa≈ø≈øage. Thus many become perfectly exhau≈øted with their toils; and to complete the climax of their ≈øufferings, their brutal over≈øeers, the wardens, ≈øcourge them for the lea≈øt remi≈ø≈øne≈øs with the mo≈øt ≈øavage ≈øeverity.</p>
               <p>When they have a≈øcended the hill, it is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to rever≈øe the ropes, and their utmo≈øt efforts are then required to prevent the carette from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending

the hill with the greate≈øt rapidity. Thus, after great labour and difficulty, they tran≈øport the≈øe ≈øtones to the wharf, where the pantoons are moored, which is about a league from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a ≈øtone's throw from the walls of the city.

               <p>The≈øe pantoons are nece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the ≈øtreets renders the pa≈ø≈øage of the≈øe huge ≈øtones through the city impracticable. They are a ≈øpecies of large flat bottomed boats, that cover about as much water as a ≈øeventy-four gun ≈øhip. They have low gunwhales, and long pieces of timber are nailed acro≈øs the deck, to prevent the great pre≈ø≈øure of the ≈øtones from-injuring the planks. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally carry three or four of the≈øe huge ≈øtones at a load, with a number of ≈ømaller ones, which are di≈øtributed over different parts of the deck.</p>
               <p>The pantoons are navigated by ca≈øting anchors and cables a-head. Fifty or ≈øixty ≈ølaves are nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to man them, and by means of the≈øe cables and anchors, which are continually carried a-head as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion requires, they warp the pantoons to the mole. In their pa≈ø≈øage they are ≈øometimes ≈øubjected to great danger from ≈øudden ≈øqualls of wind, which either blow them out to ≈øea, or wreck them on the ≈øhore. When this happens the greate≈øt bu≈øtle ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable en≈øues, and the clamour of the Turks is ≈øuch, that one would ≈øuppo≈øe that the city it≈øelf was upon the verge of de≈øtruction. The ≈øtones are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged at the mole by means of a <hi>≈økyler,</hi> which is a kind of platform re≈øembling the leaf of a table, projecting from the ≈øtern of the pantoon, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:032877_0125_0FF5AA2D85B55590"/>
by pulleys; upon this the ≈øtones are placed in ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, by means of crowbars, and depo≈øited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øuch parts of the mole as the ≈øea makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt impre≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>Thus have the fooli≈øh Turks continued this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs labour for upwards of 250 years, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived the project of forming a wall of ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ≈øtrength to defend the mole from the violence, of the waves; but it is ≈øaid that the dey has now ≈øuch a project in contemplation, which he intends ≈øhortly to put in execution.</p>
               <p>The impetuo≈øity of the ≈øea has a continual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bury the≈øe ≈øtones in the ≈øand. An ea≈øtern, or as it is called a Levant wind will roll ≈øuch a heavy ≈øea into the harbour, that in the cour≈øe of three or four days, the labour of a whole ≈øea≈øon will be ≈øwept away. The ≈øea at ≈øuch times breaks with great violence over the mole, and even the walls of the magazines are ≈øometimes nearly de≈øtroyed.</p>
               <p>Two pantoons and two carettes, with a gang of ≈ølaves to each of them, are employed in tran≈øport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the≈øe ≈øtones, and the carettes generally bring each two loads in a day.</p>
               <p>Many ≈ølaves are employed at other places in the country. Some at a mountain called Bubazoon, ≈øome at the gardens of different con≈øuls, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide in the country, and others in the marine. But on Fridays they are ordered to Bublywhite, where the vickelhadge and warden ba≈øhaws attend, and where, on tho≈øe days, there is a general collection of all the ≈ølaves.</p>
               <p>After they fini≈øh their daily<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> labour they all repair to town to their common lodgings the bagnios, where they are locked up every night, and prohibited all intercour≈øe with the citizens. The private ≈ølaves are not, however, deprived of this privilege, and they

are permitted to walk the ≈øtreets at night, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they conform to the common cu≈øtom of carrying a light with them, without which every per≈øon is ≈øubject to being arre≈øted by the watchmen of the city, and to cha≈øti≈øement by the ba≈øtinado.</p>
               <p>In the bagnios, the chief aim of the ≈ølaves is to drown the reflection of their abject ≈øituation by the mo≈øt cheerful conver≈øation. They have few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu≈øements here to divert their attention; but ≈øome of them, when they have lei≈øure, follow their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øions, in order to obtain a little money. The principal ≈øtudy of the more humorous Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, was to di≈øpel the gloom of their companions and to excite one another to laughter by ludicrous and ≈øatirical remarks upon their ≈øituation. Some of them played upon the violin, and frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the toils of the day, they would divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves all night by dancing, drinking and ≈øinging, in order to bani≈øh the reflection of ≈ølavery. In their frolics they were often very clamorous, and interrupted the repo≈øe of the whole bagnio; at which time ≈øome of the ≈ølaves would often lodge complaints again≈øt them, and the corporal would then put an end to the frolic by ordering them to retire to re≈øt.</p>
               <p>The ≈ølaves are let out of the bagnios at an early hour in the morning, and they proceed to their labour with pen≈øive hearts and reluctant ≈øteps. When they are employed in the marine they repair every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Here they wait the arrival of the vickelhadge, who ≈øoon makes his appearance, and as he pa≈ø≈øes between them they are compelled to pull off their hats as a token of re≈øpect. After him a proce≈ø≈øion of the

               <p>The bu≈øine≈øs of the marine is the lea≈øt laborious employment of the ≈ølaves. But even here they are ≈øubjected at times to great hard≈øhips, and e≈øpecially when an expedition is on foot; at which time they are compelled to labour all night in making the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary preparations for the crui≈øe. The ≈øhore is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with lamps, and Turki≈øh guards are ≈øtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned on the mole, and in other parts, to prevent their e≈øcape.</p>

The≈øe articles are brought to Bublywhite by mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who are daily employed in carrying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions to the ≈ølaves. The bread is of the mo≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different quality, and is made of unboulted meal, ground in mills in the city which are turned by hor≈øes.

It is ≈øaid that the ≈øupport of this ho≈øpital co≈øts the Spani≈øh nation 40,000 dollars per annum, which are annualy tran≈ømitted to Algiers for this benevolent purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>It has been reported that the officers and men of the American ve≈ø≈øels were treated with equal ≈øeverity; but this was a mi≈øtake. Neither the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican captains nor mates were ≈øubjected to the labour of the common ≈ølaves; but were employed in the ≈øail-loft in making ≈øails, or in boring pumps for ve≈ø≈øels, and ≈øometimes after lazar in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon they were ≈øent to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in unloading the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons. This was the general routine of busine≈øs a≈ø≈øigned to the captains and mates of ve≈ø≈øels; but the ≈øailors were indi≈øcriminately empolyed in every kind of labour.</p>
               <p>The Americans ≈øupported the be≈øt characters of any ≈ølaves in Algiers, and the mo≈øt of them could always obtain credit in the bagnios for wine and other liquors; a favour that was conferred upon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Turks nor Moors, of whom the tavern-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were always obliged to be extremely watchful; otherwi≈øe they would frequently ≈øteal away without pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The mo≈øt turbulent of the ≈ølaves are the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who frequently quarrel at night, and fight in the bagnios with drawn daggers; at which times the corporals ≈øettle di≈øturbances among them with a ≈øhort rope with a knot in the end, or confine them in chains till morning.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe ≈ølaves who have incurred the penalty of death are generally executed at the fountain in front

After the execution, the blood is wa≈øhed through the ground into the common ≈øewer, and his body is buried in the ≈øand near the ≈øea ≈øhore, as they are not ≈øuffered the privilege of a Mahometan burial.</p>
               <p>The American captives generally bore their ≈øufferings with great fortitude, and conducted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with ≈øuperior decorum; but notwith≈øtanding, frequent and ≈øevere puni≈øhments were inflicted upon them for the mo≈øt trivial remi≈ø≈øne≈øs, and a thou≈øand inadvertencies, which are natural to tho≈øe who have been accu≈øtomed to the enjoyment of their liberties.</p>

About nine o'clock one very hot morning, in the time of Ramadan, while <hi>Montenegro,</hi> the warden of the pantoon, lay a≈øleep, the≈øe fifteen ≈ølaves, at the word of command, jumped into the boat which lay along ≈øide the pantoon, and put to ≈øea in an in≈øtant.

                  <p>SOME time in 1795 an Engli≈øh cutter from Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralter arrived in Algiers with a number of ≈ømall pieces of bra≈øs cannon, which were purcha≈øed by the dey and carried to his palace. The American ≈ølaves, who were then at work in the marine, ≈øoon recogni≈øed ≈øeveral per≈øons of their former acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the crew of the cutter. A general inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy took place, and they ≈øympathi≈øed ≈øo feelingly for the di≈øtre≈øs of the Americans, that a ≈øcheme was concerted among them to effect their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from this region of mi≈øery. The crew deeply intere≈øted them≈øelves in the accompli≈øhment of this project, and communicated their intentions to their captain, who perfectly approved of their plan, and promi≈øed every a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in his power to facilitate their de≈øign.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øcheme devi≈øed between the parties was as follows: The Americans were to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the fir≈øt fair wind, and in either going to, or returning from their labour in the marine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the wind ≈øhould favor them, they were to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Baleck boats which tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them, and in≈øtantly row them≈øelves on board the cutter; which being a very ≈øwift ≈øailing ve≈ø≈øel would ≈øoon have wa≈øted them beyond the reach of their pur≈øuers. The in≈øtant they had boarded the cutter they were to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of her apparently by force, and the Briti≈øh crew were to affect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance, that the dey might entertain no ≈øu≈øpicion of their being privy to the con≈øpiracy.</p>

                     <pb n="262" facs="unknown:032877_0133_0FF5AA47259CE030"/>
The cutter was in con≈øequence put into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete order, and the nece≈ø≈øary in≈øtructions were given that they might ca≈øt off and get under weigh in an in≈øtant.</p>
                  <p>No ≈ølaves were perhaps ever pre≈øented with ≈øo favorable an opportunity as the pre≈øent. But the mo≈øt ≈øingular occurrence imaginable fru≈øtrated the whole ≈øcheme, when it was upon the point of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>The captain of the cutter, on the day of their intended departure, went up to one of the bagnios in the city, were he accidentally fell in company with two renegado Iri≈øhmen of his acquaintance, who were dre≈ø≈øed, as u≈øual, in the Turki≈øh habit. It was re≈øolved of cour≈øe to celebrate this unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted interview with a cour≈øe of wine; and they drank till they were all pretty well intoxicated. While they were in this animated mood they found them≈øelves ≈øo well di≈øpo≈øed for adventures, that one of the renegados made a propo≈øal to vi≈øit ≈øome of the Algerine courtezans, which was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceded to, and our captain, who was not, as may well be ≈øuppo≈øed, over burthened with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øpection, was conducted to a Moori≈øh brothel in the upper parts of the city, where the≈øe Iri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had previou≈øly formed an acquaintance. Some of the li≈øberos, who had ≈øu≈øpected their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns, ≈øecretly watched their motions, and di≈øcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the retreat of our frolic≈øome adventurers. Soon after their entry the≈øe li≈øberos ru≈øhed into the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and ≈øurpri≈øed our amorous captain and his friends in the height of their mirth. He was in≈øtantly ≈øeized and carried before the dey, who ≈øentenced him to immediate execution; but as he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to receive the reward of his folly, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh con≈øul, who had received intelligence of the

In con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he was e≈øcorted on board his cutter, which was ordered immediately out of the harbour, and ≈øhe was not even permitted to remain to take in the lea≈øt balla≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Thus was this ≈øcheme mo≈øt completely defeated by this trivial incident, and the hopes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans entirely fru≈øtrated. When they ≈øaw the departure of the cutter, and were informed of the captain's folly, they were thrown into a ≈øtate of inconceivable de≈øpondency.

                  <p>The≈øe renegados were afterwards bani≈øhed to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis; not becau≈øe their intercour≈øe with the Moori≈øh women was prohibited, (for the renegados are not deprived of this privilege) but becau≈øe they had been acce≈ø≈øory to an infraction of the law.

                  <p>About two hours after they had hoi≈øted ≈øail, one of the Neapolitans was ≈øeized with the plague, and

                  <p>After they had been under weigh about half an hour, the dey, receiving information of what had pa≈ø≈øed, ordered a number of the pi≈øcorees to go in pur≈øuit of her, who ≈øoon after returned and brought back the ≈øick Neapolitan.</p>
                  <p>But their misfortune, did not terminate here: for the day after another Neapolitan was di≈øcovered to have the plague, of which, he died ≈øhortly after; and the ≈øucceeding day captain Baily was ≈øeized with the di≈øorder, and al≈øo died.

               </argument>
               <p>THE city of Algiers has undergone con≈øiderable alterations in the ≈øtate of its fortifications, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, cu≈øtoms, and manners, &amp;c. ≈øince the year 1640, the time of their famous admiral Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> Pinchinin.</p>
               <p>The ancient wall of the city ≈øtill remains; but ≈øcarcely any vi≈øible ve≈øtiges exi≈øt of the ditch which extended the whole length of the wall on the land ≈øide. This ditch was about ≈øixteen feet wide, and of a proportionable depth; and ≈øerved as a recepticle for the filth of the city. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants derived but little advantage from this wall, as no military force was ≈øtationed behind it for the defence of the city.</p>
               <p>All the ≈øtreets were chained up at night; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which extended the whole length of the city from the port of Babloet, between the great mo≈øque and the dey's palace, to the gate of Buba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoon.</p>
               <p>The principal part of the garri≈øon was lodged in five large public edifices, with ≈øpacious courts in the middle, which ≈øerved as armories. Each of the≈øe contained about 600 ≈øoldiers, who were ≈øupported at the public expence; each of whom were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with a ≈øeparate apartment. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the principal Turks were lodged in large hou≈øes called <hi>Fonducas,</hi> which belonged to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate per≈øons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="unknown:032877_0144_0FF5AA84677DD918"/>
The ca≈øtle called <hi>Alcazabar</hi> was that part of the city which lay to the ≈øouthward, divided by a wall which began at the rampart on the ea≈øt ≈øide, and extended to that on the we≈øt.</p>
               <p>About three hundred paces from the ≈øhore ≈øtood a ≈ømall i≈øland, that was joined to the city by a mole which was fini≈øhed in the year 1533, and intended for the protection of ve≈ø≈øels. This mole was carried away by a violent tempe≈øt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1662, which occa≈øioned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe de≈øtruction among the ≈øhipping.</p>
               <p>Without the city there were ≈øeveral incon≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fortre≈ø≈øes; the principal of which was that built by Ha≈ø≈øan Ba≈øhaw in the year 1545 at the place where Charles V. pitched his tent in 1541. This fortre≈øs is ≈øtill in exi≈øtence, and is called the <hi>imperial ca≈øtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants amounted to about 100,000; of which 12,000 were Turki≈øh ≈øoldiers, 30,000 ≈ølaves of various nations, and the remainder citizens of Algiers, who con≈øi≈øted of Moors, More≈øcos, Jews, and ≈øome Chri≈øtian merchants.</p>
               <p>The ≈øupreme authority was, as at pre≈øent, ve≈øted in the dey, or, as he was then called, the ba≈øhaw, who was frequently honored with the appellation of <hi>Sultan,</hi> with which he was highly plea≈øed.</p>
               <p>His ≈øituation appears to have been more precarious then than at pre≈øent, and he was in continual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of mutiny among the Turki≈øh ≈øoldiers; e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if their monthly wages were withheld. His principal ≈øtudy, therefore, was to make punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at every new moon, and if he delayed the≈øe payments three hours after they were due, he was in great danger either of being murdered or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="unknown:032877_0144_0FF5AA84677DD918"/>
The dey was obliged to be very circum≈øpect in taking no more than his due proportion of all prizes; for otherwi≈øe he was in danger of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate execution by an incen≈øed ≈øoldiery; as happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in September 1661, when Ramadan Ba≈øhaw, who then pre≈øided, adjudged to him≈øelf a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion of prize-wheat than was his due. This proceeding cau≈øed an immediate in≈øurrection of the ≈øoldiers, who cut his throat, and ma≈ø≈øacred twenty-eight of the divan, who≈øe bodies were thrown to the dogs in the ≈øtreets. The re≈øt were obliged to make their e≈øcape in a fi≈øhing boat, to avoid the fury of the ≈øoldiers, in which they were afterwards captured by the Malte≈øe and made ≈ølaves.</p>
               <p>After the death of Ramadan, another Ba≈øhaw, whom they had impri≈øoned ≈øome years before for neglect in making punctual payments, was brought out and elected to the ≈øovereignty of Algiers, whom they exhorted to a more virtuous conduct in admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtration.</p>
               <p>But within three days after, he forgot their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, and meditated nothing but the de≈øtruction of an aga, who had been acce≈ø≈øory to his impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the execution of this de≈øign he promi≈øed 10,000 patacoons<note n="*" place="bottom">The patacoon is a Spani≈øh coin about 84 cents in value.</note> to two ≈øoldiers if they would murder him. With this intention they went to the aga's hou≈øe, and reque≈øted to ≈øpeak with him. But the ≈ølave who came out, ≈øu≈øpecting their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their countenances, an≈øwered that his ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not at home.</p>
               <p>When intelligence was announced to the aga of the dey's de≈øigns, he urged a complaint to the ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who ≈øeized him and threw him into a dark dungeon, where he received his food through a ≈ømall hole, and only had room enough to ≈øit down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="unknown:032877_0145_0FF5A9A35D6C8C08"/>
The nece≈ø≈øity of punctual payment, often obliged the dey to procure money by every ≈øini≈øter means in his power: even by the violation or mi≈øcon≈øtruction of treaties. And this imperious nece≈ø≈øity induced him to ri≈øk a rupture with Great Britain in 1661, by making prize (contrary to their treaty of peace) of the property and per≈øons of foreigners that had been ≈øhipped on board of Briti≈øh ve≈ø≈øels. In con≈øequence of this infraction of the treaty, the earl of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick was di≈øpatched to Algiers, with a fleet of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ≈øail of the line, to demand re≈øtitution. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral entered the harbour the 22d of Augu≈øt, and di≈øpatched his lieutenant with his credentials on ≈øhore to demand ≈øatisfaction, which the dey and divan were not di≈øpo≈øed to grant. In con≈øequence, the Briti≈øh con≈øul was brought on board the fleet, and the admiral, after pouring a volley of grape ≈øhot into the city, and battering down ≈øeveral hou≈øes, took his departure.</p>
               <p>The principal ≈øtudy of the dey was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant practice of impo≈øition upon nations with whom he was in alliance. Their ve≈ø≈øels were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øeized, and the captains con≈øtrained, by corporal puni≈øhment, to confe≈øs that the property belonged to other nations. Indeed it was an arduous ta≈øk for him to avoid foreign di≈øputes, and at the ≈øame time promote harmony at home. He was ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the e≈øtabli≈øhment of peace with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have a tendency to abridge his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øites, and a want of finances to di≈øcharge the nece≈ø≈øary demands, would expo≈øe him to the fury of a mutinous ≈øoldiery. Treaties of peace were therefore nece≈ø≈øarily violated, and as he derived the principal part of his revenue from captured ve≈ø≈øels, he was ≈øeldom at peace with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="unknown:032877_0145_0FF5A9A35D6C8C08"/>
The 12,000 men that con≈øtituted his ordinary forces, con≈øi≈øted chiefly of the refu≈øe of Turkey, and of renegados who had fled for refuge from Europe; for Algiers was ≈øuch a perfect a≈øylum for villany, that even tho≈øe who had offended the Grand Signior him≈øelf found protection upon their arrival there, as was the ca≈øe in 1640.</p>
               <p>One Sigala, the ≈øon of a Genoe≈øe renegado a famous admiral of the ≈øame name, had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of a ≈øquadron of galleys belonging to the Grand Signior Morad IV. which brought home the annual tribute of Egypt. Sigala on his return anchored his fleet in ≈øome of the ports of Greece, where he went on ≈øhore to devote part of his time to the women. While he was here indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him≈øelf in every gratification, the Malte≈øe ran into the port, and captured the ve≈ø≈øel which was freighted with the trea≈øure. Sigala, to avoid the bow ≈øtring, ≈øet ≈øail immediately with his galley to Algiers, where he ≈øub≈øi≈øted by piracy till he was pardoned by Ibrahim the ≈øucce≈ø≈øor of Morad.</p>
               <p>Algiers was at this time a kind of military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and the dey was ≈øo perfectly under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of the ≈øoldiery, that without their concurrence he could do nothing. If they approved of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they were executed, and if not, the dey was compelled to relinqui≈øh them.</p>
               <p>In the year 1642, a tributory king, refu≈øing to pay tribute, appeared with an army to ≈øhake off the Algerine yoke. Yu≈øef, the reigning dey, de≈øirous of being exempted from the command of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, pretended indi≈øpo≈øition. But the ≈øoldiers were not di≈øpo≈øed to receive his excu≈øe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to embark in one of his galleys; and le≈øt he ≈øhould de≈øert them, he was e≈øcorted by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:032877_0146_0FF5A990222DC950"/>
other galley, and was obliged to ≈øubmit to being di≈øembarked with his army at the place appointed.</p>
               <p>At this time there were, according to ≈øome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, about three thou≈øand French renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos in Algiers. Before this time the renegados were prohibited from ≈øerving in the capacity of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh ≈øoldiers; but Mahomet Ba≈øhaw fir≈øt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be incorporated with the Turks in 1568.</p>
               <p>The pay of each ≈øoldier was eight More≈øco doubles<note n="*" place="bottom">This double is about 25 cents in value.</note> a month; but their pay was enhanced upon extraordinary emergencies, and in proportion to the number of years they had ≈øerved. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Sultane≈øs was delivered of a ≈øon, or they had any remarkable engagement with the Arabs, or any ≈øoldier had killed his enemy in an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and brought away his head, their pay was augmented a double a month: provided the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of doubles did not exceed forty.</p>
               <p>The unmarried ≈øoldiers enjoyed greater privileges than tho≈øe who were married. To the former were di≈øtributed four loaves of bread a day, but to the latter none.</p>
               <p>The ≈øoldiers kept no guard in the city; but a watch called <hi>Me≈øuart,</hi> con≈øi≈øting of twenty-five per≈øons, paraded the ≈øtreets.

On the fir≈øt of Augu≈øt 1640, he left Madrid, and proceeded by land to St. Seba≈øtian, where he embarked on board an Engli≈øh ve≈ø≈øel, in order to return to his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, after having vi≈øited various parts of Spain.

The ma≈øter of the Engli≈øh ve≈ø≈øel immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ordered his ≈øails to be furled up, and alledged for a rea≈øon that it was not cu≈øtomary for an Engli≈øh ve≈ø≈øel to run away at ≈øea. The caravel ≈øoon came within gun ≈øhot, but without hoi≈øting her colours; whereupon it was concluded that ≈øhe was a pirate.</p>
               <p>But night coming on both ve≈ø≈øels lay to, waiting the events that were to take place the next morning. The pa≈ø≈øengers of the Engli≈øh ve≈ø≈øel u≈øed every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in their power to induce the captain to make his e≈øcape; but he was inflexibly determined to maintain his ≈øtation.

of the Engli≈øh ve≈ø≈øel, and her crew were ≈øent on board of one of the Turki≈øh ≈øhips, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after ≈øtood for Algiers.</p>
               <p>On the eleventh day after their capture, they pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øtreights of Gibralter, where the Turks, as they pa≈ø≈øed, ob≈øerved many ≈øuper≈øtitious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Among a variety the following was ob≈øerved; they ca≈øt a ve≈ø≈øel of oil into the ≈øea, which they imagined ≈øwam to a mountain called <hi>La montagne des Signes,</hi> where a great ≈øanton or ≈øaint re≈øided, who ≈øub≈øi≈øted upon the oil, and in con≈øequence of this gift di≈øpen≈øed various ble≈ø≈øings to them. During the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of the oil, lighted candles were placed upon the great guns (a ceremony that was particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved by ve≈ø≈øels that pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øtreights in the night) which burnt for the purpo≈øe of affording light to the oil in its pa≈ø≈øage. All the≈øe ceremonies were performed with prayers and great devotion.</p>
               <p>The third day after pa≈ø≈øing the ≈øtreights, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored oppo≈øite the city of Algiers; the guns of the ve≈ø≈øel were fired, and their report brought a large concour≈øe of people to the ≈øhore. D'Aranda with the re≈øt of the crew were now freed from their chains, and taken to the market where the Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves were ≈øold, in order to ≈øee if any of them were known; from thence they were conducted to the palace of the dey, (who was entitled to every eighth pri≈øoner) that he might make his choice out of the number of captives.</p>

               <p>After the dey had made choice of his ≈øhare of the captives, the remainder were taken to the hou≈øe of

one of the Turks who≈øe ve≈ø≈øel had taken the prize. As D'Aranda was going into the hou≈øe, the Turk a≈øked him in Italian, if he was hungry, he an≈øwered in the affirmative; whereupon a Chri≈øtian ≈ølave brought the pri≈øoners ≈øome bread and a ba≈øket of grapes, with which they regaled them≈øelves. The hou≈øe was built in the Italian manner; the galleries were formed of white marble, and the pavement, the pillars and the arches were well proportioned, according to the laws of architecture. They were confined in this hou≈øe, where they were obliged to ≈øleep on the floor in the galleries, and were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to leave the hou≈øe till they were ≈øold.</p>
               <p>After they had been confined here ≈øeven days, they were vi≈øited by Pinchinin and ≈øome of the riche≈øt Turks, who came with an intention to purcha≈øe ≈ølaves. They a≈øked the pri≈øoners whether they were able to pay the price of their ran≈øom; but they an≈øwered in the negative, and in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no purcha≈øe was made. They were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought to the market, where an old man, with a ≈øtaff in his hand, took D'Aranda by the arm, and led him ≈øeveral times round the market-place. A number of per≈øons, de≈øirous of purcha≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, appeared, who a≈øked D'Aranda his profe≈ø≈øion and the place of his nativity. They took him by the hand to examine if it was hard; and ordered him to open his mouth, to ≈øee whether his teeth were ≈øufficiently good for chewing hard bi≈økets on board the galleys. They were then all ordered to be ≈øeated in a row. The old man took the fir≈øt in order and led him three or four times round the market, crying <hi>arrache, arrache,</hi> who offers mo≈øt? After the ≈øale he was placed upon the other ≈øide of the market, and in the ≈øame manner all the others were ≈øold. D'Aranda was purcha≈øed by a rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado

               <p>The dey being entitled to any ≈ølave at the price offered for him in the market, they were in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence once more taken to the palace: each one having in his hat a piece of paper, on which was written the price at which he was ≈øold.

He then ordered them to the ≈øtables of the palace, where they found 250 other ≈ølaves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a ≈øupply to the galleys. In the≈øe ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they were confined one and twenty days, and their daily allowance here was two ≈ømall loaves of bread a-piece.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of September, when their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys make their la≈øt crui≈øe, the≈øe ≈ølaves began to prepare for ≈øea. To each one was di≈øtributed, by the dey's order, ≈øome coar≈øe cloth, for the purpo≈øe of making them ≈øuch clothes as were worn in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys. On the day appointed for the ≈ølaves to go on board, a number of barbers attended the ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ≈øhaved the heads and beards of tho≈øe who were intended as rowers. After they were ≈øhaved, the dey's ≈øteward, and the captain of one of the galleys entered the ≈øtables, and ordered the ≈ølaves into an adjoining court, where each one had his office and ≈øtation a≈ø≈øigned him. After this there remained twenty ≈ølaves more than ≈øufficient to man the galleys. D'Aranda was among this number, and the captain of the galley ≈øaid to the ≈øteward as he pa≈ø≈øed them, <hi>We will leave the≈øe ra≈øcals on ≈øhore, for they are ≈øavages yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were then ordered back to the dey's ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:032877_0149_0FF5A9A04BBC93E0"/>
and the ≈øame day four galleys thus manned, left the harbour. The dey finding D'Aranda and his companions neither rich nor per≈øons of quality, ordered them to be brought into his pre≈øence in the hall of audience, where they found Pinchinin, who ≈øaid to them, <hi>Chri≈øtians I have bought you of the dey, but at a very great price.</hi> He then ≈øent them to his hou≈øe, where they found twenty female ≈ølaves who attended his wife, be≈øides twelve male ≈ølaves, and a ≈øeraglio of forty young boys between nine and fifteen years of age.</p>
               <p>From Pinchinin's hou≈øe they were ≈øent to his bagnio, the place appointed for ≈øuch of his ≈ølaves as were intended for the galleys. This bangio was a ≈øtreet or large entry i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

D'Aranda not being acquainted with any one in this ≈øeminary of <hi>virtue,</hi> was obliged to ≈øleep the fir≈øt night upon the terrace of the bagnio, and the next morning when he ro≈øe he ≈øaw an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ≈ølave bringing in a great variety of articles and hou≈øehold ≈øtuff, and crying <hi>arrache, arrache.</hi> D'Aranda enquired of a certain knight of Malta with whom he had become acquainted, what the Italian meant.

<pb n="295" facs="unknown:032877_0149_0FF5A9A04BBC93E0"/>
were employed in a large rope-walk. D'Aranda and Saldens were appointed to turn a large wheel. Upon their turning the wheel too ≈øwiftly, their guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian cried out to them in Lingua Franca, <hi>forti, forti,</hi> which ≈øignifies <hi>gently;</hi> but they mi≈øunder≈øtanding the term, turned the wheel with all their might, which ≈øo exa≈øperated their guardian, that he ran up to them in a rage, and with a huge cudgel taught them the ≈øignification of <hi>forti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After they were thus initiated into the knowledge or rope making, they were compelled to pound wheat in a mortar; a much more laborious employment, in which D'Aranda acquitted him≈øelf but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently; upon which his guardian ≈øaid to him, <hi>give over that work you dog, you are too ≈øavage yet.</hi> In putting the wheat into bags after it had been pounded, a little happened to be ≈øpilt on the ground; whereupon their guardian ≈øaid, <hi>Pilla e≈ø≈øe cani,</hi> take that up you dog: but D'Aranda not under≈øtanding him, his keeper gave him a mo≈øt unmerciful blow over the back with a billet of wood, which gave him a dangerous wound, from which a copious ≈øtream of blood i≈ø≈øued.</p>
               <p>A very heavy bag of wheat was then placed upon each one's ≈øhoulder, which they had to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a con≈øiderable di≈øtance, and D'Aranda's ≈øtrength failing him after he had gone a few paces, the bag began to ≈ølide down his back; upon which his keeper ≈øtruck him in the face ≈øeveral times with his fi≈øt, and the blood ≈øtreamed plentifully from his mouth and no≈øe; which compelled him to greater exertions, and he ≈øtaggered under the load till he arrived at Pinchinin's hou≈øe, where he fell down, perfectly exhau≈øted with the burden. But the mo≈øt arduous part of their labour was yet to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They were under the nece≈ø≈øity of carrying
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:032877_0150_0FF5A9A1D2EE86F0"/>
the≈øe bags up into a granary forty feet high; ae ta≈øk which D'Aranda would have found totally impracticable, had not his companion Saldens, who was much ≈øtronger, compa≈ø≈øionately carried it up for him, while he lay upon the ground be≈ømeared with ≈øweat, du≈øt and blood, and ≈øtill unmercifully pounded by his keeper, who threatened to murder him. In this lamentable condition he returned to the bagnio.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Caloen, his other companion, had been employed in leading a mule, laden with bi≈øket, from Pinchinin's hou≈øe to the water ≈øide. In con≈øequence of the narrowne≈øs of the ≈øtreets, it was a cu≈øtom in Algiers, when one led a loaded mule or camel, to cry <hi>Belec,</hi> take care there. But our new mule-driver, ignorant of the cu≈øtom, gave no warning of his approach, and in pa≈ø≈øing, threw a Turk into the mud. The Turk getting up in a great rage, drew his knife, (which they carried about them in≈øtead of a ≈øword) and would have murdered Caloen, had he not been prevented by ≈øome other Turks, who hallowed out to him, <hi>don't you ≈øee that Chri≈øtian is a ≈øavage yet, and don't under≈øtand the cu≈øtom;</hi> the word SAVAGE being a term of reproach which was given him becau≈øe he was dre≈ø≈øed in a Chri≈øtian habit.</p>
               <p>While they were in a ≈øtate of the mo≈øt extreme indigence, expecting nothing from Pinchinin, and not ver≈øed in the art of ≈øtealing, the common profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in the bagnio, they had the good fortune to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ≈øeventy-five patacoons from an Italian merchant in Algiers, to whom they became jointly bound for the payment of a hundred at Antwerp.</p>
               <p>Their next employment was in a vine-yard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one of Pinchinin's country-hou≈øes, where very laborious ta≈øks were a≈ø≈øigned them; for which
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:032877_0150_0FF5A9A1D2EE86F0"/>
D'Aranda, being but indifferently qualified, agreed with his guardian to allow him four rials a month if he would give him a more ea≈øy employment: and in con≈øequence his next bu≈øine≈øs was to carry ≈øome large pots of water to the lodgings of the chief guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. D'Aranda now fared pretty well, and was much plea≈øed with his new employment; but a trivial occurrence ≈øhortly after excluded him from this bu≈øine≈øs; for as he was pouring a pot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one day into the <hi>Tin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ga,</hi> or great ci≈øtern, he acco≈øted a Turki≈øh woman who entered the hou≈øe, and a≈øked her if ≈øhe would drink a gla≈øs of ≈øack. This que≈øtion being overheard, he was di≈ømi≈ø≈øed from his employment, and compelled the next day to work with ≈øome other ≈ølaves in attending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons.</p>
               <p>This happened in the month of December, when the cor≈øairs crui≈øed along the coa≈øt of Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øia, in order to capture Engli≈øh ve≈ø≈øels laden with wine and fruits. The≈øe cor≈øairs had taken a frigate of Dunkirk, in which there was a young man who was ≈øold to Pinchinin, with whom D'Aranda had been formerly acquainted. This young man ≈øhortly after had an interview with D'Aranda, and being moved at the recital of his misfortunes, gave him ≈øome jewels, which he pawned for ten crowns. This was a very ≈øea≈øonable ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as his ≈øeventy-five patacoons were by this time ≈øpent, and his credit was in con≈øequence very much rai≈øed at the bagnio, which was more than u≈øually crouded at this time by great numbers of Turks and Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves who came to drink ≈øack, a cargo of which had been lately taken in one their prizes.

<pb n="298" facs="unknown:032877_0151_0FF5AA95587D1E88"/>
employed as tavern keepers, a bu≈øine≈øs which was prohibited to Turks; others of the crew were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned to the galleys, where they were chained to the outermo≈øt oar, men whom the Algerines called <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavands.</hi> The≈øe ≈ølaves con≈øi≈øted of Spanards, Italians and Ru≈ø≈øians, and being a little intoxicated one night a quarrel en≈øued between ≈øome of them, which made a great uproar in the bagnio. Whereupon a prie≈øt came into the room with a wax candle in his hand, and quelled the di≈øturbance. The news of this riot ≈øoon came to the ears of the patron of the bagnio, who came attended by ≈øeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons with cre≈ø≈øet lights and lanthrons, and armed with cudgels. They all fled at the approach of the patron; but one of the rioters was ≈øeized, ≈øtripped naked, and held by the hands and feet by four ≈ølaves with his belly on the floor, where he received a hundred blows on the back with a cudgel.</p>
               <p>D'Aranda had now re≈øided ≈øix months in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, at which time he and his companions went to Pinchinin, and ki≈ø≈øing his robe and the ≈øleeve of his inner garment, the Turki≈øh mode of paying homage, they told him they had come to agree with him about the price of their ran≈øom. After ≈øome conver≈øation Pinchinin told them he was then going out of town with ≈øome ≈ølaves to fell timber for a new frigate which was building, and that he would talk further with them upon the ≈øubject at his return.</p>
               <p>In the mean time D'Aranda was employed at a new hou≈øe belonging to Pinchinin in the upper part of the city, where he was obiged to carry materials on his back up a ≈øteep hill where mules and camels could not be u≈øed. While he was at work two Turks came to the bagnio and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for D'Aranda, Caloen, and Saldens; but as
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:032877_0151_0FF5AA95587D1E88"/>
they had changed their names, nobody could give any account of them. The Turks then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Brabant ≈ølave called <hi>Francis the ≈øtudent,</hi> to examine ≈øome papers which were written in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, giving ≈øome account of the ≈ølaves. Francis, upon examination, concluded that D'Aranda and his companions were the per≈øons they were enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and told them he knew the ≈ølaves very well. Whereupon he went with them to the bagnio, where they found D'Aranda and his companions, whom they informed they were no longer ≈ølaves; at which the were greatly overjoyed.</p>
               <p>The next day a Jew came to the bagnio, and by order of Pinchinin's wife, told D'Aranda and his companions that the dey wi≈øhed to ≈øpeak to them. When they were brought before him, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to go into a ≈ømall drawing room of the palace, where they continued about three hours with ≈øome young Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves. At length the ≈øteward made his appearance with a cudgel, and ≈øaid to them, <hi>You dogs which of you wrote home to be exchanged for Turks?</hi> They all excu≈øed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; but the ≈øteward not much di≈øpo≈øed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their excu≈øes, gave them all a ≈øevere beating, and told them he would come again at night and cut off their ears and no≈øes. They were here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in this ≈ømall apartment in extreme mi≈øery for eighteen days; during which time they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vi≈øited by the ≈øteward, who always carried his cudgel in his hand, and ≈øometimes beat them for his diver≈øion. The Turks now waited upon Pinchinin, who had returned, and told him they had engaged to procure an exchange of D'Aranda and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for ≈øeven of their Turki≈øh friends, who were pri≈øoners in Flanders, and offered him by way of ran≈øom the ≈øame ≈øum he had given for them. But
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:032877_0152_0FF5AA93D2A96B88"/>
Pinchinin told them the≈øe ≈ølaves were per≈øons of quality, for each of whom he demanded 6000 pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons as the price of ran≈øom.</p>
               <p>While the Turks were endeavouring to effect an exchange of pri≈øoners nine weeks pa≈ø≈øed away, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time D'Aranda and his companions were confined in the dey's palace. After much delay the Turks agreed with Pinchinin upon the price of their ran≈øom; upon which they were relea≈øed from confinement, and lodged in the hou≈øe of <hi>Cataborn Mu≈øtapha,</hi> one of the Turks, who became their new patron. Caloen was ≈øoon after ≈øent in a ve≈ø≈øel bound to Leghorn, in order to procure the liberty of the Turki≈øh pri≈øoners in exchange, according to the agreement made between the≈øe Turks and the friends of D'Aranda and his companions, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Turki≈øh pri≈øoners in Flanders.</p>
               <p>D'Aranda ≈øtill continued with Mu≈øtapha, but his re≈øidence here was of ≈øhort duration; for Mu≈øtapha getting drunk one day quarrelled with a <hi>Bulcebas,</hi> a captain of foot, whom he called a Chri≈øtian. For this offence Mu≈øtapha ≈øuffered impri≈øonment, and by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the divan received a hundred blows on the back with a cudgel; after which he was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ≈øerve ≈øix months in the field again≈øt king Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali.</p>
               <p>After the departure of Mu≈øtapha, D'Aranda was received into the family of Mahomet Celibi Oiga, where he was employed in the capacity of a ≈øervant. Here he ≈øoon became very intimate with his new mi≈øtre≈øs who granted him many liberties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to attend public wor≈øhip every day at Pinchinin's bagnio.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Caloen, who was not ≈øo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, was impri≈øoned in the hou≈øe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>At the expiration of ≈øix months after D'Aranda had re≈øided at Oiga's hou≈øe, he received a letter from Saldens, dated at Ceuta, who reque≈øted his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate attendance at Tetuan in the kingdom of Fez, according to contract with the two Turks. This letter contained information that Caloen's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ab≈øolutely refu≈øed to pay the 700 patacoons that were demanded for his ran≈øom, but made no particular mention of the five Turks who were to be given in exchange for D'Aranda and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>In con≈øequence of this information Mu≈øtapha's grandmother immediately ordered Caloen to be confined with a hundred weight of iron about his legs, in a ≈ømall cellar, where D'Aranda frequently vi≈øited him; and one day while he was with him, the old woman entered the cellar, and a≈øked Caloen if he was willing yet to pay the 700 patacoons. He made no an≈øwer, but laughed at her; which ≈øo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enraged the old lady, that ≈øhe ordered D'Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to be ≈øeized and loaded with irons in the ≈øame cell, becau≈øe ≈øhe had imputed Caloen's conduct entirely to his advice. Here they remained till the time fixed for the departure of a ve≈ø≈øel de≈øtined for Tetuan, when, by the interce≈ø≈øion of three Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves who intended to embark in this ve≈ø≈øel, they were relea≈øed upon a promi≈øe that her grand≈øon Mu≈øtapha, who was at Ceuta, ≈øhould be liberated in exchange.</p>
               <p>About this time (which was the fir≈øt of January 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

for a month, during which time they were prohibited from eating or drinking in the day; and tho≈øe who were detected in violating this law were compelled to ≈øwallow melted lead. About the time of ≈øun-≈øet the people were permitted to eat, and drums were beaten as a ≈øignal to cea≈øe from fa≈øting.</p>
               <p>To this fa≈øt ≈øucceeded the fe≈øtival or Ea≈øter of Ramadan, which continued for eight days, and was celebrated with great pomp and fe≈øtivity. Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades were formed without the city, and feats of hor≈øeman≈øhip were di≈øplayed. The Turki≈øh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were drawn in ≈ømall triumphal chariots, to which Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves were harna≈ø≈øed. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal amu≈øement was wre≈øtling, at which the Moors were very expert. The prohibitions of the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran ≈øeemed very little regarded at this time, and wine and brandy were drank in the greate≈øt exce≈øs. In the time of this fe≈øtival gifts were di≈øtributed to the ≈ølaves, and for the three or four fir≈øt days they were exempted from every kind of labour.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of January D'Aranda and Caloen, after ≈øettling all preliminaries, embarked with a number of Turks and Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves on board the ve≈ø≈øel bound for Tetuan. On the eighth day after they arrived at Oran, which is about forty leagues from Algiers, and on the twelfth at Treme≈øen, where they lay at anchor three days, and di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged part of their Moori≈øh crew.</p>
               <p>Treme≈øen was formerly a powerful kingdom, to which the dey of Algiers was tributory. It is ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated at the extremity of the Grand Signior's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and is bounded by the empire of Morocco and Fez, with which the Grand Signior is in alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but notwith≈øtanding this empire is often at war with the Algerines, and this happens without any

violation to the confederacy. The ≈øame is the ca≈øe with Tunis, which is included in the Grand Signior's dominions; but he does not concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf with the affairs of the ba≈øhaws, and they are not con≈øidered at war till ≈øome place of importance is taken.</p>
               <p>From Treme≈øen they ≈øet ≈øail upon their voyage, and ≈øhortly after, in con≈øequence of the di≈øcharge of a number of Moors, a con≈øpiracy was formed among the Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves to murder all the Turks on board, and to render them≈øelves ma≈øter of the ve≈ø≈øel. But the whole de≈øign mi≈øcarried in con≈øequence of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of a Spaniard, who was the principal in the con≈øpiracy, and neglected to give the ≈øignal of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet, as had been previou≈øly concerted.</p>
               <p>On the twelfth of February in the evening they ca≈øt anchor in a bay within half a league of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan, and the next day a violent ea≈øt-wind aro≈øe which ≈øubjected them to imminent danger. The Turks terrified at the ≈øtorm began to ≈øay their <hi>≈øala</hi> or prayers, and promi≈øed to di≈øtribute alms as ≈øoon as they were on ≈øhore. But the tempe≈øt ≈øtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed in violence, and the ve≈ø≈øel was every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in danger of being driven upon the rocks. In this extremity the Turks re≈øolved to offer a ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Mahomet as their la≈øt re≈øource; a number of ≈øheep being always taken on board the Turki≈øh ve≈ø≈øels for this purpo≈øe. They cut one of the≈øe ≈øheep into four parts, and with a variety of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ceremonies they ca≈øt the parts into the ≈øea on different quarters of the ve≈ø≈øel.</p>
               <p>The tempe≈øt continued to increa≈øe till midnight, at which time the ve≈ø≈øel began to drag her anchors. The Turks all a≈ø≈øembled at the ≈øtern in the utmo≈øt con≈øternation, and implored the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet with the loude≈øt lamentations. The ve≈ø≈øel
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:032877_0154_0FF5AA96E4738718"/>
continued to drag her anchors, and ≈øoon after ≈øhe was wrecked upon the ≈øhore, but the principal part of the crew were ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>D'Aranda and Caloen were greatly overjoyed at their deliverance, and the next morning they ≈øet out for Tetuan, where they arrived about noon. While they continued here they received a letter from Don Martin de Pegnalo≈øo a Spani≈øh merchant at Ceuta, who informed them that Saldens had gone to Gibraltar, and had left orders with him to furni≈øh them with every thing nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Turki≈øh pri≈øoners who had been detained at Flanders had arrived at Ceuta. Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapha Ingles one of the pri≈øoners, imagining that Saldens had returned to Flanders, wrote to Tetuan to the Turk who had charge of D'Aranda and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loen, that Saldens had promi≈øed when he was in Flanders to pay 700 patacoons towards the ran≈øom which his relations had paid for Caloen, and that he ≈øhould put them in the <hi>Ma≈ømora.</hi> The per≈øon who concerted this bu≈øine≈øs was Abraham Arrais one of the Turki≈øh pri≈øoners, who reported at Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta that D'Aranda and Caloen had promi≈øed 700 patacoons before their departure from Algiers.</p>
               <p>In con≈øequence of this letter they were put into the Ma≈ømora, which was a large vault about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feet under ground, where 170 Chri≈øtian ≈ølaves were confined. While they were in this ≈øituation D'Aranda wrote to Saldens, who returned to Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, and by his interce≈ø≈øion they were liberated from confinement, and ≈øoon after took their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for their native country.</p>
