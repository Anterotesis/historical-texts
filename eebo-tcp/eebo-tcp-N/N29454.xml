            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

[Secondly]</hi> There is an Answer, and a solemn Answer too, which is put into his mouth by the Lord, and which he is to return as the Lords Answer to the Question? <hi>Thou shalt then say unto them, what burden?</hi> I <hi>will even forsake you, saith the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the Lord may even forsake a</hi> P<hi>eople, that have been near to him, and He hath been near to; though for the Lord thus to do, is as fearfull and hideous a judgement as can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on any</hi> P<hi>eople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine is double, it hath two parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Lord may do thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When He doth, it is a very sad and heavy burden, <hi>I</hi>t may be prosecuted as two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct points.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. God may forsake a People that hath been near to him, and that he hath been near to. This may be spoken to in this order.</item>

withdrawn himself, he is gone, in respect of his gracious presence. We must here distinguish betwixt Gods general presence, and his precious presence. In respect of his general presence, he is not far from any one of us, <hi>for in him we live, and move, and have our being, Act</hi> 17.27.28. We have not only our beginning from, but our being in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As the beam hath its being in the Sun. Of the general presence of God, we read, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. There is no flying from it, <hi>Whither shall</hi> I <hi>go from thy</hi> S<hi>pirit, or whither shall I flie from thy presence?</hi> In this sense God is every where; as it is <hi>ver:</hi> 8: &amp; 9. <hi>If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there: if I make my bid in Hell, behold thou art there.</hi> He fills Heaven and Earth, and there is no hiding from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. <hi>Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him? saith the Lord, do not I fill Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord.</hi> He hath Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth for his Footstool, as it is I<hi>sai.</hi> 66. 1. This general presence of God, if believingly apprehended, and strongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, might be of great use.</p>
            <p>But it is not this general presence that is meant: but his especial presence, his favourable and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence, the removing whereof, is that that is intended, by the forsaking that the Text and Point speaks of. God is said to forsake a People two wayes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As to Affection.</item>

1. As to Affection, when He discontinues his love to them, when he takes away his love from a people, then He takes his leave of a people. <hi>My mind is not toward this people,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er. 15.1, a very heavy judgement, and sad removal. Be <hi>instructed O</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>least my</hi> S<hi>oul depart from thee:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to Action, when God takes away the signs of his presence.</p>
            <p>As when he takes away merciful and gracious Providences, when he carries not towards them as he was wont to do: but vexes them with all manner of adversity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.17. I <hi>will forsake them, and many evils and troubles shall befall them:</hi> when he ceases to protect them from evils and enemies, as in times past, and provides not for them, as he was wont to do. When he takes away his Ordinances, and bereaves a people of the glorious things of his house, or take a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Spirit from accompanying them, whereby the glory ceases, and the Ordinances are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in-effectual for the saving good of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How it may appear that God may forsake such a people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may appear by what God hath threatened. What God hath threatened, to such as the point speaks of, may be inflicted on them: but God hath threatened such judgements to such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>My anger shall be kindled against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:039221_0012_1013F8DEFA349AB0"/>
and I will forsake them,</hi> as near as they are to me, and as dear as they have been to me, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 17, Many such threatnings are found in the Scripture against <hi>Israel,</hi> who are stiled a people near unto him.</p>
            <p>In that such as have been near to God, and he near to them, have complained of their being forsaken by God. <hi>Thou hast forsaken us,</hi> is one of the bitter moans, on record, that the Church of God did often make unto him.</p>
            <p>What God hath inflicted on such, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on such again; what God hath done to some, he may do to others in the same state, and relation: for he is Unchangeable. Those that were once the only peculiar people of God, near to God, and had God near to them; yet what is their condition at this day? A forsaken condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the condition of the Offspring of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gods Friend, a seed whom he had chosen, and hath been so, for above sixteen hundred yeares. God hath been angry with them, and forsaken them, as they were foretold long ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How is it with the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> that were once famous golden Candlesticks? that had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles written to them. Are they not in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken condition? not the face of a Church to be found amongst them.</p>
            <p>In that they may do that, which may deserve a forsaking, therefore they may do that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> actually procure it. They may do that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039221_0013_1013F8E0AD19E9E8"/>
which may deserve a forsaking, they may through the corruption and unbelief of their hearts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake God, and God may in just judgement reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate, and thereupon forsake them: This is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, in the forequoted place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 16,17. <hi>They will forsake me, and break my Covenant which I have made with them: then my anger shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e kindled against them in that day, and I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, and hide my face from them.</hi> So again, 2. Chron. 15. 2. <hi>But if you forsake him he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake you;</hi> the first is supposed, <hi>if you forsake him,</hi> the latter is imposed, <hi>he will forsake you;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why doth the Lord forsake such a People? The Reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To shew that he hath no need of any, he hath forsaken many, and may forsake many more, to shew that he hath no need of any. God would have all are world to take notice, (that though all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of him, yet) he hath no need of any man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To testifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Sanctity, and severity against sin. He will not spare them, that have been near him, if they will not spare their sin for him. He is a holy God, and if they will have their sins, and their lusts, and their wayes, and their lovers, he will vindicate his holiness, by inflicting this judgement on them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To be a warning to all that injoy his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence. That they see that they make much of it, and that they take heed that they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039221_0014_1013F8E3605B9990"/>
do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> The point is to be understood of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are visibly and externally near and dear to him, and these may be totally and finally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of God: and yet here it must be noted, that God may exercise a deal of patience, and forbearance toward such as he is about to forsake, he did so with the old world, he did so with the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old, he did so with the seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Asia:</hi> he did not wont suddenly, and at once to forsake a People, that have been near and dear to him; but he is wont to give them warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in patience to bear a while with their frowardness, and wait to see if there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him, before he doth inflict this heavy and sharp judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> It serves to admonish us, not to bear our selves too high, upon the account of Priviledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is a great priviledge to have the Lord near us, and to be near unto him: and some lean upon this though they abide in their sin, <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 10. 11. <hi>They build up</hi> S<hi>ion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord amongst us?</hi> But if our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments be not according to our priviledges, if we do not carry it: thereafter, by becoming an humble, fruitfull, and holy people; the Lord will bring forth this heavy burden against us, we shall be rejected, and forsaken of the Lord, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

our external priviledges be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But the second part of the Doctrine; or the second Doctrine may be now spoken to, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the heaviest burden, or the sorest of Judgements for the Lord to forsake a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be two things spoken to in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this Truth. 1. Arguments to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it. 2. The Uses of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God hath threatened it as a very sore judgement, then sure it is so. Now when God hath been angry with a people, he hath manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same by menacing them with his forsaking them: when he hath been designed to do them a deep displeasure, upon the account of some high provocation, he is wont to threaten them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by taking away this, or that outward comfort from them; but by taking away himself from them.</p>
            <p>And that is a woe indeed, a woe with a witness, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 12. Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them: this is the wofullest day that such a people are wont to meet with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods forsaking a People is a sore judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that it exposes them to all judgements, Sin is a great evil, in that it exposes to all evil, this is a great evil of punishment, in that it exposes to all punishments. If God be gone, our guard is gone, and we are as a Cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, in the midst of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, whose walls are broken down. Our strength to make resistance, that is gone, for God
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039221_0016_1013F8E907D99138"/>
is our strength, as a carcase with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a prey, to beasts of prey; so are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their God, to all their devouring enemies, and to infernal, and cursed spirits: they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to mischief, and the malice of all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant enemies. When the Lord had forsaken <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> quickly made a prey of it; when they were destitute of God, their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became desolate. There is no Protection to a People, whom the Lord forsakes; but they are perplexed on every side.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because the evils that are on such, whom God hath forsaken, they are only evils. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hath the expression, <hi>Ezek</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Thus saith the Lord God, an evil, an only evil behold is come.</hi> This is such an evil, an only evil to a people. An evil whilst God is present, may have much good in it, the Lord may sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it for abundance of blessing; there is hopes of this whilst the Lord continues amongst them; but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> gone, it is an only evil, and the evils that come upon them are such they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but evil in them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because no creatures can then afford any help; for what can creatures do when God is departed, he makes the creatures useful and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but without him they can do us no good, stand us in no stead: they may say to thee as the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> said to the Woman, that cried <hi>Help O King,</hi> He answered, <hi>If the Lord don't
