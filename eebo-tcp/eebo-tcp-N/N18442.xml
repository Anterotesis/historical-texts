            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The SECRETARY OF STATE, to whom was referred by the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, the Reſolution of Congreſs, requeſting the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent 'to cauſe an eſtimate to be laid before Congreſs at their next ſeſſion, of the quantity and ſituation of the <hi>LANDS</hi> not claimed by the Indians, nor granted to, nor claimed by any citizens of the United States, within the territory ceded to the United States by the ſtate of North-Carolina, and within the territory of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, north-weſt of the river Ohio,' <hi>makes thereon the following</hi> REPORT.</head>
            <p>THE territory ceded by the ſtate of North-Carolina to the United States,<note place="margin">South-weſtern Territory.</note> by deed bearing date the 25th day of February 1790, is bounded as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, to wit: Beginning in the boundary between Virginia and North-Carolina, that is to ſay, in the parallel of latitude 36 ½ degrees north from the equator, on the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, where the ſaid boundary or parallel interſects it, and running thence along the ſaid extreme height to the place where Wataugo River breaks through it; thence a direct courſe to the top of the Yellow Mountain, where Bright's Road croſſes the ſame; thence along the ridge of the ſaid mountain between the waters of Doe River and the waters of Rock Creek, to the place where the road croſſes the Iron Mountain; from thence along the extreme height of ſaid mountain to where Nolichuckey River runs through the ſame; thence to the top of the Bald Mountain; thence along the extreme height of the ſaid mountain to the Painted Rock, on French Broad River; thence along the higheſt ridge of the ſaid mountain, to the place where it is called the Great Iron or Smoaky Mountain; thence along the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme height of the ſaid mountain to the place where it is called Unaka Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of the ſaid mountain, to the ſouthern boundary of the ſaid ſtate of North-Carolina, that is to ſay, to the parallel of latitude 35 degrees north from the equator; thence weſtwardly along the ſaid boundary or parallel, to the middle of the river Miſſiſippi; thence up the middle of the ſaid river to where it is interſected by the firſt mentioned parallel of 36 ½ degrees; thence along the ſaid parallel to the beginning: which tract of country is a degree and a half of latitude from north to ſouth, and about 360 miles, in general, from eaſt to weſt, as nearly as may be eſtimated from ſuch maps as exiſt of that country.</p>
            <p>The Indians having claims within the ſaid tract of country,<note place="margin">Indian claims.</note> are the Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kees and Chickaſaws, whoſe boundaries are ſettled by the treaties of Hopewell, concluded with the Cherokees on the twenty-eighth day of November, 1785, and with the Chickaſaws, on the tenth day of January 1786, and by the treaty of Holſton, concluded with the Cherokees, July ſecond, 1791. Theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties acknowledge to the ſaid Indians all the lands weſtward and ſouthward of the following lines, to wit; beginning in the boundary between South and North-Carolina, where the South-Carolina Indian boundary ſtrikes the ſame; thence north to a point from which a line is to be extended to the river Clinch, that ſhall paſs the Holſton, at the ridge which divides the waters running into Little River, from thoſe running into the Tanniſſee; thence up the river Clinch to Campbell's Line, and along the ſame to the top of the Cumberland mountain; thence in a direct courſe towards the Cumberland river, where the Kentucky road croſſes it, as far as the Virginia line, or parallel aforeſaid, of 30 ½ degrees; thence weſtwardly, or eaſtwardly, as the caſe ſhall be, along the ſaid line or parallel to the point thereof, which is due north-eaſt from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

point to be taken on the dividing ridge of Cumberland and Duck rivers, 40 miles from Naſhville; thence ſouth-weſt to the point laſt mentioned, on the ſaid dividing ridge, and along the ſaid dividing ridge north-weſtwardly, to where it is interſected by the ſaid Virginia line, or parallel of 36 ½ degrees. So that there remained to the United States, the right of pre-emption of the lands weſtward and ſouthward of the ſaid lines, and the abſolute right to thoſe northward thereof, that is to ſay; to one parcel to the eaſtward, ſomewhat triangular, comprehending the counties of Sullivan and Waſhington, and parts of thoſe of Greene and Hawkins, running about 150 miles from eaſt to weſt, on the Virginia boundary, as its baſe, and between 80 and 90 miles from north to ſouth, where broadeſt; and containing, as may be conjectured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to accuracy, between ſeven and eight thouſand ſquare miles, or about five millions of acres: And to one other parcel to the weſtward, ſomewhat triangular alſo, comprehending parts of the counties of Sumner, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidſon, and Tanniſſee, the baſe whereof extends about 150 miles alſo, from eaſt to weſt, on the ſame Virginia line, and its height, from north to ſouth, about 55 miles, and ſo may comprehend about four thouſand ſquare miles, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two and a half millions of acres of land.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Claims of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</note>Within theſe triangles, however, are the following claims of citizens, reſerved by the deed of ceſſion, and conſequently forming exceptions to the rights of the United States.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Appropriations by the ſtate of North-Carolina, for their continental and ſtate officers and ſoldiers.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Grants and titles to grants veſted in individuals by the laws of the ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Entries made in Armſtrong's office, under an act of that ſtate, of 1783, for the redemption of ſpecie and other certificates.</p>
            <p>The claims covered by the firſt reſervation are,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Military boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>1ſt. The bounties in land given by the ſaid ſtate of North-Carolina, to their continental line, in addition to thoſe given by Congreſs; theſe were to be located within a diſtrict bounded northwardly by the Virginia line, and ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by a line parallel thereto, and 55 miles diſtant: weſtwardly, by the Tanniſſee, and eaſtwardly by the meridian of the interſection of the Virginia line, and Cumberland river; grants have accordingly iſſued for 1,239,498 acres, and warrants for the further quantity of 1,549,726 acres, making toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 2,789,224 acres.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted that the ſouthweſtern and ſoutheaſtern angles of this diſtrict, conſtituting perhaps a fourth or a fifth of the whole, are ſouth of the lines eſtabliſhed by the treaties of Hopewell and Holſton, and conſequently in a country wherein the Indian title is acknowledged and guarantied by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. No information is received of the exact proportion of the locations made within theſe angles.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Bounties in land to Evan's battalion, raiſed for ſtate purpoſes. Theſe were to be taken weſt of the Cumberland Mountain. The locations are not yet made.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reſervation covers the following claims:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Entries and grants.</note>1. Lands for the ſurveyor-general's fees for laying out the military bounties, to be located in the military diſtrict. The grants already iſſued on this account amount to 30,203 acres.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Grants to Iſaac Shelby, Anthony Bledſoe, and Abſalom Tatum, commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for laying out the military bounties;<note place="margin">Commiſſioners.</note> and to guards, chain-carriers, markers, and hunters, who attended them, already iſſued to the amount of 65,932 acres, located in the military diſtrict.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Entries in Waſhington county amounting to 746,362 ½ acres; for 214,549 ¾ of which grants have already iſſued.<note place="margin">Waſhington county.</note> Of the remaining 531,812 ¼ acres, a conſiderable proportion were declared void by the laws of the ſtate, and were particularly excluded from the cover of the reſervation in the deed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023913_0004_0FC289BB06815438"/>
of ceſſion, by this clauſe in it, to wit, "Provided that nothing herein contained ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to extend, to the making good any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or any grant or grants, heretofore declared void, by any act or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the General Aſſembly of this ſtate." Still it is to be conſidered, that many of theſe perſons have ſettled and improved the lands, are willing, as is ſaid, to comply with ſuch conditions as ſhall be required of other purchaſers, form a ſtrong barrier on the new frontier, acquired by the treaty of Holſton, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore objects meriting the conſideration of the Legiſlature.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Entries in Sullivan county, amounting to 240,624 acres;<note place="margin">Sullivan county.</note> for 173,332 acres of which, grants have already iſſued; of the remaining entries, many are certified void, and others underſtood to be lapſed or otherwiſe voidable under the laws of the ſtate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Certain pre-emption rights granted to the firſt ſettlers of Davidſon county,<note place="margin">Pre-emptions.</note> on Cumberland river, amounting to 309,760 acres.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A grant of 200,000 acres to Richard Henderſon and others on Powel's and Clinch's rivers,<note place="margin">Henderſon.</note> extending up Powel's river in a breadth of not leſs than 4 miles, and down Clinch's from their junction in a breadth not leſs than 12 miles. A great part of this is within the Indian territory.</p>
            <p>Among the grants of the ſtate now under recapitulation, as forming excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the abſolute rights of the United States, are not to be reckoned here two grants of 2,000 acres each to Alexander Martin and David Wilſon,<note place="margin">Martin &amp; Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> adjacent to the lands allotted to the officers and ſoldiers; nor a grant of 25,000 acres on Duck river to the late Major General Greene;<note place="margin">General Greene.</note> becauſe they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the Indian territory, as acknowledged by the treaties of Hopewell and Holſton.</p>
            <p>The extent of the third reſervation in favor of entries made in Armſtrong's office is not yet entirely known, nor can be till the 20th of December, 1702,<note place="margin">Armſtrong's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> the laſt day given for perfecting them: the ſum of certificates, however, which had been paid for theſe warrants into the treaſury of the ſtate, before the 20th day of May 1790, reaches in all probability near to their whole amount; this was £.373,649: 6: 5, currency of that ſtate, and at the price of £.10 the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred acres, eſtabliſhed by law, ſhews that warrants had iſſued for 3,736,493 acres; for 1,762,660 of theſe, grants have paſſed, which appear to have been located partly in the counties of Greene and Hawkins, and partly in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from thence to the Miſſiſippi, as divided into Eaſtern, Middle, and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern diſtricts. Almoſt the whole of theſe locations are within the Indian terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Beſides the warrants paid for as before mentioned, it is known that there are ſome others out-ſtanding and not paid for: but perhaps theſe need not be taken into account, as payment of them has been diſputed on the ground, that the lands being within the Indian territory, cannot now be delivered to the holders of the warrants.</p>
            <p>On a review of all the reſervations, after making ſuch conjectural allowance as our information authorizes, for the proportion of them, which may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Indian boundaries, it appears probable that they cover all the ceded lands ſuſceptible of culture, and cleared of the Indian title, that is to ſay, all the habitable parts of the two triangles beforementioned, excepting only the lands ſouth of French Broad, and Big Pigeon Rivers. Theſe were part of the tract appropriated by the laws of the ſtate, to the uſe of the Indians, whoſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle being purchaſed at the late treaty of Holſton, they are now free to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by the United States, and are probably the only lands open to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, within this ſouth-weſtern territory, which can excite the attention of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers. They are ſuppoſed to amount to about 300,000 acres, and we are told that 300 families have already ſet down upon them without right or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</p>
            <p>The territory of the United States north-weſt of the Ohio,<note place="margin">North-weſtern territory.</note> is bounded on the ſouth by that river, on the eaſt by Pennſylvania, on the north and weſt,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023913_0005_0FC289BEE72D5F88"/>
by the lines which divide the United States from the dominions of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Spain.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Claims of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note>The part of this territory occupied by Indians, is north and weſt of the following lines, eſtabliſhed with the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippawas, and Ottawas, by the treaty of Fort M'Intoſh, and, with the Shawaneſe, by that of the Great Miami, to wit: beginning at the mouth of the Cayahoga, and running up the river to the portage, between that and the Tuſcaroras branch of the Muſkingum, then down the ſaid branch to the Forks, at the croſſing place above Fort Lawrence, then weſtwardly, towards the portage of the Big Miami, to the main branch of that river, then down the Miami to the fork of that river next below the old Fort, which was taken by the French in 1752; thence due weſt to the river De la Panſe, and down that river to the Wabaſh. So far the lines are preciſely defined, and the whole country ſouthward of theſe lines, and eaſtward of the Wabaſh cleared of the claims of thoſe Indians, as it is alſo of thoſe of the Poutiwatimas, and Sacs, by the treaty of Muſkingum. How far on the other ſide of the Wabaſh, the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern boundary of the Indians has been defined, we know not. It is only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in general, that their title to the lower country, between that river and the Illinois, has been formally extinguiſhed by the French, while in their poſſeſſion. As to that country then, and what lies ſtill beyond the Illinois, it would ſeem expedient that nothing be done, till a fair aſcertainment of boundary can take place, by mutual conſent, between us and the Indians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted.</p>
            <p>The country within the Wabaſh, the Indian line before deſcribed, the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania line, and the Ohio, contains, on a looſe eſtimate, about 55,000 ſquare miles, or 35 millions of acres.</p>
            <p>During the Britiſh government, great numbers or perſons had formed themſelves into companies under different names,<note place="margin">Ancient compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> ſuch as the Ohio, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bache, the Illinois, the Miſſiſippi, or Vandalia companies, and had covered, with their applications, a great part of this territory. Some of them had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained orders on certain conditions, which, having never been fulfilled, their titles were never completed by grants. Others were only in a ſtate of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, when the Britiſh authority was diſcontinued. Some of theſe claims being already under a ſpecial reference by order of Congreſs, and all of them probably falling under the operation of the ſame principles, they will not be noticed in the preſent report.</p>

            <p n="2">II. The claims of individual citizens derived from the United States them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe of the continental army,<note place="margin">Continental ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> founded on the reſolutions of Congreſs of September 16, 1776, Auguſt 12, and September 30, 1780, and fixed by the ordinance of May 20, 1785. The reſolution of October 22, 1787, and the ſupplementary ordinance of July 9, 1788, in the ſeven ranges of town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, beginning at a point on the Ohio, due north from the weſtern termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a line then lately run, as the ſouthern boundary of Pennſylvania: or in a ſecond tract of a million of acres, bounded eaſt, by the 7th range of the ſaid townſhips, ſouth by the lands of Cutler and Sargent; north, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the northern boundary of the ſaid townſhips; and going towards the weſt ſo far as to include the above quantity; or, laſtly, in a third tract of country; beginning at the mouth of the Ohio, and running up the Miſſiſippi to the river Au Va<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e, thence up the ſame till it meets a weſt line from the mouth of the Little Wabaſh; thence along that line to the Great Wabaſh; thence down the ſame, and the Ohio, to the beginning. The ſum total of the ſaid military claims is 1,851,800 acres.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe of the individuals who made purchaſes of land at New-York,<note place="margin">Purchaſers at New-York.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid ſeven ranges of townſhips, according to the reſolutions of Congreſs of April 21, 1787, and the ſupplementary ordinance of July 9, 1788, which claims amount to 150,896 acres.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The purchaſe of one million and a half acres of land by Cutler and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, on behalf of certain individuals,<note place="margin">Ohio company·</note> aſſociated under the name of the Ohio Company. This begins where the Ohio is interſected by the weſtern bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſeventh range of townſhips, and runs due north on that boundary 1306 chains and 25 links; thence due weſt to the weſtern boundary of the 17th range of townſhips; thence due ſouth to the Ohio, and up that river to the beginning; the whole area containing 1,781,760 acres of land, whereof 281,760 acres, conſiſting of various lots and townſhips, are reſerved to the United States.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The purchaſe by the ſame Cutler and Sargent on behalf alſo of themſelves and others.<note place="margin">Scioto company</note> This begins at the north-eaſtern angle of the tract of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe before deſcribed, and runs due north to the northern boundary of the tenth townſhip from the Ohio; thence due weſt, to the Sioto; thence down the ſame, and up the Ohio to the ſouth-weſtern angle of the ſaid purchaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed, and along the weſtern and northern boundaries thereof to the beginning; the whole area containing 4,901,480 acres of land, out of which, however, five lots, to wit, Nos. 8, 11, 16, 26, and 29 of every townſhip, of ſix miles ſquare, are retained by the United States, and out of the whole are retained the three townſhips of Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrun, and Salem; and certain lands around them, as will be hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The purchaſe of John Cleves Symmes,<note place="margin">Symmes.</note> bounded on the weſt by the Great Miami; on the ſouth by the Ohio; on the eaſt by a line which is to begin on the bank of the Ohio, 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> miles from the mouth of the Great Miami, as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured along the ſeveral courſes of the Ohio, and to run parallel with the general
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023913_0007_0FC289C7873C0530"/>
courſe of the ſaid Great Miami; and on the north by an eaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and weſt line, ſo run as to include a million of acres in the whole area, whereof five lots, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered as before mentioned, are reſerved out of every townſhip by the United States.</p>
            <p>It is ſuggeſted that this purchaſer, under colour of a firſt and larger propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the board of treaſury, which was never cloſed, (but pending that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) ſold ſundry parcels of land, between his eaſtern boundary before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and the Little Miami; and that the purchaſers have ſettled thereon. If theſe ſuggeſtions prove true, the ſettlers will, perhaps, be thought to merit the favor of the legiſlature, as purchaſers for valuable conſideration, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice of the defect of title.</p>
            <p>The contracts for lands, which were at one time under conſideration with Meſſrs. Flint and Parker,<note place="margin">Flint &amp; Parker. Morgan.</note> and with Colonel Morgan, were never ſo far proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to bring either party under any obligation. All proceedings thereon were diſcontinued at a very early ſtage, and it is ſuppoſed that no further views exiſt with any party. Theſe, therefore, are not to be enumerated among exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claims.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Three townſhips were reſerved by the ordinance of May 20, 1785, adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to Lake Erie,<note place="margin">Canadian refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees.</note> for refugees from Canada and Nova-Scotia, and for other purpoſes, according to reſolutions of Congreſs, made or to be made on that ſubject. Theſe would of courſe contain 69,120 acres.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <note place="margin">Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note>7. The ſame ordinance of May 20, 1785, appropriated the three towns of Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrun, and Salem, on the Muſkingum, for the chriſtian Indians formerly ſettled there, or the remains of that ſociety, with the grounds round about them, and the quantity of the ſaid circumjacent grounds, for each of the ſaid towns, was determined by the reſolution of Congreſs of September 3d, 1788, to be ſo much as, with the plat of its reſpective town, ſhould make up 4000 acres; ſo that the three towns and their circumjacent lands were to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 12,000 acres. This reſervation was accordingly made out of the larger purchaſe of Cutler and Sargent, which comprehended them. The Indians, however, for whom the reſervation was made, have choſen to emigrate beyond the limits of the United States, ſo that the lands reſerved for them, ſtill remain to the United States.</p>
            <p>On the whole, it appears that the United States may rightfully diſpoſe of all the lands between the Wabaſh,<note place="margin">
