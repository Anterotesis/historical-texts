         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FOraſmuch as your whole Devotion ought to be ſpiritual, ſo muſt likewiſe this ſalutary Work of Catechizing; and becauſe this is done by many with ſo little, yea, without any Spirituality, we deſire to give you ſome brief Directions how you are to behave in a becoming Manner, as in the Sight of God, before, at, and after catechizing; praying that the Lord will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you to apprehend, deſire, and practiſe the ſame.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>In the firſt Place, your Views ought to be pure; to learn to know, to obey and glorify God, to edify one another, and to further your own Salvation, (which we hope you may have good Grounds to expect) let the Frame of your Hearts be humble, and ſeek to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of your natural Ignorance, and Inability in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things.</p>
               <p>Let this fill you with an holy Shame, and excite in you a true Deſire to be delivered from theſe Things, and to be conformable to the Image of God in true Wiſdom, be ye therefore ſubject to this Way of Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the Diſcretion of your Miniſter in Reſpect to his Orders and Directions, for thoſe who learn, ought by all Means to be obedient herein, according to Heb.
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010001_0004_0F7B7AAD672024D0"/>13.17. "Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves"; And that, our Lord would have done, in Reſpect even to the Phariſees and Scribes, Matt. 23.3. "All therefore whatever they bid you, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do."</p>

               <head>III.</head>
               <p>Furthermore, you are ſeveral Ways to prepare your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; above all Things draw nigh to God in Prayer, and therein let your Deſires be in the following Order: That beſides the Things before-mentioned, the Lord may give you a clear Underſtanding to comprehend Matters; a ſanctified Judgment to value them; a ſtrong Memory, to remember them; and an unwearied Deſire and Diligence, to improve therein; a ſettled Attention, to underſtand the Queſtions and Anſwers; a ready Utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with other Qualifications, in order to expreſs Matters according to the Truth and Worth thereof; as likewiſe, the Guidance of the Holy Spirit, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Excellence and Glory of thoſe Things; and finally that the Lord may incline and move your Hearts, agreeable to the Subject treated on. Endeavour to learn ſome ſhort and comprehenſive Book of Inctruction by Heart, which may afterwards ſerve as a Foundation for farther Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Learn alſo to get perfectly by Heart, the moſt neceſſary Paſſages of Scripture; in your Preparations, uſe yourſelf to get a diſtinct Apprehenſion in your Underſtanding and Memory, of the Things you are to anſwer; and to that End ſtudy a little upon each Matter: Make it your Practice to meditate upon them, ſo that when you come to catechize, you may know what you underſtand, and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010001_0005_0F7B7AAE23432538"/>what not, and to what you are more particularly to give Attention; hence it will appear, that you have not learn'd to repeat it without Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Let him that hath made ſome Progreſs, read another Book on the ſame Subject; but in reading other Books keep this Rule, that you read not many Books, but read one Book often; being thus prepared, go out with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Heart, truſting in the Lord; and to this End, maintain continually on your Mind, a lively Senſe of this, viz. That without the Divine Aſſiſtance, you will not be fit for any Word or Duty; but that with his Aſſiſtance, you ſhall enjoy all thoſe required Qualifications, and their Effects.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>IV.</head>
               <p>Expecting thus the Favour of the Lord, go to the Place of Catechizing, with a Mind ready and deſirous to make Profeſſion; and give Account as in the Preſence of God, of the Knowledge the Lord hath given you; yea, with a Deſign by theſe Means, to advance in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Sanctification.</p>
               <p>Being there, let Gravity be ſo conſpicuous in your whole Deportment, that others may obſerve that the Preſence of God, and the Weight of his Divine Truths, impreſs your Soul.</p>
               <p>And offer both Soul and Body to the Lord, ſolemnly deſiring, that the Lord may ſo diſpoſe and govern thee, as may be moſt to his Glory and thy Salvation.</p>

            <div n="5" type="part">
               <head>V.</head>
               <p>Beware of interrupting, contradicting, or croſs-queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning thy Miniſter; leſt thou ſhould ſeem to pretend
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010001_0006_0F7B7AAEDFC5A2F0"/>to be his Maſter, or through thy Self-Conceit, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring his Perſon and Service into Diſreſpect.</p>
               <p>But endeavour carefully to attend to his Queſtions, to underſtand them, and when he hath propounded the Queſtion, then anſwer; but when the Miniſter begins to ſpeak again, you muſt be ſilent, and not continue ſpeaking with him.</p>
               <p>In Regard to the Manner of thy Expreſſion, take Heed of Affectation, of ſpeaking inarticulately or heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly; but on the contrary, take Care to ſpeak with a Voice ſufficiently loud and clear, ſo that not only the Miniſter and the Perſon ſpeaking, but all preſent, may underſtand; every one ſpeaking in his natural Tone of Voice, tho' with Reverence, ſlow, and grave, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature and Weight of the Matter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="part">
               <head>VI.</head>
               <p>This being ſo in general, we are further to notice, how you are to behave in ſeveral Circumſtances; and firſt, when you are queſtioned, and God enables you to anſwer; acknowledge that it is from him, and in Humility render him Thanks for the ſame; but if you have not anſwered well, be not diſcouraged, and don't reſolve to ceaſe catechizing; but remember, that you come to that Duty not as one who knoweth every Thing, but as a Learner, who deſires to know theſe Things; be not altogether ſilent, that waſtes Time, makes the Miniſter concerned, and ſeems to reflect upon the Importance of the Queſtion; but ſay, either that you know it not, or what you apprehend to be the meaning; and ſhew your Deſire of receiving Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Miniſter; in Reſpect to God, acknowledge your Ignorance, and your Obligation to know thoſe
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010001_0007_0F7B7AAFA6F3D8F8"/>Things; Pray for the Forgiveneſs of the Sins of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and for Increaſe of true Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Endeavour to quicken your Heart in the Uſe of Means for further Inſtruction, endeavour to underſtand what the Miniſter ſays in explaining the Subject, thank God for his Goodneſs in ſending you ſuch a Miniſter or Miniſters, by whoſe Means the Lord is pleaſed to teach you that which you know not, and yet neceſſarily muſt know; and endeavour for the Future, better to prepare thyſelf.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="part">
               <head>VII.</head>
               <p>When others are queſtioned, think not then what you ſhall be aſked, but rather what would I have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered thereon, and endeavour to underſtand what is ſaid in Explication thereof; if others know that, do not envy them, but thank God for the Gifts and Wiſdom beſtowed on them, and deſire to be equal to them.</p>
               <p>If they know it not, do not deſpiſe nor ridicule them; don't boaſt nor exalt thyſelf, leaſt the Lord alſo put thee to Silence or Confuſion, when thou anſwereſt; but pray for them, that God may grant them more Light, Deſire, Memory, Boldneſs, and Ability; and animate and encourage them hereto, as much as in you lies.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="part">
               <head>VIII.</head>
               <p>Finally, Catechizing being finiſhed, here alſo the End muſt crown the Work.</p>
               <p>Let Pride and Vanity be far from thee, it is very unbecoming that young People ſhould come from ſuch Exerciſe as from a vain idle Place, entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with laughing, and in this laughing and ſporting, exalting themſelves and deſpiſing others, repeating what
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:010001_0008_0F7B7AB05E7D8EA8"/>they themſelves knew or did not know, ſpeaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in a diſreſpectful Manner; ſo that ſuch People ſhew their own Folly, and prevent the Freedom of others.</p>
               <p>But on the Contrary, let Sobriety and Gravity be your Ornaments; go alone or with one another to your Houſes, ponder on the Subject you have heard, ſearch as in the Divine Preſence, how you have behaved at Catechizing. Be not content that your Ears only have heard, but endeavour after an hearty Experience of thoſe Things.</p>
               <p>Thank God for what you have had an Opportunity of hearing, and ſpeaking; endeavour to preſerve it in thy Heart and Memory, yea even on Paper, in Order to make Uſe thereof occaſionally; to that End, pray God for the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to preſerve and bring thoſe Things to your Remembrance.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="part">
               <head>IX.</head>
               <p>And above all, it is thy Duty to ſhew, that thoſe Truths you have made Profeſſion of, do not conſiſt in Words but in Power; and that, in an Holy Converſation, foraſmuch as it is a Doctrine leading to Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Speak not of theſe Things only in the Catechize, but let Heart and Mouth be filled therewith, in Order alſo to ſpeak thereof at every Opportunity; ſeek to be an Example to others in Doctrine, Rebuking, Direction, Comforting and Sanctification.</p>
               <p>Thus beloved Learner, we have ſet before you ſome of thoſe Matters, which you are to practiſe in regard to Catechiſing; may God enable you to practiſe this Duty to his Glory, to the Ornament of his Church, Edification of others, and to thine own Salvation.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the internal or innate Knowledge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That which is natural in the Hearts of all Men Rom. 1.19. <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Q.</hi> How can there be ſuch an innate Knowledge, ſince there are Fools who ſay in their Hearts <hi>there is no God?</hi> Pſ. 14.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is wiſhing rather than believing that there is no God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Q.</hi> What is the external or acquired Knowledge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is that which we learn from the Creatures without us, Pſ. 19.1, 2. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his Handy-Work. Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night ſheweth Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Q.</hi> How can we conclude from the Creatures, that there-muſt be a God?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they cannot be, nor exiſt of themſelves, but muſt neceſſarily be created, and continually upheld by God. Job 12.9. <hi>Who, knoweth not in all theſe, that the Hand of the Lord hath wrought this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Q.</hi> Is this natural Knowledge ſufficient to Salvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Q.</hi> Why not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe we thereby cannot know Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Q.</hi> Is the Knowledge of Chriſt ſo neceſſary to Salvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, John 17.3. <hi>This is eternal Life that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Q. Whence muſt we attain this ſaving Knowledge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From the Scriptures. 2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take Heed, as unto a Light ſhining in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day Star ariſe in your Hearts.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> WHAT do you underſtand by the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The written Word of God. John 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which teſtify of me.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And that from a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe to Salvation, thro' Faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Q.</hi> Has there always been a written Word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: Before the Time of Moſes the Word was not written.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Q.</hi> How did God then make known his Word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By Speech and Revelation to the Fathers. Gen. 18.1. <hi>And the</hi> LORD <hi>appeared unto Abraham in the Plains of Mamre, and He ſat in the Tent Door in the Heat of the Day.</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010001_0011_0F7B7AB37B354D88"/>Chap. 28.12. <hi>And he dreamed and behold a Ladder ſet upon the Earth and the Top of it reached unto Heaven: And behold the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Q.</hi> How did they then preſerve that among themſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By Tradition of the Fathers to the Children. Gen. 18.19. <hi>For I know him, that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord to do Juſtice and Judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Q.</hi> How could that be done then, better than now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe then Men lived longer, were fewer in Number, God revealed himſelf more frequently, and the Wiles of Satan were fewer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Q.</hi> Who hath cauſed the Scriptures to be written?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God. 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and is profitable for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Q. By whom hath he cauſed them to be written?</p>
               <p>A. The Old Teſtament by the Prophets, and the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. Exod. 17.14. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, write this for a Memorial in a Book, and rehearſe it in the Ears of Joſhua,</hi> Rev. 1 19. <hi>Write the Things which thou haſt ſeen, and the Things which are, and the Things which ſhall be hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Q. By whom were they inſpired, in writing this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the Holy Ghoſt: 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>For the Prophecy came not in old Time by the Will of Man: But Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Q. Could they not err in writing the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>A. No: The Holy Spirit hath led them in all Truth, John 16.13. <hi>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide you into all Truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall hear that ſhall he ſpeak, and he will ſhew you Things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Q. How many Teſtaments are there in the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>A. Two; the Old and New Teſtament. 2 Cor. 3.14. <hi>But their Minds were blinded; for until this Day remaineth the ſame Vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teflament;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010001_0012_0F7B7AB43B799218"/>which Vail is done away in Chriſt.</hi> Heb. 9.15. <hi>And for this Cauſe, he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by Means of Death, for the Redemption of the Trangreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the Promiſe of eternal Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Q. In what Language is the Old Teſtament written?</p>
               <p>A. In the Hebrew, and a ſmall Part in the Chaldean Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Q. In what Language is the New Teſtament written?</p>
               <p>A. In the Greek.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Q. Is the whole Scripture a divine Book?</p>
               <p>A. Yes: Becauſe ſuch Things are therein contained which can only be of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Q. What Things are theſe?</p>
               <p>A. Myſteries, ſuch as the Holy Trinity; the Creation of all Things out of nothing in ſix Days; that Jeſus is God-Man, the Mediator, &amp;c and Prophecies of Things to come duly fulfilled, both as to Time and Place.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Q. Are not the Apocryphal Books the Word of God?</p>
               <p>A. No: Becauſe they contain Things which are fabulous, and repugnant to the Word of God: For which Reaſon they were never acknowledged as divine, by the Jewiſh Church unto whom <hi>the Oracles of God were committed,</hi> Rom. 3.2.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Q. Are the Scriptures perfect or imperfect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are perfect, Pſ. 19.7. <hi>The</hi> LAW <hi>of the</hi> LORD <hi>is</hi> PERFECT converting the Soul, the TESTIMONY <hi>of the</hi> LORD <hi>is</hi> SURE <hi>making wiſe the ſimple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Q. Is no Part of the Scriptures loſt or falſified?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: They are as entire as ever they have been, Matt. 5.18. <hi>For verily I ſay unto you till Heaven and Earth paſs, one Jot or one Tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Q. Need we to have Traditions of Men, beſides the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: The Scriptures alone are ſufficient. Matt. 15.9. <hi>But in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010001_0013_0F7B7AB4D8BBD150"/>
19. Q. Are the Scriptures clear or obſcure?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are clear in thoſe Things that are neceſſary to Salvation. Pſ. 119.105. <hi>Thy Word is a Light for my Feet, and a Lamp for my Path.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Q. Why then doth the Apoſtle Peter ſay, that in the Epiſtles of Paul <hi>are ſome Things hard to be underſtood.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Truth of a Thing although in itſelf clearly revealed may be hard to be underſtood, thus it is with all Myſteries, as the Holy Trinity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Q. May and muſt we read the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Certainly yes. John 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for, in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which teſtify of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Q. How muſt we read and ſearch the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt in the Fear of God, Pſ. 111.10. <hi>The Fear of the</hi> LORD <hi>is the beginning of Wiſdom: A good Underſtanding have all they that do his Commandments; his Praiſe endureth for ever.</hi> 2dly. With a praying Heart, Pſ. 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine Eyes that I may behold wondrous Things out of thy Law.</hi> 3dly. With Reverence, Iſaiah 66.2 <hi>and</hi> 5, <hi>But to this Man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit, and trembleth at my Word. Hear ye the Word of the Lord ye that tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my Name's Sake, ſaid let the Lord be glorified: But he ſhall appear to your Joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> 4thly. With Attention and Spiritual Judgment, 1 Cor. 2.13. <hi>Which Things alſo we ſpeak, not in the Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual Things with Spiritual.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A perfect, and an infinite Spirit. John 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in truth.</hi> Matt. 5.48. <hi>Be ye therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All this muſt be underſtood improperly, as meaning ſuch Perfections in God as have ſome Analogy with the Uſe of thoſe human Members.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Q Wherein muſt God be known?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In his Being. 2. In his Names. 3. In his Attributes. 4. In his Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Q. May we aſcribe Being or Eſſence to God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Though not in a corporal Senſe. Prov. 8.14. <hi>Council is mine and ſound Wiſdom</hi> (or as it may be rendered, <hi>Eſſence</hi>) <hi>I am Underſtanding, I have Strength.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> But one God. 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; For there is none like unto him. Gen. 32.29. <hi>And Jacob aſked him, and ſaid, tell me I pray thee thy Name: And he ſaid wherefore is it that thou doſt aſk after my Name? and he bleſſed him there.</hi> Judges 13.18. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord ſaid unto him, why aſkeſt thou thus after my Name, ſeeing it is ſecret?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To diſtinguiſh them from other Men, who are their Equals.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; But the Name of the Divine Eſſence itſelf; He is by Nature God, in Oppoſition to the Idols. Gal. 4.8. When ye knew not God, ye did Service unto them which by Nature are no Gods.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Q. Is not the Name of God given to Angels and Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates? Pſ. 82.6 <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and ye are all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Moſt High.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. Are God's Attributes diſtinct from himſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No: They are God himſelf; therefore he is called the Light, 1 John 1.5. <hi>This then is the Meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all,</hi> Life, Truth, and Love, 1 John 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love,</hi> Even Holineſs itſelf; to ſwear by his Holineſs, and ſwearing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is one and the ſame. Amos 4.2. <hi>The Lord God hath ſworn by his Holineſs, that lo the Day ſhall come upon you, that he will take you away with Hooks, and your Poſterity with Fiſhbooks.</hi> Compared with Heb. 6.13. <hi>For when God made Promiſe to Abraham, becauſe he could ſwear by no greater he ſware by</hi> HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Q. Are God's Attributes different and diſtinct from each other?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not in God; For in him all is infinite Perfection; But they are diſtinguiſhed only according to our Manner of Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and according to the ſeveral Exerciſes of God's Perfections concerning the Creatures.</p>

3. Q. How are God's Attributes, or Properties thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſtinguiſhed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Into incommunicable and communicable Properties, Gen. 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, let us make Man in our Image. after our Likeneſs:</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes: That by theſe you might be made Partakers of the divine Nature.</hi> 1 John 3.2. <hi>Beloved now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: But we know that when we ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Q. Which are the incommunicable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Independency, Simplicity, Eternity, Omnipreſence, Unchangeableneſs of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Q. Why do you call them incommunicable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe there is not the leaſt Reſemblance of them in any Creature.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Q. What is God's Independency?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That he is Self exiſtent. Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Q.</hi> What is God's Simplicity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That all in God is one without Compoſition of different Sorts. Deut. 6.4. <hi>Hear, O! Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Q. What is God's Eternity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That he is, 1. Without Beginning. 2. Without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion or Difference of Time. 3. Without End. Pſ. 90.2. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the Earth and the World, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting thou art God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Q. Doth it belong to God's Eternity, that there is no Succeſſion of Time with him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: <hi>For one Day is with the Lord as a thouſand Years, and a thouſand Years as one Day.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Q. Where is God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Every where preſent. Jer. 23.23, 24. <hi>Am I a God at Hand, ſaith the Lord, and not a God after off? Can any hide
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010001_0018_0F7B7ABA1E868788"/>himſelf in ſecret Places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord: Do I not fill Heaven and Earth? ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Q. Muſt this be underſtood only of his Operations, or of his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It muſt be underſtood both as to his Eſſence and Oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which cannot be ſeparated, becauſe he worketh by Virtue of his Eſſence or Being. Acts 17.27. <hi>That they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if happily they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Q. Why is God ſaid to be particularly in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe he there ſheweth forth his Glory more than any where elſe. Iſaiah 66.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Footſtool; where is the Houſe that ye build me, and where is the Place of my reſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Q Is God changeable or unchargeable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Unchangeable, Malachi 3.6. <hi>For I am the Lord, I change not: Therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Q. Nevertheleſs, Repentance is aſcribed unto God; Gen. 6.6. <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This Repentance in God is only a Change in his Work: Not in his Will and Being, Numb. 23.19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lie, neither the Son of Man that he ſhould repent: Hath he ſaid and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not make it good?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Q. Change of Place is alſo aſcribed unto him, as that he deſcended, came to, and went from certain Places? Gen. 11.5. <hi>The Lord came down to ſee the City and the Tower which the Children of Men builded?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This is only a Change in a more or leſs Manifeſtation of his divine Preſence, tho' not in his eſſential Preſence itſelf.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Q. Which are the communicable Attributes of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The following are generally accounted ſuch, to wit, God's Knowledge, Will and Power, his Goodneſs, Grace, Mercy and Patience.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Q. Why are theſe called communicable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010001_0019_0F7B7ABB582555E0"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe there is ſome faint Reſemblance of them in the Creatures; although as they are in God they are infinite, and ſo incommunicable.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Q. What is God's Knowledge?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that divine Perfection, whereby he knoweth all Things in himſelf from Eternity, in the moſt perfect Manner. Acts 15.18. Known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Q. What is the Object of God's Knowledge?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All Things: He is therefore Omniſcient, 1 John 3.20. <hi>For if our Hearts condemn us, God is more than our Hearts, and knoweth all Things.</hi> Pſ. 147.4. <hi>He telleth the Number of the Stars: He calleth them all by their Names.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Q. Doth God know all future and poſſible Things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Pſ. 139.2. <hi>Thou knoweſt my down-ſitting, and mine up-riſing, thou underſtandeſt my Thoughts after off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. Q. Doth he know them by Virtue of a preceding De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or by Way of a mediate Knowledge, as it is called?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He knoweth them by Virtue of his Decrees; and with an abſolute Certainty that they ſhall take Place.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Q. How is the Will of God diſtinguiſhed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Into his Will in his Decree, and his Will in his Precept; or in other Words; into his ſecret, and revealed Will.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Q. What do you mean by God's Will in his Decree?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> God's eternal Purpoſe, according to which he doth all Things in Time. Eph. 1.11. <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an Inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the Purpoſe of him who worketh all Things after the Council of his own Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Q. What is God's preceptive or revealed Will?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that which he hath preſcribed in his Word as a Rule for us, and which it is his Will we ſhould obey, Rom. 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect Will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. Q. By which of theſe two muſt we be regulated?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010001_0020_0F7B7ABB9B86D830"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> According to his preceptive Will: for the Will of God in his Decree is unknown to us. Deut. 29.29. <hi>The ſecret Things belong unto the Lord our God: But thoſe Things which are revealed belong unto us and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the Words of this Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. Q. What is the Juſtice of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that divine Perfection by which he doth hate and puniſh all Sin. Pſ. 5.4.5, 6. <hi>For thou art not a God that hath Pleaſure in Wickedneſs: Neither ſhall Evil dwell with thee. The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy Sight, thou hateſt all Workers of Iniquity. Thou ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeak leaſing: The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Q. Muſt God of Neceſſity puniſh all Sin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, Rom. 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit ſuch Things are worthy of Death, not only do the ſame, but have Pleaſure in them that do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. Q. Is God under any Conſtraint?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, but when we ſay God muſt, we mean he wills with the moſt perfect Freedom. Heb. 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and canſt not look on Iniquity: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy Tongue when the Wicked devoureth the Man that is more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. But cannot God diſpenſe with his Juſtice, at leaſt in ſome Meaſure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, for then he would deny himſelf; for his Juſtice is God himſelf. Exod 34.6, 7. <hi>And the Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth-Keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquity and Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Sin, and that will</hi> BY NO MEANS CLEAR THE GUILTY; <hi>viſiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Children's Children unto the third and fourth Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. Q. But God however forgiveth Believers the Guilt and Puniſhment of Sins?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Then God's Juſtice is already ſatisfied in Chriſt, who hath borne the Puniſhment of Sins for them. Eph. 1.7. <hi>In
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010001_0021_0F7B7ABD809CEBE0"/>whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of ins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. Q. Of what Kind is God's Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is an Almighty Power, Matt. 19.26. <hi>But Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, and ſaid unto them, with Men this is impoſſible, but with God all Things are poſſible;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. Q. Can God die, ſin, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No: For that would be no Power, but an Inability.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Q. What is God's Goodneſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In general his Benevolence towards his Creatures. Pſ. 4.6 7. <hi>There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any Good: Lord liſt thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou haſt put Gladneſs in my Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> More particularly the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Beneficence and Love towards his Creatures, towards Man, and more eſpecially towards his Saints, Pſ. 36.6. <hi>O Lord, thou preſerveſt Man and Beaſt.</hi> John 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="34">34. Q. What is God's Grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that divine Goodneſs whereby he doeth Good to his Creatures, without any Regard to their Merits.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Q. How many Kinds of Grace are there?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There are two Sorts, general towards all, Matt. 5.45. <hi>For he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil and on the Good, and ſendeth Rain on the Juſt and Unjuſt.</hi> or ſpecial and ſaving, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Elect only. Rom. 3.24 <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Matt. 11.25. <hi>At that Time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth: becauſe thou haſt hid theſe Things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and baſt revealed them unto Babes,</hi> Gen. 6.8. <hi>But Noah found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord;</hi> and Luke 1.30. <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto her, fear not Mary, for thou haſt found Favour with God.</hi> And this Grace is preventing, opperating, and following.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Q. What is God's Mercy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that divine Goodneſs toward the miſerable elect
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010001_0022_0F7B7ABE0EF23BA0"/>Sinner, by which he actually reſtores him to a State of Grace, through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt. Exod. 34.6. <hi>And the Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed the</hi> LORD, <hi>the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Goodneſs and Truth.</hi> Eph. 2.4. <hi>But God, who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="37">37. Q. What is God's Patience, or Long ſuffering?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that divine Goodneſs, whereby he defers the juſt Puniſhment of Sin, in order to the Converſion of the Elect, and the Conviction of the Reprobate. Rom. 2.4. Or deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs, and Forbearance and Long-Suffering; not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Q What is God's Sovereignty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is God's ſupreme Authority above all Creatures. Jer. 10 6, 7. <hi>Foraſmuch as there is none like unto thee,</hi> O LORD, <hi>thou art great, and thy Name is great in Might. Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? for to thee doth it appertain: Foraſmuch as among all the Wiſe-Men of the Nations,</hi> And in all their Kingdoms there is none like unto thee. Chap. 18.6. <hi>O Houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you as this Potter? ſaith the Lord. Behold as the Clay is in the Potter's Hand, ſo are ye in mine Hand, O Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Rom. 9.18 and 20. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; It even directs the very Thoughts. Prov. 21.1. <hi>The King's Heart is in the Hand of the Lord, as Rivers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he turneth it whither ſo ever he will.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; For this governing or directing is no Force upon, but the inclining the Will which acts freely.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Q. Doth the Providence of God concern itſelf alſo about Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; He permits it, limits and directs it to a certain End. Gen. 50.20. <hi>But as for you ye thought Evil againſt me,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010001_0037_0F7B7AD0C39D1450"/>but God meant it unto good, to bring to paſs, as it is this Day, to ſave much People alive.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; A holy God cannot be the Author of any Thing that is ſinful, he hates and puniſhes Sin.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Q. Doth God work that which is good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes. 2 Cor 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of ourſelves, to think any Thing as of ourſelves, but our Sufficiency is of God.</hi>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Q. How do we commit them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In Thoughts, Words, and Deeds. Prov. 6.18. <hi>An Heart that deviſeth wicked Imaginations, Feet that be ſwift running to Miſchief.</hi> Matt. 12.36. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that every idle Word that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give Account thereof in the Day of Judgment.</hi> Chap. 15.19. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Thefts, Falſe Witneſs, Blaſphemies.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Q. Wherein doth the Miſery of Man conſiſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In three Things; In Sin, in his Inability to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Q. Is Man then while under Sin, alſo ſpiritually without Strength?</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Q. But hath not Man a Freedom of Will, or a natural Power in himſelf to ſpiritual Good?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; They are Means, whereby God will excite Man as a rational Creature, to his Duty.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Q. What is the Puniſhment of Sin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Death. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. A Separation from God's Favour. 2. An Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency under Sin. Iſaiah 59.2. <hi>Your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your Sins have hid his Face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> Eph. 2.1. <hi>And you he hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi>

                  <p n="12">12. Q. What is eternal Death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> An eternal Puniſhment in Hell, Rev. 14.11. <hi>The Smoke of their Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Q. Do all Sinners merit ſuch Puniſhment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Even the leaſt of them. Gal. 3.10. <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe: For it is written, curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Q. Are there then no pardonable Sins?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Alone in Chriſt; (the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt only excepted) but none are pardonable conſidered in themſelves. James 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Deut. 27.26. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be he that confirmeth not all the Words of this Law to do them: And all the People ſhall ſay,</hi> AMEN.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Q. Is the Covenant of Works aboliſhed thro' Sin?</p>
                  <p>

               <p n="1">1. Queſt. IS there another Covenant eſtabliſhed in the Room of the Covenant of Works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: The Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Q. When was it eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Immediately after the Fall. Gen. 3.15. <hi>I will put En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhall bruiſe his Heel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Q. What is the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Covenant of Grace is, that Method by which God in Chriſt becomes the Sinner's Property, and the Sinner the Property of God. Jer. 31.33. <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe Days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Q. With whom is it eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only with the Elect Sinner. Ezek. 16.6. <hi>And when I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own Blood, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy Blood; Live, yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy Blood, live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Q. What doth God require in this Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That which God requires in, is alſo a Promiſe of the Covenant; Namely, Faith in Chriſt. Hoſ. 2.20. <hi>I will even betroth thee unto me in Faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> Hab. 2.4. <hi>But the Juſt ſhall live by his Faith.</hi> Pſ. 27.8. <hi>When thou ſaidſt, ſeek ye my Face, my Heart ſaid unto thee, thy Face Lord, will I ſeek.</hi>

6. Q. What doth God promiſe therein?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Grace here, and eternal Life hereafter. Acts 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, thou and thy Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Q. Is this Covenant in all Ages eſſentially the ſame?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Q. Were then Believers under the Old Teſtament Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of all the real Benefits of the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; For <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is the ſame Yeſterday and to Day and for ever.</hi> Heb. 13.8.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Q. How doth the Sinner enter into this Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God doth firſt draw near the Sinner, when he invites and beſeeches him with Love. 2 Cor. 5.20. <q>Now we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us: We pray you in Chriſt's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</q> With the greateſt Earneſtneſs and Uprightneſs, Ezek 38.11. <q>Say unto them as I live ſaith the Lord God, I have no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live, turn ye, turn ye from your Evil Ways: For why will ye die O Houſe of Iſrael.</q> And ſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Difficulties, Iſaiah 55.2. <q>Wherefore do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread, and your Labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is Good, and let your Soul delight itſelf in Fatneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Q. What follows ſuch an Invitation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hereby God <hi>draweth the Sinner with Cords of a Man, and Bands of Love.</hi> Hoſ. 11.4.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Q. What doth the called Sinner on his Part?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He receives the LORD as his GOD, and wholly ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelf to him as his Property, Cant. 2.16. <hi>My belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is mine and I am his, be feedeth among the Lillies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Q. What are the Properties of this Conſent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Sinner performs this Solemnly, Freely, Humbly, Faithfully, Uprightly, with a full Conſent as well to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as to the Promiſes of the Covenant, Pſ. 51.6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God remembereth his Covenant for ever. Pſ. 105.8. <hi>He hath remembered his Covenant for ever, the Word which he commanded to a Thouſand Generations.</hi> And thoſe in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant have a Right to aſk for all Things that are neceſſary to Life and Salvation. Pſ. 74.19, 20, 21. <hi>O deliver not the Soul of thy Turtle dove unto the Multitude of the Wicked forget not the Congregation of the Poor for ever. Have Reſpect unto the Covenant: For the dark Places of the Earth are full of the Habitations of Cruelty. O let not the Oppreſſed return aſhamed: Let the Poor and Needy praiſe thy Name.</hi>

                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Iſaiah 53.4. <hi>Surely he hath borne our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows, yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God, and afflicted.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> In two Parts. 1ſt. In obeying the Law, and 2dly. In ſuffering the Puniſhment?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Q. Is the doing or obeying the Law part of his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners. So by the Obedience of one many ſhall be made righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Q. Is his Suffering the Puniſhment due to Sin, alſo part of this Satisfaction?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes; 1ſt. From the Nature of divine Juſtice, which could not forgive Sins unpuniſhed or unſatisfied. 2dly. By Virtue of his Truth, which expreſly hath declared this.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> An actual, abſolute, and perſonal Reconciliation is made, 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> No; But only for his <hi>People,</hi> Matt. 1.21. <hi>And ſhe ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his Name,</hi> JESUS <hi>for he ſhall ſave his</hi> PEOPLE <hi>from their Sins.</hi> For his Sheep, John 10.11. <hi>I am the good Shepherd, the good Shepherd giveth his Life for the</hi> SHEEP. For his Church, Acts 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the</hi> CHURCH OF GOD, WHICH HE HATH PURCHASED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Q. How then are we to underſtand what we often find in Scripture that Chriſt died <hi>for the World</hi> and <hi>for all Men?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> We are to underſtand by ſuch Expreſſions, all the Elect in the World, or the Gentile World, together with the Jews under the New Teſtament; or Men of all Ranks and Degrees.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Q. What are the Effects of this Reconciliation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1ſt. God is now reconciled with the Elect Sinner. 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation,</hi> and 2dly. He receives a Right to eternal Life. Gal. 4.4, 5. <hi>When the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Q. Hath every one a Right to believe that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſatisfied for him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A,</hi> No; But only thoſe who receive him as the meriting, opperating, moving, and exemplary Cauſe of their ſpiritual Life. Titus 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himſelf, a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi> John 12.24. <hi>Verily, Verily I ſay unto you, except a Corn of Wheat fall into the Ground and die, it abideth alone; But if it die it bringeth forth much
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010001_0064_0F7B7AECB2731D88"/>Fruit.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. <hi>For the Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not benceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> Rom. 6.5. <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his</hi> DEATH, <hi>we ſhall be alſo in the Likeneſs of his</hi> RESURRECTION.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt's Benefits may be conſidered as of two Kinds, 1ſt. Such as are beſtowed in this Life; 2dly. Such as ſhall be conferred in the Life to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Q. Which are the Benefits beſtowed in this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The principal or chief are theſe: Vocation, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sanctification.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Q. What Benefits ſhall be conferred in the Life to come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Reſurrection, final Judgment, and eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Q. Is there more than one Sort of calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes there is an external, and an internal, or effectual calling.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Q. How are Sinners externally called?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the Word of God, Prov. 9.3 to 6. <hi>She hath ſent forth her Maidens, ſhe crieth upon the higheſt Places of the City: Whoſo is ſimple let him turn in hither: As for him that wanteth Underſtanding ſhe ſaith to him, come eat of my Bread, and drink of the Wine which I have mingled. Forſake the Fooliſh and live, and go in the Way of Underſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Q. How are they effectually called?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the Spirit of God, Jer. 31.33 <q>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe Days ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Q. Who are externally or outwardly called?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Sorts of Men, even thoſe who are not elected, Matt. 20.16.—<hi>For many are called but few are choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Q. Is then the external Call general?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Among Chriſtians indeed it is, but not throughout the the whole World.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Q. But is not this Call now more general than it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; For then it was confined to the Jews, but now extends alſo to the Gentile Nations.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Q. Is there no ſaving Call in Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:010001_0069_0F7B7AF39DC6C998"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: For Nature is ignorant of Chriſt, and without him there is no Salvation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Q. Is not external calling ſufficient to Converſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; <hi>It is in vain though Paul plant and Apollos wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is God that giveth the Increaſe.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.7.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Q. What muſt ſtill be added to the external Call?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The internal, or effectual Call as is exemplified in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Acts 16.14. <hi>Whoſe Heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended unto the Things that were ſpoken of Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Q. Who are they that are internally called?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only the Elect, Rom. 8.30. <q>Moreover whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; And whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; And whom he juſtified them he alſo glorified.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Q. What is internal calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a powerful Change in the whole Man?</p>
               <p n="16">16. Q. Is there then any Thing to be changed in Man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; The Underſtanding, Will, Affections, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Q. How are they by Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Underſtanding is darkened, the Will is perverſe, the Affections irregular, and the Converſation ſinful. Eph. 4.18. <hi>Having the Underſtanding darkened being alienated from the Life of God, through Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the Blindneſs of their Hearts.</hi> Rom. 8.7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Jude ver. 12.13. <hi>Theſe are Spots in your Feaſts of Charity, when they feaſt with you, feeding themſelves without Fear: Clouds they are without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, carried about of Winds; Trees whoſe Fruit withereth, without Fruit, twice dead plucked up by the Roots, raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own Shame; Wandring Stars, to whom is reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever.</hi> Titus 3.3. <hi>For we ourſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, deceived, ſerving divers Luſts, and Pleaſures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</hi>

18. Q. What is then the Effect of this internal calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Underſtanding is enlightened to know God in his Work of Salvation, Jeſus in his precious Excellencies, and themſelves in their Depravity; being juſtly expoſed to the Curſe. 1 Cor. 2, 12, 13. <hi>Now we have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things which are freely given us of God. Which Things alſo we ſpeak, not in Words, which Man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual Things with ſpiritual.</hi> The Will is inclined to ſerve and glorify God. Rom. 7.15. <hi>For that which I do I allow not: For what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Affections are cleanſed to hate Sin, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to love God as the ſupreme Good, to have a Deſire after Holineſs, &amp;c. Rom. 6.19.—<hi>For as you have yielded your Members Servants to Uncleanneſs and to Iniquity, unto Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: Even ſo now yield your Members Servants to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto Holineſs.</hi> And the whole Converſation is ſanctified.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Q. Is this internal calling powerful?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; It hath an irreſiſtable Power. Eph. 1.19, 20. <hi>And what is the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power to usward, who believe, according to the working of his Power; which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him in Heaven at his own Right Hand in heavenly Places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Q. Is any Thing more done herein than a perſuading the Man by moral Arguments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, there is an inward inclining of the <hi>Will.</hi> Phil. 2 13. <hi>For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Q. Doth God then compel Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; But he makes them willing. Cant. 1.4, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee: The King hath brought me into his Chambers: We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Love more than Wine: the upright love thee,</hi>

22. Q. How is this powerful Effect of the internal calling expreſſed in Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is called a CREATION; <hi>We are his Workmanſhip</hi> CREATED <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. alſo a DRAWING, <hi>no Man can come to me except the Father who ſent me</hi> DRAW <hi>him.</hi> John 6.44.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Church militant; Becauſe it hath a continual Warfare. Rom. 7.23. <hi>But I ſee another Law in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Church triumphant; Becauſe it hath completely conquered. Rev. 7.14.—17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Q. Are they then two different Churches?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; They are only two diſtinct Parts of one and the ſame Church. Eph. 1.10. <hi>That in the Diſpenſation of the Fulneſs of Time, he might gather together in one, all Things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Matt. 16.18. <hi>And I ſay unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church: And the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="10">10. Q. Is the Church then nevertheleſs in being?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, as in the Times of Elijah, when he ſuppoſed that he alone was left, though there were ſeven Thouſand who had not bowed their Knees to Baal, 1 Kings 19.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Q. Who is the Head of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, Eph. 5.23. <hi>For the Huſband is the Head of the Wife, even as Chriſt is the Head of the Church; and he is the Saviour of the Body.</hi>

               <p n="13">13. Q. How do you prove that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe in him is fulfilled that which was foretold of Antichriſt. 2 Theſ. 2.1, to the 11 ver. <hi>Now we beſeech you, Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in Mind, or be troubled, neither by Spirit: nor by Word, nor by Letter, as from us, as that the Day of Chriſt is at Hand, let no Man deceive you by any Means: For that Day ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that Man of Sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition: Who oppoſeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you theſe Things? And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his Time. For the Myſtery of Iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:010001_0073_0F7B7AF6201EA418"/>will let, until he be taken out of the Way. And then ſhall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his Mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the Brightneſs of his coming: Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power and Signs, and lying Wonders, and with all Deceiveableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs, in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, becauſe they received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The pure preaching of the Word of God, and the right Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. John 8.31. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid to thoſe Jews which believed on him, if ye continue in my Word, then ye are my Diſciples indeed.</hi> Acts 2.42. <hi>And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtle's Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The being abſolved from Guilt and Puniſhment, and the having a Right to eternal Life, freely given. Rom. 4.7. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe Sins are covered.</hi> Chap. 5.19. <hi>For as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Juſtification is an Act without us: but Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Work within us. 2. Juſtification taketh away the Guilt, and Sanctification the filth of Sin. 3. Juſtification is perfect at once, but Sanctification in this Life is only in Part.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> God the Father, who herein ſuſtains the Character of a Judge, Iſaiah 43.25. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions, for mine own Sake, and will not remember thy Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Q. What Character does the Son ſuſtain in this Matter?</p>

               <p n="10">10. Q. And what Character doth the Holy Ghoſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A,</hi> That of one who ſealeth, making known and ſealing to us our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Q. Can we then be aſſured of our Juſtification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Rom. 8.16. <hi>The Spirit itſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Q. From what are we juſtified?</p>

               <p n="13">13. Q. For whoſe Sake are we juſtified?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only for the Sake of Chriſt, Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

14. Q. Are we not juſtified on Account of our own Works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; Rom. 3.28. <hi>Therefore we conclude that a Man is juſtified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Q. Why can we not be juſtified for our own Works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the beſt of them are imperfect, and therefore cannot ſatisfy the Juſtice of God. James 3.2. <hi>For in many Things we offend all, if any Man offend not in Word, the ſame is a perfect Man, and able alſo to bridle the whole Body.</hi> Iſaiah 64.6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes are as filthy Rags, and we do all fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind, have taken us away.</hi>

               <p n="16">16. Q. But in Order to our being juſtified by the Merits of Chriſt, muſt they not become ours?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Moſt certainly they muſt. Jer. 23.6. <hi>In his Days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely; And this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called,</hi> THE LORD OUR RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS. 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Q. How do they become ours?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By being imputed, and received by us.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Q. Who doth impute them to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God, by a gracious Gift. Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely, by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. How do we receive that Righteouſneſs?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; The Scripture ſaith that we are juſtified by Faith, and through Faith, but never for Faith.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Q. In what Light is Faith here to be conſidered?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As a Hand or Inſtrument whereby we receive the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt. John 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him, to

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Faith.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Queſt. HOW many Kinds of Faith are there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Four Kinds; An hiſtorical Faith, a temporary Faith, a Faith of Miracles, and a Saving Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Q. What is an hiſtorical Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a bare Aſſent to a known Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Q. Is this a good Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is neceſſary, though not ſufficient. James 2.19. <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doeſt well: The Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Q. What is a Temporary Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is an Aſſent and Profeſſion of the Truth for a Time, with ſome Degree of outward Satisfaction. Matt. 13.20, 21. <hi>But he that received the Seed into ſtony Places, the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it: Yet hath not any Root in himſelf, but dureth for a while: For when Tribulation or Perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Q. What is the Faith of Miracles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a ſtrong Perſuaſion, that a Miracle ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, either by us, or in us. 1 Cor. 13.2.—<hi>And though I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</hi> Matt. 8.10. <hi>Jeſus ſaid verily I ſay unto you, I have not ſound ſo great a Faith, no not Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:010001_0078_0F7B7AFA1D6A5988"/>
6. Q. When did that Faith take Place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that Age of the Church, when the working of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were common.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Q. Is this Faith of Miracles ſaving?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: As appears from 1 Cor. 13.2. <hi>And though I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Q. In how many Things doth ſaving Faith conſiſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In three Things; In Knowledge, Aſſent, and Truſt. Iſaiah 53.11.—<hi>By his Knowledge ſhall my righteous Servant juſtify many; For he ſhall bear their Iniquities.</hi> John 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his Teſtimony, hath ſet to his Seal that God is true.</hi> Iſaiah 27.5. <hi>Or let him take hold of my Strength that he may make Peace with me, and he ſhall make Peace with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Q. Is not an implicit or blind Faith without Knowledge ſufficient?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; John 17.3. <hi>And this is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Q. Which is the principal and properly juſtifying Act of Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is an Act of the Soul, whereby it doth heartily will and deſire, that not only the Promiſes of the Goſpel may be true in themſelves; but alſo ſuch an Act, whereby it doth deſire and actually receive the Lord Jeſus with the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Affection, as the only Cauſe of Salvation, with Denial of Self, and all other Creatures. John 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Q. What are the Effects of the juſtifying Act of Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The particular and certain Application of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and the Lord Jeſus, to the very Perſon of every Believer. Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt and I live; Yet not I but Chriſt liveth in me: And the Life
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010001_0079_0F7B7AFACAF57350"/>which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi> A comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senſe of this, every Believer doth not enjoy at all Times, by Reaſon of the Temptations of Satan, the Accuſations of the Law, and Deluſions of the Fleſh, But to attain this, every one ought to endeavour, who truly receive Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Q. Can and muſt Believers be aſſured of the Reality of their Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They can be aſſured. 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>For I know whom I have believed, and am perſuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that Day.</hi> And they ought to endeavour after it. 2 Cor. 13 5. <hi>Examine yourſelves whether you be in the Faith, prove your ownſelves, know ye not your ownſelves, how that Chriſt Jeſus is in you, except ye be Reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Q. Who worketh this Faith in us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt. Gal. 5.22. <hi>But the Fruit of the Spirit is—Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Q By what Means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the Word. Rom. 10.17. So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Q. Cannot we believe of ourſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; Eph. 2.8. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, and that not of yourſelves; It is the Gift of God.</hi>

2. Q. What is Sanctification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Renovation of the whole Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Q. Is it not only a Change of the outward Actions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: But alſo of the Inward-Man. Rom. 12 2. <hi>Be not conformed to this World: But be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect Will of God</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Q. Doth not an external Change flow from this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; In the whole Converſation. 1 Teſſ. 5.23. <hi>The very God of Peace ſanctiſy you wholly: And I pray God your whole Spirit and Soul, and Body be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Q. Is Sanctification neceſſary?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow Peace with all Men and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Q. Is Sanctification perfect in this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; It is only in Part, and imperfect. Phil. 3.12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: But I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Q. Is Sanctification equally great in all Believers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; It hath its ſeveral Degrees, in the one greater, in the other leſs. Eph. 4.13. <hi>Till we all come in the Unity of Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fullneſs of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil, for verily I ſay unto you till Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs, one Jot or one Tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At the beginning of the New Teſtament. Acts 15.10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a Yoke upon the Neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear.</hi> Gal. 5.2, 3. <hi>Behold I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Blood of Chriſt is ſhed for us.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Q. Is not Bread alone ſufficient in the Holy Supper?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; For Chriſt alſo <hi>took the Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, drink ye all of it.</hi> Matt 26.27.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Q. Is that to be underſtood of all Believers in common?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: <q>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup.</q> 1 Cor. 11.28.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Q. Is Chriſt bodily preſent in the Elements of this Supper?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; His human Nature is only in Heaven. Acts 3.21. <hi>Whom the Heavens muſt receive until the Times of Reſtitution of all Things, which God hath ſpoken by the Mouth of all his Holy Prophets ſince the World began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Q. Are not Bread and Wine changed into his Fleſh and Blood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No: They remain Bread and Wine even after the Bleſſing or Conſecration.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Q. How then can Chriſt ſay: <hi>This is my Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The meaning is, This doth ſignify my Body?</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Q. Doth the Scripture often ſpeak thus?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Frequently. 1 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The Rock was Chriſt.</hi> That is to ſay, it did ſignify Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Q. Cannot we then eat and drink Chriſt himſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not Corporally; but Spiritually.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Q. What is it to eat Chriſt ſpiritually?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To receive him by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Q. For whom is this Holy Supper inſtituted?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="22">22. Q. Not for Children?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; Becauſe they cannot examine themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Q. Concerning what Particulars muſt we examine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                  <p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. Of Man's latter End.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Queſt. SHALL Man always live?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; 'It is appointed for Man once to die, and then the Judgment." Heb 9.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Q. Doth then the whole of Man die?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; For the Soul is immortal. Matt. 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; But rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Q. How many Placesare there for the Soul after Death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only two; Hell or Heaven. Matt. 7.13.14. <hi>Enter ye in at the Strait Gate; For wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way, that leadeth to Deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat: Becauſe ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Q. Do the Souls go there immediately after Death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; As appears in the Caſes of Lazarus and the Rich Man; <hi>The Rich Man</hi> IMMEDIATELY <hi>lifted up his Eyes in Hell; and Lazarus was carried in Abraham's Boſom.</hi> Luke 16.23.23.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Q. Is there no Purgatory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; Rev. 14.13. <hi>And I heard a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying unto me, write, bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them,</hi> The penitent Thief went immediately to Heaven without Purgatory. Luke 23.43 <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, verily I ſay unto thee, this Day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. Shall there be a Reſurrection?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Both of the Juſt and Unjuſt. Acts 24.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Q. When?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> At the laſt Day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Q. Who ſhall raiſe them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Q. Shall the Wicked alſo ariſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; <hi>The Hour is coming in which all that are in the Grave ſhall bear his Voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> John 5.28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Q. With what Bodies ſhall they riſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> With the ſame Bodies; otherwiſe it would be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection but a new Creation; This was the Expectation of Job; <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter Day upon the Earth, and though after my Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God: Whom I ſhall ſee for myſelf, and mine Eyes ſhall behold, and not another; though my Reins be conſumed within me.</hi> Job. 19.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Q. But is this poſſible?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: 'With God all Things are poſſible.' It would ſeem ſtill more impoſible to create the World of nothing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Q. Shall not theſe Bodies be changed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not in their Eſſence, but only in their Qualities.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Q. In what Qualities will they be changed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 
                     <q>This Corruption muſt put on Incorruption, and this Mortal muſt put on Immortality.</q> 1 Cor. 15.53.</p>

2. Q. Shall there be a final Judgment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Acts 17.31. <hi>He hath appointed a Day, in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man whom he hath ordained: Whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi>
