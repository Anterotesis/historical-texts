            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Scriptures Conſulted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT having been publicly aſſerted in a large congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as a ſcripture truth, That unbelievers are under the law and under the curſe, engaged me to look into the ſcriptures for the ſatisfaction of my own mind, to ſee if theſe things were ſo; and knowing the apoſtle to have this ſubject in view in his epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> I have repeatedly looked it over with attention, and found two paſſages which ſeemed at firſt view, to favour the thought, that unbelievers were under the law, &amp;c. namely, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10. <q>As many as are of the works of the law are under the curſe; for it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.</q> Are not unbelievers of the works of the law? Do they not univerſally go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs? and are they not conſequently under the curſe?</p>
            <p>For anſwer it may be ſaid, They are ſo in their own apprehenſions; their unbelief places them there, and there they muſt remain in their own minds, till they believe the report of the goſpel, which is, Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029651_0003_0FE2108DB6A5D670"/>
made a curſe for us. Yet this goſpel is true before it is believed, yea, though it be not believed, ſhall our unbelief make the faith of God of none effect? God forbid.</p>
            <p>The other paſſage is <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 18. <q>If ye be led by the Spirit of God ye are not under the law.</q> Doth not this imply that they were under the law that were not led by the Spirit? What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the paſſage? What is meant by being led by the Spirit? I think the ſimple meaning is, being led by the Spirit's teaching, who takes of the things of Jeſus, and ſhews them unto us; therefore, if our minds receive the truth of the teſtimony concerning Jeſus, we are led by the Spirit; the Spirit's teaching leads to underſtand and believe the written word; and that aſſerts, ye are not under the law, but under grace, therefore if the mind gives in to the Spirit's teaching, it finds this a truth, for the Spirit witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the truth of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Let us then, as being led by the Spirit, follow his teaching by the apoſtle and all the brethren that (ſaith he) are with me who ſay, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 4. <q>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.</q> Here the following thoughts offer to view, <hi>viz</hi> That all that were under the law were redeemed, therefore, if there are any not redeemed, they muſt be thoſe that were not under the law; for, to aſſert that Jeſus Chriſt did not accompliſh what he came for, would amount to a denial that Jeſus is come in the fleſh : but he came to redeem them that were under the law, and the apoſtle ſays expreſsly, he accompliſhed it; <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 13. <q>Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</q> 
               <hi>He hath delivered us.</hi> Who? Them that were under the law. The apoſtle and all the brethren with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029651_0004_0FE2109028518498"/>
it, and united in their endeavours to bring back the fooliſh bewitched Galatians that were removed from him that called them, into the grace of Chriſt to another goſpel, to the belief of it, which they would not have done if it were not an original truth. Now, if Chriſt had not delivered us from the curſe of the law, and we believed he had not, we could not be denominated, Unbelievers: but ſince he hath, and the ſcriptures plainly and fully aſſert it, thoſe muſt be denominated unbelievers, that believe we are ſtill under the law and under the curſe ; beſides, "he that believeth entereth into reſt;" but what reſt can he that believeth that we are under the law and under the curſe, have on believing ; if it were a truth, it could never make any man free. But, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth the ſcripture teſtimony, that Chriſt hath deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us, believes a truth calculated to free the mind from the ſpirit of bondage, to fear and introduce the ſpirit of adoption, crying, Abba Father.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt hath not delivered us from the curſe of the law, it is impoſſible we ever ſhould be, for Chriſt dieth no more, and it is impoſſible for the belief of a lie to deliver us. Now, our deliverance from the law is by the body of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 4. and for this end; <q>that we might be married to another, to him who is raiſed from the dead.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps miniſters little think, while they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prove unbelievers under the law, and calling them to come to Chriſt, they are calling them to ſpiritual adultery, to have two huſbands, to be wedded to Chriſt while the law is not dead, wherein they were held. The apoſtle aſſerts in forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 4, 6. we are delivered from the law by the body of Chriſt; <q>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held.</q> Being become dead to the law by the body of Chriſt,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029651_0005_0FE2109292593460"/>
not by believing, not by any thing in or about us, or done by us, <hi>but</hi> by the body of Chriſt; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, no wonder the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 14. "Ye are not under the law, but under grace."</p>
            <p>The apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſaith, chap. iii. 23 to 25, <q>Before faith came we were kept under the law, ſhut up unto the faith that ſhould after be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; wherefore the law was our ſchool-maſter unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a ſchool-maſter.</q> Before faith came, I ſuppoſe he means before Chriſt came, who is the object of faith that was after to be revealed, which is, I apprehend, the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt and his goſpel, which reports the faith to be believed, which is that <q>in the fulneſs of time God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now when Jeſus had fulfilled the law in his life, and ſuffered the penalty in his death, being made a curſe for us, his reſurrection manifeſts our diſcharge, ſo that we are no longer under a ſchool-maſter.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 10. <q>The accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of our brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before our God day and night.</q> 
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Who is the accuſer of our brethren? We have the anſwer from Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> v. 45. <q>Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father, there is one that accuſeth you, Moſes, in whom ye truſt.</q> Moſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> the law, accuſeth our brethren before our God day and night; but the accuſer of our brethren is caſt down, and they overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their teſtimony, not by what is wrought in them or done by them; and they loved not their lives unto the death. While under the law in their own apprehenſions, nothing is more
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029651_0006_0FE21099B0D6C6F0"/>
terrible than the thought of death, being all their lives in bondage through fear of death: but when they know the accuſer is caſt down, and they overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, this alteration follows. No wonder John heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, <q>Now is come ſalvation and ſtrength and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To what has been ſaid, it may be objected, It is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> iii. 36. <q>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. <q>He that believeth ſhalll be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and he that believeth not ſhall be damned;</q> which two places ſeem to attribute our deliverance from the wrath of God, and from damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; which phraſes ſeem ſimilar to the curſe of the law.</p>
            <p>For anſwer it may be ſaid, that in <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 15, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſaith to his eleven diſciples, <q>Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature.</q> They were authorized to tell the good news to <hi>every</hi> creature, which was true concerning every creature, elſe he would not have ſent it to them.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, every creature is a ſinner, the whole world guilty before God; to every creature this news is ſent. What news? The goſpel, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf; not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting unto them their treſpaſſes: it aſſerts, he hath made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him (not in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves). <q>Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</q> This is the goſpel to be preached as a truth to every creature. He that believeth it to be a certain truth, is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaved from that perplexity, diſtreſs and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029651_0007_0FE2109B42E001F8"/>
that ariſes in the mind from an apprehenſion of the wrath of God, conſequent on being ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a breaker of God's law; while he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, ſtands in his own mind, where he was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already: the ſenſe of the wrath of God abiding on him. Yet, nevertheleſs, the good news of the goſpel is as true as if it were believed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcredited affords no relief, and it is that which denominates an unbeliever, <hi>viz.</hi> not believing the truth of the good news of the goſpel. What is ſaid on <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. may ſerve as an anſwer to <hi>John</hi> iii. 36. only look of the foregoing verſes.</p>
            <p>To uſe a ſimilitude: Having ſtept into a court of juſtice among men, a law-breaker is condemned for breach of law, and ſentenced to what the law inflicts in that caſe; I hear the ſentence pronounced as I go in, and ſee the offender ſent back to priſon till the ſentence of law is ſatisfied, which he hath no hope ever to ſatisfy. I inquire, Why is he thus ſentenced? I am anſwered, He hath broken the law.</p>
            <p>After he is gone, ſome one hath pity on him, pays that the law demands, and procures a receipt from the clerk of the court, and ſends the news to the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, who is on the point of rejoicing exceedingly; but ſome fellow-priſoner tells him it is only a decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it doth not mean as it is expreſſed; he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it he will not be releaſed till he has paid the utmoſt farthing. If he believes the lie, he will ſtill lie under the ſame condemnation. Seeing him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, caſt down, I inquire the reaſon of his diſtreſs and miſery. Seeing the ſentence of law is ſatisfied, the anſwer is, Becauſe he doth not believe the truth reported to him; but believed a lie, which is the reaſon why he retains in his mind the ſame condemnation. <q>He that believeth not is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already, becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</q>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:029651_0008_0FE2109CD04F3778"/>Unbelief keeps the mind under the law on the left hand, where can be heard nothing but, Go ye curſed. The goſpel reports that <q>Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</q> This being believed, brings the mind under the goſpel on the right hand, where it hears; Come ye bleſſed.</p>
            <p>I think this view of unbelievers being damned of ſelf-condemned, being under the wrath of God in their own apprehenſions, may be illuſtrated from ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral paſſages of ſcripture that ſpeak of believers: we read of the younger widows having damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they caſt off their firſt faith. Undoubtedly, what they believed with their firſt faith was true; or their firſt faith was a true faith, elſe they would not have damnation becauſe they caſt it off; but there is nothing but damnation takes place in the mind if the firſt faith is caſt off, or they ceaſe to believe the report of the goſpel to be true.</p>
            <p>To uſe a ſimilitude: Take a piece of dry ſole-leather, it is full of air, caſt it into the water; as the water enters, the air will go out, and you may ſee it riſe in bubbles till filled with water, and has expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the air.</p>
            <p>If the belief of the truth emerſe the mind and fill it, it rejoices with exceeding great joy. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſtands crowding at the door of the mind with all its objections, and ſo far as it gets in, it brings ſelf-condemnation or damnation with it. But our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief cannot deſtroy the truth of the goſpel that is preached to every creature: If we believe not, he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>Hence the exhortations; "We, receiving a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cannot be moved, let us hold faſt the grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably," "Hold faff the form of ſound words which thou haſt heard of me in faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus." "Take

heed brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief; in departing from the living God; for we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end."</p>
            <p>The apoſtle Peter in his ſecond epiſtle, chap i. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. exhorts thoſe who have obtained like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faith, to <q>add to their faith, virtue; to virtue; knowledge; to knowledge; temperance, patience, godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs and charity: For,</q> ſays he, <q>if theſe things be in you and abound, they make neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mark what follows: <q>But he that lacketh theſe things is blind, and cannot ſee far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſins.</q> It ſeems, his being purged in Chriſt, was his firſt faith, he hath forgotten it; what then must take place in his mind but ſelf-condemnation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? while thoſe that do theſe things ſhall never fall; but ſo an entrance shall be miniſtred abundantly, into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. What motives have believers to be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing their labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord? The belief of the truth, that we are bought with a price, tends to fill the mind with joy that we belong to ſuch a Redeemer, to ſuch a Purchaſer; and an excitation to glorify God in our ſpirits and bodies, which are his.</p>
            <p>But thoſe are damnable hereſies that deny the Lord that bought them, and ſuch muſt unavoidably bring on themſelves ſwift deſtruction: for, if Jeſus hath not bought us with his blood, if he hath not delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us, there is nothing but deſtruction and miſery, inev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable ſwift deſtruction, there is no goſpel to be preached to ANY creature.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS your Diſcourſe at the public monthly evening Lecture, on the 29th of June, 1795, (wherein you aſſerted, That unbelievers are under the law and under the curſe) gave occaſion to the collection of the foregoing thoughts, that here preſent themſelves to view. You are requeſted to attend to them, and think whether they are not agreeable to the ſcriptures: If ſo, do not ſuffer your own ſyſtem, which may have wrapt your mind imperceivably, to prevent your tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the glad tidings to <hi>all</hi> people.</p>
               <p>Sir, be pleaſed to aſk yourſelf, "Doth not my ſyſtem confine me from preaching the goſpel to every creature? from repeating without limitation, the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029651_0011_0FE210A7089B6A38"/>
goſpel preached to Abraham and confirmed to him by an oath, That in thy ſeed (which is Chriſt) ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed; while the pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt aſſures us, He hath remembered his covenant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; the word he commanded to a thouſand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Iſaac, and confirmed the ſame to Jacob by a law?"</p>
               <p>It ſeems probable, that the law by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the ſame to Jacob and to Iſrael for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, was the law of circumciſion, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given as a token of the covenant, which was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith, which Abraham had, yet being uncircumciſed. Is not this ſeal uſed by the Jews among all nations to this day, as a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony of the truth of the goſpel preached to Abraham, which inſures the bleſſedneſs of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, kindreds, and families of the earth in Chriſt Jeſus? Dare any of our Father's children preſume to break his will thus ſealed, by ſaying, It did not mean all the nations of the earth, it is only ſome out of all nations; it only meant me, an elect believer <note n="*" place="bottom">Far be it from me to ſpeak lightly of the doctrine of Election, it is the abuſe of it only, I wiſh to expoſe. This doctrine is conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in the collection, entitled, <hi>Goſpel News,</hi> page 100, 101, 102, 103; which any one that reads, may judge if it is not ſpoken of agreeable to the Scriptures.</note>, not thou, a reprobate unbeliever? What contentions muſt ariſe in the family, whom he hath directed to love one another, conſequent hereupon, about the Father's will, which is expreſſed ſo plainly, and confirmed by an oath, and ſealed with ſuch a ſeal, manifeſt in all places, where the Jews are ſcattered to this day.</p>
               <p>Again, pleaſe to aſk yourſelf, Can I publiſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, the truth of Iſaiah's teſtimony, chap. xliv. 22. <q>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins return unto me,

Or the doctrine of Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. from verſe 6th to the end. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> v. 14, <q>For the love of Chriſt conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us; becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him who died for them, and roſe again.</q> Verſe 19, <q>God was in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf, not imputing to them their treſpaſſes.</q> Verſe 21, <q>For he hath made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin; that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</q> This he proves from Chriſt being heard and accepted when thus made ſin for us. "For he ſaith," chap. vi. 2, <q>I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in a day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee; behold now the accepted time,</q> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1 to 7;

               </p>
               <p>Left I ſhould tire, I will only mention <hi>Rev</hi> v. 13. <q>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I ſay, Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power unto him that ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Admit the truth, that Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us, and all theſe texts have no difficulty in them: deny that truth, and you cannot poſſibly get along conſiſtently with any of them.</p>
               <p>The motive that has excited me thus to write, ſo far as I am able to judge, is a threefold one. Firſt, That I might ſpeak of the glory of our Redeemer, who hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us; to the glory of his name. Secondly, That I might have an opportunity to bring to view to the afflicted minds and conſciences of thoſe who are taught to believe that they are under the law and under the curſe, the ſcripture teſtimony, that our Divine Redeemer hath delivered them Thirdly, That I might act a friendly, faithful part, in love to you, in pointing to the ſcriptures, which I apprehend, ſhew that you herein miſtake the truth.</p>
               <p>I am aware it may be thought a repetition by ſome, inaſmuch as the ſentiment may be gathered from that collection, intitled, <hi>Goſpel News,</hi> already printed.

                  <hi>Micah</hi> vii. 8, 9, 10. <q>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſions of the remnant of his heritage; he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in mercy, he <hi>will</hi> turn again, he <hi>will</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon us, he <hi>will</hi> ſubdue our iniquities; and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea; thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou haſt ſworn to our fathers in the days of old.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If we read the forogoing part of the chapter to the 7th verſe, we ſhall ſee that there is no reaſon in man for this gracious declaration. The prophet appeared ſenſible of this in verſe 7; <q>Therefore I will look to the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation.</q> Verſe 9; <q>He will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall behold his righteouſneſs.</q> Neither is there any expreſſed in the three verſes firſt mentioned, it is becauſe he delighteth in mercy: He <hi>will,</hi> he <hi>will,</hi> he <hi>will</hi> is three times repeated. <q>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou haſt ſworn to our fathers in the days of old:</q> The mercy and truth included in the goſpel preached to Abraham; which is an unconditional goſpel.</p>
               <p>All falſe religion that I have ever heard of propoſes pardon to the penitent and the fulfiller of certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, according to their various orders.</p>
               <p>The glory of the true God is made manifeſt in that he finds in himſelf a divine reaſon, to forgive the moſt deſtitute and unworthy, for his name's ſake, for his mercy's ſake, for his truth's ſake, for his oath's ſake, for the glory of his name.</p>
               <p>I would now proceed to take notice of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions alluded to. You ſay in page 5th, ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt. "I believe he was authorized by God to proclaim forgiveneſs to the penitent, and to reveal
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029651_0016_0FE210B68AED8028"/>
a ſtate of immortal glory and bleſſedneſs to thoſe that fear God and work righteouſneſs." When I had read this ſentence, I pauſed to make a mark in the margin of my book, as follows:</p>
               <p>Glory be to God, Jeſus Chriſt is exalted a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance as well as remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 31. And he calls us to repentance becauſe he has found a divine reaſon of forgiveneſs in himſelf. <q>I, I am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</q> 
                  <hi>Iſa</hi> xliii. 25. <q>I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud, thy ſins: Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee,</q> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> xliv. 22. <q>I will put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As I progreſſed in reading in page 11th, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your belief, "That God requires obedience to his laws, and conſequently reſeats the infraction; that forgiveneſs is poſſible and repentance and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the conditions."</p>
               <p>On reading this ſentence, I pauſed; and, as it were, imagined myſelf, while looking on the book, (with grateful admiration and reverence be it ſpoken) ſurrounded by Moſes and the prophets. Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles, as a voice behind me, ſaying. This is the way.</p>

               <p>How will it do to add, <hi>Repentance and reformation are the conditions,</hi> judge ye? Are they the conditions of everlaſting love, which is manifeſt in drawing with loving-kindneſs; in helping the ſelf-deſtroyed; in healing the backſliding, and loving them freely; in ſending the goſpel to the poor; in ſaving the loſt; in the gift of God, which is, eternal life through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord?</p>
               <p>The knowledge of divine love thus made manifeſt,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029651_0018_0FE210C0A6AFBB78"/>
is the ſpring from whence flow repentance and ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormation, but they are not the conditions of divine love manifeſted in forgiveneſs. The expreſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to contain in embryo, the whole doctrine of deſert of grace, held in the Romiſh church.</p>
               <p>It appears to me a matter of ſober importance; ſuffer me therefore to add, let it have its due weight, and come to a concluſion in your own mind. Either to preach God our Saviour ſaving for his own name's ſake, and freely giving repentance; as well as remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins: Or, ſaving only on condition of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reformation. Be pleaſed, Sir, to bring it home; you have a reſpectable character among men, and are as likely perhaps, as any, to have performed the conditions of conditional ſalvation; having had as many advantages therefor as any man. Will or can you plead your repentance and reformation, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your forgiveneſs, before God? Or muſt you be obliged to go in the ſtrength of the Lord God, and ſay with the pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxi. 16, <q>I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine only.</q> Let what ſatisfies your mind, occupy your pen, and proceed from your mouth: permit me to remind you of <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxi. 15. 24. as a ſafe example.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy righteouſneſs, thy ſalvation all the day, for I know not the numbers. My tongue alſo ſhall talk of thy righteouſneſs all the day long.</q> If we know not the numbers, we ſhall find it is a ſubject that cannot be exhauſted, the numbers will flow and unfold, to furniſh new diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of grace, mercy, peace and love, to animate the new ſong, and employ the tongue all day long, thro' time and eternity.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould think I take too much upon me in theſe interrogations, I will preſent it in the language of ſcripture, and turn your attention to <hi>Iſa.</hi> xliii. 25, 26. <q>I, I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029651_0019_0FE210C260E46900"/>
for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins. Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: declare thou that thou mayeſt be juſtified.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have taken notice of two exceptionable paſſages in your otherwiſe truly valuable production, and cannot but hope, I have been conſtrained thereto from a ſenſe of duty; for the glory of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the benefit of thoſe whoſe minds are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed for want of the conditions you make mention of: And wiſh you to eſteem me your unfeigned Friend,</p>

               <p>For anſwer we find, before he leaves this world, he calls upon his Father to glorify him And why does he claim the glory? Becauſe he had finiſhed the work given him to do. We then hear Jeſus ſay, <q>Father, I will that thoſe which thou haſt given me be with me, where I am, that they may behold my glory</q>

               <p>All that the Father had; he had power over all fleſh, the heathen are given to him his inheritance, and the utmoſt part of the earth his poſſeſſion. <hi>Query.</hi> Shall not all that were given to him, come to him? ſhall they not behold his glory, the glory of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed work? We find him coming in his glory, with all the holy angels with him.

Did he not when on the croſs, draw all men to him? We find all nations are gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the paſſage firſt mentioned, <hi>Queſtion.</hi> For what? <hi>Anſ.</hi> That there might be a complete and eternal ſeparation between what he came to ſave, and what he came to deſtroy, manifeſted to the aſſembled world; agreeable to what Iſaiah ſaid, chap. xl. 5. <q>And the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee together for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</q> Again, <q>All fleſh ſhall come and worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord.</q> chap. lxvi. 29.

               <p>When the angels come to celebrate the birth of the new-born king, they proclaim good news and glad tidings to all people, becauſe the Saviour is born. Then they ſing the ſong, "Glory to God in the

higheſt." Why do they ſing this ſong? The anſwer is, Becauſe there is peace on earth, and good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</p>
               <p>Paul tells us to <q>judge nothing before the time, till the Lord comes, who, both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</q> 
                  <hi>Query.</hi> Why ſhall every man have praiſe of God, when he appears? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe he is the head of every man, and he in this nature, and for this nature, fulfilled the law they had broke; and he, by the grace of God, taſted that death for every man. Therefore, he is called the juſt God and the Saviour, and having finiſhed the work of ſalvation for <hi>all,</hi> he comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, to make a full diſplay of his glory, in the ſalvation of all his own, in the eyes of all the nations, the complete and eternal ſeparation and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the works of the devil, with all the plants that God did not plant under the figure of the tares; or as the wood, hay, ſtubble, that is built by man on the foundation, is to be burnt up; though the fooliſh builder himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</p>
               <p>We find the beaſt and the falſe prophet, death and hell after they are emptied, with the devil, are all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether caſt into the lake of fire, which is the ſecond death. <hi>Rev.</hi> xx. 13, 14.15. Is not the ſame figure held up under the carcaſes in <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxvi. 23, 24, when all fleſh are brought to worſhip before the Lord? All fleſh had ſinned, ſo that all fleſh had carcaſes; all fleſh come to worſhip, ſeparated from their carcaſes, their bodies of ſin and death; and they (the carcaſes) ſhall be abhorred of all fleſh, when they go forth to look upon them, agreeable to <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 63. <q>That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of this ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou

haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</q> The worm may gnaw, and the fire burn, but the men are ſeparated and ſaved from them; then nothing ſhall hurt or deſtroy in all that holy mountain. Our God is one, and his work one, and he is the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> yeſterday, to-day and forever, without change, according to <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 6. <q>I the LORD. I change not; therefore, ye ſons of Jacob are not conſumed.</q> Here we ſee the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men depends on the unchangeable God, for he is of one mind, and none can turn him. All this is to bring to paſs his glory, for all things were made by him for his glory, and he will not be diſappointed, nor will he give his glory to another.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be our God, he changes not: But evil was permitted to enter this world, that there might be a more full diſplay of his glory, agreeable to <hi>Romans</hi> viii. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>We adore his power who hath all power in heaven and on earth: we admire his juſtice in deſtroying ſin, and puniſhing the ſinners in ſuch a way, as to bring them back again to their Father and their God, by the glory of the finiſhed work of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: we bleſs and praiſe his love, for God is love, that he ſo loved the world, as to give them his Son, to ſuffer and die in our room and ſtead; for he died for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification; he fulfilled the law, and was made honourable; he, by the grace of God, taſted death for every man, and his blood cleanſeth from all ſin; he, the Lamb of God, that beareth away the ſin of the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore, by the eye of faith, let us ſee him come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, and ſee all nations gathered before him: Let us ſee the ſeparation of all evil, of all ſorts, from his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and deſtroyed; and all his own ſaved, all that he made and ſaw good, and bleſſed; and in this way ſee a full diſplay of his glory, his power to create,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029651_0023_0FE210CE62386810"/>
his juſtice to puniſh, and his love to ſave, and bring back that which was driven away.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore, who believe our God to be one, his work one, without change, give unto him all hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, glory, bleſſing and praiſe, for he only is worthy; and never harbour a thought, that our God will be diſappointed of his glory, or that any power can take any of his creatures from him, and in that way diſappoint him in his plan of government; but give unto him the glory that is due to his name and be ſtill, and know that he is God, and that the Judge of all will do that which is right. He will come in his glory, and make a full diſplay of it; and all fleſh ſhall ſee together.</p>
