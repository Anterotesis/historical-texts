            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Touching this most <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and other heavenly Points in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Protestants</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I present your roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eye with a <hi>Lantskip</hi> of a <hi>Battle</hi> fought this last Summer in your Majestyes <hi>New-England,</hi> between some of the eminentest of the <hi>Quakers</hi> and my self, three dayes at <hi>Newport</hi> on <hi>Rode-Island,</hi> and one at <hi>Providence</hi> on the <hi>Main</hi> in the same <hi>Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am humbly bold to present it to your <hi>Royal Hand,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That your own precious <hi>Soul</hi> (infinitely more precious then thousands of <hi>Brittains</hi> or <hi>Worlds</hi> may see the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Roots</hi> of these <hi>Protestant Disquisitions.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. Because it was affirmed by some of my Opposites in publick, that there were scarce any of their <hi>Books</hi> came forth, but the <hi>King</hi> had one: I thought it some obligation on me, to present the <hi>Protestant Truth</hi> (thus publickly and solemnly asserted) more justly then my <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> and <hi>Arminian Opposites</hi> to offend your Royal eyes with Smoak out of the <hi>Deep Pit.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was one of the greatest Princes of that name in the world. And <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (both Emperours) had his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Trick at Helm</hi> also; but both (and all) turn into the <hi>Cabbin</hi> &amp; <hi>Pit</hi> of <hi>Rottenness.

            <p n="2">2. The truth is (as <hi>Edmund Burroughs,</hi> and others of you say of your selves) from my Childhood (now above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> years) the Father of <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> toucht my Soul with a love to himself, to his only begotten, the true <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> to his <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. his infinite Wisdome hath given me to see the City, Court and Country, the Schools and Universities of my <hi>Native Country,</hi> to converse with some <hi>Turks, Jews, Papists,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and by Books to know the <hi>Affairs</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> of all <hi>Countries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My Conclusion is, that <hi>be of good chear thy sins are forgiven thee,</hi> Mat. 9. is one of the joyfullest sounds that ever came to poor sinful Ears: how to obtain this sound from the mouth of that Mediatour that spoke it, is the great dispute between the <hi>Protestants</hi> and the bloody <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> this is also the great point between the true <hi>Protestants</hi> and your selves: as also (in order to this) about what Man is (to the utmost) now by nature, what the true Lord Jesus Christ is, and all other controversies (discussed in this Book, not unworthy this your serious weighing (as <hi>Mary</hi> did) in the hearts and spirits, &amp;c:</p>
            <p n="4">4. Bear with me while I say, that as the <hi>Jesuites</hi> pretend to deifie the <hi>Pope,</hi> but it is known, the end is to deifie themselves under the cloak of the <hi>Popes</hi> Name: so Satan pretends to exalt and deifie you, under the name of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. but his end is as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, to exalt himself, and fill his hellish Paunch with Souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5 I endeavoured, but could not procure a Short-hand writer, so that I am forced to recollect Transactions from my Memory, and I believe (as in the holy presence of God) that I have not failed to present the true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of passages without advantage to my self, or disadvantage to my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have used some sharp Scripture Language, but not (as commonly you do) passionately and unjustly: I sometimes call you <hi>Foxians,</hi> (as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans</hi> from <hi>Nicholas</hi>) because <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath appeared the greatest Writer, and the greatest Preacher amongst you, and the most deified that I can hear of, sure it is that here he subtly run for it: he ordered that my Letters to
<pb facs="unknown:000228_0005_0FA36C55C91E32B0"/>
our Deputy Governour Captain <hi>Cranstone</hi> (in which my Proposals to <hi>G. F.</hi> were, should not be delivered to the Deputy, until <hi>G. F:</hi> was some hours under sayle, that he might say he never saw my Paper, though it is as clear as noon-day, that he knew all matters by Copies, Letters and Relations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly many dayes before his departure.</p>
            <p n="7">7. My disadvantage (in our Contests (especially at <hi>Newport</hi>) were great and many: for though <hi>J. Stubs.</hi> and <hi>J. Burnet</hi> were more civil and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: yet <hi>W. Edmondson</hi> was nothing but a bundle of Ignorance, and Boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness, he would speak first end all (though all three were constantly on me at once) no man might speak at all in favour of my Positions: any might freely speak against them: they sat in the midst of the Governour &amp; Magistrates (of their Opinion) and the whole Assembly (of their way) <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> (though <hi>J. Stubs</hi> twice said in publick, that I had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted them) yet <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> would frequently and insolently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt me: so that I was not only forced to bear patiently (through Gods only help) but to suppress my thoughts, which here I have added in some places. 8. I know that a great weight of your Opinions and Actings lye upon your believing your selves guided by the immediate Spirit of God: but I believe that I have proved that it is no more the holy Spirit of God, that speaks and acts in you, then it was the true <hi>Samuel</hi> that spake such heavenly words in the appearance of <hi>Sam.</hi> Mantle amongst a cloud of other witnesses you shall never perswade Souls (not bewitched) that the holy Spirit of God would perswade your Women and Maidens to appear in publick (streets &amp; assemblies) stark naked, &amp;c. of which I have spoke more particularly in our disputations. 9. It is hard to perswade a Fox or a Wolf that he is so, &amp;c. or that he doth Rob or Steal, or Murther; it is hard to perswade a man while he dreams that he is in a Dream yea though he be a filthy Dreamer as Gods Spirit speaks: In our Dreams we believe lyes and impossibilities to he true as that we are many thousand miles of, that we talk with dead men, &amp;c. that we are at Marriages or Burials and are Kings and Queens. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="10">10. All that I can hope for (without Gods wonderfull mercy) is to give my Testimony in my generation: for (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of the Whore) few or none of you return. Yet I know Gods foundation is sure he knows who are his amongst you as amongst other perswasions. I have proved, and will prove (if God please) that spiritual Pride, that is Pride about spiritual matters, is the Root and Branch of your whole Religion, and that the King Eternal, who did cast out proud Angels out of his Palace, will hardly open his Gates to proud and scornful Dust and Ashes:</p>

            <head>A Narration of A CONFERENCE OR DISPUTE, This last August 1672 (so called) in the Colony of Rode-Iland and Providence, Plantations in N. ENGLAND, between Roger Williams of Providence, (who Challenged G Fox by writing (which followes) and all his Friends then met on Rode-Iland, (and G. Fox with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing) John Stubs, John Burniat, and William Edmundon, (three of their ablest Apostles) on the other, that is, (on the pretended Quakers) Party.</head>
            <p>HAving long heard of the great name of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> (a man cried up by the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) and having read his Book in Folio (some years since) against,<note place="margin">The Occasion of the <hi>Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>

And therefore for his most holy Names sake, and the Name of his most holy only begotten, the true <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> the <hi>God-Man</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi> &amp;c, And for the honour of the most holy <hi>Spirit of God</hi> (so horribly torn in pieces by this <hi>foul Spirit of the Quakers</hi>) For the vindicating of many of the precious Truths of the old <hi>Christian purity,</hi> and for the sake of so many precious Souls lying slain and bleeding before me, I made this Offer following to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and any or all his Followers or Associates, then together at <hi>New-port</hi> on <hi>Rode-Iland.</hi> Tis true <hi>G. Fox</hi> was at <hi>Providence</hi> some few dayes before, and spake pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; and it was free for me publickly to have heard him, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him; But going the last year to one of their general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes at <hi>New-Port,</hi> and having begun to present to them some Considerations about the <hi>True Christ</hi> and the <hi>false,</hi> the <hi>True Spirit</hi> and the <hi>False</hi> and being cut of in the midest,<note place="margin">A Spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> by the sudden <hi>Prayer</hi> of one, and the <hi>Singing</hi> of another, and then by the <hi>Prayer</hi> of another and the sudden dissolving of the Assembly, I resolved to try another way, and to offer a fair and full <hi>Dispute,</hi> according to <hi>Ed. Burrowes</hi> (and therein <hi>G Foxes</hi>) Offer in his large <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Foxes</hi> Book.

            <p>They departed (after drink offered and accepted by some) but the next morning being the first of the Week I sent them word in writing, that diverse of our Neighbours were grieved that the <hi>Conference</hi> should be caried away from <hi>Providence</hi> to <hi>Newport</hi> wholly,<note place="margin">My care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them to my whole <hi>Offer</hi> and of discussion, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </note> (as some of them had also spoken) I told them that the accepting of my <hi>Proffer</hi> necessarily included the Conference about the latter seven at <hi>Providence:</hi> I told them their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> and <hi>Credits</hi> lay on it, and therefore desired them to fix on a day for the dispute of the latter seven at <hi>Providence</hi> before their departure hence. This Paper was delivered to one of their Company in the room where they were together, but whither on purpose or (as tis possible) by mistake, they say the Paper was lost: so receiving no Answer from them, I late in the evening sent them another writing, signifiing, that I could not hold my self ingaged to meet them at <hi>Newport</hi> about the first seven, without their promise of discussing the latter seven at <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Then they wrote to me that I had seemed willing, and that they had given notice, and the Countrey would come in, therefore they challenged me to appear and prove my malicious

and bitter charges against them, and withall promised that upon the finishing of the first seven at <hi>Newport,</hi> some of them would give me a meeting at <hi>Providence &amp;c.</hi> Upon the receipt of this, I sent them a third writing signifiing that I rested in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and therefore (if God pleased) I would not fail to be with them at the time and place appointed.

            <p>Then I sent them a fourth Paper (with a Copie of my first that miscaried as they said) and signified to them, that is would be convenient to agree about some <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Transition,</hi> or passing from one position to another: as also since they were <hi>many</hi> and I but <hi>One,</hi> I presumed their Reason told them that I expected but <hi>One at once,</hi> and that if another desired to speak, the first should hold his peace;<note place="margin">Scruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout meeting in the <hi>Quakers Meeting house at Newport.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. My end was, the vindicating his <hi>most holy Name,</hi>

2.

            <p n="3">3. I had also in mine eye, that this exercise might occasion some <hi>Soul Consideration</hi> in many. I told them that we had a dolefull <hi>Alarum</hi> and instruction lately,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I had many thoughts of beginning such an exercise with <hi>Prayer</hi> unto God for his Presence:<note place="margin">What Prayer was used.</note> but I knew I could not joyn with them nor would they owne my <hi>Prayers:</hi> I had thoughts (as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> among the <hi>Baalites</hi>) to have prayed in the singular number: But some <hi>Considerations</hi> made my spirit content with this kind of Petition unto God: For not only in my <hi>Closet</hi> and my heart, but publickly before them all I said, <hi>I doe humbly hope and beg of</hi> God <hi>the</hi> Father <hi>of Spirits so to order and direct our Spirits in these our Agitations, that his holy name may receive glory, and the</hi> Soules <hi>of all of us some</hi> Soul-profit <hi>and Advantage.</hi>

            <p>Some of these Particulars I could not then express, but think

fit here to remember the former dayes, for Information of such as doe desire it.</p>
            <p>These People came from <hi>Lancashire</hi> and other northern parts to the Southward of <hi>England</hi> and to <hi>London.</hi> I spake with some of their Chief then in <hi>London;</hi> I knew it was the old proud <hi>spirit</hi> which had appeared in so many soul lyes in their former decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and deceiving <hi>Leaders,</hi> and I was the more confirmed in my thoughts when I saw their soul <hi>spirit</hi> so transport them, not only in lying <hi>Doctrines,</hi> but lying <hi>Quakings</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> lying preaching through the Streets <hi>Repent, Repent:</hi> and lying and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable <hi>Nakedness</hi> of men and women, untill their ugly Child and Daughter <hi>Rantisme</hi> rose from their Bowels and practised <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness</hi> of men and women in the Streets and in their religious <hi>Meetings,</hi> as <hi>Adamites:</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>But the quaking and shaking motions of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as I shall prove) they proceeded not from those holie Affections

                  <hi>The horrid</hi> shaking <hi>of the</hi> Quakers.</note> so also they were horrid and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous casting their bodies into horrid and monstrous motions and Gestures which mine eyes have seen: Besides the abundance of notorious Instances, what strange horrid motions are those which <hi>Theera John</hi> (as he madly calls himself) and <hi>John Toldervy</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To this purpose I told them that at the first coming of this spirit to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> some <hi>Parliament men</hi> told me that themselves went to one of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings about <hi>Charing Cross,</hi> but were so affrighted with the <hi>shaking</hi> of their own bodies, and of their <hi>Chairs</hi> and Stooles under them, that they could never again be got into their <hi>Assemblyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I added, that such <hi>Shakings, Motions, Extasies,<note place="margin">Satans Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> &amp;c.</hi> were known to be the frequent workings of <hi>Sathan</hi> upon his Servants in all ages, Such were the furious motions of <hi>Baals Preists,</hi> the motions of the <hi>Possessed</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Gospells,</hi> and other <hi>Historyes,</hi> and known to be amongst the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about this time. <hi>John Burnet</hi> and <hi>William Edmunson</hi> rose up and said that I had laid many deep and heavy <hi>Charges</hi> upon the people of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Quakers Answer.</hi>
               </note> which I should be never able to prove: I had denied them to be <hi>Christians,</hi> and so had wronged the good Spirit of God in them, and their Profession of worshipping God in the Spirit: Yea I had taken away their being (as men) out of the World, as a dangerous People to <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> &amp; <hi>Common-weales,</hi> yea to <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; <hi>Princes,</hi> and so not fit to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men in the World. These Speeches were often uttered and enlarged by one or other of them, and that with Zeal (and Passion in <hi>W. Edmunson</hi>)</p>
            <p>I waited patiently till these <hi>Gusts</hi> of their angry Spirit was over, and then I told them I had not wronged them in a title: But by the help of the most High I would make all good against them, &amp; toen leave it to every mans and womans Soul to judge at their own Perill.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>John Stubs</hi> alleadged that of <hi>Paul;</hi> Phil 2. <hi>Work out salvation with fear and Trembling.</hi>
            </p>

But I denied that those places to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Philippians</hi> concerned any such bodily shakings and quakings as we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>
            <p>Beside I said if <hi>Quaking</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> were a Command and an Ordinance,<note place="margin">No Ordinance of God</note> and institution of God to be practised, then was in constantly to be practised (as the <hi>Jewes</hi> say of <hi>Cain</hi> that the Mark which God set upon him was a constant <hi>Trembling</hi>) O if not alwayes, yet alwayes in <hi>Worship,</hi> or if not alwayes in <hi>worship</hi> yet at some certain times.

            <p>I also declared, that the <hi>most High</hi> and holy one, was free as he pleased to cause the trembling of the <hi>Soules</hi> of his People to over flow with influence upon their <hi>Bodyes</hi> also, asin <hi>Moses, David, Daniel, Habakkuk, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> this is like to be in some extraordinary cases and <hi>Conversions</hi> or turnings to God, as <hi>Paul'</hi>s was, and that especially in bringing of <hi>great Sinners</hi> or <hi>old Sinners</hi> unto himself <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were some few Speeches, some from the <hi>Governour</hi> and his Wife, and some few others that spake, some in favour of, and some against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but neither did my Opposites nor I so far attend them as to engage with them, excepting some Turnes that were between <hi>William Edmunson,</hi> and <hi>William Hitchcock</hi> (an Inhabitant of <hi>Newport</hi>) who (as others did) witnessed against their upbraiding me with my age (<hi>Old man, Old man &amp;c.</hi>) as also for their <hi>Interruptions.</hi>

(For his name sake) enabled me to cut through, otherwise I saw the <hi>Debate</hi> would not have held on so many <hi>Hours</hi> as it did <hi>Dayes,</hi> I knew they had as much mind to this work (no nor any guilty <hi>Soul</hi> in the world) as <hi>Bears</hi> to be tyed to a stake to be baited: and I must humbly declared and predicate it (to the praise of the <hi>Father of mercyes,</hi> and for the incouragement of others to be <hi>Patient</hi> for <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> sake) that an hand from heaven caried me through to the end of each day, and to the end of the whole business.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I offered to proceed to another <hi>Point,</hi> but all this first day was spent upon the first <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false Quakers:</hi> For though many upon a sudden spake as <hi>Mr. Coddington Mr. Easton</hi> (then Governour, who spake sharply) <hi>William Dyer, William Harris</hi> and others against me, yet I minded closely what my <hi>Antagonists</hi> vented, who were placed on high in their <hi>Desk</hi> against me: <hi>John Stubs</hi> and <hi>John Burnet</hi> were more sober and manly, but <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> (who was the junior of three) would speak all like <hi>Solomons</hi> foolish woman, <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>clamorous, simple</hi> and <hi>knowing nothing,</hi> being in truth nothing but a <hi>flash</hi> of wit, a <hi>Face of Brass,</hi> and a <hi>Tongue</hi> set on <hi>fire</hi> from the <hi>Hell of Lyes and Fury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Instance</hi> here fell out, for when I urged that it was not what man had <hi>within him</hi> already, and brought into the world with him, that made a true <hi>Quaker,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying and blessing the <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>writings</hi> of <hi>God preached and opened:</hi> I said the <hi>Heart</hi> of man was shut up lockt and ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I said that <hi>Paul</hi> preached the <hi>word</hi> by the River side, but the Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia:</hi> and while I was saying that, <hi>It was not Paul nor Pauls Preaching nor the word that he preached—</hi> at this word <hi>W. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondson</hi> clamour'd out, <hi>He speakes Blasphemy:</hi> But it pleased God to move the heart of our <hi>Deputy-Governour</hi> Capt. <hi>Cranston</hi> justly and seasonably to witness against this <hi>Interruption</hi> saying,<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Let him have liberty to make out his mind:</hi> So I proceeded and said, it may be <hi>W. Edmnndson</hi> is offended as thinking I spoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>word Christ;</hi> but <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> knowes that I had no such thought, but of the words which <hi>Paul</hi> spake. And I added that it was not <hi>Lydia</hi> nor all her <hi>Light</hi> within her, nor <hi>Paul</hi> nor
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000228_0044_0FA36C730B284ED8"/>
his <hi>Preaching,</hi> nor the <hi>word</hi> nor <hi>words</hi> that he uttered, but the Finger of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> (according to <hi>Election</hi>) that set the <hi>word</hi> or <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> home, opening her <hi>heart</hi> and not every heart, (shewing what free grace is against the <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Foxians</hi> exalting of <hi>Cursed Nature</hi>) and then it was that she being by the Lord turned, she turned to attend &amp; apply to her soul the words which were spoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> as a poor <hi>Rams-horn</hi> made use of in the hand of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Toward the end of the day <hi>W. Edmondson</hi> fell into a long <hi>Invective,</hi> how I had falsly standered the <hi>People of God,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Forians boast of their Number.</hi>
               </note> but the whole Body of the People of the <hi>Lord</hi> called <hi>Quakers</hi> in all parts: For said he we are a great people, many thousands in <hi>England,</hi> many thousands in <hi>London,</hi> besides in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and other places, and <hi>N-England.</hi> And he and they said, hast thou any more to say to make out thy <hi>Lyes</hi> against them.</p>
            <p>I Answered (as at other times) that the <hi>Papists</hi> the common <hi>Protestants,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Mahumitans</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> &amp;c. fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world with their <hi>Numbers,</hi> and yet we jointly opposed them in <hi>Religious matters</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi> And as for more proof that they were not <hi>True Quakers,</hi> and so truly <hi>Fearing and Trembling</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> I told them I would produce an Argument, that they were so far from being <hi>Christians,</hi> that they were a to be <hi>exploded</hi> and <hi>abhorred</hi> of all <hi>Mankind,</hi> as being fallen beneath the common <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Humanity</hi> of men and women, yea of the Savage and <hi>Barbarous</hi> in the world, <abbr>

               </abbr> their stripping <hi>stark naked</hi> their <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Maidens</hi> and pasting along in publick places and <hi>Streets</hi> unto the <hi>Assemblyes</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Youths</hi> and so were beheld and gazed upon by them! and this under a pretence of being stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by God as a <hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> unto God, as an act of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> proceeding from the immediate moving of the most holy <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> most glorious in purity, and purity and holiness it self.</p>
            <p>At first <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> seemed to make strange of the matter as if it could not be proved that any of their women should so appear in the <hi>Assemblyes</hi> of People.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Two of the Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian women na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in</hi> New-England.</note> I told them the matter of <hi>fact</hi> was so <hi>notorious</hi> that it would be loss of time and <hi>Impudence</hi> to question it, being so fouly and openly <hi>practised</hi> both in <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New England.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:000228_0045_0FA36C73C796F288"/>
Also I added further, that <hi>G. Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bristow,</hi> one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in his second part of the <hi>Persecutions of New-England,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in print the names of two women in <hi>N-England</hi> that did so practice: and he complains of <hi>N-England Persecution</hi> because those women suffered <hi>Whipping</hi> for those actions by the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>N-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Burnet</hi> said that the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> were a People known to abhor all <hi>Impurity</hi> and Uncleanness and the <hi>Appearance</hi> of it, and if any of their women should so practice, they should condemn it in them, yet nevertheless if it should please the <hi>Lord God</hi> to stir up any of his <hi>Daughters</hi> so to appear as a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> against the <hi>Nakedness</hi> of others, they durst not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Stubs</hi> said, that they did condemn all immodest <hi>Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in women, both in <hi>Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Gestures.</hi> But if God stirred them up and commanded them to this service to discover the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness</hi> of others, they could not but acknowledge <hi>Gods</hi> hand, and submit to it: And he further added, that it was a great <hi>Cross</hi> to a sober womans spirit so to act, as well as an affliction and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Stubs</hi> likewise alleadged the <hi>Prophet Isaiah,</hi> (as also did <hi>W. E.</hi>) and the <hi>Sign</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> and <hi>John Stubs</hi> read the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Isa.</hi> where <hi>Isaiah</hi> was commanded to goe <hi>naked</hi> for a <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethyopians,</hi> to prophesie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that they also should go naked with their buttocks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as the words are: and this is (said they) a proof that the People of the Lord might be stirred up by <hi>God</hi> to such actions for <hi>Signs</hi> unto others.<note place="margin">Isai. 20. <hi>discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed touching</hi> Nakedness.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answered,</hi> That this was in the dayes of <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> Shadows and <hi>Ceremonyes:</hi> And though this was <hi>G.

Although it were so threatned that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> should so goe <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>stark Naked,</hi> and that <hi>Isaiah</hi> did so, which is much questioned: yet it is not to be questioned but that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> in their flight, would cover

their <hi>Secret parts</hi> with the first cloaths or raggs they could get, as it is no question but the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The difference of <hi>Nakedness</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> and <hi>Womankind</hi> is very great in all <hi>Nations.</hi> The <hi>Sex</hi> of <hi>Women</hi> is more fitted and framed by God for a <hi>Covering,</hi> for <hi>Retiredness</hi> and keeping at home and for <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Bashfulness;</hi> nor do we ever read, that ever God commanded such a thing to Women, or that ever it came into his heart, or that ever any <hi>Godly Woman</hi> did so prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: there is no shadow or colour of <hi>Proof</hi> from the holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> nor from any <hi>Civill</hi> and sober People, no nor from the naked <hi>Barbarians</hi> themselves, who though they suffer their <hi>Male Children</hi> to go naked till about seven years old, yet cover they their <hi>Females</hi> from their birth: Tis true it is said in <hi>Brasil</hi> and other bruitish places some <hi>Savage bruits</hi> go so, but they are <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, Men-eaters &amp;c.</hi> and other B<hi>arbarians</hi> do not so except in <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Madness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They still answered, that they would not <hi>Countenance</hi> any such <hi>Practice</hi> but if the <hi>Lord God</hi> so commanded his <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> it must be obeyed.</p>
            <p>I demanded of them how it should be known that it was the voice and command of <hi>God,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>They seemed to me to be <hi>Confounded</hi> with this Argument and weary to hear of it, and not willing to speak to it: I therefore took occasion my self to say that it was true in former Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Command of God came to <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his own Child, his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> and this fact enjoined him did seem as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> as this <hi>Nakedness</hi> of the Women unwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and <hi>unnatural.</hi> But,</p>

used to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and had spoken to us by his <hi>Son,</hi> and had left his mind both in the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new Scriptures</hi> or Writings: We have the example and President of the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> that is, to attend to the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> only, and to use the weapon of [<hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it is written</hi>] against <hi>Satkans</hi> immediate <hi>Inspirations</hi> and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>And thus by Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> and Patience the Discourse of the first day ended: which very day was notable and <hi>significant</hi> as to the created <hi>Sun</hi> in the Heavens,<note place="margin">

to the <hi>Quakers</hi> who set up a voice or motion within them overtopping and over pouring the voice or Christ Jesus in the Scriptures, some of them maintaining that this <hi>Light</hi> within them is that <hi>great Prophet</hi> that was to come which <hi>Moses</hi> Prophesied of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>I said I would contract my thoughts,<note place="margin">

            <p>In particular I told them I had abundant proof there ready to bring forth from <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>I told them that <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book and all their Books and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions denied any visible Church of Christ at all: and though they maintained and kept up <hi>Congregations</hi> (of pretended Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) <hi>Worships</hi> and <hi>Worshippers</hi> (in a direct contradiction unto their own Tenents, yet) they maintained the Church was in God and so not visible: the Officers of the Church were invisible and immediately made by the immediate and invisible Spirit. The <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme</hi> was within, and only the <hi>Baptisme</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and of <hi>Fire:</hi> The <hi>Lords Supper</hi> appointed by the Lord Jesus to be a Spiritual Feast remembring him until his coming was with them nothing else but Spiritual joy, which they have one, in and with another, which they have by the second coming of the Lord Jesus to them, who they said was come again to the Apostles the second time, and unto themselves also.</p>
            <p>Upon this (as I remember) there fell out some words between my Opposites, and some of the people called <hi>Baptists:</hi> But some of them (especially <hi>John Stubs</hi>) demanded of me, why I thus charged them and was my self so guilty, not living in <hi>Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> myself.<note place="margin">

            <p>I told them I had used all diligence, I failed not to meet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the exact hour appointed, and alwayes before the Audience was come.

            <p>Within a quarter of an hour they sent one to me to desire my coming in again to them and <hi>William Edmondson</hi> (commonly their proud mouth) told me that I had deeply charged them and laid many <hi>false Accusations</hi> upon them, and some of them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, both as they were <hi>Christians,</hi> and as they were men: they had used long patience in hearing of me, and yet because it should be seen that they were willing to hear the utmost that I had to say they would meet and spend a few hours with me on the second Day following at <hi>nine in the Morning,</hi> only they would not endure any long and tedious Discourses.</p>
            <p>I Answered that their own souls knew,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>And</hi> First <hi>unto the</hi> Complaining Disputant <hi>it appears unto my Soul that you have not dealt as a faithful Servant of the Lord Jesus, with your fellow Servants, for you should have admonished them both first and second time in private, and if they would not have heard you then to have told it to the Church, the great</hi> Congregation <hi>of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the first appearance you would not begin before you had stated by forced Covenant that none should speak (though with leave in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and sobriety) but those that would joyn issue with the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>For in our Courts of Judicature there is a fundamental liberty stated for any to speak freely for Conscience sake in any Cause in the Bounds of Sobriety and Modesty. But this appears against the Rules and Practises of all</hi> Christianity, <hi>not practised by the</hi> Judicial Convocation, <hi>nor by the high</hi> Commission Court <hi>in our Native Country, where often I have been and the</hi> Metropolitan <hi>with the rest of the</hi> Bishops <hi>in Gravity and Christianity (though their pleadings were by Proctors, yet) gave liberty especially for Relations to speak: As in one Instance of a person whom you all have heard of, when he was to come upon Examination, his Wife being big with Childe came with him, the</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>(though otherwise he might be improper) yet herein shewd great civility by considering the Womans condition, and gave liberty for speaking to the full, with replying no discomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Words, yea in Christianity delayed further prosecution until she was delivered, though afterwards they acted their improper perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But into what a condition shall we be brought (I hope not into an high</hi> Commission <hi>nor</hi> Inquisition Court) <hi>if this</hi> Imprimator <hi>goes on, that none shall speak, no not so much as suffered to desire to speak, though they are great with Childe with the Man Christ Jesus: But I hope the People will see their Liberties, and your selves know this was not the true Apostles practices.</hi>
                  </p>

               <hi>It is an Errour (if not damnable) to say Christ is the meanes, and that there is no other meanes of Salvation.</hi>

            <p>He Answers, <hi>And Christ faith no man comes unto the Father but by me: and he is able to the uttermost to save? and he shall be my Salvation to the end of the Earth saith the Lords and saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, God is in Christ reconciling the World to himself, and he that hath the Son hath Life, and the Father and the Son are one, and there is no salvation in any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I reply: I shall now freely declare to the Sence of this <hi>Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> though in the Dispute my <hi>Adversaryes</hi> would not suffer me to meddle with the Sence of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his words, contrary to our Covenant in my Writing,<note place="margin">

            <p>This was the great point preached by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and more expressly by <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> and by the Lord Jesus himself: and when he sent abroad his Apostles or Messengers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations,<note place="margin">This 24th. of Luke I earnekly Insisted on.</note> they were to preach the Gospel or glad News of the Forgiveness of sins according to <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <abbr>

            <p>I Reply, 1. The work of God (according to Christs Doctrine) is to believe on him whom God sent. It is true, it is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to keep his Commands, but since the deadly Fall of man,<note place="margin">The Papists and Quakers know not the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</note> none, not one being able, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. (though <hi>Fox</hi> deny it,) it is the work, the <hi>great Work</hi> of God to fly to that <hi>blessed Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for poor sinners, (throughout the world:) But G. <hi>Fox</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish between the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and of <hi>Debt,</hi> and that of <hi>mercy,</hi> and of receiving all as a <hi>Beggar,</hi> and Condemned Rebels, <hi>poor proud Souls</hi> they know not any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Blood of Christ Jesus and their own Blood, as we shall see afterward.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas he saith, they that do not Gods will are not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in so doing:</p>
            <p>I Answer, therefore it follows ronndly as his Conclusion, that they that do Gods will are justified in so doing: that is their sins are pardoned as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> by pardon of Sin describe justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</p>
            <p>

Who sees not the subtlety of this <hi>Fox</hi> cheating himself and others with the divers signification of this <hi>Latin word Justification?</hi> It is true, a man can not be justified or defended for <hi>Thieving,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I Conclude, that by these hints a broken hearted sinner, who hath seen Sin as Sin, the sin of his Nature, his chief sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will see how far from the Doctrine of true Repentance, true Faith, &amp;c these mens Teachings be, and (for all their boasting) what need they have to Examine themselves whether they be in the Faith, and whether there be any other Christ Jesus within them then a <hi>Counterfiet</hi> and <hi>painted Messiah,</hi> and whether their <hi>Counterfiet</hi> and <hi>painted Faith, Repentance</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> will yield them another Fruit then a <hi>dolefully Counterfieted</hi> and <hi>perishing Salvation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>G. <hi>Fox</hi> Answers, by dividing all men into three sorts: Some are born holy from the wombe,<note place="margin">Of Natures its Impurity</note> as <hi>Jer.</hi> Some the Saints that is, only their Children born holy without any sinful Corruption. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the wicked who will not turn to the Light within them, and they are only the <hi>Unbelievers dead in sin.</hi> But the <hi>Protestants, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and his <hi>Followers</hi> Confess their <hi>Natures, Births,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> to be all defiled with fin, and with a <hi>sinful proneness</hi> to all Iniquity, though <hi>miraculously</hi> some are Sanctified, or set apart to God from the wombe as <hi>Jeremiah, John the Baptist,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>It is true, that the <hi>Papists</hi> come nearer the Truth as to <hi>Birth, Corruption</hi> and <hi>Defilement</hi> then the <hi>Quakers,</hi>

            <p>I told them that it was true, that in words and Terms they professed and maintained all these, as other <hi>Protestants</hi> did, but if their writings were Examined, and especially this of G. <hi>Fox</hi> which I had there by me it should appear that what they professed in one place they overthrew in another: I told them that they had there <hi>George Fox</hi> his Book as well as I, and if <hi>John Stubs</hi> wou'd turn to them I would name the <hi>Quoted Pages,</hi> and read them and he might read them also.</p>

            <p>I Reply, as the Swinish Epicures and <hi>Dives'</hi>s of this World, (what ever they formally and loosely profess) have no solid hope of peace and joy to come after this life, and therefore (like Bruit Beasts) practically confess it saying, (in their hearts and Life)

let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall dye: so do this cynical or doggid kind of Philosophers (the Quakers) profess plainly (though some would cover it) no hopes of a rising of the Body but what they have here, no hopes of a Heaven but what they have here, no hell but what they (in their minds) have past through: no Judgement but what (as Saints) they are now executing.</p>
            <p>I know that some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not believe that <hi>G.

            <p>I did not (the Father of Spirits is my holy witness) fling this in as a Firebrand of <hi>Reprobation</hi> against either Teachers or Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers called <hi>Quakers:</hi> it is true they do so against all that ever were not or are not or shall not be in their Opinion, but my hope is, that many amongst these misled and wandring Souls may come to <hi>Abrahams Bosome,</hi> &amp;c. yet this I assert, that thousands and ten thousands may be of their Religion, and may have gotten all that their Religion requires or performs, yea, all that their Principles call for outwardly or inwardly, and yet not be accepted but reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the holy and gracious presence of God.</p>
            <p>I told them that I had this notion from a man famous in his day (Mr. <hi>W. Perkins</hi>) who having been a deboist young man in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> after the call of God to him he proved famous in Preaching and Writing,<note place="margin">

            <p>For the Foundation both of the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers Faith</hi> is laid upon the Sand of <hi>Rotten Nature</hi> which they (both) only adorn and trim as the dead <hi>Carcasses</hi> and <hi>Cossins</hi> with Roses and Lillies and other <hi>Flowers and Garlands,</hi>

            <p>I said I did not charge them to say in express terms, We have lost so much outward <hi>Gain, Favour, Friendship, worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> for the Name of Christ within us, can you say the like for the Christ without you?

            <p>I told them, I had observed much to this purpose in <hi>G. Fox</hi> &amp; <hi>E. Burrowes</hi> in the Book by me.</p>
            <p>They bid me alleadge what I could out of them: I took up the Book,<note place="margin">E. Burrowes <hi>his Epistle Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </note> and they theirs, I directed them to the 12th. Page of <hi>Ed. Burrowes</hi> his large <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book in Folio where I read this passage <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               <hi>And this we did with no small opposition and Danger; yea oftentimes we were in danger or our Lives, through beating, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing, punishing, haling, castings over walls, striking with staves &amp; Cudgels, and knocking down to the ground: Beside,</hi> Reproaching, Scorning, Revilings, Hooting at, <hi>and Scornings and Slanderings, and all abuse that could be thought he or acted by evil hands and tongues, and oft carried before</hi> Magistrates <hi>with grievous Threats, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put in the Stocks, and whipped, and often imprisoned, and many hard dealings, against us, the worst that tongues or hands could exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, sparing life. Of this all the</hi> North Countreys <hi>can witness, And all these things are sustained and suffered from People and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers because of our</hi> Faithfulness <hi>to the Lord, and for declaring against the false Deceivers. For nothing Save only the hand of the Lord and his power, could have preserved us and carried us through all this: neither for any</hi> Reward <hi>outward whatsoever, or advantage to ourselves would we have exposed our selves to sufferings, violence and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which befel us daily. But the Lord was our exceeding great reward through all these things, and kept us in the hollow of his hand, and under the shadow of his wings, and gave us dominion in Spirit over all our enemies, and subdued them before us: and though Rulers and People were combined against us, and executed their violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:000228_0182_0FA36BA406D2BFF8"/>
against us, yet the Lord made us to prosper and grow excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in Strength, Wisdome and Number and the hearts of the people inclined to us, and the Witness of God in many stirred for us: for to that in all Consciences, Words and wayes we did commend our selves to be known and approved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereto they suddenly said, What canst thou make of this, but that <hi>Edward Burrowes</hi> said the truth, that the Sufferings of the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> were very great, &amp; that he acknowledged the powerfull hand of the Lord toward them in supporting and delivering them: But this was far from boasting or making it any <hi>Evidence</hi> of the truth of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I replyed, I prayed them to consider why pious and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Souls(as they would be reputed) should give so large a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of their <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Quotation weighed.</hi>
               </note> 2. Profess it was only for their <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to the Lord. 3. Declare that it was the hand of the Lord that kept them. 4. That he only could do it: I sayd the <hi>weaving</hi> and <hi>inter-weaving</hi> of these Particulars, speak plainly that for their <hi>Faithfullness</hi> to the Lord and his Truth in declaring and suffering for it, the Lord had been faithfull to them in supporting them and comforting them in all these Sufferings for his Name sake. Why should wise men use all these words but to this end, of <hi>Evidencing</hi> their <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to God, and Gods <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>After some words had about these kind of passages in <hi>Ed. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi> and other of their Writings, I told them that we must come to that ancient and true Maxime, <hi>Causa facit Martyrem,</hi> not the Suffering of Burning it self that is the evidence of a true matter.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What true Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is.</hi>
               </note> I therefore told them that' as it was in the case of Signs Wonders <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. though they be Signs which false <hi>Prophets</hi> give, which come to pass, yet God commands his Children not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his written word, and his holy revealed and recorded <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Institutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told them that I had other places which I had turned down in <hi>Edward Burrowes</hi> to produce; but these I had suppressed in my thoughts for expedition sake, and would if they pleased pass on to my proof of my next <hi>Position;</hi> to this they readily assented: but being now out of my Shackles of a quarter of an hour(to which I wink'd to draw them on) I crave the Readers Patience and leave to hear me say something now which then I could not say.</p>

First. To what I have said before of <hi>E. Burrowes</hi> insisting so largly on the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>True Scripture Language.</hi>
               </note> and yet my <hi>Antagonists</hi> denying them to make their Sufferings an <hi>Evidence</hi> of their <hi>Truth,</hi> I present the Reader with a witness of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his words in his <hi>Pag</hi>64. [<hi>And there is a Proof to thee that the</hi> Quakers <hi>are sent of God who speak to thee of the Scripture right as thy are</hi>] He that reads the place shall see that <hi>G. Fox</hi> useth these words against his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite <hi>Jeremiah Jewes,</hi> because that his Opposite had said, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the <hi>Word of God</hi> was contained in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and <hi>G. Fox</hi> checks him for it and saith if he had said [the word which it speaks of] he had spoken right <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this <hi>G. Fox</hi> makes and <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> being sent of God, that they only can speak <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> How much more is what I have produced (and have much more to produce) a <hi>Proof</hi> that they do roll their Souls upon their <hi>Sufferings</hi> as an <hi>Evidence</hi> and Confirmation that they are sent of God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is wonderfull what the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> have suffered for their <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Biasphemyes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> What a wonderfull Story doth <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh Ben-Isrel</hi> relate of a Noble man, a <hi>Portugal,</hi> turned <hi>Jew,</hi> burn'd in <hi>Portugal</hi> for the <hi>Jewish Faith?</hi> What <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> have many of the <hi>Popish</hi> Party shewn at <hi>Tiburn?</hi> Sure it is that a natural <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> a natural <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Stoutness,</hi> a natural <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vain-Glory</hi> will give wings which fire and Burning cannot scorch and conquer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I doubt not but that tis possible for not only <hi>Christians,</hi> but also <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> &amp;c. like <hi>Paul</hi> in his mad <hi>Conscience,</hi> to be zealous for his <hi>Conscience,</hi> and to put others to death for their <hi>Consciences,</hi> and yet neither of them to sin against their <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but ignorantly as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I believe that not only <hi>Paul,</hi>

            <p n="6">6.

            </p>
            <p>First, The Persons whome the heavenly man <hi>John Fox</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes, they were men and women known to be of holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirits towards God, and of low and meek Spirits towards all, yea their very enemyes. I would I could say so of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>(though no question but a <hi>a gold Ring</hi> may fall into the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>

Some of them have literal <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and some stirring <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with the stony Ground, others with the thorny Ground have suffered formerly, but the Cares and lusts of this world have drild them into this way of Antichristian Worship. others are <hi>Fierce, Pragmatical, Discontented &amp;c.</hi> and they must travel and be <hi>Apostles</hi> to preach and bring in Proselites.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The Cause of <hi>John Foxes</hi> and of <hi>G. Foxes</hi> Martyrs differ as much as Day from Night, and Light from Darkness: For it is known that <hi>J. Fox</hi> his <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Witnesses</hi> (those blessed Souls under the Altar) were slain for maintaining the Authority and Purity of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> as the revealed word or will of the <hi>Eternal God</hi> against the <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Inventions</hi> of men.</p>
            <p>But <hi>G. Foxes Sufferers</hi> have generally suffered for their <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens Banbles,</hi> fantastical <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Inventions,</hi> for setting up a <hi>Dream</hi> of a <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> within all Man kind, above the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> above the <hi>Son of God,</hi> above all <hi>Earthly Dignityes,</hi> and all their <hi>Betters:</hi> endeavouring (with the Pope) to trample all <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>Bodyes</hi> under their proud feer.</p>

3. The carriage of these two Sorts of Sufferers differ as much as <hi>East</hi> from <hi>West,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> from <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The ground of <hi>Johns</hi> Sufferers was that which <hi>John</hi> so much writes of, <abbr>

               </note> this appears in their wonderfull Love to the holy Scriptures, (the Love-Letters of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>) and unto all that loved <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> also. The Quakers are known to be Fierce, Heady, Proud, Self conceited, Stout, Bold, and driven on by an Audacious and Desperate <hi>Spirit</hi> (which <hi>G. Fox</hi> and some subtle <hi>Foxes</hi> with him have of late blamed in <hi>H.

                  <hi>Virgin love to God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> others of them fast 40 dayes, and yet be far from true <hi>Virgin Love</hi> to the <hi>Son of God. A Virgin</hi> that loves a man for <hi>Himself,</hi> will not slight his <hi>Love-letters,</hi> nor his <hi>Near Relations</hi> (least of all abhor them, and sink and burn them as these <hi>Foxians</hi> doe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The carriage of <hi>J. Foxes Witnesses,</hi> though (in respect of Gods holy Truth) it was couragious and gallant, yet their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and humility did shine forth gloriously also.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to God, being more sensible of their sins then of their sufferings: confessing with many tears that although God did turn their sufferings unto this Glory,<note place="margin">

            <p>Contrarily it is known to all, that although sometimes the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> will say we come in love to your Souls yet) the <hi>Quakers</hi> are far from confessing their sins,<note place="margin">

               </note> as having no more sin then God hath and (according to their Principles and some of them say it) they can no more sin against God then God can sin against them.</p>
            <p>As to Men Christs sufferers were meek, patient; respective, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, thankful.</p>

1. Was there ever a People (Men and Woman professing such an height of Christianity) so fierce so heady, so high-minded and (though generally not hardned) so censuring, reviling, cursing, and damning: and so savage and barbarous as in the stark naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of men and women &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to Revenge, how patient, and pitiful, and praying for their Enemies were <hi>J. Foxes Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>G. Foxes,</hi> how spitting <hi>Fire &amp; Brimstones?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Tis true some of their Predictions have and may come to pass as do many also of <hi>Conjurers &amp; Witches,</hi> for the Devil knows the Complexion of persons and things, and what is like to come to pass (as in <hi>Souls</hi> case and in other events) and still the poor <hi>Quakers</hi> (and other his Captive Slaves) with such Bables as these.

            <p>We now descended to the thirteenth Proposal (the sixth to be discus'd at <hi>Providence</hi>) which was read by them,<note place="margin">

            <p>I told them that I had not shun'd (as in the presence of the most High) to read any of their Books or Letters I could come at: but the truth is, I could never pick out any Wheat (of solid, rational and heavenly Truth) out of their heaps of Chaffe, and Dreams, and Fancies of new Christs, new Spirits, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is true that <hi>W. Edmund.</hi> said, that the Word of the Lord
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:000228_0187_0FA36BAADA7646D8"/>
was a Fire, and a Hammer, &amp;c. But I said the word they meant was but a painted Fire, and a painted Hammer, and that never broke, nor burned up sin as sin.</p>
            <p>Let a man read the Works of the <hi>Papists,</hi>

            <p>But in the <hi>Quakers Books &amp;c Writings, Peter &amp; Jude</hi> tells us (what I have found) clouds high of an imaginary Christ and Spirit high swelling words, strange from the Holy Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and all sober and Christian Writers and Speakers.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Jo.

            <p>I have read <hi>Nichols,</hi> and <hi>Nailor,</hi> and <hi>Howgel</hi> and <hi>Burrows,</hi> and <hi>Parnel,</hi>

And I could readily and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove my position out of all of them, but my desire and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was (as by my Paper to <hi>G.

            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> then I said, let who will that understands true English, and are able to read and write true English (though he know no more) take <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Folio Book in hand, and tell me whether

               <hi>G. Fox.</hi> Answers [<hi>Though the Scripture saith the Spirit dwells in the Saints,</hi> 1. Cor. 6. <hi>And he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> 1 Joh.1. <hi>As though the Saints had not Union with God which the Scripture say they have.</hi>]</p>
            <p>I Reply: concerning the <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of the Immortal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent and Omniscient, and only Wise: we know no more then a Fly knows what a King is, and therefore 1 <hi>Time. 9.

            <p>Is it not enough for Sun,<note place="margin">

               </note> Moon and Stars, and Men to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by his Infinity, but they must be God himself, and Light it self, in the highest sence, because God is Light, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What impudence would it be in a Wise, because she is one with her Husband in Relation, to say, She is the Husband himself, and not to keep her just distinction and distance? or in a Subject (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Subjects and the <hi>King</hi> are Relatives, and in a sence one)

therefore to say, that they are the <hi>King himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we know that the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken in <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> for a <hi>Spiritual Nature.</hi> Hence it is said that God is a Spirit, not that God is properly a Spirit, no more then he is Light (though my Opposites in our Dispute affirmed he was) but of such a Heavenly and Spiritual Nature:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The nature of Spirits</hi>
               </note> For the Devils also are Spirits, though defiled with sin and wickedness: thus <hi>Joh. 3.

            </p>
            <p>And that <hi>1 Cor.6.</hi> shews us in what respect he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit: For know you not (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Spirit:</hi>

            <p>Thus God dwelt in his Temple of old, as a Man in his House, and a King in his Palace: not that a Mans House, or the Kings Palace is of his Substance or Essence no more then an house is of the Suns Essence, &amp;c and no more was Gods Temple of old, nor his Temples his Saints now, after the blockish and blasphemous nonsence of the <hi>Quaker.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> Answer [<hi>The Jews had not the infallible Judgement, that had Scripture but stood against Christ the Light, and judged him to be a Devil,</hi>

            <p>I Reply, as the Sun in the Heavens is the Epitomy or Center of all Natural Light, though some eyes are sore, look a squint, or are stark blinde.</p>
            <p>And as the Rule or Canon (though <hi>Fox</hi> simply bogles at that as not a Scripture word) is the same, for it is in the Greek, though millions know it not, and millions (as the <hi>Pharises</hi>) pervert and misapply it.</p>

            <p>We are not only commanded to read and meditate in the Holy Scriptures, and to search them as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, but we are commanded to try all things, to try the very Spirits. The <hi>Papists</hi> flap us in the mouth with the infallible Spirit of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that he is not to be judged: the <hi>Quakers</hi> say the same of themselves, which is no more then as I said in the Dispute (when <hi>W, Edmund.</hi> interrupted me, crying out <hi>Blasphemy</hi>) for a Man to go for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to an arrant Cheater and Jugler (then cheating most when he calls all others Cheaters.)</p>

            <p>But whether it be Christian obedience, or Diabolical laziness to fling off all means (as <hi>Fox</hi> all along teacheth) to sit still and listen to immediate Teachings (that is say I to the Devils whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) I believe the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> would give much to be rid of the Scriptures: I know also, that notwithstanding their pretence of Spirit, yet both of them are forced to use means, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Preaching, Congregating, and(in stead of the holy means by Gods Spirit) have appointed many Inventions and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from a Satanical Spirit.</p>

And this is far from being Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Advocates for sin (as <hi>G.

            <p>A ninth Instance is in page 28. where G. Fox. tells how the same Author preacheth an external word [<hi>Which the Scripture speaks not of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Richard Baxter</hi>
                  </note> but of the word that lives, abides and endures for ever, and of the Scriptures of Truth that cannot be broken: and of Gods words and Christs words, and that is not external: this is not agreeable to sound words that cannot be condemned: but that is like his Doctrine that knows not the Eternal: but the Ministers of Christ did not tell of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word, but you being made by the will of man speaks to the People of an external word.</hi>]</p>
            <p>I Reply, The word (whether external, internal, or eternal) is a
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:000228_0204_0FA36BECC64C2AD8"/>
similitude, for we know God hath no Mouth, nor Tongue, nor Words as we have: but as Kings, and Generals of Armies or Navies, or any Commanders in chief signifie their minds by Speech, by Writing, yea by sign (at a distance) this Word or will, which was before in the Kings breast, and internal is now outward or external. Hence Christ Jesus above all other wayes of Gods manifesting himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally or outwardly is called the Word of God, and the Word which was God. Hence in common speech we call our Thoughts our selves [<hi>So I think, &amp;c. this is my Word, my Vote, or Mind.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And as it is in the Field: If a General himself who first gave the external Word from his own internal Thoughts:<note place="margin">

               </note> if he forget the word in the night a common Sentinel will make him stand, or fire upon him: and shall men be so careful in these transitory businesses, and shall we suffer open Enemies to the true Lord Jesus presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to pass without the external word or mind of God, and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to deny such a word at all to be? When Christ Jesus <hi>Luke</hi> 4 spake out of the <hi>Prophet Isaiah:</hi> and when <hi>Paul</hi> disputed three Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes out of the Scriptures, and when <hi>Apollos</hi> mightily convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ, did they not use external, audible Expoundings and Applyings of that written word or mind of God as the external and outward manifestation of his internal and eternal holy Pleasure.</p>
            <p>A tenth Instance is in page 32. where <hi>G. Fox</hi> brings in <hi>Ellis Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> saying [<hi>The Quakers Spirit doth teach them to honour no Man.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I told them I could adde more Branches to this <hi>Head,</hi> as unto the peace and civil Societyes of Mankind in the world: but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred my promise of <hi>Brevity,</hi> and <hi>W.

               </note> and they hasted me on to prove that their <hi>spirit</hi> tended to <hi>Barbarisme:</hi> they said (one and an other) that their <hi>spirit</hi> was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, and the Grace of God had appeared to all men and had taught them to deny all <hi>ungodliness</hi> and worldly <hi>lusts,</hi> and to live <hi>soberly, righteously &amp; godly</hi> in this present world.</p>
            <p>I told them that in our <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> and in all <hi>civilized Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> the civility, Courteous Speech Courteous Salutation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Behaviour was generally practised,<note place="margin">

I mused in my self (being much acquainted with the <hi>Natives</hi>) what <hi>G. Fox</hi> should mean, he not having been in <hi>N.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Indians and Quakers of one Spirit.</hi>
               </note> for generally they have boldly come in without <hi>Knocking</hi> or asking of leave, and sit down without any respect in word or gesture to the Governour or chief of the Family whosoever (just the <hi>Quakers</hi> general fashion and Spirit).</p>
            <p>Further I told them, that in some respect the spirit and cariage of the <hi>Quakers</hi> was worse then that of the <hi>Indians,</hi> for if they were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the <hi>English</hi> in the <hi>high-way</hi> or coming into an <hi>House,</hi> they are very ready to receive your <hi>Salutation</hi> kindly, and to return you an other: But commonly we know that it is not so with the <hi>Quakers bruitish spirit.</hi> 2. The <hi>Indians</hi> morning and evening, and upon all meetings, they give a respective and proper <hi>Salutation</hi> to their own <hi>Superiours,</hi> and sometimes in gesture as well as speech. 3. Although the <hi>Indians</hi> are <hi>bruits</hi> in their <hi>Nakedness</hi> both men and women, yet they never appear (no not in private houses) <hi>stark naked</hi> as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker men</hi> and <hi>women</hi> doe: yea they so abhor such a <hi>bruitishness,</hi> (except it be in there mad <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> for then they will be <hi>stark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi>) that as to their <hi>Female kind,</hi> they will carefully from their birth keep on some modest covering before them. <hi>W.

               </note> but he said if the Lord God did stir up any of his <hi>Daughters</hi> to be a Sign of the <hi>nakedness</hi> of others he believed it to be a great Cross to a Modest womans Spirit, but the <hi>L</hi>ord must be obeyed. <hi>John Stubs</hi> immediately seconded him, and quoted again the Command to <hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> 20. to go naked &amp; he added, whereas I said at <hi>Newport</hi> that it was in the time of <hi>Signs, Types, Figures &amp;c.</hi> He would now prove that all <hi>Signs</hi> were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished by the coming of Christ, for <hi>Agabus Act.</hi> 20. took <hi>Pauls

            <p>A 11. <hi>Instance,</hi> is in <hi>Pag.</hi> 40. where G.<hi>Fox</hi> brings in <hi>I. Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Deacon.</note> saying <hi>[The enjoyment of Immortulity is not till they have put off the Body.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He Answers, [Contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, who saith, <hi>Immortality was brought to light through the Gospel:</hi> this was when they were upon the Earth, and the Word of God was in them which was Immortal.]</p>
            <p n="1">1. I Reply First, G. <hi>Fox</hi> affirms an Immortality (that is a not dying of the Soul and Body) As for the Soul, all true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants affirm that the Soul once raised up to Spiritual Life never dyes,<note place="margin">The Quakers dream about not dying or Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</note> no more then Christ Jesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. as for the Body Papists and Protestants, and the Quakers and all the World grants, that <hi>all Flesh is as grass,</hi> &amp;c. and the Sentence of Death, by sickness, Age or Casualty is impartially executed upon the <hi>Foxians</hi> as well as other Cattel: As to the Soul, who of sober Papists or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants questions the Immortality of it: and of the Body also, in joy or Sorrow to Eternity.</p>
            <p>As for the Body the Quakers say when the Soul is gone into God, yea, the Soul of <hi>Judas</hi> as well as the Soul of <hi>Peter</hi> as some of them say, and all of them by Argument will be forced to say, the Body returns to Earth and Rottenness, never more to be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no more then Bodies of the Beasts, Birds and Fishes, (though we know who holds the Bodies of Beasts, Birds and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes shall live again as the Soul mortalists do) what is it then
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000228_0234_0FA36C03477D2CE0"/>
that G. <hi>Fox</hi> sputters out for Immortality, or a not dying in this Life? If he speak of the Soul who denies it? If of the Body he speaks a Beastly Contradiction to the doleful Sense of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and their own also, who die and rot as well as them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is true, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>God only hath Immortality dwelling in the Light which no man can approach unto,</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>G. <hi>Fox</hi> Answ. which shews, that he knows nothing of Christ the <hi>second Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit.

            <p>I Reply, 1. I know it pleased God (in all Ages) to stir up the Spirits of some Men (as the Philosophers amongst the Greeks

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. The utmost of Reason in these Excellent Men, it is known I say, that the Activity of the highest Reason in this World falls short in two grand particulars.</p>

            <p>I Reply, First, What is the Light of Nature, but that Light in which every man comes into the World with (as the <hi>Foxians</hi> speak) a Light differing from that Light which Beasts,<note place="margin">The light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture discussed</note> wilde and tame, and Birds, and Fishes have: And a Second Light differing from what is Supernatural, as that Light revealed from Heaven in the Holy Scriptures, and infused into the Souls of Men by the Holy Spirit or Power of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is the Light of Nature in Man, but that Order which the most Glorious Former of all things hath set (like Wheeles in Clocks or Watches) a going in all his Creatures?</p>
            <p>Some have observed that in the Insensible Creatures to which the most High hath only given Beings,<note place="margin">Male and Female</note> that there may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Male and Female amongst them.</p>

            <p>Most of all in Rationals: Men and Women, whom the most High hath so wonderfully distinguished.</p>

            <p>And it is true, the Wisdome of God prefers some Women before thousands of Men, in their being born of Nobles, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts (as is observable in the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> &amp;c.) in some special favour,<note place="margin">The kindness of God to women</note> as Christ Jesus first appearing to <hi>Many Magdalen</hi> and other Women, and sending them to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the first Tydings or Gospel of his Resurrection to his Apostles: yea, in effusions or powrings forth of an extraordinary measure of his Spirit before Christs coming, as on <hi>Miriam, Deborah, Anna, Huldah,</hi> &amp;c. and at his coming (according to <hi>Joels</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie) on his Daughters as well as his Sons (so that as my opp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites alledged to me in publick: <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangelist</hi> had four Daughters thus extraordinarily endewed) yet this favour of God toward Women destroys not the order which the God of Order or Nature hath set in those Bounds, and Limits, and Distinctions between the Male and Female, the Man and Woman: though the Holy Scripture were silent, yet Reason and Experience tell us,<note place="margin">Womens unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for manly employments</note> that the Woman is the weaker Vessel, that she is more fitted to keep and order the House and Children, &amp;c. that the Lord hath given a covering of longer Hair to Women as a sign or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of covering Modesty and Bashfulness, Silence and Retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and therefore not so fitted for Manly Actions and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Therefore because of <hi>Joels</hi> Prophesie, or because we must not limit or quench the Spirit, as G. <hi>Fox</hi> saith, there is no ground in Gods ordinary course of Nature to permit Women to pretend to be Apostles or Messengers to the Nations, or Preachers and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the Publick Assemblies.</p>

            <p>The 25. Instance is in <hi>Pag.</hi> 90. He brings in the same Author saying, [<hi>There is a kinde of Infiniteness in the Soul, and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>He Answers: Is not the Soul without beginning coming from God,<note place="margin">The Soul man horribly abused</note> and returning into God again, who hath it in his hand, which Hand goes against him that doth Evil, which throws down that which wars against it: and Christ the power of God the best of the Soul, which brings it up into God, which came out from him; hath this a beginning or ending? and is not this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in it self, and more then all the World?</p>
            <p>I Reply, More briefly, (having spoken of the Soul before) That the Soul or Spirit of a Man should be boundless or without limits, without beginning or ending, in a <hi>Blasphemous Monster</hi> begotten of <hi>Hellish Pride</hi> the Father, and <hi>Hollish Ignorance</hi> the Mother: for Infinity and Infiniteness in that sence can be no other but the Infinite and Eternal Power and Godhead transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Capacity of Men or Angels to receive it or conceive the nature of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is true in a secondary way (<hi>a posteriori</hi>) as they say the Spirits of Angels and men are as a Lamp lighted up by the most high and

            <p n="4">4. Among all the Opinions of the Souls Being and Rise, this of Infinity making it God himself, commits two horrible Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</p>

               </note> It Murthers and destroys the Soul.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, The Infinite God himself.</p>
            <p>For the Soul of Man by such a world of woful experience being so subject to change, to sins and sorrows of all sorts. If this should be the Infinity of the Soul and so of God himself, there would be no Infinity at all so stopt, so limited by sins and sorrows:</p>
            <p n="5">5. We use to say (hyperbollically) that such and such a doing is Infinite Pride, but surely it is wonderful and devilish lifting up of the mind of a poor Earthen Pot, though never so high, so wise, so learned, so holy to entertain thoughts of being the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and boundless Infinite power and Godhead.</p>
            <p>The blessed Lord proclaime his Infinite Power, his Infinite Wisdome, his Infinite Greatness, and Goodness, and Potience to poor sinners (as he did unto <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirlwind) and then for all <hi>Jobs</hi> perfection and their own, (which so simply as well as proudly they prate of) they will with <hi>Job</hi> see cause to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor themselves in Dust and Ashes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Such is the inconceivable Infinity in God beyond the reach of all Creatures, that he is not only Infinite but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>The 54th.<hi>Instance</hi> is in <hi>Pag.330.</hi> where <hi>G. Fox</hi> brings in <hi>James Dorram,</hi> saying, [<hi>The Believer is not in sin as the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is,<note place="margin">330. James Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</note> he sins not as the Unbeliever doth: and in another place he saith, the Law is the same to the Believer that it is to the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> Answers, Here any may read thy Confusion, but I say unto thee He that believeth doth not commit Sin, but the unbelief it Sin, <hi>Rom.11.20. And Christ is the End of the Law to every one that believes for Righteousness sake,</hi> Roms10.4. and yet thou puts both Believers and unbelievers under the power of the Law.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Reply,</hi> The Devils (no question) know Sin, they see Sin, but not in the true glass of the holy Scripture:<note place="margin">The fight of Sin as Sin.</note> They see sin as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c. in the fire of the Coal, as dreadful in the punishment, but not in the blackness of the Coale, as against their new Life and Nature, and the purity of the <hi>Eternal,</hi> who hath begotten them unto holiness. The <hi>Robber</hi> and <hi>Murtherer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails his offence at the <hi>Gallows,</hi> though yet his heart is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but (could he) he would murther the Judge, and all that had a hand in his Condemnation and Execution. The Drunkard hates his Sin as a Tyrant over him, only as it brings Discredit to him, so is it with the unclean person, and every other sinner. But it is not so with the <hi>Regenerate or new Born,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sins of the Regenerate.</note> who can no more (unless deceived and Circomvented) touch Sin, then the Devil the Father of it, nor then Fire can delight in Water, nor Light in Darkness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is true, that 7 of the <hi>Romans</hi> is Contended for by the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and in a great measure by the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="unknown:000228_0320_0FA36BDC6B0FC5F0"/>
to Contain not the Combate of the Saints, but of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate within themselves: But the true Protestants have proved from the Scripture, and the Experience of all true Saints that sin and grace, Flesh and Spirit, the Law of the Spirit, and the Law of sin may, and do continue Combating in the Regenerate, or New born, Contrary to that <hi>proud perfection</hi> of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Foxians</hi> in this Life, is more clear then <hi>Pauls Argumentation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between the Flesh and Spirits in Rom.7</note> and upon that his Conclusion <abbr>

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> shews the Sincerity of the <hi>Chast Will</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> unto the <hi>Heavenly Bridegroom,</hi>

            <p>The 56th.

            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Ezek. 18.</hi> How doth it follow, that because the word Righteousness in which <hi>Fox</hi> is in his <hi>wonted Burrough,</hi> signifies divers things, that therefore in this first place it must signify the Imputed Righteousness of God in Christ,<note place="margin">The Word Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny significations.</note> from which a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Invested with it, may really, Totally and Finally depart.
