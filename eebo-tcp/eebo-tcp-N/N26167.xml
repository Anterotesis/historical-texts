         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY virtue of a reſolution of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the United States, paſſed Friday, the 2d of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1798, appointing the Honorable Mr. Sitgreaves, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Harper, Mr. Dawſon, and Mr. Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, a committee with inſtructions to take all ſuch ſteps as might be neceſſary for obtaining the teſtimony of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elijah Clark, reſpecting a letter from the ſaid Clark, to Don Diego Morphy, Conſul of His Catholic Majeſty, at Charleſton, (S. C.) and communicated to the ſaid committee by his Catholic Majeſty's Miniſter Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary—and by virtue of the power veſted in us by the ſaid committee, and agreeable to inſtructions, bearing date the 20th of February, 1798, WE James Hendricks, William Barnett, David Creſswell, Robert Chriſtmas, John Griffin, and Edwin Mounger, met at Col. Wiley Pope's, in the county and ſtate aforeſaid, and having cauſed General Elijah Clark to come before us—Who being ſworn by William Barnet, Eſq. one of the Juſtices of the Inferior court, to make true anſwers to the interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories tranſmitted to us and Benjamin Taliaferro, Eſq. or any two of us, by the ſaid committee—Depoſeth to the firſt interrogatory, and ſaith:</p>
            <p>That he wrote the letter of which the annexed is a copy, to the beſt of his knowledge and belief, and to the perſon to whom it is addreſſed.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond interrogatory, he ſaith, There was an application made to him as ſuggeſted in the ſaid letter. That the application was made to him by one William Carrick, to the beſt of his recollection, ſome time in the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034786_0003_0FFF5D3957E6ED50"/>
month of May, in the year 1797, at his houſe in Wilkes county. That the ſaid Carrick came to his houſe the day before any propoſitions were made, and tarried all night. That he appeared to know this deponent, and ſaid he had ſeen him about ten years before, in Savannah, tho' this deponent could not call to his mind that he had ever ſeen the ſaid Carrick before—that during the evening he talked much of the exiſting war between France, Spain, and England—that the day after his arrival, ſome little time after breakfaſt he informed this deponent that he was a Britiſh captain then from Charleſton, and intended to return there as ſoon as poſſible, by the way of Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, where he expected to ſee Col. John M'Intoſh, and that he was authorized by the Britiſh government to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to this deponent 10,000 dollars, as mentioned in the ſaid letter, as a ſalary, if he, this deponent, would engage in the Britiſh ſervice, againſt the Spaniards and French; and this deponent ſhould hold in the ſaid ſervice, the ſame rank that he held in the ſtate of Georgia.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid propoſals were oral, and not in writing: And this deponent further ſaith, that after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly refuſed to cloſe with the ſaid propoſitions, the ſaid Carrick aſked this deponent, if any ſum would engage this deponent to enter into the ſervice of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government? And having explicitly informed the ſaid Carrick that nothing could induce him to enter into their ſervice, the ſaid Carrick extorted a promiſe, that nothing more ſhould be ſaid of the propoſitions, ſo as aforeſaid made, which this deponent felt no reluctance in giving; not believing at the time, that a diſcloſure could in any manner be intereſting to the government of the United States. That the deſign, ſcheme or enterprize was not diſcloſed to this deponent: And that the ſaid Carrick left the houſe of this deponent in one half hour, he believes, after the ſaid propoſitions were made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>To the third Interrogatory he ſaith, that he does not know of any propoſals made by and on the part of the Britiſh, or any other foreign nation, to any other citizen
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034786_0004_0FFF5D4D9117BF68"/>
or citizens of the United States, for the purpoſe of engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in any enterprize hoſtile to the United States.</p>

            <p>ON the 23d of November laſt, the Miniſter Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary of his Catholic Majeſty, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Committee of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, charged to enquire into the nature and extent of the conſpiracy of William Blount, a letter purporting to have been written by General Elijah Clark, of Georgia, to the Spaniſh Conſul, at Charleſton, (S. C.) dated "State of Georgia,—Waſhington, 9th Auguſt, 1797," and containing a declaration in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words—
<q>An application was made to me from the Britiſh, through a channel which bound me to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, if not acquieſced in, and this queſtion aſked me by that perſon,—Whether a ſalary of 10,000 dollars would or would not induce me to join the Britiſh?</q>
—The Houſe of Repreſentatives having deemed it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to inveſtigate the contents of this letter, and, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to obtain a diſcloſure of the application to which it refers, have, for that purpoſe, appointed a committee
<q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:034786_0005_0FFF5EA627ECCF58"/>with inſtructions to take all ſuch ſteps as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for obtaining the teſtimony of the ſaid General Clark or any other perſon or perſons, touching the ſubject matter of the ſaid letter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You will receive herewith, a copy of the report of the late committee, referring to and including the letter of General Clark; and alſo a copy of the reſolution of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the 2d of February in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, for the appointment of the preſent committee.</p>
            <p>Being informed that you reſide in the vicinity of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Clark, and having perfect confidence in your zeal and attachment to the welfare of our common country, we have thought that we could not better diſcharge the functions aſſigned to us by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, than by delegating to you the care of the examination of the ſaid General Clark, and of ſuch other witneſſes in the ſtate of Georgia, as from his information, or from any circumſtances within your knowledge, you may be led to believe can throw any light on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>In purſuance, therefore, of the powers and duties committed to us by the ſaid reſolution, of the 2d of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1798, we do hereby requeſt and authorize you, or any two or more of you, to call before you, at ſuch place as you ſhall appoint, and as ſoon as conveniently may be, after the receipt hereof, the ſaid General Elijah Clark, and to examine him, upon oath, in relation to the premiſes, on the interrogatories accompanying this letter, and on ſuch others as may appear to you to be proper or neceſſary to effect the deſired diſcloſure, or which may grow out of the examination.</p>
            <p>We do further requeſt and authorize you, or any two or more of you, to cauſe to appear before you, ſuch other perſon or perſons as you may deem to have any knowledge of the ſubject of this enquiry; and to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ſuch perſon or perſons, touching the ſame, on oath, on ſuch interrogatories as the occaſion may require: and to make return of the ſaid interrogatories and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as ſoon as may be, to the committee aforeſaid, at Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:034786_0006_0FFF5ED9A57F8490"/>The recited paragraph from the letter of General Clark ſtates, that the application, alluded to, was made to him under injunctions of ſilence. A good citizen will have no ſecrets in relation to ſubjects involving the intereſts or welfare of his country: And the committee have no doubt that General Clark, paying reſpect to the high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, will make, without any heſitation, a full and particular diſcloſure of all the circumſtances relative to this application: the more eſpecially, as having already departed from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction ſo far as to mention, that ſuch an application had been made to him, it becomes more ſtrongly his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, now, to relieve the anxiety which this partial commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication has produced. You will preſent theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to him in ſuch manner as you ſhall think moſt likely to be effectual, and to prevent the neceſſity of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning General Clark to the ſeat of government.</p>
            <p>The expenſes which may be neceſſarily incurred in the execution of the buſineſs hereby committed to your care, will be reimburſed to your order on the Clerk of the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>

            <p>SIR—I RECEIVED your letter by Major Patton, requeſting me to inform you the propoſitions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who made them to me reſpecting my junction with the Britiſh. The peculiar and delicate manner in which theſe propoſitions were made, and the delicacy with which the whole buſineſs was conducted, prevents me from giving you that ſatisfaction on the ſubject which I wiſh. I can only ſay that an application was made to me from the Britiſh, through a channel which bound me to ſilence if not acquieſced in: And this queſtion aſked me by that perſon—Whether a ſalary of ten thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars would or would not induce me to join the Britiſh? I anſwered that no ſum could ever induce me to join the Britiſh upon any occaſion whatever. In fact I reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the offer with diſdain. Could I be more explicit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject, I would gratify you with pleaſure, but from the circumſtances heretofore mentioned, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident your good ſenſe will dictate, that ſilence on my part is the moſt prudent act.</p>
