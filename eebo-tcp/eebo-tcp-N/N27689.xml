            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS day is remarkable. This day, ſixty-eight years ago, had the honour to witneſs the nativ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of one of the greateſt and beſt of the human race. You will readily conceive, that the reference applies to the late General GEORGE WASHINGTON, whoſe memory is bleſſed. This day, therefore, has often been celebrated, in many of our cities and towns, in commemoration of that happy event.—Some of you, I preſume, have ſeen the lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive emblems of publick joy diſplayed upon that occaſion, and have partaken in the high-wrought affection.</p>
            <p>HAPPY were it for us! happy were it for the whole nation! were this the only object of publick attention, this day. But the caſe is greatly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036906_0005_100B31B6584C46A0"/>
The harp is now turned to mourning; for that venerable and illuſtrious Perſonage has lately cloſed his eyes upon the light of life, and is now no more.</p>
            <p>ON the 14th December laſt, a regretful day now to be adopted into the gloomy annals of mortality, his invaluable life was taken from the earth.</p>
            <p>THE winged tidings, as if an hoſt had periſhed, or a whole city ruſhed to ruin, pervaded the whole land. The bereaved nation is now ſeen, as the Prophet ſaw the tents of Cuſhan, in affliction; or, as were the choſen tribes in the wilderneſs, lamenting the death of their Moſes.</p>
            <p>THIS day, ſo often the joyful anniverſary of his birth, is now, by authority, made ſacred to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral honours. Alas for the day! <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> How is the ſcene changed! Yet, the nature of this changeful world conſidered, perfectly in order.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the propriety of the publick ſolemnities of this day be demanded, while the publick loſs, and the ſublime virtues of our aſcended Patriot, in ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn aſſemblies, reſound from the lips of a thouſand ſelected orators; I ſhall make ſome reply.</p>
            <p>MOURNING for the dead, with funeral reſpect for the great and good, eſpecially ſuch as have been great and publick benefactors, is a dictate of nature, ex-emplified in the practice of all nations, the diſciples of Divine Revelation not excepted; and appears to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036906_0006_100B31B858708010"/>
be countenanced, at leaſt, by Revelation itſelf. The principle, like other natural principles, has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to exceſs; has often been the parent of the groſſeſt abſurdities, and even of abominable idolatries. Hence, mere frail mortals have been deified; and ſome of the moſt polluted wretches, ſainted. Laſt reſpects to virtuous deſerving character, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more can be done, are often overdone. This is no reaſon that nothing of the kind ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. If any thing be due from the living to the dead, it is an honourable remembrance. Who lives, and wiſhes not that his honours, if he has any, may outlive him? Such a principle, under due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, is not without its uſe; is a ſtimulus to the acquiſition of perſonal accompliſhments and merit; a motive, among greater motives, to a virtuous and honourable practice. More virtue exiſts, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, becauſe it is known, that its praiſe ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive its poſſeſſor. What leſs than to check vice, and encourage virtue, did the wiſe king of Iſrael intend, when he uttered that memorable aphoriſm? "The memory of the juſt is bleſſed; but the name of the wicked ſhall rot."</p>
            <p>As Pagan, Jewiſh, and Chriſtian princes, poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, heroes, &amp;c. have been publickly honoured by their funeral rites; who will deny the preſent claim, in behalf of our WASHINGTON, to be juſt?</p>
            <p>I PRESUME, it is now the wiſh of this whole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, moſt certainly it is mine, that I were able
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036906_0007_100B31B9DB021BB8"/>
to do juſtice to a character, ſo much the ornament and boaſt of our nation. But, inſtead of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſcribe a character ſo exalted, I will honour him yet more another way; by acknowledging it is above my reach. To this ſmall tribute of praiſe (for ſmall indeed it is) I will add that which is far greater; by announcing to you, that others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Eulogiſts, who have acted the part before me, have confeſſed the attempt to be deſperate.—What deſcription of the fun, when ſhining in his meridian luſtre, ſhall improve the intuitive idea of his ſplendor? That muſt be a fair hand, that touches the driven ſnow without injury to its native white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Suffice it for me further to ſay, that on every pronunciation of the glorious name, GENERAL WASHINGTON, rides forth the idea of a bright aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage, if I may not ſay, the aggregate, of virtues.</p>
            <p>I SHALL attempt, however, with great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive brevity, and as great diffidence, to retrace the mighty and beneficent deeds of one, who has been ſo much the organ of ſalvation and bleſſings to his native country, and our own.</p>
            <p>SINCE the day of ſome, and before the day of others, of us, the now United States of America were appendages of the Britiſh nation. The parent ſtate ceaſed to govern them with affection, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged political chains for them. Born free, and accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to a liberal government, they revolted at the idea of ſubjugation. Coercive policy met their firm
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036906_0008_100ADD25AC1BEE60"/>
united reſiſtance. Fleets and armies were employed againſt them. It was neceſſary that an oppoſing army ſhould be raiſed and organized. An important, but not difficult queſtion aroſe; Who ſhall take the chief command? no doubt was long entertained. WASHINGTON was appointed. Not for filthy lucre, not from the pride of his heart, not to ſupport a lawleſs faction, not to drive in ſunder the nations for conqueſt or plunder; but "for the help of the Lord againſt the mighty;" for the help of his then oppreſſed, already wounded, and bleeding country, he greatly aroſe, and accepted the awful charge.</p>
            <p>WHAT followed is well known. He came; he fought; he conquered. Long time, with various ſucceſs, at the head of his brave republican legions, he oppoſed the mighty invaders of our rights and poſſeſſions; thoſe who blockaded our harbours, rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged our coaſts, burned our cities to aſhes, and ſhed rivers of innocent blood. When the proſpect dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened before him, deſpondency found him not; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs could not flatter him to abate his vigilance. As the fruits of his proweſs, ſo happily accompanied with prudence and perſeverance, whole armies, one after another, became his mortified captives; and he unbuckled not his armour till all oppoſition gave way before him; till he ſaw the proud foe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity proſtrated and trembling under the point of his ſword, and his native land a quiet habitation. Then, and not before, he reſigned the auguſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and retired to the common rank of a citizen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:036906_0009_100B31BD9A29BD18"/>
IT was not long, before the united voice of the nation called him forth from his beloved retirement, to preſide over the realms his valor had ſaved.—This honour was done him a ſecond time; a third time was prevented only by his abſolute refuſal, for reaſons he adduced. By his adminiſtrations, as Chief Magiſtrate, it was made evident, that nature had formed him for the ſceptre, as well as for the ſword.</p>
            <p>THE nation being threatened again with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of war, to whom was it natural for them to look for protection, under God, but to their veteran Hero, who had ſo recently conducted them to vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and peace? The ſolicitations of Government, therefore, prevailed with him to reſume the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſword, and take the command of the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary forces. Under the honours of this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the command of the Arbiter of life, to which the higheſt muſt ſubmit, he made his mighty exit, and retired, all are confident, to peaceful regions.</p>
            <p>How imperfect the review! Draw upon your memories, call up faithful hiſtory, to ſupply the preſent lack of narration. From theſe ſources of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation it will appear, that ſuch were his virtues and talents, and ſo directly and ſucceſsfully exerted for the benefit of his generation, that he roſe to fame by his own merits, and, foreign to his main object, attached to himſelf honours to an effulgence of glory. His praiſe is in all the nation; it ſurpaſſes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036906_0010_100B31C011B514C0"/>
her limits; and, like the rays of the prince of day, is gone out into all the world. It re-echoes to us from every enlightened people. It will progreſs with civilization, till both embrace the ends of the earth. And his name ſhall endure, as long as virtue and talents, employed for the beſt purpoſes, ſhall command plaudits from a human tongue. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our confidence of its perpetuity, by addreſſing to him that ancient poetic line, as pertinent to the purpoſe as in its primary application;
<q>Semper honos, nomenque tuum, laudeſque manebunt.</q>
Pardon the unknown tongue, and take the ſenſe thus:
<q>Forever live thy name, renown and praiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>DESERVEDLY great as the publick mourning is, is there no conſolation?</p>
            <lg>
               <l>No grief ſo great, but remedies are found;</l>
               <l>There's balm in ſtore to heal a nation's wound.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>IN behalf of our deceaſed benefactor, mourning, we preſume, is needleſs; tears would be waſted.—Why weep for the dead, who have accompliſhed every important purpoſe of life, and retired to their rewards? To his more publick character as a patriot, we are happy in being able to add, that he, whoſe memory we celebrate as the Saviour of our country, was himſelf a diſciple of the Saviour of the world; believed in, and profeſſed, the Chriſtian Religion;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036906_0011_100B31C194A48BC0"/>
was in church-fellowſhip; and attended the ſacred ordinances; and, in his more private walks, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſteps by the heavenly rules and maxims of the goſpel. Such a one muſt have happineſs ſecured. Earth, bad as it is, cannot deny it him; death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deprive him of it; the eternal world, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, muſt improve it to perfection.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>For Vernon's mount, that with a palace vies,</l>
               <l>He now poſſeſſes heavenly paradiſe:</l>

            <p>THE publick loſs we juſtly deplore. The breach is wide like the ſea. But, conſolation offers itſelf to us from the higheſt ſource. We piouſly exult in the language of the Prophet, in a dark day; "Art not thou from everlaſting, O Lord our God, our holy One? We ſhall not die," as a nation, though WASHINGTON, ſo long and ſo much the breath of our noſtrils, be taken from us. Be we but a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous people, and the Lord will provide for us. With him is the reſidue of the ſpirit. When Moſes the ſervant of the Lord was dead, He raiſed up Joſhua, to lead the choſen race to their deſtination. Nor are we left in a ſituation only to hope againſt probability, ſo long as there is an ADAMS, a JEFFER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, and others we could name; even an hoſt of patriots who ſurvive, to watch over, defend, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036906_0012_100B31C4057E6EE0"/>
improve the glorious fabric of our union and polity, according to the pattern that has been ſhewed them from the Mount (Vernon).</p>
            <p>AND may we not conſole ourſelves, in part, from the conſideration of the flouriſhing ſtate of literature in our nation? that the ſcientific fountains will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for a ſucceſſion of wiſe and faithful rulers, to go in and out before us; and of Generals too, to command our armies, ſo long as the world around us ſhall remain ſo depraved and rapacious, as to make the art and occupation of war neceſſary for defence.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſhall we praiſe our WASHINGTON, and neglect HIM who is higher than the higheſt? Herod made an oration to the people, and committed an error that proved fatal to the pompous orator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; "he gave not God the glory." And far be it from us, in imitation of a late refinement upon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, to addreſs our publick gratitude to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional genius. We are not aſhamed to mention the name of the Lord, who rules in the kingdom of men; our hope in the day of evil; in the day of proſperity, our ſong. Is WASHINGTON celebrated this day, as having been our political Father, our Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactor, our Saviour? For this purpoſe God raiſed him up, to ſhew forth by him his mighty power, and his extenſive goodneſs, before all the people.—He foreſaw our deſtinies, and fitted him exactly for our purpoſe: raiſed him up in the right time: he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036906_0013_100B31C6989B0E98"/>
was of proper age the moment his ſervices were wanted; nearly the age of Moſes when he entered upon his divine legation, to liberate the poſterity of Jacob, from the oppreſſions of the tyrant of Egypt. The Creator of man united in him ſtrength of body, and vigour of mind; formed him by nature and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for his work; made him impregnable to the force of corruption, ſhould the proffered price of his fidelity be the greateſt, and laviſhed upon him the talents of war and of government. The Preſerver of man ſtrengthened his warlike arm, and covered his anointed head in the day of battle; not an hair of his head fell to the ground; nor was a drop of his blood ſhed by the ſword of the enemy. Happy for us! the ſame man, WASHINGTON, had, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Chief Command of our forces, from the beginning to the end of the memorable conflict.—The honoured inſtrument deſerves an honourable remembrance; but the ultimate praiſe muſt take an higher direction, even to the God of armies and battles, who turneth the victory on which ſide he pleaſeth. Thus we "render unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſar's; and unto God the things that are God's."</p>
            <p>LOOK now for a reward of your further attention, in a concluding word of advice.</p>
            <p>DO we honour the memory of General WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON this day, as having been our benefactor, and ſo much the inſtrument of our national freedom,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036906_0014_100B31C8ACEB09E8"/>
and preſent happy eſtabliſhment? Hence, theſe are benefits; benefits to be appreciated, defended, and improved. He has left us in a ſituation moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the acquiſition and enjoyment of publick and private property; the cultivation of every virtue; and the practice of pure and undefiled religion, which is under a divine promiſe of this life, and the life to come. Therefore, let us ſtand faſt, let us ſtand right in, and prize and improve, the liberty with which we are made free, by the ſword of the LORD, and of WASHINGTON his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>YOU will now allow me to retire within my proper ſphere, and act the preacher, ſo far as to exhort all preſent, heedfully to attend to the voice that cries, "All fleſh is graſs, and all the glory of man as the flower of the graſs:" the ſolemn voice of mortality, I mean, now become peculiarly impreſſive, by the fall of this mighty one, this earthly god, who has died like another man, and fallen like one of the princes. In regard to death, the high and low, the illuſtrious and obſcure together, ſtand on equal ground; there is no pre-eminence. "The ſmall and the great are there"; "and there is no diſcharge in that war." Let us fight the good fight of faith; and the reward will be, a crown of glory that ſhall not fade.</p>
