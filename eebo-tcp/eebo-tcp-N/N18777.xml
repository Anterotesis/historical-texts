            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I WAS much pleaſed when I heard of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to publiſh a Magazine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Monthly Miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For you muſt know, Mr. Aitken, that I have long had an earneſt deſire to appear as an author before the reſpectable public. When I walk out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which I frequently do, obſervations and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ariſe in my mind, which appear to me as wiſe and important as many of thoſe which the preſs is continually obtruding upon the public notice.</p>
                     <p>TRUE it is, I have never yet been able to collect
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:024407_0006_0FC70B0E68E68CF0"/>
a ſufficient number of theſe bright ideas to form a regular piece of compoſition: but I had great hopes, that if a proper occaſion ſhould offer, I might be able to furniſh a ſhort eſſay upon ſome ſubject or other.</p>
                     <p>YOU may wonder, perhaps, why I have not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hand in ſome of the public newſpapers; but the truth is, that what with your <hi>Citizens,</hi> your <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> your <hi>Lovers of Liberty,</hi> your <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men,</hi> and your <hi>Immoderate Men,</hi> there is no getting a word or two in, edge-ways, amongſt them. Now, I look upon your propoſed magazine as a pleaſant little path, where a man may take an agreeable walk with a few orderly and agreeable friends, without the danger of being joſtled to death in a crowd.</p>
                     <p>I DETERMINED, therefore, to make my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in your firſt number; and, for this purpoſe, I ſat whole hours alone in my chamber: I took ſolitary walks, and implored every muſe to aſſiſt me.—But all in vain.—Thoſe hard-hearted god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes were deaf to my earneſt invocations, and abſolutely refuſed to attend me, either in their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt ſuits of flowing rhyme, or in their common dreſs of home-ſpun proſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="unknown:024407_0007_0FC70B102BB85260"/>THE firſt important difficulty I met with was the choice of a ſubject; much fruitleſs time was waſted in this purſuit. The whole train of ſciences paſſed in review before me; I choſe, and rejected, my choice; I determined, and altered lay determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſo many enticing objects courted my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that fancy hovered over them like a bird, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined where to ſettle.</p>
                     <p>Having, one evening, wearied myſelf with this mental exerciſe, I retired to reſt. During the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hours of night, when the powers of my ſoul, no longer ſubjected to the directions of my will, were reſigned to the influences of the ſpiritual world, I was entertained with the following very EXTRAORDINARY DREAM.</p>
                     <p>I FOUND myſelf in a place where a thick fog ſurrounded me, and ſcreened every object from my view. The exerted powers of viſion could extend no farther than a few yards round me.</p>
                     <p>AT length I perceived a denſe and ſutty cloud, gradually deſcend and reſt before me. I attended its motions with earneſt application. I obſerved that it boiled in circling eddies, and laboured with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine conflict; it burſt with a peal of thunder, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024407_0008_0FC70B15EDBFF9A0"/>
vaniſhed in thin air: and I ſaw an angelic form of exquiſite beauty ſtanding before me. She was clad in flowing robes, white as the new fallen ſnow, and was inveſted with an atmoſphere of lambent glory. She addreſſed me in words to this effect:
<q>Happy art thou, oh mortal! and highly favoured in this interview! I am TRUTH; and as thou art in the earneſt purſuit of knowledge, I am come to impreſs upon thy mind, by ſenſible objects, a comprehenſive view of human wiſdom.</q>
Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, ſhe waved her right hand, and the fog diſperſed. I then perceived that I was ſtanding on a beautiful eminence, which commanded an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted view of a very extenſive garden. Three ſides of this garden were bounded by a lofty and ſubſtantial wall; the fourth was waſhed by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ocean.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>WHAT thou ſeeſt before thee, (ſaid my divine companion,) <hi>is the garden of human knowledge.</hi> It is ſurrounded by a high wall, becauſe the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of finite beings muſt be finite; and it lies on the banks of the ocean of <hi>eternity.</hi> You may obſerve, that it has but one gate, leading into a long and narrow <hi>path,</hi> on which nothing grows but a few nutritious fruits and ſalutary herbs. After this, innumerable walks and alleys branch
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024407_0009_0FC70B181F2B37B0"/>
out, directing to the ſeveral departments of the garden.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I SEE your eyes are fixed upon that remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tree in the middle of this ſpacious garden. It does indeed make a very ſingular appearance now; but it was once the glory of the whole ſcene. It is the tree of <hi>religion,</hi> and its fruit is the moſt delicious and ſalutary that can be found in the whole garden. The folly of mankind hath reduced it to the deplorable ſituation in which you now ſee it. Some thought its branches were too large, and ſpread too far: and leſt their ſhade ſhould ſtint the growth of the paltry weeds they had planted under them, they lopt off many of them cloſe to the ſtock. Others, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, concluded that, as it was ſo beneficial a tree, there could not be too much of it, and therefore permitted the ſuckers to grow round its roots; and moreover, brought cions from other trees and grafted them on the ſtock. Some learned botaniſts inſiſted that all the virtues of this tree were contained in the fruit, and would have all the leaves ſtripped off, as being of no uſe; whilſt others, as learned, contended, that if the leaves were preſerved, it ſignified nothing whether it bore fruit or not. Thus by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>ſyſtems</hi> and <hi>improvements,</hi> they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

                        <q>TURN your attention now to yonder labyrinth. That is the LAW department in the garden of knowledge. In the centre ſtands an elegant ſtatue of <hi>Juſtice:</hi> but the ways that lead to it are ſo intricate, and the paths ſo narrow and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with each other, that by the time thoſe who reach it have got half through the puzzle, they become more anxious to find their way back than to proceed. For you muſt know, that the alleys are formed by ſtone walls and wooden fences ſtuck full with nails and tenter-hooks; ſo that, if the bold adventurer ſhould even reach the ſtatue, he gets there in a moſt ragged, and, ſometimes, naked condition. Moreover, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances to all theſe paths and alleys were much encumbered with weeds, bruſh, and thorns; but a celebrated modern <note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſtone.</note> hath taken the pains to clear away a great deal of the rubbiſh, and has drawn a plan of the ſeveral windings and intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this labyrinth for the benefit of mankind, yet the tenter-hooks remain in the walls as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as ever.</q>

PHYSIC. It abounds, indeed, with a great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of medicinal herbs and plants; but the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is, that the miſapplication of their powers and qualities by unſkilful pretenders, hath been the ſource of much miſery to mankind. Add to this, that the affectation of pomp and myſtery, and the fopperies of faſhion, have too frequently rendered this important branch of knowledge ridiculous in the eye of truth.</q>

It was once enriched with a great profuſion of fruits and flowers of exquiſite ſcent and varied hues: but theſe have long ſince been gathered by the artiſts of former days. It is kept, however, in neat order, and furniſhes many gay garlands and agreeable noſegays. It muſt be owned too, that a modern poet <note n="*" place="bottom">Shakeſpeare.</note> cultivated here a number of flowers and ever-greens, with uncommon ſucceſs.</q>

                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024407_0012_0FC70B2711F45810"/>HERE I interrupted my kind inſtructor, by aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what that ſtrange looking place, near the walls of the garden, might ſignify.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>THAT place, (ſaid ſhe) is a ſwamp, overgrown with briars and thorns. It is the department of LOGIC; and the moſt uſeleſs and untoward ſpot in the whole garden of knowledge. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, there are not wanting ſome who take delight in cultivating it. You ſee what odd nooks and angles form the outward boundaries; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts are alſo cut by a thouſand crooked paths, turning and winding, dividing and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, and all to no purpoſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>THE proprietors of this ſwamp have, in vain, endeavoured to drain it, as it lies lower than all the neighbouring ground. They have, however, ſomewhat improved it by ſhutting up the moſt uſeleſs paths, and throwing bridges and cauſe-ways over the marſhy places. They have been pleaſed to dedicate their labours to me; but I ſhould be ſorry if any of my votaries ſhould ſo far miſpend their time, as to ſeek for me amidſt the trifling intricacies of that barren place.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>NEAR to this ſwamp you ſee METAPHYSICS; but this department lies ſo cloſe to the wall
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024407_0013_0FC70B28BAD59D70"/>
which bounds all human knowledge, and is ſo ſhadowed thereby, that it produces very few plants whoſe virtues can be depended upon. The labourers in this ground are continually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make peep-holes through the wall, by which they may diſcover the adjacent country: but the materials of which that wall is made are too hard to yield to any tools they can work with.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>HERE my divine inſtructor turned to me, and ſaid:
<q>I would willingly point out to you the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and deſtination of all the other parts of the garden; but I perceive that by the natural courſe of your conſtitution, your ſpirit will ſoon be again ſubject to your will, and of conſequence plunged in the vortex of the buſy world. I haſten, therefore, to communicate to you ſome very important intelligence, reſpecting both the ſpiritual and material kingdoms. Truths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of human inveſtigation, which will tend to enlarge your mind, and give you the moſt exalted ideas of the Omnipotent Author of nature.</q>

By the ſtudy of natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and aſtronomy men acquire ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the oeconomy of the <hi>Great Supreme.</hi> In ſome inſtances demonſtration and fact confirm the truths diſcovered; but, in others, fanciful hypotheſes are ſubſtituted for truth, and errors become ſanctified by ſyſtem, and habitual by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. My preſent deſign is to remove ſome of theſe prejudices from your mind, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich your underſtanding with <hi>true philoſophy.</hi>

Think, Mr. Aitken, what a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was to me to be ſo unſeaſonably interrupted, when I was juſt going to receive the ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the lips of truth. Inſtead of converſing further with that divine perſonage, I was obliged to attend the impatience of Monſ. le Friſeur; who, without ceremony began to ſmeer my face with naſty ſoap-ſuds.

                     <p>I MUST not forget, however, to tell you, that in a pleaſant corner of the garden of knowledge,

                     <head>For the Pennſylvania Magazine. AN IMPROVED PLAN OF EDUCATION.</head>
                     <p>THERE are few objects in life of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance than the proper culture and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who muſt in time ſupply the places of the preſent generation.</p>
                     <p>VERY arduous is the taſk of education, both to the induſtrious teacher and his aſſiduous diſciples. What thanks then will be due to him who ſhall contribute any thing towards rendering the road to ſcience eaſy and pleaſant, or ſhorten the tedious length of the journey.</p>
                     <p>MANY ſchemes have been formed by ingenious men for this good purpoſe, in which they have endeavoured to blend the <hi>utile</hi> with the <hi>dulce,</hi> in ſo intimate a connection, that the pupil becomes inſenſibly inſtructed, whilſt he thinks he is only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing himſelf.</p>
                     <p>AS I am quite diſpoſed to allow every perſon the praiſe due to his ingenuity, I readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the uſefulneſs of their ſeveral devices: ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024407_0017_0FC70B3335545418"/>
as teaching <hi>geography</hi> by maps paſted on thin boards, and cut into pieces, according to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of counties or kingdoms: <hi>commerce,</hi> by a te-to-tum: <hi>hiſtory</hi> and <hi>chronology,</hi> by a pack of cards: and <hi>Euclid's elements,</hi> by figures cut out of box-wood, with many other ſimilar inventions, by which ſcience is planted in the minds of youth by the fair hand of innocent pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>THE improvement I have made on this idea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me ſo important, that I cannot forbear of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to the public for general uſe; heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending my plan to the truſtees of our college, and to the patronage of the legiſlature. I have, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not only united inſtruction with delight, but added alſo the invaluable bleſſing of <hi>health</hi>; making theſe deſireable acquiſitions to go hand in hand, mutually improving and ſtrengthening both mind and body, by one amuſing proceſs.</p>
                     <p>IN order to execute my plan, it will be neceſſary to purchaſe about twenty acres of level ground, which muſt be well cleared of all incumbrances; and, if laid out in a circular form, it may be called the <hi>whole circle of ſciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TO begin with <hi>grammar,</hi> which coſts the poor boys much trouble and painful attention: I beg
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024407_0018_0FC70B34A71347D8"/>
leave to quote a paſſage from a late humorous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; from which, I muſt in juſtice acknowledge, I took the hint of my improved plan of education. The paſſage I allude to is this.</p>
                     <p>"HERE, <hi>Jackey,</hi> let the gentleman <hi>ſee</hi> you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the pronoun article <hi>hic, haec, hoc.</hi> Maſter Jackey immediately began hopping about the room, repeating <hi>hic, haec, hoc;</hi> genitive, <hi>hujus,</hi> dative, <hi>huic;</hi> uccuſative, <hi>hunc, haec, hoc;</hi> vocative, <hi>caret;</hi> ablative, <hi>hoc, haec hoc.</hi> There now, ſays <hi>Selkirk,</hi> in this manner I teach him the whole grammar. I make eight boys repreſent the eight parts of ſpeech. The <hi>noun ſubſtantive</hi> ſtands by himſelf; the <hi>adjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> has another boy to ſupport him; the <hi>nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive caſe</hi> carries a little wand before the <hi>verb;</hi> the <hi>accuſative caſe</hi> walks after and ſupports his train; I let the <hi>four conjugations</hi> make a party at whiſt, and the <hi>three concords</hi> dance the hay together, and ſo on."</p>
                     <p>BY this contrivance, the common exerciſe of <hi>hop-ſtep</hi> and <hi>jump</hi> is rendered truly grammatical, and the head and the heels are improved by one operation.</p>
                     <p>IN like manner, may the young ſcholar be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in <hi>arithmetic,</hi> by the healthful play of

                     <p>IT is eaſy to ſee that in ſuch a commodious piece of ground the ſeveral branches of mathematics, as <hi>trigonometry, ſurveying, navigation,</hi> &amp;c. may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by actual exerciſe, in a mode very amuſing to the ſtudent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>NATURAL philoſophy</hi> may alſo be taught by the ſports in common uſe amongſt boys. The <hi>vis iner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi> of matter, <hi>elaſticity,</hi> and the general laws of <hi>motion</hi> may be evidenced in playing <hi>marbles, fives,</hi> and <hi>bandy-wicket.</hi> The doctrine of projectiles, the accelerated velocity of falling bodies, and the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolic curve,</hi> the <hi>centrifugal force,</hi> and the laws of <hi>gravitation,</hi> may be underſtood by ſhooting arrows, ſlinging ſtones, and throwing ſnow-balls. <hi>Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics</hi> will be taught in the uſe of the <hi>pop-gun,</hi> flying of kites, blowing bladders, and lifting ſtones with a piece of wet leather and ſtring: and <hi>hydroſtatics</hi> may be illuſtrated by the <hi>ſquirt</hi> and other aquatic amuſements.</p>

                     <p>THUS far the common ſports of boys may be made the vehicles of inſtruction; but ſome ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity on the part of the tutor will be requiſite to teach them <hi>moral philoſophy</hi> and <hi>aſtronomy.</hi> In order to the firſt, I would propoſe that the ſeveral <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> of the mind be repreſented by as many boys, each of whom ſhould have his deſtined courſe and diſtance aſſigned by the tutor, who ſhould himſelf repreſent <hi>reaſon.</hi> Theſe boys ſhould all be blindfolded, and ſtarted as for a race; and whilſt they are running, <hi>helter-ſkelter,</hi> in full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, the tutor ſhould exert himſelf with great vociferation to direct them to keep in their ſeveral courſes: calling out to one to ſtop, to another to to puſh forward, and to all of them not to joſtle or interfere with each other. It would be proper that the ſtouteſt and moſt active boys ſhould perſonate the <hi>paſſions,</hi> and that the cooler <hi>affections</hi> of the

                     <p>TO teach <hi>aſtronomy,</hi> it will be neceſſary to make uſe of the whole twenty acres of ground: which muſt be divided by concentric circles, at proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſtances, for the orbits of the planets. Let the tutor place himſelf as the ſun, in the centre: the larger boys repreſenting the primary planets, and the ſmall ones attending them as ſatellites. The tutor, by the help of a ſpeaking trumpet, muſt direct them how to perform their ſeveral revolutions in due order of time and place; which cannot fail giving theſe peripatetic philoſophers a competent idea of the ſolar ſyſtem.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOUR <hi>Old Bachelor</hi> having pathetically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the miſeries of his ſolitary ſituation, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reproaching himſelf for having neglected to marry in his younger days; I would fain alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate his diſtreſs, by ſhewing that it is <hi>poſſible</hi> he might have been as unhappy—even in the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate of matrimony.</p>
                     <p>I am a ſhoemaker in this city, and by my induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and attention have been enabled to maintain my wife and a daughter, now ſix years old, in comfort and reſpect; and to lay by a little at the year's end, againſt a rainy day.</p>
                     <p>MY good wife had long teaſed me to take her to New York, in order to viſit <hi>Mrs. Snip,</hi> the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an eminent taylor in that city, and her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin; from whom ſhe had received many preſſing invitations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:024407_0025_0FC70B4EE64FC128"/>THIS jaunt had been the daily ſubject of diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at breakfaſt, dinner, and ſupper for a month before the time fixed upon for putting it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As our daughter <hi>Jenny</hi> could by no means be left at home, many and great were the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to equip Miſs and her Mamma for this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant journey; and yet, as my wife aſſured me, there was nothing provided but what was <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary,</hi> and which we could not poſſibly do without—My purſe ſweat at every pore.</p>
                     <p>AT laſt, the long expected day arrived, preceded by a very reſtleſs night. For, as my wife could not ſleep for thinking on the approaching jaunt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ſhe ſuffer me to repoſe in quiet. If I happened through weariſomeneſs to fall into a ſlumber, ſhe immediately rouſed me by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable queſtion or remark: frequently aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if I was ſure the apprentice had greaſed the chair-wheels, and ſeen that the harneſs was clean and in good order; often obſerving how ſurpriſed her couſin Snip would be to ſee us; and as often wondering how poor dear Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> would bear the fatigue of the journey—Thus paſt the night in delightful diſcourſe, if that can with propriety be called a diſcourſe, wherein my wife was the only ſpeaker—my replies never exceeding the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſyllables
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024407_0026_0FC70B5064C86990"/>
                        <hi>yes</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> murmured between ſleeping and waking.</p>
                     <p>NO ſooner was it fair day-light, but up ſtarted my notable wife, and ſoon rouſed the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The little trunk was ſtuffed with baggage, even to burſting, and tied behind the chair, and the chair-box was crammed with trumpery which <hi>we could not poſſibly do without.</hi> Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> was dreſt, and breakfaſt devoured in haſte: the old ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro wench was called in, and the charge of the houſe committed to her care; and the two appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and the hired maid received many whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cautions and inſtructions for their conduct during our abſence, all which they moſt liberally promiſed to obſerve; whilſt I attended, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite patience, the adjuſtment of theſe preliminaries.</p>
                     <p>AT length, however, we ſet off, and, turning the firſt corner, loſt ſight of our habitation, with great regret on my part, and no leſs joy on the part of Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> and her Mamma.</p>
                     <p>WHEN we got to Poole's Bridge, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a great concourſe of waggons, carts, &amp;c. ſo that we could not paſs for ſome time— Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> frightened—my wife very impatient and uneaſy—wondered I did not call out to thoſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024407_0027_0FC70B51DEDE1D68"/>
impudent fellows to make way for us; obſerving that I had not the ſpirit of a louſe. Having got through this difficulty, we proceeded without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction—my wife in good humour again—Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> in high ſpirits. At <hi>Kenſington</hi> freſh trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ariſe—Bleſs me, Miſs <hi>Jenny,</hi> ſays my wife, where is the band-box? I don't know, Mamma; the laſt time I ſaw it, it was on the table in your room—What's to be done? the band-box is left behind—it contains Miſs <hi>Jenny's</hi> new wire-cap— there is no poſſibility of doing without it—As well no New York as no wire-cap—there is no alternative, we muſt e'en go back for it. Teaſed and mortified as I was, my good wife adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſolation by obſerving,
<q>That it was my buſineſs to ſee that every thing was put into the chair that ought to be, but there was no depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me for any thing; and that ſhe plainly ſaw I undertoook this journey with an ill-will, merely becauſe ſhe had ſet her heart upon it.</q>
Silent patience was my only remedy. An hour and an half reſtored to us this eſſential requiſite—the wire-cap, and brought us back to the place where we firſt miſſed it.</p>
                     <p>AFTER innumerable difficulties and unparalleled dangers, occaſioned by ruts, ſtumps, and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous bridges, we arrived at Neſhamony ferry: but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024407_0028_0FC70B57E09C34A0"/>
how to croſs it was the queſtion. My wife pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that neither ſhe nor <hi>Jenny</hi> would go over in the boat with the horſe. I aſſured her that there was not the leaſt danger; that the horſe was as quiet as a dog, and that I would hold him by the bridle all the way. Theſe aſſurances had little weight: the moſt forcible argument was that ſhe muſt go that way or not at all, for there was no other boat to be had. Thus perſuaded, ſhe ventured in—The flies were troubleſome—the horſe kicked—my wife in panics—Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> in tears.—<hi>Ditto</hi> at <hi>Trenton-ferry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>AS we ſtarted pretty early, and as the days were long, we reached Trenton by two o'clock. Here we dined. My wife found fault with every thing; and whilſt ſhe diſpoſed of what I thought a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearty meal, declared there was nothing fit to eat. Matters, however, would have gone on pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well, but Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> began to cry with the tooth-ach—ſad lamentations over Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi>—all my fault, becauſe I had not made the glazier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place a broken pane in her chamber window. N. B. I had been twice for him, and he promiſed to come, but was not ſo good as his word.</p>
                     <p>AFTER dinner we again entered upon our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney—my wife in good humour—Miſs <hi>Jenny's</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:024407_0029_0FC70B5C1E62C730"/>
tooth-ache much eaſier—various chat—I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge every thing my wife ſays for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſing her. We arrive in good time at <hi>Princetown.</hi> My wife and daughter admire the College. We refreſh ourſelves with tea, and go to bed early, in order to be up by times for the next day's expedition.</p>
                     <p>IN the morning we ſet off again in tolerable good humour, and proceeded happily as far as <hi>Rocky-hill.</hi> Here my wife's fears and terrors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with great force. I drove as carefully as poſſible; but coming to a place where one of the wheels muſt unavoidably go over the point of a ſmall rock, my wife, in a great fright, ſeized hold of one of the reins, which happening to be the wrong one, ſhe pulled the horſe ſo as to force the wheel higher up the rock than it would otherwiſe have gone, and overſet the chair. We were all tumbled <hi>hickledy-pickledy,</hi> into the road—Miſs <hi>Jenny's</hi> face all bloody—the woods echo to her cries—my wife in a fainting fit—and I in great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; ſecretly and moſt devoutly wiſhing couſin <hi>Snip</hi> at the devil. Matters begin to mend—my wife recovers—Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> has only received a ſlight ſcratch on one of her cheeks—the horſe ſtands quite ſtill, and none of the harneſs broke. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters grew worſe again; the twine with which the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024407_0030_0FC70B60DDC039E8"/>
band-box was tied had broke in the fall, and the aforeſaid wire-cap lay ſoaking in a naſty mud-puddle—grievous lamentations over the wire-cap —all my fault becauſe I did not tie it better—no remedy—no wire-caps to be bought at <hi>Rocky-hill.</hi> At night my wife diſcovered a ſmall bruiſe on her hip—was apprehenſive it might mortify—did not know but the bone might be broken or ſplintered— many inſtances of mortifications occaſioned by ſmall injuries.</p>
                     <p>AFTER paſſing unhurt over the imminent dangers of <hi>Paſſayack</hi> and <hi>Hackenſack</hi> rivers, and the yet more tremendous horrors of <hi>Pawlas-hook</hi> ferry, we arrived, at the cloſe of the third day, at cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Snip's</hi> in the city of New York.</p>
                     <p>HERE we ſojourned a tedious week; my wife ſpent as much money as would have maintained my family for a month at home, in purchaſing a hundred uſeleſs articles <hi>which we could not poſſibly do without;</hi> and every night when we went to bed fatigued me with encomiums on her couſin <hi>Snip</hi>; leading to a hiſtory of the former grandeur of her family, and concluding with inſinuations that I did not treat her with the attention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I ought.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:024407_0031_0FC70B64F0D59E10"/>ON the ſeventh day my wife and couſin <hi>Snip</hi> had a pretty warm altercation reſpecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative elegancies and advantages of New York and Philadelphia. The diſpute ran high, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aggravating words paſt between the two advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. The next morning, my wife declared that my buſineſs would not admit of a longer abſence from home—and ſo after much ceremonious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, in which my wife was by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by her very polite couſin, we left the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous city of New York; and I with heart-felt ſatisfaction looked forward to the happy period of our ſafe arrival in Water-ſtreet, Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>BUT this bleſſing was not to be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much vexation and trouble—but leſt I ſhould ſeem tedious I ſhall not recount the adventures of our return—how we were caught in a thunder ſtorm—how our horſe failed, by which we were benighted three miles from our ſtage—how my wife's panics returned—how Miſs <hi>Jenny</hi> howled, and how very miſerable I was made. Suffice it to ſay, that, after many diſtreſſing diſaſters, we arrived at the door of our own habitation in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NO ſooner had we entered the houſe, but we were informed that one of my apprentices had

ran away with the hired-maid, no body knew where; the old negro had got drunk, fallen into the fire, and burnt out one of her eyes; and our beſt china-bowl was broken.</p>
                     <p>MY good wife contrived, with her uſual inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, to throw the blame of all theſe misfortunes upon me. As this was a conſolation to which I had been long accuſtomed in all untoward caſes, I had recourſe to my uſual remedy, viz. ſilent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. After ſincerely praying that I might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſee couſin <hi>Snip,</hi> I ſat induſtriouſly down to my trade, in order to retrieve my manifold loſſes.</p>
                     <p>THIS is only a miniature picture of the married ſtate, which I preſent to your <hi>Old Bachelor,</hi> in hopes it may abate his choler, and reconcile him to a ſingle life.

                     <p>—OH, that I had been made an oyſter!— that I had been ſtationed in the bottom of the ſea —the winds might have blown and ſwelled the waves mountains high; I ſhould not have heeded them. Mankind might have ſatiated themſelves with folly, iniquity and deceit; it would not have troubled me. But, what is better than all, I ſhould have propagated my ſpecies by a numerous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, without the cares, without the plagues, without the expences of a female aſſiſtant.</p>
                     <p>HERE ſome journeyman philoſopher would interrupt me with a learned diſſertation on ſexes; and prove, by a chain of irrefragible ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that oyſters are male and female.— What's that to you, ſir? Who aſked your opinion? The deuce is in theſe coxcombs, that they cannot let a man go on in his own way, but they muſt be throwing ſtraws acroſs his path.—Go, Mr. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, go, catch butterflies, and ſearch for the pineal gland of a muſketoe.</p>
                     <p>OH, that I had been an oyſter!—'Tis true I ſhould not have known what are called the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024407_0034_0FC70B6925F233F0"/>
joys of life; that is, I ſhould not have eaten turtle-ſoup and veniſon till I nauſeated both, nor have drank Madeira till I loathed it.—True,—neither ſhould I be tormented with the treachery of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the hypocriſy of relations, or the inſults and ſarcaſms of my fellow oyſters.</p>
                     <p>YOU ſhould have heard from me before this, Mr. Aitken, but I have been ſick, very ſick,—al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the point of death; I caught cold by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a damp ſhirt.—If I had been married, my wife, perhaps, would have taken care that my linen ſhould have been well aired—perhaps not. Be this as it may, I caught cold, and was very ſick. Nobody troubled their heads about me; I lay helpleſs, languiſhing and neglected above; my ſervants rioted and plundered below; every thing ran into confuſion. The common comforts of the ſick were not adminiſtered to me; I lay many hours alone, brooding over my own melancholy reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I thought I ſhould die—I ſuppoſed myſelf dead—I ſaw my own funeral—Not a ſingle tear to embalm my memory. A few ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling neighbours attend the ſcanty proceſſion, converſing on politics, or the current news of the day, as they follow me to the grave. The day after the funeral, ſome perſon of the next ſtreet aſks one of my near neighbours, "Pray,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024407_0035_0FC70B70C62A79D8"/>
how does the Old Bachelor? I hear he is ſick." "He was ſick, but he is well enough now—he was buried yeſterday."—"Dear me! I never heard of it—and how has the old curmudgeon left his eſtate?—"To the Pennſylvania Hoſpital." No more is ſaid about me—they paſs on to other chat. After three days, I am no more thought of than if I had never exiſted, except by the managers of the Pennſylvania Hoſpital. No widow to be viſited and comforted for the loſs of me—no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to keep my name and memory alive in the world, and to talk of their dear father, ſome ten or a dozen years after my deceaſe. No elegy in verſe or proſe to celebrate the virtues I never poſſeſſed, or palliate the faults I really had. Not even a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph in the newſpaper to announce my departure —Yes—I had ſome comfort in ſuppoſing that my name might creep into the fag-end of your Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, under the liſt of deaths, with a declaration that I had charitably left my eſtate to the Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania Hoſpital.</p>
                     <p>SUCH was the diſmal train of ideas that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my imagination. My diſorder encreaſed, my life was deſpaired of. Some half a dozen ſecond and third couſins came to ſee me. They diſguſted me with their officious and overacted kindneſſes. "Why did you not ſend, my dear couſin, to let
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024407_0036_0FC70B721CFAC320"/>
me know you was ſick?" "I never heard a word of it till this morning, and I came the moment I was informed of your danger." Says another,— "Do take this."—" Pray try that."—"There is nothing better for a fever, I have known it to do wonders." Another of my very loving couſins ſat down by my bedſide, and with a doleful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance began a lecture upon the uncertainty of life, and the certainty of death. After a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place obſervations he came to the point he had in view. "I hope, my dear couſin, (ſaid he) that you have ſettled your worldly affairs; your loving relations expect it of you; I hope you have made your will; theſe things had better not be delayed; it will be an eaſe to your mind when that neceſſary buſineſs is over, and you will not die an hour the ſooner for having completed it. We all hope you may recover; God grant you may! But, as we are all mortal, and know not how ſoon we may be called upon, it is prudent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt the worſt." I told him that my will was already made, and that I had no inclination to alter it. My couſins continued to teaſe me with unremitting cruelty; my ſtrength was ſo exhauſted that I could not ſcold, ſtorm and ſwear, as I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do. I fretted inwardly; my phyſician, too, was in league with my couſins; he denied me every thing I deſired, and forced upon me every

thing I loathed and abhorred; my ſituation was truly deplorable. I earneſtly longed for a draught of cold water; I requeſted it in terms of the moſt pathetic ſolicitation; but to no purpoſe.—At length I prevailed upon an old negro wench, who is not worth a farthing, and yet the moſt valuable ſervant I have got, to bring me, privately, a tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard of water freſh from the pump. I drank it off greedily. It threw me into a profuſe ſweat and deep ſleep—it ſaved my life—I began to recover. No ſooner was I out of danger, but my loving cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, whom I had not ſeen for four years before my illneſs, left me with one conſent: and it is more than probable, that they will not viſit me again for four years to come—Heaven grant they may not! But I fancy I need be under no apprehenſions on that account, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SUCH is the forlorn ſtate of an <hi>Old Bachelor.</hi> Sick or well there is none will do him a ſervice, or even an act of charity, but from intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. I ſometimes wiſh I had married when I was young; but when I look round amongſt my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and ſee a tyrannical and extravagant wife, a reprobate ſpendthrift ſon, and a daughter, running off with the firſt vagabond that offers, I
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024407_0038_0FC70B7C801AEAA0"/>
hug myſelf in my ſolitary ſtate, and bleſs my ſtars that I did not marry when I was young.</p>
                     <p>UPON the whole, <hi>I find</hi> ſo many reaſons to wiſh myſelf a married man; and <hi>ſee</hi> ſo many reaſons to rejoice that I am not; that my mind is like the pendulum of a clock hanging in ſuſpenſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually vibrating between two opinions.</p>
                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the fine things that have been ſaid, time out of mind, about the married ſtate, I am perſuaded that he who marries muſt venture boldly. It is not a ſubject that will bear much reaſoning upon. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred it is <hi>paſſion,</hi> or <hi>intereſt,</hi> not <hi>reaſon,</hi> that points to matrimony. Should a man, before he engages, call up to view all the diſaſters, troubles, and inconveniences, ſome of which probably may, and others certainly will, occur in the married ſtate, he would never have the courage to engage in it. In my youthful days I fancied myſelf in love two or three times; I even made ſome advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a courtſhip: but I <hi>reaſoned</hi> too much on the conſequences, and therefore I remain, as you ſee, a <hi>fretful Old Bachelor.</hi>

                     <p>—I might have ſat in my elbow chair till doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and revolved the matter over and over again, till my brain had become as dry as a box of Scotch ſnuff. I might have waſted the midnight lamp; read all the works of the learned, and of the unlearned, upon the ſubject; and even out-ſtudied <hi>Duns Scotus,</hi> without being able to determine the point. 'Tis very ſtrange, ſaid I, that any ſpeculation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould be ſupported and contradicted, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and confuted by reaſons ſo exactly balancing each other as to leave the judgement hanging in ſuſpence like Mahomet's coffin. The hundred-thouſandth part of a grain would ſet all agoing; and yet I cannot throw that hundred-thouſandth part of a grain into one ſcale, but I find juſt as much hath dropped into the oppoſite. In a word, I found it impoſſible to determine, whether I had better marry or not.</p>
                     <p>AT laſt, <hi>an accident</hi>—who would have thought it!—<hi>an accident</hi> ſettled this important queſtion; broke down the dam which I had been ſo many years building up, ſtrengthening and repairing, and let out all my objections at once in a torrent. It

would have ſurpriſed any body to ſee how many prudential motives, ſelf-love, avarice, pride, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of opinion, &amp;c. tumbled out, helter ſkel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, head-over-heels, in the guſhing ſtream. Here lay <hi>Pride,</hi> bouncing and flouncing indignant through the foaming tide; there lay <hi>Avarice,</hi> wriggling and twiſting in mud and ſlime—On one ſide, <hi>Self-love,</hi> like a tortoiſe, collected within its own unſocial ſhell; on the other, thouſands of odd notions and <hi>peculiarities of opinion</hi> crawling about like ſnails, tad-poles, and unformed vermin.</p>
                     <p>BUT the accident, which occaſioned this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revolution, is worth relating—</p>
                     <p>I acquainted you in a former letter, with my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and recovery. For the better eſtabliſhment of my health, exerciſe and air were much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. I made it a practice, therefore, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the weather was ſuitable, to walk two or three miles before dinner. One day, as I was taking my uſual excurſion along the road that leads to the lower ferry on Schulkyl, two women paſſed me in a chair. The youngeſt of the two drew the attention of a momentary glance. I thought I ſaw ſomething in her that made me wiſh for a longer view. They had not proceeded above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards when their horſe took fright, ran up
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024407_0041_0FC70B8124724E98"/>
againſt the fence, and overſet the chair. I made all poſſible haſte to the aſſiſtance of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ladies. The elder ſeemed to have received no great injury; but the young lady, either from the force of the fall, or through fear, had fainted away. I took her in my arms; her head reclined upon my boſom—ſhe was delicate—ſhe was lovely: I felt an anxiety I never felt before. Love, though I knew it not, ſtole into my heart under the diſguiſe of compaſſion. I chaſed her temples, her wriſts, and the palms of her hands. The ſoft touch thrilled through every vein, and awakened unuſual ſenſibilities. She recovered, and, obſerving her ſituation, with a gentle effort, diſengaged herſelf from my arms, and thanked me for my care with graceful eaſe and a lunguiſhing voice. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lady, who was her mother, joined in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements. The horſe and broken chair were left at a neighbouring houſe, and I inſiſted on conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladies home.</p>
                     <p>LITTLE paſſed during this walk but thankful expreſſions on the part of the ladies, and polite aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances on mine. I did not fail, however, to examine the young lady's perſon and deportment with great attention, and the more I obſerved the more I was pleaſed with her. As they were both much diſcompoſed by the accident, I did not think
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024407_0042_0FC70B858FAF9060"/>
it proper to intrude upon them at that time; but took my leave at the door, with a promiſe to wait upon them the next day to enquire after their health.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I returned home, this adventure engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all my thoughts; I ſecretly wiſhed myſelf ſome twenty years younger, that I might with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make this aimable young woman all my own. What a treaſure, ſaid I, muſt ſhe be to a man of ſenſe and delicacy: How happy ſhould I be at this time if I had, in the earlier part of my life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected myſelf with ſuch a ſweet companion—but I have miſſed the golden opportunity, and muſt e'en fret out the remainder of my days as well as I can.</p>
                     <p>THE day was long—the night longer. The next morning was chiefly ſpent in preparations for my afternoon's viſit. I was uncommonly particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar about my dreſs, although I had no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined object in view. The barber had expreſs orders reſpecting the dreſſing of my wig; my beſt ſuit of broad-cloth was taken out of the preſs, and my new beaver neatly and carefully bruſhed. In ſhort, I was more attentive to my preparations for this viſit than I had been for many years. But I
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024407_0043_0FC70B86916E47C0"/>
placed all to the account of politeneſs and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.</p>
                     <p>WHEN all was ready, I went to the glaſs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt my wig. I thought I looked uncommonly well—at leaſt I obſerved a neatneſs in my dreſs and a vivacity in my countenance to which I had long been unaccuſtomed. Certain reflections aroſe in my mind which I could not then ſuppreſs. And thus I reaſoned with myſelf. Few men carry their age better than I do—this muſt be owing to the temperance and regularity of my paſs'd life. A diſcreet man of fifty hath the powers of life in greater vigour than a debauchee of twenty-five. Who knows what may happen?—perhaps—Oh! the enchanting idea!—ſtranger things have come to paſs—my fortune is unexceptionable—my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I think, not diſagreeable, and my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather better ſince my late illneſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. At this inſtant I took up my hat which lay on the table cloſe by an old quarto Family Bible, the corner of my hat, in lifting it, took hold of the upper cover of the Bible and threw it back—when behold! on the firſt leaf of the aforeſaid Bible, theſe words, in very legible characters, ſaluted my eye—
<q>George, the ſon of Thomas and Alice San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was born in the city of London, on the 10th day of October anno Domini ****</q>
—I need
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024407_0044_0FC70B895BF17528"/>
not give you the figures—ſuffice it to ſay, that this malicious accident had a great effect on my mind. It ſtruck the top-ſails of my vanity in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſperſed all the gay ideas I had conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up. I left home ſomewhat diſconcerted; and many jarring ſenſibilities diſtracted my mind till I got to the houſe where I was to make my viſit.</p>
                     <p>IT is time to inform you that the mother of this young lady keeps ſhop in—ſtreet: upon the profits of which, and the intereſt of a thouſand pounds left her by her deceaſed huſband, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports herſelf and her only daughter—Her huſband had been a merchant of ſome note; but partly by loſes in trade, and chiefly by living too expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively for his income, had it not in his power to leave any thing conſiderable to his family. This intelligence I artfully obtained from an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the common way of chat.</p>
                     <p>I was received by my new friends with great cordiality. The mother was all complaiſance and civility, the daughter all ſweetneſs and innocence. Our diſcourſe firſt turned upon the accident of the preceding day. I was happy in finding it attended with no bad conſequences; and happier ſtill (as I took occaſion to obſerve) it had been the means of introducing me to ſuch an agreeable family; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024407_0045_0FC70B939C372CD0"/>
my intention to take advantage of it by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal viſits. To this a reply was made quite to my ſatisfaction. I ſpent the afternoon and a good part of the evening moſt agreeably. I returned home in high ſpirits, and much enamoured with the young lady. I thought no more of the accident of the family Bible, but indulged myſelf for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the night in a thouſand golden dreams.</p>
                     <p>NOW, if ever you expect to hear from me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I inſiſt that you do not entitle this, or any ſubſequent letter from me, <hi>The Old Bachelor.</hi> I am not ſo old perhaps as you may imagine. I dare ſay <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was in leading-ſtrings at my age, or juſt beginning to cut his teeth. A man ſo hearty and ruddy as I am, cannot with any propriety be called <hi>Old—Old</hi> philoſopher, <hi>Old</hi> hermit, <hi>Old</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men, <hi>Old</hi> widower, may be well enough—but <hi>old</hi> ſhould never be applied to a bachelor until he is a great deal older than I am yet—thank God! You may alledge that in ſome of my letters I have called myſelf an <hi>Old Bachelor</hi>—but I was not well then, and ſomewhat low ſpirited—I did myſelf great injuſtice, and have a right to recall the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion—which I now do—Indulge me in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and perhaps you may hear from me again.</p>

                     <head>ON MOTTOS.</head>
                     <p>I WAS much entertained by your friend's expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the devices and mottos which diſtinguiſh our continental bills of credit. When a motto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies a device, there ſhould be ſuch a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them that the one ſhould be explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the other, ſo that a little knowledge of the language from which the motto is ſelected, ſhould be ſufficient for a diſcovery of the author's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent. But I have often puzzled my brains to no purpoſe to tranſlate ſome of the mottos in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry; there being ſeldom any connection between the device and the inſcription. And as the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar of the motto is almoſt always incomplete, I have been inclined to think that the words were only intended as ornamental, in filling up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſpace of a handſome ſcroll.</p>
                     <p>YOUR writers of eſſays and pamphlets are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very fond of mottos—as well no title-page as no motto. The perſon amongſt the Indians who acts in the capacity of phyſician and magician (for they always unite theſe characters) wears a leaf of ſome plant on his forehead or breaſt, to indicate
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024407_0047_0FC70B9A0FBD82B0"/>
his knowledge in the medicinal qualities of herbs; juſt ſo a fragment from Virgil or Horace is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtuck in the title-page of a pamphlet, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew that the author underſtands Latin.</p>
                     <p>IT is curious to obſerve how the works of the ancients have been frittered into ſcraps for this uſe, and how ſtrangely they have been miſapplied. Three or four detached words, having the leaſt ſeeming analogy with the ſubject in hand, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly ſeized upon for a motto: whereas, perhaps, upon examining the paſſage from which theſe words have been plundered, and obſerving what precedes and what follows, we may find a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very different from that to which the modern author hath applied them, if not directly contrary to it.</p>
                     <p>BY the ſame management paſſages in Holy Writ may be adduced as authorities for every ſpecies of immorality and wickedneſs. For example, if I wanted a motto in favour of

                     <p>ABSURD as theſe applications of ſcripture may appear, I have known learned preachers almoſt as much out of the way in handling a text. A text is a motto of the firſt rank, as it is, or ought to be, the ſole buſineſs of the ſubſequent diſcourſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024407_0050_0FC70BA9A320B0E8"/>
and enforce it to the improvement of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. How many ſermons fall ſhort of this end? How frequently is a text to a ſermon, what a motto is to a coat of arms—mere matter of decoration? Or, which is much worſe, how often do preachers diſtort and miſapply texts of ſcripture to favour ſome new doctrine or erroneous dogma?</p>
                     <p>THERE is no doubt but that mottos may be uſed to advantage, when they are ſelected with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and applied as an authority or elucidation of the ſubject in hand. They are with more propriety prefixed to ſhort eſſays than to prolix and elaborate works; becauſe the general ſenſe of a conciſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance may be condenſed into a few words more eaſily than can be expected of a diffuſe and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous work.</p>

                     <head>THE AMBIGUITY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</head>
                     <p>I AM by birth a foreigner, have been ſome years in the mercantile way, and by a ſucceſsful attention to buſineſs have acquired a handſome fortune for a ſingle man. Content with my acquiſitions I cloſed all accounts, and reſolved to travel, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wherever my inclination ſhould determine. This city, for many reaſons, became the place of my choice. I found it abſolutely neceſſary to devote ſome time to the ſtudy of the Engliſh language; and for this purpoſe I purchaſed grammars, dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and ſome of the moſt approved authors in proſe and verſe; all which I ſtudied with no ſmall aſſiduity. I thought, at length, that I had made a conſiderable proficiency; but either I was deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the language itſelf muſt be in the fault.</p>
                     <p>PRECISION in terms, is certainly an important perfection in any language: but, in this, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue ſeems to be very deficient; witneſs the opportunity it affords to your demi-witlings to quibble and pun upon every occaſion; owing, as I apprehend, to the ambiguity of the language: many words having the ſame pronunciation, but
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024407_0052_0FC70BABE3E3ED60"/>
widely differing in ſignification; and many of which are both pronounced and ſpelt preciſely alike, are made to anſwer to very different ideas; hence the noble art of <hi>punning,</hi> to which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Engliſh are more addicted than any other nation.</p>
                     <p>THIS want of preciſion in a language may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be productive of real inconveniences and ſerious miſtakes, as I know by woeful experience. I will relate a few of the grievances I have ſuffered on this account; which may amuſe you, but were, at the time they happened, truly vexatious to me.</p>
                     <p>HAVING a deſire that my beſt room ſhould be genteely furniſhed, I wrote to my correſpondent in London for the purpoſe; and amongſt other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, req<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That the dogs he had ſhipped were of an excellent breed, and were thought to be very great beauties, and that he had ſent me as handſome a ſedan as could be made; apologizing that the other five could not be got ready in time for that conveyance, but ſhould be forwarded as ſoon as completed.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> I was determined to have good <hi>cheer,</hi> let the world go as it would; and then making three loud huzzas, ſaid there were three <hi>cheers</hi> more at my ſervice. I wiſhed the chair at the devil, and curſed the language that was liable to ſo much ambiguity. I ſold this chair for leſs than it coſt me, and had juſt time to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand the five others my correſpondent was preparing to forward.</p>
                     <p>HAVING accidentally broke a lady's <hi>fan,</hi> I ordered my ſervant, the next morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to look for and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the beſt and handſomeſt <hi>fan</hi> he could get, and carry it to the lady with my compliments. My ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant returned, after an abſence of two hours, and told me that the lady refuſed to receive the <hi>fan</hi>; ſaying, that he muſt certainly be miſtaken; that it could not be intended for her; and that ſhe had no uſe for ſuch a thing. I was ſurpriſed, and aſked my ſervant what he had done with it.— "Sir, I have brought it home with me."—"Well, and where is it?"—"At the door in a cart."— "In a cart!—A fan in a cart!"—I ran to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024407_0054_0FC70BB4ED848EB0"/>
and ſaw a huge <hi>Dutch fan</hi> for winnowing corn.</p>
                     <p>AT another time, I wanted to rack off ſome wine, and ſent my blundering ſervant to buy a <hi>crane</hi> for the purpoſe. After a long ſtay, he came back and told me he could not find one in the whole market, but had bought a turkey worth half a dozen <hi>cranes;</hi> very wiſely obſerving, that cranes were but poor eating. In like manner, when I once ſent him to buy a <hi>gooſe,</hi> he brought home a taylor's <hi>iron gooſe</hi> for my dinner. There is no end to my vexations of this kind. Having an inclination to ride out, I ordered him to ſaddle and bridle the <hi>horſe:</hi> but he came into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, ſometime after, with the bridle in his hand, and with an embarraſſed countenance declared he did not know how to put it on the horſe. I called him a blockhead, and went out to ſhew him how it ſhould be done; when, behold, he had contrived to faſten my ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle on the <hi>wood-horſe,</hi> and had been puzzling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the bridle, not knowing where to fix it. At laſt I got myſelf properly equipt; and intending to viſit a friend a few miles out of town, I ſtopped a man on the road, and aſked for directions to my friend's houſe. He told me that I muſt go on about a mile farther, and I ſhould ſee a large houſe on the left hand, and muſt go in at a great gate.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024407_0055_0FC70BB67ACF8AC0"/>
Accordingly, as ſoon as I came in ſight of the houſe, I put ſpurs to my horſe, and rode full gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop up to the door. The family were all greatly alarmed, as I had like to have ran over one of the children in my way, and they were, moreover, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſudden bad news. I told them that I had only obſerved the directions that had been given me, viz. to go in at <hi>a great gait;</hi> but they informed me, that the <hi>gate</hi> at the end of the lane was meant, and not the <hi>gait</hi> of my horſe.</p>
                     <p>ONE of my friends having bought a fine mare for me, I told my ſervant to go and fetch the mare. By and by comes the worſhipful the <hi>mayor</hi> of the city to know what particular buſineſs I had with him. I was confounded with ſhame, and had a thouſand apologies to make.</p>
                     <p>BUT it would be too tedious to recount all the blunders, miſtakes, and croſſes that have occurred to me in conſequence of the duplicity of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue.</p>
                     <p>TO render a language preciſe and determinate, every thing ſhould have its proper <hi>name;</hi> which ſhould differ from all other names as really as the thing to which it belongs differs from all other
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024407_0056_0FC70BC3AD0091A0"/>
things. By applying the ſame appellation to differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubjects, we are under the neceſſity of adding ſome explanatory word for the ſake of diſtinction: which is not only a troubleſome multiplication of words, but a clog to the language, and greatly diminiſhes its force and elegance. Thus, we are obliged to ſay, a <hi>bottle-crane,</hi> a <hi>wood-horſe,</hi> a <hi>fire-engine,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. Would it not be much better if each <hi>thing</hi> had a <hi>name</hi> peculiar to itſelf, by which it might, in one word, be known and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from all other <hi>things?</hi>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or, but will more probably depend on the temper and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the ſoul of each individual to become an angel of light, or a fiend of darkneſs. We cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe that God will forcibly compel any man to be either happy or miſerable. Good and evil are ſet before us, and our own wills muſt determine the choice. Such, indeed, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of our nature, that without divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we are unable to perſevere in the paths of righteouſneſs. This aſſiſtance, however, is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly promiſed to thoſe who ſincerely deſire it. To <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>not to will,</hi> to be good and happy is in our own power; but really to be ſo, is the gift of God. He doth indeed continually incite men to a happy choice by the various diſpenſations of his Providence: either by an accumulation of benefits, which ought to engage their love and gratitude; or by ſuffering them to experience
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024407_0058_0FC70BC6F00A9198"/>
the trials of adverſity, that they may ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of temporal enjoyments, and turn their views to more ſubſtantial happineſs. Yet ſo entirely free is man, that he too often ſuffers neither of theſe powerful inducements to influence his mind as they ought. The ſmiles of proſperity frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly producing arrogance, ſelf-ſufficiency, immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and exceſs: and the wholeſome chaſtiſements of an affectionate Father frequently creating mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſcontent.</p>
                     <p>IN the early periods of life, our ſenſes alone are the touch-ſtones of good and evil. Whatever is grateful and pleaſant to them we denominate <hi>good;</hi> whatever is painful and uneaſy, we denominate <hi>evil.</hi> This ſimple diſtinction is ſufficient for the ſtate of infancy, when the nurture and ſecurity of the body is the chief concern: but when the mind comes to be enlightened by reaſon and religion, it will eaſily perceive, that an undue attention to preſent enjoyments, or a miſapplication of them, may be productive of much future miſery; and that temporal croſſes and afflictions fit the ſoul for eternal happineſs and glory.</p>
                     <p>HUMAN nature hath a ſtrong abhorrence of pain, grief, and care. Were it otherwiſe they
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024407_0059_0FC70BCF8B9633A8"/>
would be of no uſe in weaning the affections from the vanities of the world. Moſt medicines are nauſeous to the palate and ſevere in their operation. In this their virtue conſiſts. Affliction is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of the ſoul. It ſoftens the obdurate heart, and renders it ſuſceptible of good impreſſions. When we are in pain and ſorrow, we learn to feel for the diſtreſs of others, and are prompted to acts of charity. When we find that the pleaſures of the world cannot give ſolid, permanent ſatisfaction— cannot gratify <hi>all</hi> our deſires, we are induced to turn to that only Being who is the ſource of true felicity, and in whom alone there is fulneſs of joy. In the time of diſtreſs <hi>we feel</hi> and <hi>know</hi> what we only had, perhaps, a tranſient idea of before, that the Chriſtian graces and virtues are the only true ſources of happineſs; and will be our comfort in the laſt inevitable hour: when all the palliating vanities of the world, and the anodynes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, muſt entirely loſe their effect. The ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities attendant on affliction and diſtreſs, are too ſtrong to be continued through the common courſe of life. The wounds of the mind will heal as well as thoſe of the body. But if afflictions produce their proper effect, the mind, ever remembering that thoſe things may be, will acquire a calm and ſteady adherence to the dictates of conſcience and the practice of virtue: not as a taſk impoſed by
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024407_0060_0FC70BD0F5AB78B0"/>
a ſuperior power whoſe wrath he would deprecate; but as the higheſt gratification to himſelf. He will become habituated to do good; and what is <hi>duty</hi> in others will be <hi>nature</hi> in him.</p>
                     <p>THUS it is that the calamities of life may become real bleſſings, if a right uſe be made of them. If the ſmiles of proſperity do not fill the ſoul with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, love, and religious joy; they will produce arrogance, ſelf-ſufficiency and pride: If pain, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and diſappointment, the loſs of thoſe we love, and injuries from thoſe who love not us, do not wean the heart from too ſtrong an attachment to the tranſitory pleaſures of life, and direct our views to better hopes; they will either plunge us in the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy eddies of vicious enjoyments, to drown every painful ſenſibility, or will throw the mind into a wicked deſpondency, and occaſion profane mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings againſt the Author of our exiſtence, or fix us in a groſs and ſinful infidelity.</p>
                     <p>I may, perhaps, in ſome parts of this paper, have left open a door for controverſy. But I ſhall not enter the liſts with any one. I would rather ſpend my time in the moſt unmeaning amuſements, than corrupt my heart with the pride and obſtinacy of what is called <hi>religious</hi> diſputation.</p>

                     <p>AFTER reading the paper, I cloſed the book, and reflecting on the ſingularity of the thought, I fell into one of thoſe deep reveries in which the mind is entirely abſorbed, and rendered for a while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inattentive to the objects of the ſenſes; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of waking dream.</p>
                     <p>I fancied myſelf poſſeſſed of ſome of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſnuff, and enabled thereby to examine a variety of characters, diveſted of all diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024407_0063_0FC70BDEE8A3BB78"/>
My heated imagination led me a long chace through the intricate windings of the human heart. The rapidity of my progreſs made it impoſſible to delineate my obſervations on paper: for it takes a great deal more time <hi>to write</hi> than to <hi>think.</hi> But I will try to recollect two or three of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions for your amuſement.</p>
                     <p>AFTER taking a view of many capricious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, I entered the pineal gland of <hi>a miſer,</hi> I found his ſoul ſeated on her throne, with a large family of domeſtics around her: ſome waiting the orders of her <hi>will,</hi> and others executing her purpoſes with the utmoſt attention and aſſiduity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>You ſee, (ſaid ſhe) with what induſtry I am labouring to fulfil the deſigns of our great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. You know that he has aſſigned us our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective little dominions here, that by a proper direction of the <hi>will,</hi> left free for that purpoſe, we may attain <hi>happineſs.</hi> I cannot indeed ſay that I have as yet quite anſwered this benevolent end; but I am ſtriving for it with all poſſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity. I have, by unremitting care and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acquired a large portion of wealth, which would, I believe, make me very happy, were it not for two terrible apprehenſions. One is, leſt, by ſome unforeſeen accident, I ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024407_0064_0FC70BE06393FC88"/>
of the fruit of my long labour; and the other is, leſt an awful ſummons ſhould remove me from this government, and compel me to leave all my hard earned acquiſitions behind. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to guard againſt the firſt of theſe evils by continually making ſuch additions to my ſtock as to render it improbable that any one caſualty ſhould deprive me of the whole: and as the other is without remedy, I endeavour to think of it as little as poſſible.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I now took a view of her family, which I found in a deplorable condition indeed—and no wonder— ſince <hi>Avarice</hi> was prime miniſter, and had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an entire aſcendency over the ſoul. I ſaw <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi> languiſhing under an incurable hectic: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> dying of her wounds: and <hi>Honour</hi> lay gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for breath, and as cold as a ſtone; all the noble paſſions were benummed and <hi>froſt-bitten</hi>; and as for <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhe was cloſe confined under a ſuſpicion of diſaffection to the preſent government, and of having formed a traitorous deſign to obſtruct the ſoul in her purſuit of happineſs. I enquired for <hi>Charity;</hi> but was told that ſhe died an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo: her body, however, had been preſerved in ſpirit, and was ſhown to me as a great curioſity— Natural affection, ſympathy, compaſſion, and all the ſocial feelings were crawling about naked and almoſt ſtarved to death. In the midſt, ſat the ſoul herſelf,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024407_0065_0FC70BE26C048E00"/>
ſullen, fearful, and deeply anxious. She was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clothed with the robes of knowledge, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated with the jewels of fancy. In vain did <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> ſtrive to ſooth her melancholy, by recounting the tranſactions of former times; and <hi>Hope,</hi> who ſhould have ſung of joys to come, had got ſo bad a cold that ſhe could not ſing at all. Her palace was in no better condition than her family. The neceſſary repairs were refuſed or neglected—deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations it had none. Within and without it exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the appearances of extreme poverty. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs fine aqueducts were entirely dried up and in a ruinous condition: others were choaked up with undigeſted crudities, and the animal ſpirits were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſſated by long inactivity, and lazily crept through their ruſty channels—Even the throne itſelf, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal gland, had ſhrunk into leſs than ordinary ſize; from whence it had been concluded, that <hi>the man</hi> had a <hi>little ſoul</hi>—but erroneouſly, for, in fact, ſouls are of no ſize at all.</p>
                     <p>FROM this odious habitation I flew on the wings of thought to a character the very reverſe. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the pineal gland of a Libertine. Here all was uproar and confuſion: the ſoul ſeemed to have loſt her command. Her unruly paſſions had wreſted the government from her hand, and tyranniſed over her domeſtics with unlimited ſway;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024407_0066_0FC70BE84CCA71D0"/>
whilſt the ſoul ſat upon her throne in ſtupid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. <hi>Religion</hi> lay in a deep trance; <hi>Conſcience</hi> was doſing under repeated anodynes; and the the voice of <hi>Charity</hi> could not be heard in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult. <hi>Hope</hi> was waſting in a deep conſumption; and <hi>Fear</hi> lay, with her throat cut, a ghaſtly ſight, but as the wound was not mortal, ſhe made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and dreadful ſtruggles for life. <hi>Ambition</hi> was in a ſtate of inſanity, and played off a thouſand ridiculous gambols; <hi>Love</hi> lay groveling in the mire, with his wings clipt, and all his fine feathers ſullied with mud and filth; and <hi>Honour</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo whimſical and captious, that ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually embroiled in quarrels and diſputes. As to the palace itſelf, it was ſo filled with combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that I expected every minute it would take fire and be entirely conſumed. I left it therefore as ſpeedily as poſſible, and by an eaſy tranſition, found myſelf in the pineal gland of <hi>a ſot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>HERE I found the ſoul ſitting ſolitary on her throne, abridged of almoſt all her domeſtics, and diveſted of almoſt all her powers. She was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a deep and incurable lethargy, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaching to abſolute annihilation. She might have found ſome degree of ſatisfaction even in her inſenſibility, but that <hi>Truth,</hi> whoſe voice ſhe could not ſilence, frequently reminded her, that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024407_0067_0FC70BEC9E648C50"/>
the diſſolution of her dominion was near at hand, when the domeſtics ſhe had now diſmiſſed would return, and become her perpetual tormentors. I obſerved, with great ſurpriſe, that ſhe had loſt much of the ſpirituality of her nature, and ſeemed to be condenſed into an almoſt palpable and viſible maſs of matter. I ſcarcely knew her to be one of us—her habitation, for it could not be called a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, was in a moſt alarming condition. An inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, highly corroſive, had inſinuated itſelf into every department, defiled the very ſeat of majeſty, and undermined the foundation of the building, ſo that it tottered on its baſe, and ſeemed juſt ready to fall in ruins.</p>
                     <p>HAVING gone thus far, I had an inclination to viſit a body after the ſoul had left it. By an effort of imagination, I pierced the grave, and entered the pineal gland of a corpſe newly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But deſcription would here be highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting. Every thing I ſaw inſpired averſion and horror. The hiſſings of putrid fermentation— the cracking of the cordage, and the burſting of cataracts, ſounded through the hollow fabric, and filled me with inconceivable terror and diſmay. But what alarmed me moſt, I perceived a gentle oſcillation beginning in the heart, and felt myſelf conſtrained by a potent influence, like a perſon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024407_0068_0FC70BEF4F0D9B70"/>
with an <hi>Incubus.</hi> Theſe ſymptoms were the effects of my pretence, and fearing leſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection ſhould be formed, I broke the charm by a violent exertion, and with pleaſure returned to my own body.</p>
                     <p>MY efforts were aſſiſted by the noiſe of a fife and drum which juſt then paſſed by my windows, and raiſed me from this ſtrange <hi>revery.</hi>

                     <p>ONCE upon a time, a great while ago, there lived a certain nobleman, who had long poſſeſſed a very valuable farm, and had a great number of children and grand-children.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES the annual profits of his farm, which were very conſiderable, he kept a large ſhop of goods; and being very ſucceſsful in trade, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in proceſs of time exceeding rich and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inſomuch that all his neighbours feared and reſpected him.</p>
                     <p>HE had examined all the known ſyſtems of oeconomy, and ſelected from them, for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own family, all ſuch parts as appeared to be equitable and beneficial, and omitted thoſe which experience had ſhown to be inconvenient or prejudicial: or rather, by blending their ſeveral conſtitutions together, he had ſo ingeniouſly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-balanced
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024407_0070_0FC70BF66E2E0580"/>
the evils of one by the benefits of another, that the advantages were fully enjoyed, and the inconveniences ſcarcely felt.</p>
                     <p>HE never exerciſed any undue authority over his children or ſervants; neither indeed could he greatly oppreſs them, if he was ever ſo diſpoſed; for it was particularly covenanted in his marriage arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that he ſhould never impoſe any taſk or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips upon his children without the conſent of his wife.</p>
                     <p>Now the cuſtom in his family was this:—that at the end of every ſeven years his marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came null and void, at which time his children and grand-children met together and choſe another wife for him, whom the old gentleman was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to marry under the ſame articles and reſtrictions as before. By this means the children had always a great intereſt in their mother-in-law, and through her a reaſonable check upon their father's temper. For, beſides that he could do nothing material re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them without her approbation, ſhe was ſole miſtreſs of the purſe-ſtrings, and gave him from time to time ſuch ſums as <hi>ſhe</hi> thought neceſſary for the expences of his family.</p>
                     <p>BEING one day in a very extraordinary good
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024407_0071_0FC70BF7A6C4D5D0"/>
humour, he gave his children a writing under hand and ſeal, by which he releaſed them from many badges of dependence, and confirmed to them ſeveral very important privileges. The chief of theſe were, that none of his children ſhould be puniſhed for any offence, or ſuppoſed offence, until twelve of his brethren had examined the facts, and declared him ſubject to ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, ſecondly, he renewed his aſſurances that no taſks or hardſhips ſhould be impoſed upon them without the conſent of their mother-in-law.</p>
                     <p>THIS writing, on account of its ſingular impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was called THE GREAT PAPER. After it was executed with the utmoſt ſolemnity, he cauſed his chaplain to publiſh a dire anathema againſt all who ſhould attempt to violate the articles of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> in the words following:</p>
                     <p>"In the name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Amen! Whereas our Lord and Maſter, to the honour of God, and for the common profit of this farm, hath granted for him and his heirs for ever, theſe articles above-written; I his chaplain and ſpiritual paſtor of all this farm, do admoniſh the people of this farm, <hi>once, twice,</hi> and <hi>thrice.</hi>— Becauſe that ſhortneſs will not ſuffer ſo much delay as to give knowledge to the people of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024407_0072_0FC70BF9201E2718"/>
in writing: I therefore enjoin all perſons, of what eſtate ſoever they be, that they, and every of them, as much as in them is, ſhall uphold and maintain theſe articles, granted by our Lord and Maſter, in all points. And all thoſe that in any point do reſiſt, or break, or in any manner, hereafter procure, counſel, or any ways aſſent to, reſiſt, or break theſe ordinances, or go about it by word or deed, openly or privately, by any manner of pretence or colour; I, the aforeſaid chaplain, by my authority, do <hi>excommunicate</hi> and <hi>accurſe;</hi> and from the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and from all the company of heaven, and from all the ſacraments of holy church, do <hi>ſequeſter</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</hi>"</p>

                     <p>NOW it came to paſs, that this nobleman had, by ſome means or other, acquired a right to an immenſe tract: of wild, uncultivated country, at a vaſt diſtance from his manſion-houſe. But he ſet little ſtore by this eſtate, as it yielded him no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor was it likely ſo to do; being not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult of acceſs on account of the diſtance, but was inhabited by numerous wild beaſts, very fierce and ſavage, ſo as to render it very dangerous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt taking poſſeſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:024407_0073_0FC70C0006694028"/>IN proceſs of time, however, ſome of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, more ſtout and enterpriſing than the reſt, requeſted leave of their father to go and ſettle in this diſtant country. Leave was readily obtained: but before they ſet out, certain articles were ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated between them. The old gentleman engaged on his part to protect the adventurers in their new ſettlement; to aſſiſt them in chaſing away the wild beaſts; and to extend to them all the eſſential pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and benefits of the government under which they were born: aſſuring them, that although they would be removed ſo far from his preſence, they ſhould always be conſidered as the children of his family. At the ſame time he gave each of them a bond<note n="*" place="bottom">Charters.</note> for the faithful performance of theſe promiſes: in which it was moreover covenanted, that they ſhould have the privilege of making ſuch rules and regulations for the good government of their reſpective families as they ſhould find moſt convenient: provided only, that theſe rules and regulations ſhould not be contradictory to, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with, the general eſtabliſhed orders of his houſhold.</p>
                     <p>IN return, he inſiſted that they, on their parts, ſhould at all times acknowledge him to be their

father; that they ſhould not deal with others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, but ſend to his ſhop for what they might want, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell the produce of their lands to any but thoſe he ſhould point out.</p>
                     <p>THESE preliminaries being duly adjuſted, our adventurers bid adieu to the comforts and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of their father's houſe. Many and great were the difficulties and dangers they encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the way; but many more, and much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on their arrival in the new country. There they found mountains covered with impervious foreſts, and plains ſteeped in ſtagnated waters—no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roof to ſhelter them from the roaring tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt—no fortreſs to protect them from ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangers—many ſunk under ſickneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and others fell a prey to the barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the country.</p>
                     <p>THEY began, however, under all diſadvantages to clear the land. The woods reſound with the ſtrokes of the ax—they drain the waters from the ſedged moraſs, and pour the ſun beams on the reek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoil. They are compelled to exert all the powers of induſtry and oeconomy for bare ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; and, like their firſt parents, when driven from paradiſe, to earn their bread with the ſweat
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024407_0075_0FC70C03E8891340"/>
of their brows. In this work they were frequently interrupted by the incurſions of the ſavages, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they defended themſelves with great magnanimity.</p>
                     <p>AFTER ſome time, however, by their indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable perſeverance they found themſelves comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſettled, and had the delightful proſpect of fields waving with luxuriant harveſts, and orchards, glowing with the fruits of their labour.</p>
                     <p>IN the mean while they kept up a conſtant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with their father's family; and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at a great expence, the means of procuring from his ſhop ſuch goods and merchandizes as they wanted, for which they duly paid out of the produce of their lands, and the fruits of their induſtry.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                     <p>NOW the new ſettlers had adopted a mode of government in their ſeveral families ſimilar to that to which they had been acuſtomed in their father's houſe: particularly in taking a new wife at the end of certain periods of time, without whoſe conſent they could do nothing material in the conduct of their affairs. Under theſe circumſtances, they
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024407_0076_0FC70C08A8E661F8"/>
thrived exceedingly, and became very numerous, living in great harmony with each other, and in conſtitutional obedience to their father's wife.</p>
                     <p>TO protect them againſt the incurſions of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous natives, and the attacks of ſome of their neighbours, the old nobleman ſent a number of his ſervants, but then he required that they ſhould reimburſe him for the trouble and expence he was at in furniſhing this aſſiſtance; and this they cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did, by applying from time to time to their reſpective wives for the neceſſary caſh.</p>
                     <p>THUS did matters go on for a conſiderable time, to the mutual benefit of the old and new farms. But at laſt the nobleman's wife began to look with an avaricious eye towards the new ſettlers; ſaying to herſelf, if by the natural conſequence of their friendly intercourſe with us, and conſtitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on me our wealth and power are ſo much encreaſed, how much more would they accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, if I can perſuade them, that all they poſſeſs belonged originally to me, and that I may, in right of my prerogative, demand of them ſuch por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their earnings as I pleaſe. At the ſame time, being well aware of the promiſes and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments her huſband had made, and of the tenor and force of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> ſhe thought it beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024407_0077_0FC70C0FE7AEAD18"/>
with great caution, and determined to gain her point, if poſſible, by ſubtile and impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſteps.</p>
                     <p>FOR this purpoſe, ſhe firſt iſſued an edict, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth—That whereas the taylors of her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were greatly injured by the people of the new farm, inaſmuch as they undertook to make up their own clothes, whereby the ſaid taylors were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the benefits that ſhould ariſe from their trade: it was ordained, that for the future, the new ſettlers ſhould not be permitted to have any <hi>ſhears</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Prohibition of ſplitting-mills.</note> or ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars in their families, under ſevere penalties. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, our adventurers were obliged to have their clothes made up by the taylors of the old farm, although they were well able to make them up themſelves. Nevertheleſs, out of reſpect to the old gentleman, they patiently ſubmitted to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                     <p>OBSERVING alſo, that the new ſettlers were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fond of a kind of cyder, which they purchaſed of a perſon in friendſhip with their father (the fruit proper for making this cyder not growing on their own grounds), ſhe iſſued another edict<note n="†" place="bottom">Duty on wines.</note>, obliging them to pay her a certain ſtipend on every barrel
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024407_0078_0FC70C11265BF240"/>

                     <p>THUS ſhe gradually proceeded in her plan, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing internal taxes on the new ſettlers, under various pretences, and receiving the fruits of their toil with both hands: moreover ſhe perſuaded her huſband to ſend amongſt them, from time to time, a number of the moſt lazy and worthleſs of his ſervants, under the ſpecious pretext of defending them in their ſettlements; but, in fact, to rid his houſe of their company, not having employment for them at home: and more eſpecially to be a watch and a check upon the people of the new farm. He had alſo ordered that theſe <hi>protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> as they were called, ſhould be ſupplied by the new ſettlers with bread and butter, cut in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form. But the head of one of the families, refuſed to comply with this whimſical order.

                     <p>AS the old nobleman advanced in years, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the affairs of his family; leaving them chiefly to the management of his ſteward. Now the ſteward had actually debauched his wife, and gained an entire aſcendency over her. She no longer deliberated upon meaſures that might beſt promote the proſperity of the old farm or the new; but ſaid and did whatever the ſteward put into her head. Nay, ſo entirely was ſhe under his influence, that ſhe could not utter even <hi>aye</hi> or <hi>no</hi> but as he directed her. For he had cunningly perſuaded her, that it was very faſhionable for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of quality to wear padlocks on their lips; and he accordingly faſtened a ſmall padlock to each cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her mouth: when the one was open ſhe could only cry <hi>aye;</hi> and when the other was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked ſhe could only ſay <hi>no.</hi> And he took care to keep the keys of theſe padlocks in his own pocket; ſo that her words were the expreſſions of his will rather than of her own.</p>
                     <p>NOW the old lady and the ſteward had ſet themſelves ſtrenuouſly againſt the people of the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024407_0080_0FC70C142636F580"/>
new farm; and began to deviſe ways and means for their total and unconditional ſubjection. And to this end they prevailed on the nobleman to ſign an edict againſt the new ſettlers; in which it was declared, that, as children, it was their duty to contribute towards ſupplying their father's table with proviſions, and towards the ſupport of the dignity of his family; for which purpoſes it was ordained, that all their ſpoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers, ſhould be marked <note n="*" place="bottom">The Stamp act.</note> with a certain mark by officers he ſhould appoint for the purpoſe; for which marking they ſhould pay certain fees into his ſtrong box: and it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they ſhould not, under ſevere penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, preſume to uſe any ſpoon, knife, fork, plate or porringer before it had been ſo marked by the officer, and the fees paid.</p>
                     <p>THE inhabitants of the new farm began now to ſee that their father's affections were alienated from them; and that their mother was but a baſe mother-in-law, governed by their enemy the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. They were thrown into great confuſion and diſtreſs by this diſcovery. They wrote the moſt ſupplicating letters to their father; in which they acknowledged their dependence upon him in terms
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:024407_0081_0FC70C1A3907C6F8"/>
of the moſt ſincere affection and reſpect. They reminded him of the difficulties and hardſhips they had ſuffered in ſettling this new farm; and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the great addition of wealth and power his family had acquired by their improvement of an unprofitable wilderneſs; and ſhowed him that all the fruits of their labour muſt, by a natural cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, finally enrich his money-box. They mentioned, in terms of humility, his promiſes and engagements to them when they left home, and the bonds <note n="*" place="bottom">Charters.</note> he had given them; and held up in a ſtrong point of view, the ſolemnity and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the <hi>Great Paper.</hi> They acknowledged that he ought to be re-imburſed the expences he had incurred upon their account; and that it was their duty to aſſiſt in ſupporting the dignity of the family. All this they declared they were willing and ready to do; but requeſted that they might do it in the manner pointed out by the <hi>Great Paper;</hi> by applying to their reſpective wives for the keys of their money-boxes, and furniſhing him from thence: but earneſtly prayed that they might not be ſubjected to the caprice and tyranny of an avaricious mother-in-law, whom they had never choſen, and of a ſteward, who was their declared enemy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:024407_0082_0FC70C1D1DD6C370"/>SOME of theſe letters were intercepted by the ſteward; others indeed were delivered to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman: but he was perſuaded not only to treat them with contempt, but to inſiſt the more ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly on the right his wife claimed to mark the knives and forks, plates and porringers, of the new ſettlers.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the people of the new farm heard of the ill ſucceſs of their letters, and underſtood how matters were conducted in their father's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, they were exceedingly alarmed and diſtreſſed. They conſulted together on the ſituation of affairs, and determined that they would no longer ſubmit to the arbitrary impoſitions of their mother-in-law, and of their enemy the ſteward; that they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the new decree as a direct violation of the <hi>Great Paper;</hi> and would not pay obedience to it, but would ſup their broth and eat their pudding as uſual, without having their ſpoons, knives and forks, plates or porringers, marked by the new officers.</p>
                     <p>THE old nobleman and his wife, finding that the new decree could not be eſtabliſhed without actual force, and fearing the conſequences of an open conteſt, thought fit to annul the offenſive
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024407_0083_0FC70C1EAC2BE838"/>
edict, under the pretence of <hi>mere expediency;</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Declaratory Act.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring and proteſting, at the ſame time, that he and his wife had an undoubted right to mark all the furniture of the new ſettlers, if they pleaſed, from the ſilver tankard in the cloſet to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-pot under the bed: that, with reſpect to them, he was not bound by the ſhackles of the <hi>Great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi> and in a word, that he and wife had, and ought to have, an uncontroled power over them, their lives, liberties, and property.</p>
                     <p>THE people, however, took little notice of theſe pompous declarations. They were glad that the marking decree was annulled; and were in hopes that by degrees things would ſettle in their former courſe, and mutual affection be again reſtored.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                     <p>IN the mean time the new ſettlers encreaſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, their dealings at their father's ſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came proportionably enlarged, and their partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for their brethren of the old farm was ſincere and manifeſt. They ſuffered, indeed, ſome in conveniences from the <hi>protectors</hi> which had been ſtationed amongſt them, who became very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024407_0084_0FC70C210721DDE0"/>
in their houſes. They introduced riot and intemperance into their families, debauched their daughters, and derided the orders they had made for their own good government. Moreover, the old nobleman had, at different times, ſent over to them a great number of thieves, murderers, and robbers, who did much miſchief by practiſing thoſe crimes for which they had been baniſhed from the old farm. But they bore thoſe evils with as much patience as could be expected; not chuſing to trouble their old father with complaints, unleſs in caſes of important neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>NOW the ſteward began to hate the new ſettlers with exceeding great hatred, and determined to renew his attack upon their peace and happineſs. He artfully inſinuated to the nobleman and his fooliſh wife, that it was very mean, and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their greatneſs, to receive the contributions of the people of the new farm through the conſent of their reſpective wives: that upon this footing they might ſome time or other refuſe to comply with his requiſitions, if they ſhould take into their heads to think them oppreſſive and unreaſonable; and that it was high time they ſhould be compelled to acknowledge his unlimited power and his wife's <hi>omnipotence,</hi> which, if not enforced now, they would ſoon be able to reſiſt, as they were daily encreaſing in numbers and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:024407_0085_0FC70C2A528DBD98"/>ANOTHER decree was, therefore, prepared and publiſhed, directing that the people of the new farm ſhould pay a certain ſtipend upon particular goods,<note n="*" place="bottom">Painter's colours, glaſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> which they were not allowed to purchaſe any where but at their father's ſhop; ſpecifying that this impoſition ſhould not be laid as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance upon the original price of theſe goods, but ſhould be paid as a tax on their arrival in the new farm; for the expreſs purpoſe of ſupporting the dignity of the nobleman's family, and for re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing the expences he pretended to have been at on their account.</p>
                     <p>THIS new decree occaſioned great uneaſineſs. The people ſaw plainly that the ſteward and their mother-in-law were determined to enſlave and ruin them. They again conſulted together, and wrote, as before, the moſt dutiful and perſuaſive letters to their father—but to no purpoſe—a deaf ear was turned againſt all their remonſtrances, and their humble requeſts rejected with contempt.</p>
                     <p>FINDING that this moderate and decent conduct brought them no relief, they had recourſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expedient: they bound themſelves to each other in a ſolemn engagement,<note n="†" place="bottom">Non-importation agreement.</note> not to deal any
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024407_0086_0FC70C2B6E2CA208"/>
more at their father's ſhop, until this unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional decree ſhould be repealed, which they one and all declared to be a direct violation of the <hi>Great Paper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS agreement was ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that in a few months the clerks and apprentices in the old gentleman's ſhop began to raiſe a terrible outcry. They declared, that their maſter's trade was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining exceedingly, and that his wife and ſteward would by their miſchievous machinations ruin the whole farm. They ſharpened their pens, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the ſteward, and even the old lady herſelf, with great ſeverity: inſomuch, that it was thought proper to withdraw this attempt alſo, upon the rights and liberties of the new ſettlers. One part only of the decree was left ſtill in force, viz. the tax upon <hi>water-gruel.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Tea.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>NOW there were certain men <note n="†" place="bottom">The India company.</note> in the old farm, who had obtained an excluſive right of ſelling <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gruel.</hi> Vaſt quantities of this gruel were vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the new ſettlers, as they were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of it, and uſed it univerſally in their families. They did not, however, trouble themſelves much about the tax on <hi>water-gruel;</hi> they were well
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024407_0087_0FC70C2CDDB8E6E8"/>
pleaſed with the repeal of the other parts of the decree, and fond as they were of this gruel, they conſidered it as not abſolutely neceſſary to the comfort of life, and determined to give up the uſe of it in their families, and ſo avoid the effects of that part of the decree.</p>
                     <p>THE ſteward found his deſigns again fruſtrated: but was not diſcouraged by the diſappointment. He deviſed another ſcheme, ſo artfully contrived, that he thought himſelf ſure of ſucceſs. He ſent for the perſons who had the ſole right of vending <hi>water-gruel;</hi> and after reminding them of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations they were under to the nobleman and his wife for the excluſive privilege they enjoyed, he requeſted that they would ſend ſundry waggons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with gruel to the new farm; promiſing that the accuſtomed duty which they paid for their excluſive right ſhould be taken off from all the gruel they ſhould ſo ſend amongſt the new ſettlers; and that in caſe their cargoes ſhould come to any damage, the loſs ſhould be made good to them out of his maſter's coffers.</p>
                     <p>THE gruel-merchants readily conſented to this propoſal; conſidering that if their cargoes were ſold, their profits would be very great; and if they failed, the ſteward was to pay the damage.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:024407_0088_0FC70C2E6FCEE058"/>
On the other hand, the ſteward hoped that the new ſettlers would not be able to reſiſt a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus thrown in their way, of purchaſing their favourite gruel, to which they had been ſo long accuſtomed; and if they did uſe it, ſubject to the tax aforeſaid, he would conſider this as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acknowledgement that the nobleman and his wife had a right to lay upon them what impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they pleaſed, and as a reſignation of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the <hi>Great Paper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT the new ſettlers were well aware of this decoy. They ſaw plainly that the gruel was not ſent for their accommodation; and that if they ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ered any part of it to be ſold amongſt them, ſubject to the tax impoſed by the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it would be conſidered as a willing ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the aſſumed omnipotence of their mother-in-law, and a precedent for future unlimited impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Some, therefore, would not permit the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons to be unladen at all; but ſent them back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched to the gruel-merchants; and others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to unload, but would not touch the dangerous commodity; ſo that it lay neglected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the roads and high-ways till it was quite ſpoiled. But one of the new ſettlers, whoſe name was JACK, either from a keener ſenſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries intended, or from the neceſſity of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:024407_0089_0FC70C34AD6BD690"/>
which was ſuch that he could not ſend back the gruel, becauſe of a number of mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note n="*" place="bottom">Board of Commiſſioners.</note> whom his father had ſtationed in his houſe to be a watch over him—he, I ſay, being almoſt driven to deſpair, ſtove <note n="†" place="bottom">Deſtruction of the tea at Boſton.</note> to pieces the caſks of gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el which had been ſent him, and utterly deſtroyed the whole cargo.</p>

                     <p>THESE violent proceedings were ſoon known at the old farm. Great was the uproar there. The old nobleman fell into a furious paſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the new ſettlers meant to throw off all dependence upon him, and rebel againſt his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. His wife alſo tore the padlocks from her lips, and raved and ſtormed like a Billingſgate, and the ſteward loſt all patience and moderation—ſwearing moſt profanely, <hi>that he would leave no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, till he had humbled the ſettlers of the new farm at his feet, and cauſed their father to tread upon their necks.</hi> Moreover, the gruel-merchants roared and bellowed for the loſs of their gruel; and the clerks and apprentices were in the utmoſt conſternation leſt the people of the new farm ſhould again agree to have no dealings with their father's ſhop.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:024407_0090_0FC70C375EEF9DE0"/>VENGEANCE was forthwith prepared, eſpecially againſt <hi>Jack.</hi> With him they determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; hoping that by making a ſevere example of him, they ſhould ſo terrify the other families, that they would all ſubmit to the power of the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and acknowledge the omnipotence of the <hi>great Madam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A very large padlock <note n="*" place="bottom">The Boſton Port-bill.</note> was ſent over to be faſtened on <hi>Jack's</hi> great gate; the key of which was given to the old nobleman, who was not to ſuffer it to be opened until <hi>Jack</hi> had paid for the gruel he had ſpilt, and reſigned all claim to the privileges of the <hi>Great Paper</hi>—nor even then, unleſs he ſhould think fit. Secondly, A decree was made to new model the regulations and oeconomy of <hi>Jack's</hi> family, in ſuch manner that they might in future be more ſubjected to the will of the ſteward. And, thirdly, A large gallows was erected before the manſion-houſe in the old farm, that if any of Jack's children ſhould be ſuſpected of miſbehaviour, they ſhould not be convicted or acquitted by the voice of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, according to the purport of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> but he tied neck and heels, and ſent over to be hanged on this gallows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:024407_0091_0FC70C38DE476760"/>ON hearing of theſe ſeverities, the people were highly enraged. They were at a loſs how to act, or by what means they ſhould avoid the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened vengeance. But the old lady and the ſteward perſiſted. The great padlock was faſtened on <hi>Jack's</hi> gate, and the key given to the nobleman as had been determined on; without waiting to know whether <hi>Jack</hi> would pay for the gruel, or allowing him an opportunity to make any apology or defence.</p>
                     <p>POOR <hi>Jack</hi> was now in a deplorable condition indeed: The great inlet to his farm was entirely ſhut up; ſo that he could neither carry out the produce of his land for ſale, nor receive from abroad the neceſſaries for his family.</p>
                     <p>BUT this was not all—The old nobleman, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the padlock aforeſaid, had ſent an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer <note n="*" place="bottom">General Gage, made Governor of the province.</note> to hector and domineer over <hi>Jack</hi> and his family, and to endeavour to break his ſpirits by every poſſible ſeverity; for which purpoſe, this overſeer was attended by a great number of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, and armed with more than common au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="unknown:024407_0092_0FC70C42FB09DC70"/>WHEN the overſeer firſt arrived in <hi>Jack's</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he was received with great reſpect, becauſe he was the delegate of their aged father. For, notwithſtanding all that had paſt, the people of the new farm loved and revered the old nobleman with true filial affection: and attributed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs entirely to the intrigues of the ſteward.</p>
                     <p>BUT this fair weather did not laſt long. The new overſeer took the firſt opportunity to ſhow that he had no intention of living in harmony and friendſhip with the family—Some of <hi>Jack's</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics had put on their Sunday clothes, and waited on the overſeer in the great parlour, to pay him their compliments on his arrival <note n="*" place="bottom">Addreſs to General Gage.</note>; and to requeſt his aſſiſtance in reconciling their father to them, and reſtoring peace and cordiality between the old and new farms. But he, in a moſt abrupt and rude manner, ſtopped them ſhort in the midſt of their addreſs; called them a parcel of diſobedient ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels; bid them go about their buſineſs; and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round on his heel, left the room with an air of contempt and diſdain.</p>

                     <p>THE people of the new farm ſeeing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of their ſituation, had appointed a grand committee, conſiſting of ſome of the moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able characters from each family, to manage their affairs in this difficult criſis. <hi>Jack,</hi> thus oppreſſed and inſulted, requeſted the advice <note n="*" place="bottom">Boſton conſults the congreſs of the ſtates.</note> of the grand committee as to his conduct. This committee in their anſwer, ſympathized cordially with him in his afflictions—they exhorted him to bear his ſuffering with fortitude for a time; aſſuring him, that they looked upon the inſults and puniſhments inflicted on him with the ſame indignation as if they had been inflicted on themſelves; and promiſed to ſtand by and ſupport him to the laſt—They recommended it to him to be firm and ſteady in the cauſe of liberty and their juſt rights, and never to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>omnipotence</hi> of their mother-in-law, nor ſubmit to the machinations of their enemy the ſteward.</p>
                     <p>IN the mean time, leſt <hi>Jack's</hi> family ſhould ſuffer for want of neceſſaries, his great gate being faſt locked, contributions were raiſed for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

                  <p>BUT in proceſs of time, there ſhall ariſe a <hi>North</hi> wind, and ſhall blaſt the tree, ſo that it ſhall no longer yield its fruit, or afford ſhelter to the

people, but it ſhall become rotten at the heart; and the <hi>North</hi> wind will break the branches thereof, and they ſhall fall upon the heads of the people, and wound many.</p>
                  <p>THEN a prophet <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. F—n.</note> ſhall ariſe from amongſt this people, and he ſhall exhort them, and inſtruct them in all manner of wiſdom, and many ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; and he ſhall wear ſpectacles upon his noſe; and reverence and eſteem ſhall reſt upon his brow. And he will cry aloud, and ſay—Seeing that this tree hath no ſtrength in it, and that it can no longer ſhelter us from the winds of the <hi>North,</hi> but is become rotten in the heart; behold now, let us cut it down and remove it from us: And in its place we will plant another tree, young and vigorous; and we will water it, and it ſhall grow, and ſpread its branches abroad. And moreover, we will build an high wall to defend it from the winds of the <hi>North</hi>: that it may be well with us, and our children, and our children's children.</p>
                  <p>AND the people ſhall hearken to the voice of their prophet, for his ſayings ſhall be good in their eyes. And they ſhall take up every man his ſpade and his ax, and ſhall prepare to dig up and cut

away the ſhattered remains of the blaſted and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tree, according to the words of their prophet.</p>

And he ſhall harangue with great vehemence, and ſhall tell them that a rotten tree is better than a ſound one; and that it is for the benefit of the people that the <hi>North</hi> wind ſhould blow upon it, and that the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thereof ſhould be broken and fall upon and cruſh them.</p>
                  <p>AND he ſhall receive from the king of the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, fetters of gold and chains of ſilver; and he ſhall have hopes of great reward if he will faſten them on the necks of the people, and chain them to the trunk of the rotten tree. And this he ſhall ſtrive to do by every inſinuating art in his power. And ſhall tell the people, that they are not fetters and chains, but ſhall be as bracelets of gold on their wriſts, and rings of ſilver on their necks, to orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and decorate them and their children. And his words ſhall be ſweet in the mouth, but very bitter in the belly.</p>
                  <p>

And he ſhall ſtand upon <hi>Mount-ſeir,</hi> and ſhall pun upon Mount-ſeir in the face of all the people. And all the people ſhall laugh him to ſcorn.</p>
                  <p>AND it ſhall come to paſs that certain other wiſe men ſhall alſo ſtand up and oppoſe themſelves to <hi>Cato</hi>; and ſhall warn the people not to truſt in the allurements of his voice, nor be terrified with his threats, and to hearken to his puns no more. And they ſhall encourage the people to go on with the work they had taken in hand, according to the words of their prophet. And they ſhall earneſtly exhort the people to deſpiſe and reject the fetters of gold and the chains of ſilver, which the king of the iſlands would faſten upon them.</p>
                  <p>AND one of theſe wiſe men ſhall call himſelf CASSANDRA, and the other ſhall call himſelf THE FORESTER: and they ſhall fall upon <hi>Cato,</hi> and

ſhall ſtrip him of every diſguiſe, and ſhew him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked before all the people.

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, <hi>Cato</hi> ſhall not repent, but ſhall harden his heart, and become very ſtubborn, and ſhall be vexed till he die. And when he ſhall be dead, his funeral oration ſhall be pronounced. And the heads of the people ſhall order that his funeral oration be printed; that all men may know of his death. Howbeit, in thoſe days, it ſhall not be cuſtomary for the heads of the people to deſire that funeral orations ſhould be printed; yet that all men may know of <hi>Cato's</hi> death, and that the people may be delivered from the fear of the raw-head and bloody-bones of <hi>France,</hi> and the wild bull of <hi>Spain,</hi> his funeral oration ſhall be printed.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR COUNT,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE now been ſix months in England, and eight weeks in this metropolis. You ſhould have heard from me before; but my frequent avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as the want of a ſuitable opportunity, have prevented. Agreeably to my promiſe, however, I now ſit down to give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the character and politics of this ſtrange people. So copious a ſubject cannot be diſcuſſed in one letter; but you ſhall hear from me again, when further obſervation ſhall have enabled me to be more particular.</p>
                  <p>THE general character of the Engliſh is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt fantaſtic and abſurd that ever fell to the lot of any known nation. As they are made up of contradictions, it would be unjuſt to give them any uniform deſignation. There is ſcarce a
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024407_0103_0FC70898E57C6B98"/>
virtue that adorns the mind, or a vice that diſgraces human nature, but may be aſcribed to them as part of their national character. But the former are often rendered ineffectual by miſapplication, and the latter qualified by a levity of manners, which ſhews them not to be conſtitutionally preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. An Engliſhman will treat his enemy with great generoſity, and his friend with ingratitude and inhumanity. He will be laviſh of his wealth when he has but little of it, and become a miſerly wretch when fortune pours her favours into his purſe. He will brave th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſt hardſhips, and encounter the ſevereſt trials with heroic fortitude; and will drown or hang himſelf becauſe the wind is in the eaſt. He will lend large ſums to a ſtranger on the ſlighteſt ſecurity, and refuſe his neareſt relation the means of ſubſiſtence. To-day, his heart expands with ſocial benevolence; to-morrow, he is cold, ſullen and moroſe—To-day, he poſſeſſes the wealth of a nabob; to-morrow, he refuſes a ſix-pence to a beggar, leſt he ſhould himſelf be reduced to the want of that ſix-pence. In a word, contradiction and abſurdity make an Engliſhman.</p>
                  <p>DURING the laſt century, this people hath riſen in wealth, power, and proſperity; but the inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their temper will not permit them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with content any bleſſing in poſſeſſion—At
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024407_0104_0FC708A889280E20"/>
peace with all the world—feared and reſpected by their neighbours—an eſtabliſhed policy, reformed religion, and extenſive commerce, are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſufficient, one would ſuppoſe, to render any people happy. But the thirſt of lawleſs ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition can never be ſatisfied. The Engliſh aſſume to themſelves the character of being the moſt juſt, generous, and humane nation in the world, and yet they encourage the <hi>African trade</hi>—a trade attended with circumſtances of injuſtice, cruelty, and horror, that diſgrace human nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they faſten for life, the chains of ſervitude the moſt abject, and miſery the moſt complete, on many hundreds of their fellow creatures every year.</p>
                  <p>THIS juſt and humane nation alſo ſent one <hi>Clive</hi> to the Eaſt Indies, to ſecure a dominion for them there. A country which, it ſhould ſeem, the Creator never intended for the Engliſh, becauſe he had placed it on the oppoſite ſide of the globe, and made the inhabitants of a quite different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. This <hi>Clive,</hi> however, arrived with his forces in the Eaſt Indies, and under the ſanction of his moſt <hi>gracious</hi> Britannic majeſty and <hi>a free</hi> parliament, put to death ſome hundred thouſands of the inoffenſive inhabitants, by the ſword, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the moſt attrocious cruelties—After
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024407_0105_0FC708A9AED43860"/>
which he retured to England with immenſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and a wife ſet in diamonds, and was made a <hi>Lord</hi>—and then cut his throat with a penknife.</p>
                  <p>YOU will be ſurpriſed at this; but the people here were not ſurpriſed at all. It is no uncommon thing to ſpend an evening with a man, in all the eaſy gaiety of ſocial life, and to hear next morning that he hanged himſelf in a ſtable, or practiſed phlebotomy on his own jugular vein with a razor.</p>
                  <p>THE Engliſh now govern in the Eaſt Indies with a tyranny ſo pure, ſo unadulterated with any mixture of juſtice or humanity, as could not have been exceeded in the reigns of the twelve Caeſars.</p>
                  <p>THIS beſt of all kings has now turned his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to AMERICA. There he had three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſubjects, who loved, honored, and obeyed him. He governed them by officers of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: he had the whole regulation of their commerce; and the over-flowings of their wealth were conducted, by eaſy channels, into his coffers, and into the purſes of the merchants and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers of his kingdom. But he has quarrelled with theſe loyal and beneficial ſubjects, becauſe they
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024407_0106_0FC708AB45C0ABE8"/>
are ſo obſtinate that they will not acknowledge that <hi>two and two make five.</hi> Whole volumes have been written on this ſubject, and all the force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and eloquence exerted to convince this wiſe king that he is in an error. The Americans have moſt emphatically beſeeched him to accept of the undiſſembled loyalty of their hearts; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that they are ſatisfied that the fruits of their induſtry ſhould center with him and his people, as heretofore, to enrich and aggrandiſe them; but humbly pray that they may not be compelled to acknowledge that <hi>two and two make five,</hi> which would be to them a moſt dangerous and diſtreſſing violation of truth. But this wiſe and humane monarch is far from being diſpoſed to give up the point. He has rejected their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions with ſcorn, and ſpurned at their offers of affection and fidelity; and declares, that he will even riſk the crown of his anceſtors, but he will make the obſtinate Americans ſubſcribe to his new dogma.</p>
                  <p>TO this end he hath ſent over, not only his own fleets and armies, but has hired a banditti of foreign mercenaries from a petty prince, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the ſplendor of his court by ſelling the blood of his ſubjects; and he has alſo employed negroes and wild Indians to perſecute the poor Americans
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:024407_0107_0FC708B9A8BC0E08"/>
without mercy, until they ſhall acknowledge that <hi>two and two make five.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AMERICA is at this time a ſcene of deſolation and diſtreſs; a theatre whereon is acted a real tragedy, exhibiting every ſpecies of cruelty and injuſtice. The royal army of this moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened of all nations are raviſhing the women, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the men, and laying waſte that fertile and beautiful country, under the conduct of Lord and General <hi>Howe;</hi> who are executing their bloody mandate, with all the compoſure in the world. His moſt gracious majeſty receives, from time to time, ſuch accounts of their proceedings as they pleaſe to give him, and is as happy as ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch can be.</p>
                  <p>WHO would have thought that the peaceful plains of America would be deſolated becauſe the inhabitants will not believe that <hi>two and two make five,</hi> when their good king and his wiſe parliament require them ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>ON the contrary, the Americans, highly reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this treatment, have declared, that they will no longer be penſioners of the ſmiles of ſuch a king, or ſubmit to a government in which they have no ſhare, and over which they have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:024407_0108_0FC708BAEDDD93C0"/>
and which is therefore, with reſpect to them, a government of mere will and pleaſure. They have determined to be henceforth a <hi>free</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and have publicly avowed that they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oy the ineſtimable, privileges of believing, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>two and two make only four,</hi> according to the common ſenſe of mankind.</p>
                  <p>HOW this affair will terminate, God only knows: but it ſeems very probable, that the king of England will loſe the moſt valuable jewel of his crown, in the purſuit of his preſent views.</p>
                  <p>YOU will ſay, perhaps, that the king could not act ſo abſurdly were he not countenanced and ſupported in his folly by the aſſent of his people. But the truth is that the king, by means of his miniſters hath gained ſuch an aſcendency over the parliament, which is the conſtitutional voice of the people, that he can obtain their ſanction for any project in which their rights are not openly and directly attacked. As to the people at large, they do not trouble themſelves about the right or wrong of the matter in conteſt. America is a great way off, and they have no feelings for what is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there. They grumble, indeed, about the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of their trade in conſequence of this war, but leave the diſcuſſion of national politics to their
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024407_0109_0FC708BC82561D30"/>
parliament. The crown hath imperceptibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended its prerogative ſo as to deſtroy the boaſted balance of the Britiſh conſtitution; and if the king's power ſhould be further ſtrengthened by the ſubjugation of America, the people of England may bid adieu to their conſtitutional freedom. Some of the wiſeſt amongſt them ſee this, and have openly declared, that the ſalvation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land depends upon the ſucceſs of the Americans in the preſent war.</p>
                  <p>THIS infatuated people have wearied the world, for theſe hundred years with loud eulogiums liberty and their conſtitution; and yet they ſee that conſtitution languiſhing in a deep decay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any efforts for its recovery. Amuſed with trifles, and accuſtomed to venality and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, they are not alarmed at the conſequences of their ſupineneſs. They love to talk of their glorious conſtitution, becauſe the idea is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and they are ſatisfied with the idea, and they honour their king, becauſe it is the faſhion to honour the king. Half the loyalty of the nation is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by two popular ſongs. viz. "<hi>Britons ſtrike home; and God ſave the king.</hi> Theſe are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferated at taverns, over porter, punch and wine, till the imagination is heated, and the blood in a ferment, and then theſe pot-valiant patriots ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:024407_0110_0FC708C92B03B800"/>
forth and commit all manner of riot and exceſs in honour of their king and country.</p>
                  <p>THERE are fanatics in politics as well as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and both are managed in the ſame way, viz. by keeping up the deluſion in which they delight The men in power well know the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the multitude, and when they obſerve them to grow uneaſy under the too barefaced en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of prerogative, they get half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of court ſcribblers to expatiate on the glories of the Britiſh conſtitution, and to ſing the ſweet Lullaby of Liberty to the people—and all is well. Juſt ſo a nurſe rattles three pieces of tin in a little ruſh baſket to amuſe her crying child. The poor infant thinks it has the world in poſſeſſion, and is ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>THE extreme ignorance of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this civilized country can ſcarce be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited. In general they know nothing beyond the particular branch of buſineſs which their parents or the pariſh happened to chuſe for them. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they practiſe with unremitting diligence; but never think of extending their knowledge farther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:024407_0111_0FC708CD254584E8"/>A manufacturer has been brought up a maker of pin-heads: He has been at this buſineſs forty years, and of courſe makes pin-heads with great dexterity; but he cannot make a whole pin for his life. He thinks it is the perfection of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature to make pin-heads. He leaves other matters to inferior abilities. It is enough for him, that he believes in the <hi>Athanaſian Creed,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences the ſplendor of the court, and makes pin-heads. This he conceives to be the ſum-total of religion, politics, and trade. He is ſure that London is the fineſt city in the world; black-friars bridge the moſt ſuperb of all poſſible brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and the river Thames, the largeſt river in univerſe. It is in vain to tell him that there are many rivers in America, in compariſon of which the Thames is but a ditch; that there are ſingle provinces there larger than all England; and that the colonies, formerly belonging to Great-Britain, now <hi>independant ſtates,</hi> are vaſtly more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, taken all together—He cannot conceive this. He goes into his beſt parlour, and looks on a map of England, four feet ſquare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the other ſide of the room he ſees a map of <hi>North</hi> and South America, not more than two feet ſquare, and exclaims— How can theſe things be!—It is altogether impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! He has read the Arabian Nights Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024407_0112_0FC708D85FCEBEF8"/>
and he hears this wonderful account of America—he believes the one as much as the other—That a giant ſhould riſe out of the ſea, or that the Delaware ſhould be larger than the Thames, are equally incredible to him. Talk to him of the Britiſh conſtitution, he will tell you it is a glorious conſtitution—Aſk him what it is, and he is ignorant of its firſt principles; but he is ſure that he can make and ſell pin-heads under it. Mention the freedom of elections, and he will tell that he does not meddle in theſe matters; that he lives in a borough; and that it is impoſſible but that ſquire <hi>Gooſe-Cap</hi> muſt repreſent that borough in parliament—becauſe Squire <hi>Gooſe-Cap</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the prime miniſter, and his Lady comes every Sunday to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He believes in the Athanaſian Creed, honours the king, and makes pin-heads—and what more can be expected of man.</p>
                  <p>IT is not ſo in <hi>America.</hi> The loweſt tradeſman there is not without ſome degree of general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. They turn their hands to every thing; their ſituation obliges theim to do ſo. A farmer there cannot run to an artiſt upon every trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—He muſt make and mend and contrive for

himſelf. This, I obſerved in my travels through that country. In many towns, and in every city, they have public libraries. Not a tradeſman but will find time to read. He acquires knowledge imperceptibly. He is amuſed with voyages and travels, and becomes acquainted with the geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, cuſtoms, and commerce of other countries. He reads political diſquiſitions, and learns the great out-lines of his rights as a man and as a citizen— He dips a little into philoſophy, and knows that the apparent motion of the ſun is occaſioned by the real motion of the earth—In a word, he is ſure that, notwithſtanding the determination of king, lords, and commons to the contrary, <hi>two and two</hi> can <hi>never make five.</hi>

                  <p>SUCH are the people of England, and ſuch the people of America. Theſe nations are now at daggers drawn. At firſt, the Americans knew little or nothing of the art of war, but they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove daily. The Britiſh troops are teaching them how to conquer; and they find them very apt ſcholars. The probable conſequence is, that England will loſe, and America gain, an empire. If <hi>George the Third</hi> ſhould ſubjugate America on his preſent principles, all good men will abhor him as a tyrant; if he ſhould fail in his project, all wiſe men will deſpiſe him for riſking the immenſe

                  <head>A POLITICAL CATECHISM: Written in 1777.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſtion.</hi> WHAT is WAR?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The curſe of mankind; the mother of famine and peſtilence; the ſource of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated miſeries; and the undiſtinguiſhing deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the human ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How is war divided?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Into <hi>offenſive</hi> and <hi>defenſive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the general object of an offenſive war?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Sometimes it is to regain by the ſword what had been unjuſtly taken from the rightful poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor: Sometimes to prevent impending dangers, which cannot be avoided by other means: But, for the moſt part, it is undertaken to gratify the ambition of a prince, who wiſhes to ſubject to his arbitrary will a people whom God created free,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024407_0116_0FC708E4ECDD88E0"/>
and to gain an uncontrolled dominion over their rights and property.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Are there any inſtances of ſuch princes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, many. Hiſtory is filled with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives and miſerable deaths of tyrants. The preſent king of Great Britain, whoſe hiſtory is not yet completed, is a living example of ſuch a prince. He carried an offenſive war into the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and deprived many thouſands of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people of their lives and property: and he is now carrying on an offenſive war in <hi>America,</hi> without one ſpecious plea of juſtice for ſo doing: Moſt wickedly aiming at the abſolute diſpoſal of that extenſive country, and its numerous inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. For this purpoſe he has ſpread deſolation and death amongſt their friendly habitations, and proſecutes his wicked deſign with aggravated cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and horror.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What may juſtly be ſaid of ſuch a prince?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That he looks on his fellow-creatures as created only for his uſe, and makes their miſery his ſport. That the ſpirit of thouſands, who have fallen a ſacrifice to his ambition, flutter round the poliſhed points of his imperial crown, and cry to
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024407_0117_0FC708E668FC2830"/>
heaven for juſtice—that his throne reſts on the ſculls of the ſlain—that his unhallowed feaſts are defiled with blood—and that the curſes of widows and orphans are poured out againſt him at every riſing ſun.</p>
                  <p>THAT hiſtory will do juſtice to his memory, and record his crimes with his name, for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of poſterity—and that the blood he has wantonly ſpilt in unjuſt purſuits will moſt aſſuredly be required of his hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT is <hi>defenſive</hi> war?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> IT is to take up arms in oppoſition to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of uſurped power, and bravely ſuffer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hardſhips, and encounter preſent dangers, to ſecure the rights of humanity, and the bleſſings of freedom, to generations yet unborn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> IS even defenſive war juſtifiable in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious view?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> THE foundation of war is laid in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of mankind. Were all men juſt and good, there would be no cauſe of contention amongſt them; but as the caſe is far otherwiſe, war is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolutely neceſſary, as many other inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024407_0118_0FC708F16A0A8AF0"/>
are, which derive their origin from the weakneſs or wickedneſs of men. Even laws and government would be uſeleſs encumbrances were there no open violence or ſecret treachery to be guarded againſt. God has given man will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, power to execute, and freedom of will to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his conduct. It cannot be but that ſome, from a depravity of will, will abuſe theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and exert theſe powers to the injury of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and the oppreſſed would have no ſafety or redreſs but by exerting the ſame powers in their defence: and it is our duty to ſet a proper value upon, and defend to the utmoſt, our juſt rights, and the bleſſings of life: otherwiſe a few miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants would tyranniſe over the reſt of mankind, and make the paſſive multitude the ſlaves of their power. Thus it is that <hi>defenſive</hi> is not only juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, but an indiſpenſable duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> IS it upon theſe principles that the people of America are reſiſting the arms of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and oppoſing force with force?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> STRICTLY ſo—The Americans had nothing in view but to live peaceably and dutifully under a conſtitutional ſubjection to their acknowledged ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. They patiently ſubmitted to many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt encroachments of power. They were not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024407_0119_0FC708F61387FC18"/>
of every right. But at laſt the deſigns of Great-Britain became too manifeſt to be miſtaken: and the Americans were urged on to the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſity of chuſing one of two great evils; either to enliſt themſelves, and their unborn poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the unconditional ſlaves of a corrupt and wicked adminiſtration; or to brave the horrors of war, under every diſadvantage, in a noble ſtruggle for the rights of mankind. They have reſolutely determined on the latter; and after ſolemnly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to God and the world for the juſtice of their cauſe, are proſecuting the war with promiſing hopes of ſucceſs. Supported by the rectitude of their principles, they have ſurmounted the greateſt difficulties, and have exhibited inſtances of perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bravery and military conduct not exceeded by the heroes of antiquity—And may Heaven proſper their virtuous undertaking!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> BUT it has often been ſaid, that America is in a ſtate of rebellion. Tell me, therefore, what is REBELLION?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> IT is when a great number of people, headed by one or more factious leaders, aim at depoſing their lawful prince, without any juſt cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, in order to place another on his throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="unknown:024407_0120_0FC708F9EBB98EC8"/>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> IS this the caſe of the Americans?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> FAR otherwiſe.—They have repeatedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, with the moſt ſolemn proteſtations, that they were ready to ſupport, with their lives and fortunes, the preſent king of Great-Britain, on the throne of his anceſtors; and only requeſted, in return the enjoyment of thoſe rights, which the Britiſh conſtitution confirms to all his ſubjects; and without which, the boaſted freedom of that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is but a ſolemn mockery and an empty name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> TO whom has the king of England commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the conduct of this war?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. TO Lord and General</hi> HOWE.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHO are theſe gentlemen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> THEY are the brothers of a <hi>Colonel</hi> HOWE, who fought bravely along with the Americans in a former war between the Engliſh and French, and fell in battle. The Americans loved and honoured this <hi>Colonel Howe:</hi> they lamented his fate, and at their own expence erected a monument to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in the town of Boſton. But theſe gentlemen, with unrelenting hearts, and ſacrilegious hands,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024407_0121_0FC708FDC0472AC0"/>
have defiled their brother's tomb with the blood of thoſe whoſe affection had raiſed it to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and have plunged their hoſtile ſwords into boſoms glowing with love and eſteem for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT progreſs have they made in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing America?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> VERY little.—They got poſſeſſion of the town of <hi>Boſton;</hi> but could not hold it. They were but tenants at will there, ſtrictly ſpeaking, for their landlords ejected them without any warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſtrained for rent upon certain military ſtores.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What did they next?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> THEY took <hi>Staten-Iſland,</hi> where there was nothing to oppoſe them, and a part of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and ſo <hi>ferried</hi> themſelves over to the city of <hi>New-York.</hi> From thence they crept into <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and taking advantage of a critical period, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican troops were diſbanded by the expiration of their enliſtments, and before a new army could be raiſed, they advanced to the banks of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware,</hi> well knowing that there was nothing to oppoſe their progreſs. On the banks of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="unknown:024407_0122_0FC709019B4F60F8"/>
they ſat themſelves down, and fell to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the adjacent country. In the mean time they publiſhed an enticing proclamation, offering pardon and protection to all thoſe who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, upon the eaſy terms of <hi>unconditional ſubmiſſion.</hi> But the Americans did not deſpair: they ſoon found a ſpirited militia to ſupply the place of their diſbanded troops until a new army could be raiſed. This militia, with a ſmall remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the regular troops, croſſed the <hi>Delaware</hi> at midnight, in a ſnow-ſtorm, and following their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant general through the moſt ſevere and inclement weather, unexpectedly attacked, and drove the enemy from their ſtation in the utmoſt confuſion, and made twelve hundred of their men priſoners of war, and then re-croſſed the river to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer encampment. The Britiſh then rallied, and returned to their poſt, knowing that a large rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement was on the way to their relief. But the American general, having a range of fires along the banks of the river to deceive the enemy, marched his army in the night, re-croſſed the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware,</hi> and by a circuitous rout, ſurpriſed, attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and defeated the enemy's expected reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The royal army is now lying in <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> mortified and creſt-fallen.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT are the ſtriking outlines of the king of England's character?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Injuſtice, obſtinacy,</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi> He is unjuſt, becauſe he endeavours to get by force what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him by the laws of the realm over which he preſides, and in direct violation of his coronation oath: he is <hi>obſtinate,</hi> becauſe he refuſes to hear the humble petitions of an oppreſſed people: and his <hi>folly</hi> is conſpicuous in quarrelling with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans who loved and honoured him—who were the faithful and zealous contributors to the ſupport of his crown and dignity, and a never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encreaſing ſource of wealth to him, and to the merchants and manufacturers of his country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHO has the chief command of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. HIS Excellency</hi> GENERAL WASHINGTON.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT is his character?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> TO him the title of <hi>Excellency</hi> is applied with peculiar propriety. He is the beſt and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man the world ever knew. In private life, he wins the hearts and wears the love of all who are ſo happy as to fall within the circle of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024407_0124_0FC70911478BCEF8"/>
In his public character, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands univerſal reſpect and admiration. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the principles on which he acts are indeed founded in virtue and truth, he ſteadily purſues the arduous work with a mind neither depreſſed by diſappointment and difficulties, nor elated with temporary ſucceſs. He retreats like a General, and attacks like a Hero. Had he lived in the days of idolatry, he had been worſhipped as a God. One age cannot do juſtice to his merit; but a grateful poſterity ſhall, for a ſucceſſion of ages, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the great deliverer of his country.</p>

                  <head>A LETTER TO LORD HOWE.
<date>[December 1776.]</date>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHATEVER errors the court of Great Britain might have fallen into in the commencement of the preſent unhappy conteſt with America, it was at leaſt a politic ſtep to commit the conduct of this important affair to your Lordſhip, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral your brother.</p>
                  <p>THE name of <hi>Howe</hi> is dear to America; and amongſt the many diſtreſſing difficulties we have to encounter, it is no inconſiderable one to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the predilection we feel for your family. The exalted virtues of your heroic brother <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Colonel Lord' Howe,</hi> was in Gen. Abercombie's army at the battle of Ticonderoga, and was there killed by a random ſhot. The town of Boſton erected a Monument to his memory.</note>, whoſe bones are embraced by that ſoil you are now drenching with blood, often riſe in painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="unknown:024407_0126_0FC7091B9AAEFE60"/>WE are ready to acknowledge the good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that diſtinguiſh your private character, and whilſt we feel the ſmart of the wounds you inflict, wiſh they had been adminiſtered by another hand. We would fondly conſider you as the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of another's wrath—not your own: and forgive with as much ſincerity—pardon the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!—as the condemned wretch forgives the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed officer who is about to torture him into another ſtate of exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>THE idea we have of your Lordſhip's character compels us to ſuppoſe, that before you undertook this cruel taſk your conſcience was fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the inflexible rules of right and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the ſpirit of the Britiſh conſtitution, fully authoriſed the preſent war: and that the reſiſtance of America to the claims of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh legiſlature is, and ought to be, deemed <hi>rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Under ſuch a ſuppoſition, can we blame your Lordſhip for aſſerting and enforcing what you may believe to be the rights of your ſovereign.</p>
                  <p>LET the ſame candour be extended to the poor Americans. They think and are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that neither the rules of honour or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the ſpirit of the Britiſh conſtitution, or the rights of mankind, can authoriſe the views of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024407_0127_0FC7091C5FAB21C8"/>
in the proſecution of the preſent war: on the contrary they believe, that is an indiſpenſable duty, which they owe to themſelves and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born poſterity, to oppoſe to the utmoſt the troops you have brought into their country, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſubmiſſion to the yoke that is prepared for them. Ought they not then to be reſpected as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the beſt principles, however ill-founded you may ſuppoſe theſe principles to be? And ought you not at leaſt to pity, whilſt you think you juſtly puniſh?</p>
                  <p>THE preſent diſpute is, what the rights of the crown and parliament are with reſpect to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and what they are not—Great Britain would have us acknowledge her claims of unlimited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that too, without reaſoning on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—ſhe will not condeſcend to reaſon with us— ſhe will not receive our humble petitions, or even hear what we have to ſay in our own behalf—we muſt implicitly acknowledge her claims to be juſt. And when, my Lord, were acknowledgements of this kind ever forced upon mankind with ſucceſs? To own the ſupremacy of the Britiſh parliament over the lives and properties of the people of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, or own the ſupremacy of his holineſs over our immortal ſouls, are doctrines which can only be eſtabliſhed by the ſword and the faggot amongſt
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024407_0128_0FC709263280C1B8"/>
men who have the free uſe of their reaſon. But I am, perhaps, going too far—I mean not to offend, nor would I be wanting in the reſpect due to your character and ſtation. Should my zeal on ſo intereſting a ſubject appear ſomewhat intemperate, I truſt your Lordſhip will make a proper allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet ſuffer me to ſhed a few tears over the mangled limbs of my bleeding country.</p>
                  <p>KNOW then, that devaſtation, inſult, murder, and ruin mark the way of your ſavage troops through this cultivated, hoſpitable, and once happy land. It is not enough that the manly youth, with a heart high-beating in his country's cauſe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth, and cut down in the field of battle, an early ſacrifice at the ſhine of Liberty; but the voice of the helpleſs virgin cries aloud to Heaven againſt the brutal force of the ſalacious raviſher. Take a view of the country before you—villages in ruin, cities abandoned, and the miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants driven from their comfortable homes, and all the endearing ſweets of domeſtic felicity, to ſeek for ſhelter in this inclement ſeaſon— they know not where—leaving their property a prey to unpitying foreigners, who deſtroy, without remorſe, what they cannot immediately uſe or conveniently take away. This is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated picture, over-charged in the colouring
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024407_0129_0FC7092BEFA25218"/>
—facts have juſtified the drawing, and the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful occaſion prompts the ſtile.</p>
                  <p>SUCH is the nature of the commiſſion you have come to execute amongſt us. Cruel as it is, I would fain hope that you think you are only bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing the ſword of juſtice, not inflicting the rod of oppreſſion—but how you can think ſo, it is hard for an American to conceive.</p>
                  <p>THE unpardonable <hi>fault</hi> of America <hi>now</hi> is the declaration of <hi>Independence.</hi> When our faults were leſs they were as hardly thought of. Our modeſt complaints were called preſumption—our humble petitions diſmiſſed with contempt—no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient hand was held out—no friendly meaſures propoſed to ſooth the griefs we thought we ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prevent the horrors that now ſurround us —<hi>independence</hi> was not the wiſh of America, but a hard and cruel neceſſity has forced us to this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate determination—we truſt in the juſtice of our cauſe, and leave to the God of battles the great event.</p>
                  <p>IN the mean time, though you carry on your maſter's work, let not the lawleſs hand of rapine ſpread unneceſſary deſolation through our bleeding country—Arreſt the plunderer's greedy graſp,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024407_0130_0FC7092FC4E56330"/>
and ſuffer not the cries of the deſpoiled virgin to call to Heaven for vengeance on thoſe who regard not God, and trample on the ſacred rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Wrongs like theſe, tarniſh the luſtre of victory, and blaſt the laurels of the brave.</p>

                  <p>NOW that you have gained the ſummit of your ambitious hopes, the reward of your forfeited ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that dear bought gratification, to obtain which you have given your name to infamy, and your ſoul to perdition—now that you fit in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, the <hi>nominal</hi> governor of Pennſylvania, give me leave to addreſs a few words of truth to your corrupted heart. Retire for a moment from the avocations and honours of your new ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency, and review the ſteps by which you have mounted the ſtage of power—ſteps reeking with the blood of your innocent country.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the ſtorm was gathering dark and drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over this devoted country—when America ſtood in need of all the exertions which her beſt patriots and moſt confidential citizens could make, you ſtepped forward—you offered yourſelf a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, and with unwearied diligence ſolicited a
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024407_0132_0FC709322E922268"/>
ſeat in the American congreſs. Your ſeeming ſincerity, and your loud complaints againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt uſurpations of the Britiſh legiſlature, gained the confidence of your country. You were elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—you took your ſeat in congreſs—and let poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity remember, that while you were vehemently declaiming in that venerable ſenate againſt Britiſh tyranny, and with hypocritical zeal urging a noble ſtand in behalf of the liberties of your country, you were at the ſame time betraying their ſecrets, ridiculing their oeconomy, and making ſport of their conduct, in private letters to your friend go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ********.</p>
                  <p>BUT your abilities were not equal to your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. Your character became ſuſpected. You were left out of the delegation, and fearing the juſt reſentment of your injured country, you took refuge under the banners of General <hi>Howe.</hi> You well knew that profeſſions alone would not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to his notice: actual ſervices muſt be rendered to raiſe you above neglect, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of your new patron. The general knowing your conduct to have been ſuch as to render all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with your country impoſſible, and thinking that from your knowledge of the people he meant to ruin, you might be a uſeful tool in his hands, took you into his ſervice. You found it
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024407_0133_0FC70938562E7F50"/>
no hard taſk to come into his views; to baniſh every virtuous ſenſibility, and even ſteel your heart againſt the cries of ſuffering humanity, and wade through the blood of your fellow-citizens to your promiſed reward. Is there a curſe denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt villainy that hangs not over your head?—It was owing to your poiſonous influence that *—* took part againſt his country's cauſe, and involved his family in miſery and diſtreſs. Let their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſit heavy on your ſoul! It was owing to your ſeductions that a hopeful young man was cut off with infamy in the prime and vigour of life.—Let the blood of <hi>Moleſworth</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">He was detected in endeavouring to procure pilots to conduct the Britiſh fleet up the Delaware; was tried, convicted, and hanged.</note> ſit heavy on your ſoul! You attended the Britiſh army from the <hi>Head of Elk</hi> to the city of Philadelphia—you rode in the rear of that army in your triumphant carriage—you feaſted your eyes with ſcenes of deſolation—the cries of ruined families, and the curſes of the diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, compoſed the muſic of your march, and your horſes hoofs were wet with the blood of your ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered countrymen and former friends.—Is there a curſe denounced againſt villainy that hangs not over your head?—Let theſe things ſit heavy on your ſoul!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="unknown:024407_0134_0FC7093C1144C6C0"/>BUT you are now in the ſeat of power in the city of Philadelphia. The glow of gratified am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition burns on your cheek, whilſt like a baſhaw of the eaſt, you order this or that fellow-citizen to priſon and puniſhment. You ſit down daily to a board ſpread with more than plenty, and know, with unconcern, that numbers of your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, even ſome of your former acquaintance, are ſuffering all the lingering anguiſh of abſolute fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the jails of the city—within your reach— within your power to relieve. You well know that under the diſcipline of that arch-fiend, <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> they have plucked the weeds of the earth for food, and expired with the unchewed graſs in their mouths <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cunningham</hi> had deſerted from the Americans to the Britiſh, and was made keeper of the provoſt priſon. The ſtate-houſe in Philadelphia was made uſe of for this purpoſe; and the author was aſſured, by ſome who made their eſcape from thence, that they had ſeen bodies lying in the yard of priſoners, who had died of mere famine, with unchewed graſs hanging out of their mouths. Some of the citizens had one day ſent a bucket full of broth to the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the provoſt—the infernal <hi>Cunningham</hi> took it into the ſtate-houſe yard, and when the ſtarving wretches had gathered eagerly round, he kicked over the bucket with his foot, and then laughed to ſee them lie on their bellies and lap the ſlop from the ground, like dogs, with their tongues.</note>—yet you pity not the miſery to which you have yourſelf been inſtrumental, nor will you ſuffer their torture to touch your heart— Oh! let this too, ſit heavy on your ſoul!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:024407_0135_0FC7093D6509D3A8"/>THE time is at hand when the army on which you build your ſupport muſt withdraw, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their vain attempt, When this ſhall happen, then fly—fly to England, for you will not be ſafe here—your life and eſtate are both forfeited—and both will be but a poor atonement for the wrongs you have done.—Fly to England, and if you ſhould find yourſelf deſpiſed and neglected there, as will moſt probably be the caſe, for the Engliſh hate a traitor, even though they benefit by the treaſon— then fly thence, with the monſter <hi>Cunningham,</hi> to the barren deſert, and herd with hungry beaſts of prey.</p>
                  <p>THE temporary reward of iniquity you now hold will ſoon ſhrink from your graſp; and the favour of him on whom you now depend will ceaſe, when your capacity to render the neceſſary ſervices ſhall ceaſe. This you know, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection muſt even now throw a gloom of horror over your enjoyments, which the glittering tinſel of your new ſuperintendency cannot illumine.— Look back, and all is guilt—look forward, and all is dread.—When the hiſtory of the preſent times ſhall be recorded, the names of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham</hi> will not be omitted; and poſterity will wonder at the extreme obduracy of which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart is capable, and at the unmeaſurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between a traitor and a WASHINGTON.</p>

                     <p>I AM <hi>a Tory,</hi> the ſon of a Tory, born and bred in the pure principles of unconditional ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a true friend to the Hanoverian family— right or wrong and at all events. The king of England, is in my humble opinion, entitled, <hi>jure divino,</hi> to govern abſolutely, not only the Britiſh empire, but the Eaſt and Weſt Indies—not only the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, but the continent of North America—not only theſe, but even the whole of this paltry world.</p>
                     <p>BUT the infatuated people of this moſt vile portion of this moſt vile planet, have been moved by the inſtigation of the Devil to oppoſe the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of George III.—God bleſs his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty!—to govern them <hi>in all caſes whatever,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good will and pleaſure, For my own
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024407_0137_0FC709469FDEC0A0"/>
part, I truly abominate and abhor their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſtinacy. His Majeſty hath been pleaſed, in his great goodneſs, and to my unſpeakable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to ſend over his fleets and armies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and ſubdue this horrible country. Now, it is the indiſpenſable duty of all thoſe who would be called the friends of arbitrary government and of the ſaid George III. to render all the aſſiſtance in their power to the aforeſaid fleets and armies, and to the worthy Lords and Generals, whom this juſt and benign monarch hath commiſſioned to direct and manage them.</p>
                     <p>AMONGST the implements of war, the Pen and the printing Preſs are not the moſt inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. It is true, they can break no bones—can ſhed no blood—but they can inſtigate men to do both: and by their influence over the minds of the multitude, can, perhaps, do more towards gaining a point, or oppoſing a purpoſe, than the ſword or the bayonet. For this reaſon, I have anxiouſly deſired to ſee a printing preſs in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubſervient to the purpoſes of Lord and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe; and it is with great ſatisfaction I find they have at laſt got a printer to their mind— one perfectly diſpoſed to forward their humane deſigns. I was boaſting, in the fulneſs of my heart, of <hi>The Pennſylvania Ledger,</hi> printed by Mr
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:024407_0138_0FC7094D2B1D1818"/>
                        <hi>Humphreys,</hi> to a friend whom I ſuppoſed to be a tory like myſelf: but I had quite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken my man. He had the aſſurance to addreſs me on the ſubject in the following manner. I will give it nearly in his own words, that you may ſee what dangerous characters we have amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>IT has been the policy of every government, (ſaid he) from the beginning of time to this day, when the honour, ſafety, and exiſtence of that government depended on the fate of war, to uſe every poſſible means to forward and ſtrengthen the efforts of its citizens and friends, and to counteract the force and ſubtlety of its enemies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>FOR this end, even under the moſt popular conſtitutions, many of the ſacred rights of the people have been hard preſſed, and even ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that without endangering the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, provided ſuch extraordinary exertions of government be manifeſtly ſanctioned by the neceſſity of the caſe. The Britiſh king, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even the plea of neceſſity impreſſes men for ſupplying his navy in time of war; a practice not authoriſed by the conſtitution, and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024407_0139_0FC70956F4EAA568"/>
a high infringement of the perſonal rights of the ſubject.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>THE liberty of the preſs has ever been juſtly eſteemed as one of the moſt important popular privileges in a free government. It is indeed highly reaſonable that the channels of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be kept open and uncorrupted—and no man holds this right in more ſacred eſtimation than I do. But when this privilege is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed, and the preſs becomes an engine in the hands of an enemy for ſowing dangerous diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpreading falſe alarms, and undermining the defenſive operations of government in an hour of danger, ought not that government upon the undeniable principles of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſilence, by its own authority, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal enemy to its peace and ſafety?—I have now in view <hi>The Pennſylvania Ledger,</hi> a paper mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly in the intereſts of the enemy: whether we conſider the complexion of the paper itſelf, or the known political character of the editor. Why ſhould a dangerous lenity protect a man in the abuſe of that very lenity which is his only ſecurity, and on which he ſo ungratefully preſumes? or why ſhould he, under the ſanction of one right, be permitted to aim at the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the other rights of his country?
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:024407_0140_0FC7095864D49AA8"/>
Would not our council of ſafety be very juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ſilencing a preſs, whoſe weekly producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inſult the feelings of the people, and are ſo openly inimical to the American cauſe?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>DID you ever hear ſuch a fellow? For my part I was ſo ſhocked at his principles, that I left him abruptly, and am determined to have no more communication with him.</p>

                     <p>IT is not eaſy to conceive how much I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and diſappointed at the diſcourſe of my friend, as communicated to you in my laſt. There are indeed ſome whom we confide in with ſafety in theſe precarious times: and people ſhould be very cautious in opening their minds before perſons of a doubtful political character.</p>
                     <p>IT is a rule in our tory ſociety to be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in this particular—But I confeſs that, in this inſtance, I was not as prudent as I ſhould have been; and I have had the mortification of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprimanded for my indiſcretion before a full meeting.</p>
                     <p>YOU can hardly imagine what regularity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in our board of tories. We are all formed into committees of various denominations, and appointed to various duties. I have myſelf the honour to belong to <hi>the committee of wiles and ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems.</hi> It was I, Mr. Printer, who planned the ſcheme for ſtealing the mail ſent by General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:024407_0142_0FC709609C8B6F20"/>
to congreſs <note n="*" place="bottom">By this Mail (which was ſtole from off the expreſs horſe, whilſt he was refreſhing himſelf at Briſtol) Gen. Howe was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ſituation of the American army, and of the day on which moſt of the troops would be diſbanded by the expiration of their enliſtments. He accordingly came into Jerſey with his whole force at the critical time and drove Gen. Waſhington over the Delaware.</note>.—And my deſign was ſo ſucceſsfully executed, that whilſt the committee of congreſs were ſearching Briſtol for thoſe letters, they were then on their way to our friend <hi>General Howe;</hi> where they ſafely arrived, as we have been ſince informed. You may be ſure that I gained great applauſe for this manoeuvre.</p>
                     <p>WE have alſo a <hi>committee of falſe reports;</hi>— whoſe duty is to fabricate and publiſh ſuch articles of intelligence as may tend to alarm and terrify timid whigs, and diſtract the minds of the people. Theſe are circulated at ſuch times as the ſituation of public affairs may make them moſt probable. Sometimes they are thrown out in whiſpers, in ſo dark and ſecret a manner that their origin cannot be traced; and at other times openly, by means of the <hi>Pennſylvania Ledger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WE have, moreover a <hi>committee of true intelligence;</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to employ a number of ſpies, who are directed to mix amongſt the people in the aſſumed character of zealous whigs; to hire
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:024407_0143_0FC709621F1C6E88"/>
themſelves as ſervants and waiters in houſes and taverns frequented by members of congreſs. This committee holds a regular correſpondence with our friends in the Britiſh army; ſo that we are certainly informed of what paſſes on both ſides, from the beſt authority, and are thereby enabled to take all advantages. Happily for us, the ſeveral ferries and ſtages have as yet been left free and open, ſo that our meſſengers paſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs without examination, and of conſequence this department has been attended with little or no difficulty.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER committee is called the <hi>committee of lies:</hi> whoſe duty differs from that of <hi>falſe reports</hi> in this—the latter is to circulate miſrepreſentations of facts reſpecting the armies, and things of a public nature, on the large ſcale: whilſt the former only frame temporary lies for the uſe of this city: particularly reſpecting the deliberations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of congreſs. Theſe lies muſt be freſh and freſh every day; and always ſupported by a ſtrong aſſertion that the information came from ſome leaky member of congreſs; generally without mentioning the name of any individual member; yet, in caſes of urgency, the real name of ſome leading character may be adduced; when the lie
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:024407_0144_0FC7096C2C151090"/>
may have had its operation before it can be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</p>
                     <p>THERE is likewiſe a <hi>committee of extortion;</hi> theſe are wealthy men, who monopolize, as far as they can, the articles moſt wanted for the rebel army; buy up the neceſſaries of life, and put on them the higheſt prices they can with any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of propriety, in order to make the people diſcontented and uneaſy.</p>
                     <p>THE laſt committee I ſhall mention is <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of depreciation—as important as any</hi>—they are to take all poſſible pains, and to exerciſe every ſubtile art to run down and depreciate the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental currency. This committee is very large, and compoſed chiefly of brokers and monied men. They get ſome of this money, and run with it to diſcharge any debts they may have contracted, with a ſeeming anxiety to get rid of it as faſt as poſſible. If they have goods for ſale, they openly avow three prices: one, if the purchaſer will agree to pay in hard money; an higher price, if in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial paper, under the old government; and a ſtill higher, if in the preſent continental bills of credit. But we have many other ways of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that currency into diſrepute, which I am not at liberty to mention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:024407_0145_0FC7096E282D9948"/>I would give a liſt of the men of moſt influence in our ſociety—at preſent this would be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but I will be more explicit hereafter, when <hi>toryiſm</hi> may be more ſafely and openly avowed.</p>
                     <p>SOME narrow minded people ſay, that we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all we can to ruin our country, and entail a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſlavery on our unborn poſterity.

'Tis true, if the Britiſh Generals ſhould ſucceed in their enterpriſe we may ſee our neighbours and friends impriſoned by hundreds, and hanged by dozens; their eſtates confiſcated, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren turned out to beggary and want; but then we ſhall ourſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHEN neceſſity firſt compelled us to take up arms in defence of our country, we thought our only buſineſs would be to oppoſe ſtrength to ſtrength, in the uſual courſe of war: and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, we provided ourſelves with guns, bayonets, powder, ball, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>BUT experience ſhews that we were miſtaken. Other weapons of leſs mortal, but not leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous effect, are exerciſed againſt us by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and we are very deficient on our parts. It is now high time that congreſs ſhould enable us to meet the foe with equal arms. In ſhort, Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, we want men of abilities to ſerve the United States in the capacity of <hi>public Liars.</hi>

                     <pb n="143" facs="unknown:024407_0147_0FC709711E03E620"/>HOWEVER ſtrange ſuch an appointment may appear at firſt view, we find that the experienced commanders of the Britiſh army have not thought it unworthy of their attention. It is manifeſt that our enemies depend much on their ſuperiority in the art of <hi>lying.</hi> In the very commencement of the war, the Britiſh miniſter was at the trouble and expence of ſending over a whole ſhip load of lies in a pamphlet, entitled <hi>An Addreſs to the People of America,</hi> to be diſperſed among the people. After this, many other lying pamphlets and papers were diſcharged from the royal batteries. Lord <hi>Howe</hi> ſent a lie to congreſs by Gen. <hi>Sullivan,</hi> requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conference for the eſtabliſhment of peace— knowing, at the ſame time, he had neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention nor the power to make peace. But this was only priming the cannon—his principal aim was to ſend a thundering lie to Europe, and particularly to <hi>France,</hi> informing that congreſs was about to ſubmit, and had actually entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a treaty with the Britiſh generals for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And Sir <hi>William Howe</hi> let off another <hi>lie,</hi> not long ſince, by means of the unfortunate <hi>John Brown</hi>—but that miſſed its aim.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as the <hi>Howes</hi> got to New York, they appointed their <hi>liar general,</hi> who played off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable lies from the batteries of <hi>Rivington</hi>

                  <p>I have heard of a man in England, ſome years ago, called a Ventriloquiſt, who had the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary faculty of making his voice ſeem to come from where he pleaſed. This man kept a great dog, and for the entertainment of his viſitors, would throw his voice into the dog's belly; and then wagging the poor beaſt's jaws with his hands, made him ſeem to ſay any thing he pleaſed. Thus it is with <hi>Humphreys</hi> and <hi>Town. The liar general</hi> is the man with a wonderful voice, and they are only his dogs, whom he cauſes to utter what he thinks proper.

the juſtice and mercy of your king;</hi> we the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles of America, were ſeized with unuſual trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and confounded with diſmay. But what words can expreſs the plenitude of our horror when the colonel of the queen's regiment of light dragoons advanced towards Ticonderoga. The mountains trembled before thee, and the trees of the foreſt bowed their lofty heads: the vaſt lakes of the weſt were chilled at thy preſence, and the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous cataract of <hi>Niagara</hi> bellowed at thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.—Judge then, oh! ineffable governor of Fort-William in North-Britain! what muſt have been the conſternation, terror, and deſpair of us miſerable Americans, whilſt in your irreſiſtible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances you laid all waſte with fire and ſword, more fully to diſplay <hi>the juſtice and mercy</hi> of your king. Dark and dreary was the proſpect before us, till, like the ſun in the eaſt, your moſt generous, moſt ſublime, and inimitable proclamation ſhed abroad the cheering rays of protection and mercy, and ſhone upon the only path that could lead us from the pit of annihilation.</p>
                  <p>WE fooliſhly thought, ignorant as we were, that your gracious maſter's fleet and armies were come to deſtroy us and ſubdue our country; but we are moſt happy in hearing from you—and who can doubt what one of the repreſentatives of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

of Great-Britain aſſerts? that they were <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth for the ſole purpoſe of reſtoring the rights of the conſtitution to a froward and ſtubborn gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND is it for this, oh, ſublime lieutenant-general of his majeſty's armies in America! that you have left the commons of Great-Britain to ſhift for themſelves, and croſſed the wide Atlantic; and ſhall we moſt ungratefully decline the profered bleſſing? <hi>To reſtore the rights of the conſtitution,</hi> you have collected an amiable hoſt of ſavages, and turned them looſe to ſcalp our wives and children, and to deſolate our country. This they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed with their uſual ſkill and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and we yet remain inſenſible of the benefit— we yet remain unthankful for ſuch unparalleled goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>OUR congreſs hath declared independence— and our aſſemblies, as your ſublimity juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, have moſt wickedly impriſoned ſome of the avowed friends of that power with which we are at war. If we continue thus obſtinate and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, what can we expect, but that you ſhould in your wrath <hi>give a ſtretch to the Indian forces under your direction, amounting to thouſands, to overtake and deſtroy</hi> us; or which is ſtill more terrible, that

you ſhould withdraw your fleet and armies, and leave us to our own miſery; without completing the benevolent taſk, of reſtoring to us the rights of the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>WE ſubmit—we ſubmit—moſt puiſſant colonel of the queen's regiment of light dragoons, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Fort-William in North-Britain! We humbly offer our heads to the tomahawk, and our bellies to the bayonet—For who can reſiſt the power of your eloquence? Who can withſtand the terror of your arms?</p>
                  <p>THE invitation you have given, <hi>in the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtianity, your royal maſter's clemency, and the honour of ſoldierſhip,</hi> we thankfully accept. The blood of the ſlain—the cries of violated virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſlaughtered infants—the never-ceaſing groans of our ſtarving brethren now languiſhing in the jails and priſon-ſhips of New-York, call upon us in vain, whilſt your ſublime proclamation is ſounding in our ears. Forgive us, oh, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! Forgive us, dear poſterity! Forgive us, all ye nations of the world, who are watching our conduct in this important ſtruggle for the liberty and happineſs of unborn millions, if we yield im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly to the faſcinating eloquence of one of the repreſentatives of the commons of Great-Britain.

Forbear then, thou magnanimous lieutenant-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral—forbear to denounce vengeance againſt us.— Give not <hi>a ſtretch</hi> to thoſe reſtorers of conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal rights—the Indian forces under your direction. —Let not <hi>the meſſengers of juſtice and wrath await us in the field: and deſolation, famine, and every concomitant horror bar our return</hi> to the allegiance of a prince who has taken ſo much pains for our reformation.

                  <p>HAVING obſerved with real concern, that our newſpapers have for a long time paſt been filled with private conteſts and perſonal calumny, to the great abuſe of the liberty of the preſs, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our city; I, who have ever been ambitious of deviſing ſomething for the public good, never before deviſed or thought of by any ſchemer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſet my wits to work to remedy this growing evil, and to reſtore our gazettes, advertiſers, jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and packets to their original deſign, and make them the vehicles of intelligence, not the common ſewers of ſcandal.</p>
                  <p>TO convince you that I am not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for this purpoſe, you muſt know that I have had a tolerable education in the charity-ſchool belonging to our univerſity. My parents being
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:024407_0156_0FC70995E4106C00"/>
poor bound me to a ſcrivener. My maſter ſoon diſcovered in me an aptitude for buſineſs; and as I wrote a good hand, he took me from the menial labours of the kitchen to aſſiſt him in his office; where I engroſſed deeds, leaſes, wills, &amp;c. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little practice, was able to do the chief part of his buſineſs for him.</p>
                  <p>WHEN I had completed my apprenticeſhip, I left the ſcrivener and ſet up for myſelf. I ſerved as clerk in the offices of ſeveral ſucceſſive mayors, aldermen, and juſtices of the peace—and, to my honour be it recorded, my employers frequently applied to my judgement in difficult caſes—and I venture to ſay—but with all due deference—that my advice contributed not a little to ſupport their worſhip's official reputation.</p>
                  <p>NOW for my project—which after much labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtudy I have completed, and generouſly give to the public without any proſpect of reward; ſave only the reputation of being the author of ſo ingenious and ſalutary a ſcheme.</p>
                  <p>LET there be a new court of juſtice eſtabliſhed, under the name and ſtile of <hi>The High Court of Honour</hi>: To conſiſt of twelve impartial and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men, annually elected by the freemen of the

ſtate. In which election all perſons of what degree or quality ſoever (ſlaves excepted) ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to vote—ſtrangers alſo excepted, who have not reſided one year in the city or county where they would vote. This court when met ſhall chuſe one of their body for preſident, and alſo appoint ſome ſuitable perſon to ſerve as clerk: and ſhall have juriſdiction in all matters of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between man and man, of what kind ſoever they be, provided no property real or perſonal ſhall come in queſtion, ſo as to be affected by the final judgment of the ſaid court. It ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on differences in opinion—points of honour —ceremony—rank and precedence in all caſes of affronts—flights—abuſe—ſcandal, ſlander, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny—and in all other matters of conteſt; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as before excepted. Nine judges ſhall make a quorum, and a majority of voices ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the judgment of the court—and from their deciſion there ſhall be no appeal.</p>
                  <p>THE clerk ſhall keep a large bound book, to be entitled <hi>The Raſcal's Record.</hi> In which ſhall be fairly entered, in alphabetical order, the names, occupations, and places of reſidence of thoſe on whom the judgment of the court ſhall fall; which book ſhall at all times be open to inſpection, on paying the clerk <hi>ſixpence</hi> ſpecie for every ſearch,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024407_0158_0FC70998F5E99AF0"/>
and one ſhilling for a certified extract.

                  </p>
                  <p>AND the form or proceſs of the court ſhall be as follows—If any man hath cauſe of offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, he ſhall apply to the clerk of the court for a <hi>declaration.</hi> Theſe declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be fairly printed on good paper, with ſuitable blanks for the names of the parties, dates, &amp;c. And the plaintiff applying ſhall pay eighteen pence for the blank and ſix pence for fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up, atteſting it, and entering the action on the docket. And the party ſhall, in the preſence of the clerk, ſign the ſaid declaration with his own hand; or if that cannot be, ſhall make his mark. After which the clerk ſhall number and file the ſaid declaration.</p>
                  <p>ON notice from the clerk that ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been filed, the judges ſhall meet and

agree on a time and place for hearing the cauſe; to which the accuſers and accuſed ſhall be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to attend, with their reſpective witneſſes. No council ſhall be admitted in this court; but the parties ſhall perſonally plead their own cauſes. After a full hearing, the court ſhall give their final ſentence or decree.

                  <p>☞ JAMES RIVINGTON, printer of the Royal Gazette at New York, whilſt the Britiſh troops were in poſſeſſion of that city, had been exceedingly virrulent, abuſive, and illiberal in his publications againſt the Americans, their congreſs, their army, their officers, and their meaſures: Every paper abounded with the groſſeſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, miſrepreſentations, and inſults; till at laſt, facts repeatedly contradicting his poſitive intelligence, the Royal Gazette loſt all credit, even in Europe, where his accounts of the events of the war were chiefly intended to operate. This conduct of Mr. Rivington, and of thoſe who countenanced and aſſiſted him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked ſome ſarcaſms in return—amongſt which were the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publications.</p>

                     <q>THE late ſurrender of <hi>Lord Cornwallis</hi> and his army, together with a variety of other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, having rendered it convenient for the ſubſcriber to remove to Europe, all thoſe who are indebted to, or have any demands againſt him, are earneſtly requeſted to make as ſpeedy a ſettlement of their accounts as poſſible.</q>

                  <opener>To the printer of the Pennſylvania Packet. <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR paper of the 10th inſtant, No. 805, reached this city, and an Advertiſement therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and ſigned with my ſignature, hath attracted univerſal notice and particular attention, and hath, moreover, rendered me the ſubject of much ſaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſtricture.</p>
                  <p>THE author of this moſt wicked forgery, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is, hath moſt nefariouſly, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice aforethought, made uſe of my name as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle to impoſe on the judicious public the nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory productions of his own flimſy brain, as the genuine offspring of my prolific pen. But I do aſſure you, upon the word of a gentleman, that
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:024407_0175_0FC709E1497FD2E0"/>
ſaid advertiſement is <hi>in toto</hi> ſpurious and fictitious. Was the <hi>ultimatum</hi> of the jejune performance nothing more than a little riſible ſatire, I had borne the indignity with taciturn patience: But it is moſt patent to ſenſe, that an emphatic injury is intended by this attrocious calumniator. The manifeſt deſign is to draw upon me the reſentment of a people for whom I have the moſt profound veneration, and whoſe virtuous and heroic ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles for conſtitutional liberty I have beheld with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment and ſecret admiration.</p>
                  <p>YOU may perhaps, Mr Printer, be ſurpriſed at this manifeſto, and exclaim, that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation between ſuch a declaration and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form tenor and tendency of the Royal Gazette of New York. In anſwer—you are to conſider, that it was my lot to remain with a people who had power in their hands, and money in their purſes. In ſuch a ſituation, you muſt concede, it was the part of a wiſe man to evade the power, and to poſſeſs as much of the money as he could. This I have done: I have written and publiſhed for them to the extremeſt verge of invention—the Engliſh language hath been tortured, and truth expired on the rack, in their behalf. By this I have gained their confidence and blinded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus eyes of power—As to money, let the ſalary I
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:024407_0176_0FC709E2634DC010"/>
enjoy, and the baubles I have ſold at extortionate prices, evince that my labour hath not been in vain. Have I done this to the injury of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica and advantage of her enemies?—by no means—By overacting my part, I defeated the very purpoſes I ſeemed to intend: and the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical lies I daily fabricated, only ſerved to gull for a time, the fools who thought I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting myſelf in their ſervice; till, by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confutations they loſt all credit, even in the cities of New York and London—In the mean time my hopes were rivetted to an event which I foreſaw muſt ſooner or later take effect; and I felicitate myſelf in the proſpect of ſpending in America, amongſt heroes and patriots, the caſh which I have ſeduced from the unbuttoned pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of cockaded coxcombs—in America, the land of liberty, when the ſtorm of war ſhall ceaſe, and every man may enjoy the fruits of his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity under his own vine and his own fig-tree.</p>
                  <p>I am well aware, Mr Printer, that the voice of your multitude is againſt me. They judge from appearances only, and appearances are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deluſive—They ſuppoſe that I am the ſole author of the inveterate falſehoods, groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations, and ſtigmatic appellations which I ſo frequently publiſh againſt them and their cauſe

—Alas! I am but <hi>a poor printer</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">His own words.</note>! ſubjected by my vocation to the execrable taſk of bringing into the world the monſtrous conceptions of weak and diſordered minds. But I am deemed a tory—male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent tory—and why? truly becauſe I have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed tory news, tory lies, and tory eſſays in my ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette. Granted. But will any one pretend to ſay that I have ever refuſed to publiſh whig news, whig lies, or whig eſſays; I challenge all Philadelphia to produce a ſingle writer who ever ſent me a whig piece for publication which I refuſed or neglected to print— I am confident no ſuch inſtance can be found.— The truth is, I am a great friend to liberty; and have actually felt the ſacred flame glow in my breaſt—firſt, about the time, or rather juſt after the affair of <hi>Saratoga</hi>; and now again on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Lord Cornwallis</hi> and his army. And if the brave Americans ſhould purſue their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and confirm their independance, of which indeed there now ſeems to be little doubt, you may depend upon it, there is not a flaming patriot in the Thirteen United Sates that will garrulate the charms of liberty with more loquacious zeal than myſelf.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>☞ CONGRESS had, from ſome diſguſt, ſuddenly removed from Philadelphia to Princetown in New-Jerſey: but, finding themſelves but ill accommodated there, they took into conſideration the fixing upon ſome ſuitable place for their permanent reſidence In canvaſſing this queſtion, the eaſtern and ſouthern delegates could not agree on a ſituation equally convenient for both. On motion of Mr. G— it was at length determined, that congreſs ſhould have two places of alternate reſidence: one on the banks of the Potowmack, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the banks of the Delaware: and it was reſolved, that congreſs ſhould not remain leſs than ſix months, nor more than two years at either of theſe places at one time. But as there was no town on the Potowmack fit for their reception, they, for the preſent, adjourned to Annapolis. This circumſtance gave occaſion for the following publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.</head>
                  <p>THE great revolution that hath taken place in America, will undoubtedly involve many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of conſiderable importance and curious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. None, perhaps, more remarkable than this, that the philoſophical world may expect to be entertained with a phenomenon in mechanics, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether new, and which cannot fail to engage uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal attention.</p>
                  <p>THE Americans having obſerved the great irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities to which the political ſyſtems of Europe
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:024407_0183_0FC709FC2C153B88"/>
are liable, have invented a method of regulating the affairs of their empire by ACTUAL MECHANISM. For this purpoſe an immenſe pendulum hath been conſtructed, of which the point of ſuſpenſion is fixed ſomewhere in the orbit of the planet <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Bob</hi> is compoſed of certain heterogeneous matter of great ſpecific gravity, called the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Congreſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS miraculous pendulum is to vibrate between Annapolis, on the Cheſapeak, and Trenton, on the Delaware; a range of about 180 miles.</p>
                  <p>IT will require the moſt ſubtle mathematical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations to aſcertain the true path of this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical bob: for it is pretty certain that it will not move in a <hi>ſtraight line,</hi> nor in a cycloid, nor in a parabola, nor in an hyperbola, nor in any other known curve; but will have a motion peculiar to itſelf, forming a <hi>crooked line,</hi> the properties of which cannot be reduced to any of the rules with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the preſent ſyſtem of mathematics.</p>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH the oſcillations of this pendulum will not be performed in, yet they will average equal times. Two vibrations muſt be made in two years: but theſe vibrations may bear no determatine proportion to each other; for their relative propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:024407_0184_0FC70A00C419BE60"/>
will depend entirely upon the ſpecific gravity of the bob: which being, from the nature of its compoſition, very variable, will render the oſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations equally variable with reſpect to each other: and, which is very extraordinary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in all other inſtances, the more ponderous a body is, the more it is diſpoſed to reſt, and the ſhorter and ſlower will its vibrations be when ſuſpended, it will be the reverſe in the preſent caſe; for the bob will be inclined to moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more or leſs, in proportion as the matter of which it may be compoſed ſhall happen to be more or leſs dull and heavy.</p>
                  <p>BY the oſcillations of this pendulum and its <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> bob, are thirteen wheels of the American ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine to be regulated. And, it is expected, that the different combinations of motions, the actings, and counter-actings, the checks, and counter-checks of the moving parts, will ſo correct and ballance each other, as to produce, in the final reſult, a movement ſo perfectly equable, that the great <hi>deſiderata,</hi> viz. the perpetual motion, and the diſcovery of longitude, will no longer puzzle the brains and drain the purſes of ſeekers in ſcience.</p>
                  <p>BUT the moſt entertaining conſequence of this improvement in politics will be, that it will render
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:024407_0185_0FC70A01EA4FF860"/>
viſible the locomotive faculties of the ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Europe; ſo far at leaſt as the ſame may be aſcertained by their reſpective ambaſſadors and envoys. For, as they muſt all follow the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the American bob, they will do this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the genius of the countries to which they reſpectively belong. The volatile and active will always keep within reach of the object of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit: the careleſs and indolent will loiter by the way; and the dull and phlegmatic be ſo diſtanced, that by the time they ſhall have arrived at one of the limits of oſcillation, they will find it neceſſary to tack about and follow the pendulum in its return to the other.</p>
                  <p>IN order to render this alternate peregrination as convenient as may be to their miniſters, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral governments of Europe are to raiſe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution the ſum of four hundred thouſand guineas for the purpoſe of levelling the roads between Annapolis and Trenton, building bridges, and erecting houſes of reſidence in each of thoſe towns, if thoſe can properly be called houſes of reſidence wherein the inhabitants are to have no reſt.</p>
                  <p>SOME have thought that when this <hi>monſtrous</hi> pendulum ſhall be once ſet in motion, it will not be poſſible to confine it within the propoſed limits;
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:024407_0186_0FC70A0362E3BF58"/>
but that it will by its great weight (contrary to the uſual laws of gravitation) enlarge its field of action, and acquire a velocity which will cauſe it to ſwing from New-Hampſhire to Georgia.</p>
                  <p>A further improvement hath alſo been ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is this—Many philoſophers have been of opinion, that the moſt regular and proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a pendulum would be to cauſe it to ſwing in a horizontal circle, and not in a vertical plane, as the common practice is, ſo that the ſtring or rod may deſcribe a cone, of which the apex will be in the point of ſuſpenſion, and the baſe formed by the circumference of the circular plane in which the bob moves.</p>
                  <p>SHOULD this idea prove juſt (which Mr. Rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenhouſe has been directed to aſcertain) the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of America will be performed in a circle, whoſe diameter, north and ſouth, will be from a point in St. John's river, Nova-Scotia, to the mouth of the great river Miſſiſippi, and weſt and eaſt, from the Lake in the Woods, to an unknown diſtance in the Atlantic ocean. The only incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience will be the cutting a circular road through mountains and foreſts for the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of foreign miniſters and the officers of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:024407_0187_0FC70A0A289CB2B0"/>
congreſs; and the providing ſufficient ſhips at the point where the the ſaid line of circumvolution ſhall leave the continent, and enter on the waters of the Atlantic, in order that their excellencies, and their honours, may be attendant on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary planet in every part of its orbit.</p>

                  <head>A SUMMARY OF SOME LATE PROCEEDINGS IN A CERTAIN GREAT ASSEMBLY.</head>
                  <p>—A Member, in the courſe of debate, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mention the reſolve reſpecting the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſidence of the houſe in two federal cities, and two hundred miles diſtant from each other; and although he acknowledged himſelf out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the reſolve had already been debated, and the votes thereupon taken; yet he begged leave to draw their attention to a circumſtance which had probably eſcaped notice at the time, which was this: that the houſe had, ſome months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſolemnly reſolved, that a certain equeſtrian ſtatue ſhould be erected in the place where the houſe ſhould fix its permanent reſidence. <note n="*" place="bottom">Congreſs had before reſolved that an equeſtrian ſtatue, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of General Waſhington, ſhould be erected in the place where their reſidence ſhould be fixed.</note> And he requeſted to know in what manner the Houſe propoſed to execute this determination under the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:024407_0189_0FC70A11DDD5FC38"/>
preſent ſyſtem of a <hi>peregrinating</hi> inſtead of a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi> reſidence.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſtruck the houſe with great force, and many looked upon it as an invincible difficulty; thinking that the two reſolves were altogether ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable with each other. But the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous member, who had planned the ſcheme of the two federal towns, ſoon relieved them from their embarraſſment by declaring—That he had been well aware of this objection, and looked for it at the time the reſolve in queſtion was under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, when indeed he ſhould not have been ſo ready to anſwer as at preſent: That he was now prepared to obviate the objection that had been ſtarted, and ſhould in a day or two propoſe his ſcheme at large, as he only waited for certain drawings to be completed, which were already in great forwardneſs.</p>
                  <p>THE attention of the houſe being ſtrongly drawn to the ſubject of this promiſe, he was earneſtly requeſted to give <hi>Inſtanter,</hi> ſome idea of his deſign.</p>
                  <p>THE ingenious member, thus urged, ſaid that he was ſenſible his ſcheme muſt greatly ſuffer in opinion by being exhibited in a partial, imperfect
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:024407_0190_0FC70A134F30C370"/>
manner. Nevertheleſs he could not refuſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the impatience of the houſe, truſting in their candour that they would not form too haſty a judgment of his deſign, but wait till they ſhould ſee the drawings, which would elucidate the whole.</p>
                  <p>HIS deſign, he ſaid, was this—not only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the reſolve reſpecting the equeſtrian ſtatue, but to make that very reſolve condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the ſcheme of the two federal towns. The ſpirit and intention of the reſolve reſpecting the equeſtrian ſtatue, he obſerved, was no more than this, that the ſaid ſtatue ſhould always be where the houſe ſhould ſit. To effect which, nothing more was neceſſary than to adjourn the ſtatue when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and wherever they ſhould adjourn the houſe, which might eaſily be done by mounting it on wheels. But this was not all; for if the horſe ſhould be conſtructed of a ſuitable ſize, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with timbers, like the hull of a ſhip, it might be made a moſt convenient vehicle to tranſport the members themſelves, with their books, papers, &amp;c. from one federal town to the other: and added, that the drawings he had mentioned were deſigned to exhibit ſuch a conſtruction of the body of a horſe, as might moſt conveniently anſwer this purpoſe: whereby would be ſhown the ſeats intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the reſpective members, the places for the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:024407_0191_0FC70A1981E7DAA0"/>
preſident and ſecretary, and a little cloſet in the <hi>inteſtinum rectum,</hi> for the ſecret papers of the houſe: proviſion being alſo made for light and air, and every other convenience ſuitable to ſo great a deſign.</p>
                  <p>HE confeſſed he had taken his idea from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Grecian horſe,</hi> uſed at the ſiege of <hi>Troy;</hi> and had been ſearching <hi>Homer</hi> with all his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, annotators, and tranſlators, in hopes of finding ſome deſcription of the internal conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that memorable machine; but receiving no aſſiſtance from theſe ſources, he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to depend upon his own ingenuity, and the advice of an able ſhip-wright, who was now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the drawings he propoſed to lay before the houſe.</p>
                  <p>THIS device of the <hi>ingenious</hi> member was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with great applauſe—but a <hi>ſtill more ingenious</hi> member roſe up, and ſaid—that the gentleman who ſpoke laſt, had in ſome meaſure anticipated a project he had conceived, and was preparing to offer. But as the deſign he had formed was upon a much larger ſcale than that which had been ſuggeſted, he ſhould not with-hold it from the houſe, although he confeſſed it was planned on much the ſame principles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="unknown:024407_0192_0FC70A1AB336FA28"/>THE difficulty reſpecting the ſtatue, he ſaid, had not indeed occured to him; but one of at leaſt equal importance had—which was the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expence of building two federal towns, when one might be ſufficient for all purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>TO obviate this, he would propoſe that there ſhould be <hi>two</hi> places of <hi>alternate, permanent</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, agreeably to the late reſolve, and but <hi>one</hi> federal town; which town ſhould be built upon a large platform, mounted on a great number of wheels, and be drawn by a great number of horſes.</p>
                  <p>THIS, he obſerved, would be productive of many great conveniences. It would render the immence expence of building two federal towns unneceſſary—It would ſpare the trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of packing and unpacking, deranging and arranging their books and papers at every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment—and it would ſave much precious time, inaſmuch as there would be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in their proceedings; for the buſineſs of the houſe might be going on, whilſt the houſe itſelf <hi>was going on</hi>; and motions not only be made in the houſe, but the houſe itſelf <hi>make motions</hi> —ſo that, with the motions of the members, the motions of the houſe, and the motions of the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:024407_0193_0FC70A1C26C717F0"/>
whole federal town, all the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be in conſtant action for the good of the empire.</p>
                  <p>HE then proceeded to ſhow that ſuch a ſcheme was neither abſurd in itſelf, nor impracticable in in fact. It was not abſurd, he ſaid, becauſe nature, who does nothing improper, had furniſhed many inſtances of the kind—as in the ſnail, the tortoiſe, and ſeveral other animals—neither was it imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, as he could fully prove. He aſſerted that he had himſelf ſeen in England an ingenious tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who had mounted a ſmall houſe upon wheels, which contained a bed, ſome neceſſary furniture, and the utenſils of his trade, and was drawn about by a ſingle horſe: ſo that, when he had exhauſted the cuſtom of one village, he removed, <hi>cum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus appurtenantibus,</hi> to another; and by that means ſecured a conſtant circulation of employ.</p>
                  <p>BUT I have an inſtance, ſaid he, more directly in point—I mean that of the empreſs of Ruſſia; who, when ſhe removes her court from Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh to Moſcow, is accommodated with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant apartments, built on ſleds, and drawn by fifty horſes, over a tract of ſnow many hundred miles in extent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="unknown:024407_0194_0FC70A1DB6295370"/>BUT it may be objected, continued this more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious member, that theſe are only examples of a ſingle room, or two or three apartments being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered moveable by machinery; but to make a whole town—a federal town—an imperial city— thus tranſitory, muſt be totally impracticable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the help of art magic—I am not unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, ſaid he, to anſwer this objection. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a mark of great weakneſs to conclude eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principle falſe of which we cannot conceive, and every purpoſe impoſſible, which we know not how to effect. A fool often wonders improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſees a jack-weight deſcend without ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but exclaims with admiration at the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an orrery: whereas, in truth, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more myſtery in the deſcent of a jack-weight than in the moſt complicated movements of an orrery.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not now undertake to deſcribe minutely the means by which our federal town may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>itinerant.</hi> This I reſerve for a future day; but to ſhew that the thing is at leaſt not impoſſible, I beg leave to read a paſſage from a book I have in my hand. It is entitled, <hi>A Voyage to the Moon, by Cerano de Bergerac,</hi> p. 112 &amp; 114. <q>At this our young hoſt enquired from his father, What
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:024407_0195_0FC70A29A5B7DE58"/>
was the hour? Who replying it had already ſtruck eight, he very angrily aſked him, how he dared to neglect calling him at ſeven, as he had ordered; when he knew very well the houſes were to begin their journey next day, the walls of the town being already gone? The good man told him, that ſince his ſitting down at table, a proclamation had been made, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the houſes to ſet out before the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to-morrow.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>IN order to turn the diſcourſe, I intreated him to inform me, what was meant by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the town, and if the houſes and walls really travelled? Dear ſtranger, ſaid he, our buildings are of two ſorts, the <hi>moveable</hi> and the <hi>ſedentary.</hi> The <hi>moveable,</hi> in one of which you are now, I am about to deſcribe. They are compoſed, as you ſee, of very light wood: and at the building of them, the architect places four ſtrong wheels under the foundations of the walls. Six large pair of bellows are placed, with their noſes horizontal to the wings of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtory; ſo that when a town is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved (which is always done as the ſeaſons change) ſeveral large ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ils are unfolded before the noſe of theſe bellows, which being ſet at
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:024407_0196_0FC70A2B22DD79E0"/>
work, diſcharge the wind ſo very forcibly upon them, that the houſes are ſet in motion, and by the violence of the guſt which drives them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, are enabled to travel upwards of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues in eight days.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>very ingenious</hi> member quoted this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with no ſmall marks of triumph, and obſerved, in cloſing the book, that what had been done might be done again. That he ſhould, however, improve upon this device of his lunatic brethren, by cauſing his town to move bodily, with all its rights, privileges, and appurtenances, and not by ſingle houſes, which he apprehended would be apt to occaſion much confuſion on the road.</p>
                  <p>HE concluded, with ſaying, that the only thing he ſhould aſk of the houſe would be to proclaim a two days faſt previous to every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment; not only with a view to render the burden of ſo vaſt a machine as light as poſſible, but alſo to avoid too great a complexity of <hi>motions</hi> during the journey.</p>
                  <p>THE houſe was aſtoniſhed at the extenſive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the projecting member; and immediately

                  <p>FROM what hath appeared in the public papers reſpecting the late conteſt between the judges of the court of oyer and terminer, and the grand jury for the city and county of Philadelphia, this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath claimed the general attention of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the rights and duties of juries have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in almoſt every company—ignorantly enough no doubt. But the people, ever jealous of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:024407_0199_0FC7056F210892D0"/>
are ready to take alarm on any appearance of danger, without regarding the quarter from whence the invaſion ariſes, or the motives that induced it: the robes of office are not long enough to ſcreen the invader from cenſure, nor the ſeemingly harmleſs motive of pride palliate the offence. Are our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties ſafe or are they not? is the only queſtion with the people at large. Friends may explain, and ſycophants may flatter, but ſtrict right knows neither friends nor flatterers.</p>
                  <p>FOR my own part, I confeſs I am no lawyer; and wonder how it ſhould come to paſs that I ſhould appear in the Pennſylvania Packet on a law ſubject—but the thing is unavoidable—as I feel myſelf urged by what I conceive to be a ſenſe of duty.</p>
                  <p>I had, ſome how or other, acquired a notion that there were but two ſcreens between the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and the rigour of the law. I mean the grand jury, and the power of pardon, lodged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in every ſyſtem of government. The firſt, as a ſecurity to the innocent accuſed, that he may not be brought to a diſgraceful, vexatious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive trial; and the other, a merciful interference to relax the rigid cords of conviction, in caſes where, though the crime may have been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:024407_0200_0FC705773B7ADE20"/>
aſcertained, yet concomitant circumſtances may juſtify an extenſion of pardon.</p>
                  <p>I imagined that the grand inqueſt of the county, when duly returned, compoſed a body of truſt and power inferior to none but the legiſlature itſelf. That they are conſtitutionally independent of every influence and controul in the line of their office, and not accountable for their deciſions, unleſs in caſes of manifeſt corruption and breach of the laws. That they are ſuperior to and not the ſervants of the court, in as much as the court with all its powers cannot proceed againſt a citizen, or any individual in the criminal line, without the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſent of this grand inqueſt (except in caſes of attainder or contempts in the face of the court). For, as to the doctrine of proceeding by information, I do not fully underſtand it; yet know enough to hope it, will never gain an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in this country.</p>
                  <p>I thought the power of a grand jury, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as it is, could never give any juſt cauſe of jealouſy; becauſe it is lodged in a kind of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the people of the county, if the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff does his duty with integrity and diſcretion—in a number of men haſtily drawn together, between whom there could not have exiſted any previous
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:024407_0201_0FC705783142B3D8"/>
collective connection, and, therefore, no danger of colluſion; and particularly becauſe their office and power are ſo temporary that there is not time to form any ſyſtematical abuſes of either</p>
                  <p>I had further conceived, that as the grand jury were impannelled merely for the purpoſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the innocent, by bringing the guilty, and none but the guilty, to an open trial, they muſt of courſe have a right <hi>to make a ſtrict enquiry,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of their official oath—that is, to command to be brought before them all manner of legal teſtimony, of what nature ſoever, that may in any wiſe tend to the diſcovery of truth, and of the whole truth; and that they may and ought to do this of right, uninfluenced, and unau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by any interfering power. Becauſe, if the grand jury were prohibited from all teſtimony but ſuch as the court ſhould furniſh, and <hi>obliged</hi> to receive as authentic, nothing but the dictates of the judges or the attorney general (who in truth ought to be no more than aſſiſtants and adviſers of the grand jury in matters of form only), they would be an unneceſſary wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AT length I ſaw a piece in the <hi>Freeman's Journal</hi> of the 15th inſtant, ſigned ADRIAN; and was horribly ſhocked to find ſentiments and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines advanced on this ſubject ſo very contrary to thoſe which I had entertained. As I doubt not but this performance muſt have been written by a very great man, from the elegance of the ſtile, and by a very great lawyer, from the ſubtlety of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, I began to fear that I was all in the wrong.

                     </gap> the ſtore from which I had taken all my prejudices was cloſe at my elbow. You muſt know that we have in the houſe an old folio book which my grandfather had brought with him from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. My father had made no other uſe of it but to ſtrap his razor on the leathern cover thereof when he had occaſion to ſhave himſelf; and as it concerned the politics of a diſtant country one hundred years ago, and as our family were no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, it had lain for a long time neglected on the upper ſhelf of a cloſet. I recollected, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that about twelve or fourteen years ago, I had in ſome idle hour, taken up this book, and read
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:024407_0203_0FC7057FAF13F4C8"/>
with ſome attention a piece therein reſpecting the rights and powers of a grand jury.</p>
                  <p>I hope our new pope is not as infallible as his predeceſſor of the ſame name: if he is, my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and conſequently myſelf, muſt be greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. I ſhall not pretend to ſay which is moſt to be depended upon; but as the doctrine reſpects a very important right of the people, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt the two authors, and leave the deciſion to abler judges.</p>
                  <p>THE book to which I refer is entitled
<q>
                        <hi>STATE TRACTS,</hi> being a collection of ſeveral choice trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes relating to government from the year <hi>1660</hi> to <hi>1689.</hi>
                     </q>
And the treatiſe which had engaged my particular attention is entitled
<q>The ſecurity of Engliſhmen's lives; or the truſt, power, and duty of the grand juries of England; <hi>explained</hi> according to the fundamentals of the Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the declaration of the ſame made in parliament by many ſtatutes.</q>

                  <p>WITH reſpect to <hi>Adrian's</hi> performance, I am willing to ſuppoſe that his narrative of the caſe in queſtion may be true, not having had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of informing myſelf more certainly. All that I know of the matter is that a writer in Mr Oſwald's paper had preſumed to cenſure the conduct of the chief juſtice in two inſtances: for which offence two indictments had been ſent to the grand jury againſt Mr Oſwald as a publiſher of libels. Had the teſtimony been ſufficient to ſupport theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments: had the jury returned them <hi>true bills,</hi> and had a conviction enſued, the conſequence would have been, at leaſt this—that one citizen having offended another, would have been thrown into the power of the offended party to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed according to that meaſure of reſentment which his wounded pride might inſtigate</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ADRIAN</hi> is pleaſed to ſay—"For theſe <hi>falſe</hi> and ſcandalous libels on the court and the juſtice of the country, which ought not only to be above impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation but free of ſuſpicion, Mr Oſwald was arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted."—Theſe libels, ſays <hi>Adrian,</hi> were <hi>falſe</hi>; but nineteen honeſt and impartial men, declare, upon
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:024407_0205_0FC7058424873240"/>
oath, that they were not falſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſwald's publication conſiſted merely of a narrative of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the court in a particular caſe: the jury on enquiry, found that the narrative was ſtrictly true, and therefore could not find the bill.</note>—and not only upon oath, but according to <hi>Adrian's</hi> own aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<q>after keeping the bill two days, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers teſtimonies.</q>
It appears then that the grand jury did deliberately, and not haſtily, or unwarily, reject thoſe bills.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the oath of ſecrecy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the grand jury, <hi>Adrian</hi> thinks he has fiſhed out the reaſons by which they were gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne'd—<q>It is ſaid, (ſays he,) that upon examining ſeveral other perſons it was made out, <hi>ſome how,</hi> that the printer had been miſinformed: thence it was inferred, that miſtake merely involved no guilt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ADRIAN</hi> had juſt before obſerved,that the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the country ſhould not only be above im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation but free of ſuſpicion. Now, I am inclined to think, that the grand jury, for the time, more nearly repreſents the juſtice of the country than even the learned judges themſelves: and yet <hi>Adrian</hi> ſuſpects that they made out teſtimony <hi>ſome how or other</hi>—an inſinuation at leaſt that they had
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:024407_0206_0FC7058E580A7AE0"/>
acted unfairly—whether they did ſo or not, I leave to themſelves to anſwer—I am not their champion in this particular inſtance—I contend only for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principles; and ſhall proceed to ſelect from <hi>Adrian's</hi> performance ſome doctrinal paſſages, which ſeem to be inconſiſtent with the tenor of my old book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>WAS there not, (ſays he,) the uſual probable evidence for an open enquiry by a petit jury? If there was, why ſtifle the cauſe in the chamber of the grand inqueſt?</q>
                     <hi>Probable evidence,</hi> and <hi>ſtifle a cauſe</hi>—horrid language! are men's lives, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and fortunes to be hung upon the tenter-hooks of logical probabilities: and is the fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal of a fellow-citizen from a heinous charge to be called a ſtifled cauſe?—Oh, ſovereign pontiff, have mercy upon us!
<q>Upon this, the chief-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſeemingly provoked at their irregularities (I hope it was in appearance only) aſked the grounds on which the grand jury had proceeded, and how they came to receive witneſſes not admitted by the court?</q>
This, dilated into plain language, will ſtand thus:—Gentlemen, you are enjoined by your oath of office, diligently to enquire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment make, of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But, remember you are to ſhut your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall ſend you, otherwiſe you may perhaps find this fellow innocent of the charge, when it is my deſire that he ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THEY declined (or one for the reſt did ſo) giving any reaſons for their conduct, under pretence that they were ſworn not to reveal the ſecrets of the ſtate, or their fellows; as if this oath reſtrained them.</q>
                     <hi>Adrian</hi> then promiſes, that he will hereafter ſhew the public—<q>the true nature and conſtitution of a <hi>grand jury,</hi> that part of legal machinery, compoſed of unlearned men, (to uſe the phraſeology of the profeſſion,) which is regulated and controlled by the law, as other juries, at every ſtep, and in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their truſt, and ſubmitted to the legal direction of the court.</q>
Obſerve, reader, how irreverently his holineſs ſpeaks of one of the moſt reſpectable bodies in our government—little reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, indeed, would be due, if they were no other than what he repreſents them to be: I wiſh to know what truſt can be ſaid to be committed to a body of men who are to be regulated and controll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every ſtep and in every inſtance?

'Tis a wonder they were not more awakened

with the attempts of the late lord chief juſtice K—, who would have uſurped a lordly dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial power over the grand jury of Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and commanded them to find a bill of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment for murder, for which they ſaw no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and upon their refuſal, he not only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the jury, but aſſumed to himſelf an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power to fine them. Here was a bold battery made upon the ancient fence of our reputations and lives. If that juſtice's will had paſſed for law, all the gentlemen of the grand jury muſt have been the baſeſt vaſſals to the judges, and have been penally obliged <hi>jurare in verbo magiſtri,</hi> to have ſworn to the directions or dictates of the judges. But, thanks be to God! the late long parliament (though filled with penſioners) could not bear ſuch a bold invaſion of the Engliſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; but upon the complaint of one ſir Hugh Windham, foreman of the ſaid jury, and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that parliament, the commons brought the then chief juſtice to the bar to acknowledge his fault, whereupon the proſecution ceaſed.</q>

                     <q>
                        <hi>THEREFORE every grand juryman is ſworn as the foreman, in the words following, viz.</hi> You ſhall diligently enquire, and true preſentment make of all ſuch articles, matters, and things, as ſhall be given you in charge; and of all other matters and things as ſhall come to your own knowledge, touching the preſent ſervice: the (king's) counſel, your fellows, and your own, you ſhall keep ſecret: you ſhall preſent no man for hatred or malice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall you leave any one unpreſented for favour or affection, for love or gain, or any hopes thereof; but in all things you ſhall preſent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the beſt of your knowledge: <hi>SO HELP YOU GOD!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>HENCE it evidently appears, that every grand jury is bound to enquire diligently after the truth of every thing for which they ſhall indict or preſent a man.—When a grand jury is ſworn to enquire diligently, it is natural and neceſſary to their buſineſs to think of whom they ſhould enquire; and it is plainly and eaſily reſolved that they ought to enquire of every man that can or will inform them.—It ſeems, therefore, from the words of the oath, that there is no bound or limit ſet (ſave their own underſtanding or conſcience) to any number or ſort of perſons of whom they are bound to enquire. They ought
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:024407_0212_0FC705A7B52B34C0"/>
firſt and principally to enquire of one another, mutually what knowledge each of them hath of the matter in queſtion before them. The law preſumes that ſome at leaſt of ſo many ſufficient men of the county muſt know or have heard of all notable things done againſt the public peace. —If the parties, and the facts whereof they are accuſed, be known to the jury or any of them, their own knowledge will ſupply the room of many witneſſes. Next, they ought to enquire of all ſuch witneſſes as the proſecutors will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce againſt the accuſed. They are bound to examine all fully and prudently, to the beſt of their ſkill. Every juryman ought to aſk ſuch queſtions (by the foreman at leaſt) as he thinks neceſſary to reſolve any doubt that may ariſe in him, either about the fact, or witneſſes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the jury be then doubtful, they ought to receive all ſuch further teſtimony as ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, and to ſend for ſuch as any of them do think able to give teſtimony in the caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>NO directions can legally be impoſed upon them by any court or judges. An honeſt jury will thankfully accept good advice from judges, as they are aſſiſtants; but they are bound by their oaths to preſent the truth, the whole truth,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:024407_0213_0FC705AB1D0BDE08"/>
and nothing but the truth, to the beſt of their own, not the judge's, knowledge; neither can they, without a breach of that oath, reſign their conſciences, or blindly ſubmit to the dictates of others; and therefore, ought to receive or reject ſuch advices, as they judge them good or bad.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THE language wherein the oath is penned, is known and underſtood by every man, and the words in it have the ſame ſignification as they have whereſoever they are uſed. The judges (without aſſuming to themſelves a legiſlative power) cannot put a new ſenſe upon them, other than according to their genuine common mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They cannot magiſterially impoſe their opinions upon the jury, and make them forſake the direct words of their oath to purſue their gloſſes. They are carefully to examine what ſort of men the witneſſes are.—It is undoubtedly law which we find reported in <hi>Stiles,</hi> that though there be witneſſes to prove the bill, yet the grand inqueſt is not bound to find it if they ſee cauſe to the contrary.</q>

                  <p>MY author then conſiders the nature and intent of the ſecrecy impoſed on the grand jury by their oath; which is chiefly to prevent combinations of

                  <p>
                     <q>THERE are two vulgar errors concerning the duty of grand juries, which, if not removed, will in time deſtroy all the benefit we can expect
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:024407_0216_0FC705B0035512B8"/>
from that conſtitution, by turning them into a mere matter of form, which were deſigned for ſo great ends. Many have of late thought, and affirmed it for law, that the grand jury is neither to make ſo ſtrict enquiry into matters before them, nor to look for ſo clear evidence of the crime as the petit jury; but that their preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being to paſs a ſecond examination, they ought to indict upon a ſuperficial enquiry, and bare probabilities. Whereas, ſhould either of theſe opinions be admitted, the prejudice to the ſubject would be equal to the total laying aſide grand juries. There being in truth, no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between arraigning without any preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them at all, and their preſenting upon ſlight grounds.—For the firſt, that grand juries ought not to make ſo ſtrict enquiry: it were to be wiſhed, that we might know how it comes to paſs, that an oath ſhould be obligatory unto a petit jury and not unto the grand. The truth is, that grand juries have both a larger field for their enquiry, and are in many reſpects better capacitated to make a ſtrict one than the petit juries. Theſe laſt are confined, as to the perſon and the crime ſpecified in the indictment; but, <hi>they</hi> are at large obliged to ſearch into the whole matter that any way concerns every caſe before them.—The petit jury are bound to move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:024407_0217_0FC705B797C1E0F0"/>
the circle of the indictment made by the grand jury.—'Tis true that upon hearing the party or his witneſſes, the petit jury may acquit or judge the facts in the indictment to be leſs heinous or malicious than they were preſented by the grand jury, but cannot aggravate them; which being conſidered, it will eaſily appear, by the intent and nature of the powers given unto the grand juries, that they are by their oaths obliged to keep all injuſtice from entering the firſt gates of courts of judicature, and to ſecure the innocent not only from puniſhment, but from all diſgrace, vexation, expence or danger.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>IT is neceſſary to know what they mean by a probable cauſe or evidence, who ſay that our law requires no more for an indictment. <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> is a logical term, relating to ſuch propoſitions as have an appearance, but no certainty of truth. Theſe may be allowed in rhetoric, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the paſſions: but courts of juſtice are not erected to bring men into condemnation, but to find who deſerves to be condemned; and thoſe rules are to be followed by them, which are leaſt liable to deception. If the word <hi>probable</hi> be taken in a common, rather than a ſtrict logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe, it ſignifies no more than <hi>likely,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likely than unlikely. When a matter is
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:024407_0218_0FC705BA1C4532A8"/>
found to be ſo, the wager is not even—there is odds upon one ſide. And this may be very good betting in a Tennis-court or at a horſe race; but he that would make the adminiſtration of juſtice to depend upon ſuch points ſeems to put a very ſmall value upon the fortunes, liberties, and reputations of men; and to forget that thoſe who ſit in courts of juſtice have no other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there than to preſerve them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>IT hath been ſaid (in a book entitled <hi>the grand juryman's oath and office</hi>) that their work is no more than to preſent offences fit for trial, and for that reaſon give in only a veriſimilar or probable charge: And others have affirmed that a far leſs evidence will warrant a grand jury's indictment, than a petit jury's verdict. But nothing can be more oppoſite to the juſtice of our laws than ſuch opinions. All laws, in doubtful caſes, direct a ſuſpenſion of judgement, or a ſentence, in favour of the accuſed perſon: but if this were hearkened to, grand juries ſhould upon their oaths affirm him criminal, when the evidence is upon ſuch uncertain grounds, that they cannot but doubt whether he is ſo or not.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>'TIS ſcarcely credible that any learned in our laws ſhould tell a grand jury that a far leſs
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024407_0219_0FC705BAE2BCDE38"/>
evidence will warrant their indictment (being but an accuſation) than the petit jury ought to have for their verdict</q>—<q>There is no real difference between affirming in writing that an indictment of treaſon <hi>is true,</hi> as is the practice of grand juries, and ſaying that the party indic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereupon <hi>is guilty</hi> of the treaſon whereof he is indicted, as is the courſe of petit juries. They are both upon their oaths, which are equally obligatory unto both. The one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt expect the ſame proof for their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as the other, and as clear evidence muſt be required for an indictment as for a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>—<q>WHATEVER ground this doctrine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting upon ſlight proofs may have got in our days, it is (as we have ſeen) both againſt law and reaſon, and contrary to the practice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. My lord Coke, in his comment on Weſtm. 2d. tells us, that in thoſe days (and as yet it ought to be) indictments taken in the abſence of the party, were formed upon plain and direct proofs, and not upon probabilities and inferences. Herein we ſee that the practice of our forefathers, and the opinion of this great and judicious lawyer, were directly againſt this new doctrine; and ſome that have carefully
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:024407_0220_0FC705C0615D7548"/>
looked backwards obſerved that there are very few examples of men acquitted by petit juries, becauſe grand juries of old were ſo wary in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing every thing narrowly, and ſo ſenſible of duty in proceeding unto truth upon ſatisfactory evidence, that few or none were brought unto trial till their guilt ſeemed evident.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THEREFORE let the grand juries faithfully perform their high truſt, and neither be cheated nor frighted from their duty. Let them purſue the good old way, ſince no innovation can be brought in, that will not turn to the prejudice of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed perſon and themſelves. Let them not be deluded with frivolous arguments, ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate a conſiderable part of our law, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves inſignificant cyphers, in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that petit juries will repair the faults they commit; ſince that would be no leſs than to ſlight one of the beſt fences that the law provides for our lives and liberties, and very much to weaken the other.</q>

                  <p>SUCH are the quotations I have thought fit to make from this valuable old book; and wiſh the whole treatiſe on this ſubject were reprinted.</p>

                     <pb n="217" facs="unknown:024407_0221_0FC705C35AA80150"/>I ſhall be told, I ſuppoſe, that this is not law, and is of no authority—Of this I do not pretend to judge—but ſure I am that it is reaſon; and if it is not law, it ought to be. What is generally called law authority is the opinion or deciſion of ſome learned judge on the point in queſtion; but it ſhould be obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that grand juries are not like to have any conteſts, nor have they ever had any that I know of, except with the learned judges themſelves: now, if the judge's opinion is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the point and become law authority, there can be little doubt but he will do it as much in favour of his own power, and that of his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>IT does not appear by my old folio book, who was the author of this treatiſe on grand juries; it contains, however, the ſentiments of a freeman one hundred years ago; and hath been deemed ſo judicious a performance as to gain a place amongſt a valuable collection of authentic papers; and to be particularly pointed at and ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the preface to this collection.</p>

of a petit jury—<hi>Adrian</hi> is for giving him no chance at all, in the firſt inſtance, but ſeems to think that nothing leſs than the abſolute impoſſibility of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing even probable proof againſt him ſhould acquit him there, and juſtice will be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the petit jury. And that he may be thankful for his final eſcape, after having been ruined in health, reputation, and eſtate by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, infamy, fees and coſts—my good old author ſeems to be of opinion, that it ſhould be a cauſe of ſatisfaction and joy when a fellow-citizen is acquitted of a crime laid to his charge; but <hi>Adrian</hi> thinks a man accuſed, and not hanged, is <hi>a cauſe ſtifled.</hi> Laſtly, my author eſteems the grand inqueſt for the county as a moſt reſpectable body, in which the law hath placed the higheſt truſt and confidence; but our new pope declares that it is no more than <hi>a legal machine,</hi> to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and controlled in all its movements by the judges of the court—which of theſe doctrines is moſt likely to be founded in truth, to promote the adminiſtration of juſtice, and ſecure the liberty of the ſubject, let the public determine.</p>

                  <p>A CERTAIN man had an undoubted right to a valuable farm. It was his living—it was his all. A powerful lord wiſhed to poſſeſs this farm, and ſent his ſervants to take the title deeds by force. The good man locked up his papers in his cloſet, and arming himſelf at all points, went forth to combat his adverſary: but, alas! whilſt he was in the field, the rats were gnawing his deeds in the cloſet.</p>
                  <p>THE common people are afraid of the word <hi>law.</hi> They think it is full of inexplicable myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. It is not ſo in the text; it is too much ſo by the expoſition. All law is, or ought to be, founded in reaſon, and hath for its object the adminiſtration of general juſtice or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of general good. Every man of common ſenſe is capable to judge of law, provided all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and all conſequences are made known to him. Let any one be aſked, For what purpoſe do you think grand juries were inſtituted? He will ſay, I do not underſtand the law, but I ſuppoſe
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:024407_0225_0FC705CF2634F1E0"/>
they muſt have been inſtituted to bring the guilty, and none but the guilty, to a further trial by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit jury. There is no myſtery in this—the greateſt lawyer could not give a better anſwer. Aſk this plain man further—Why he thinks ſo? and he will probably reply—for three reaſons: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is highly neceſſary that the innocent ſhould have this ſecurity againſt falſe or malicious proſecutions. Secondly, becauſe a grand jury cannot poſſibly be of any other uſe. And, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe their oath of office is full to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to no other. But ſtop, my friend, ſays a learned judge, your firſt reaſon is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, your ſecond is no better, and your third is flatly contradicted in 4th Blackſtone, page 300. Let us ſee how this matter ſtands—a grand-jury-man's path is in theſe words:</p>

                     <q>YOU ſhall diligently enquire, and true preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make, of all ſuch articles, matters, and things as ſhall be given you in charge: and of all other matters and things as ſhall come to your own knowledge, touching this preſent ſervice: the ſtate's council, your fellow's, and your own, you ſhall keep ſecret; you ſhall preſent no perſon for hatred or malice, neither ſhall you leave any one unpreſented for favour or affection, for love or gain, or any hopes thereof: but in all things
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:024407_0226_0FC705D3CA7886D8"/>
you ſhall preſent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the beſt of your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: SO HELP YOU GOD!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS is certainly very plain Engliſh, and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, one would ſuppoſe, of miſconſtruction. But, let us obſerve how <hi>Juriſperitus,</hi> with the help of Blackſtone, can tranſlate theſe very intelligible words out of <hi>common ſenſe</hi> into <hi>common law.</hi> The oath in Engliſh ſays, <hi>you ſhall diligently enquire:</hi> in law, you ſhall ſit and receive indictments, and only hear evidence on the part of the proſecution. <hi>You ſhall diligently enquire, and true preſentment make,</hi> ſaith the oath—You are to conſider your preſentment only in the nature of an accuſation, ſaith the law, or rather the lawyer. <hi>You ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,</hi> ſays the oath—You are only to enquire, ſaith the judge, whether there be <hi>ſufficient</hi> cauſe to call upon the party to anſwer. Now ſome have ſaid, that <hi>ſufficient</hi> cauſe means <hi>probable</hi> cauſe; and <hi>probable</hi> means <hi>likely;</hi> and every thing that is <hi>likely,</hi> is at leaſt <hi>poſſible:</hi> and ſo, by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragible chain of reaſoning, we may be hung in chains, according to the good pleaſure of the judges and learned expounders of the law.</p>
                  <p>FOR my own part I honour judge <hi>Blackſtone</hi> as
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:024407_0227_0FC705D52808FA48"/>
a profound and liberal expoſitor of law, except only where <hi>prerogative</hi> comes in queſtion. The rays of <hi>prerogative</hi> are apt to warp the bench of juſtice, make it or what ſtuff you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>LET us ſee how far the authority of this ſame judge Blackſtone will carry us:—Turn to vol. i. p. 107, 108—<q>Our American plantations, (ſays he,) being obtained either by right of conqueſt and driving out the natives, or by treaties, the common law of England, as ſuch, has no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or authority there; they being no part of the mother country, but diſtinct dominions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the controul of parliament.</q>
And in p. 109:—<q>And becauſe ſeveral of the colonies had claimed the ſole and excluſive right of impoſing taxes upon themſelves, the ſtatute of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Geo. III. chap. 12, expreſsly declares, that all his majeſty's colonies and plantations in America, have been, are, and of right ought to be, ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament of Great-Britain: who have full power and authority to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient validity to bind the colonies and people of America, ſubjects to the crown of Great-Britain, in all caſes whatſoever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, good people, you have thought it eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:024407_0228_0FC705D6A981E678"/>
neceſſary to your happineſs, to deny the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of judge Blackſtone, vol. i. p. 108; altho' fortified by the ſtatute of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Geo. III.— But you have only done your buſineſs by halves, unleſs you will as firmly reject the authority of the ſaid judge Blackſtone, vol. iv. p. 300, although ſupported by the authority of <hi>Juriſperitus</hi> the firſt.</p>
                  <p>WHY did <hi>Juriſperitus</hi> ſtop juſt where he did, when he was quoting Blackſtone?—Anſwer. —Becauſe the very next ſentence, which is but a ſhort one, and concludes the paragraph, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, does not ſupport the doctrine of <hi>probable teſtimony</hi> he wiſhes to eſtabliſh.—The ſentence ſtands thus:—<q>a grand jury, however, ought to be <hi>thoroughly</hi> perſuaded of the truth of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, ſo far as their evidence goes, and not to reſt ſatisfied merely with remote <hi>probabilities;</hi> a doctrine that <hi>might be applied to very oppreſſive purpoſes.</hi>
                     </q>—State Trials, vol. iv. p. 183.</p>
                  <p>THIS device of picking out a part of a ſentence, is like <hi>Lord Peter's</hi> method of expounding his father's will.</p>
                  <p>BUT what ſays judge <hi>Adrian?</hi> He tells us that a grand jury is—<hi>that part of legal machinery compoſed of unlearned men, to uſe the phraſeology of
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:024407_0229_0FC705D826406F48"/>
the profeſſion, which is regulated and controlled</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. yet judge <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> vol. IV. page. 302. ſays that
<q>to form a grand jury the ſheriff of every county is bound to return &amp;c. twenty-four <hi>good and lawful</hi> men of the county. That they ought to be freeholders, but to what amount is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—however, they are uſually men of the <hi>beſt figure</hi> in the county.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have thought a good deal of this ſame idea of a <hi>legal machine,</hi> and am of opinion that <hi>Adrian</hi> muſt have drawn his idea from the <hi>pillory,</hi> which is, in truth, <hi>a legal machine,</hi> and very like his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a grand jury. A poor devil is fixed neck and hands in this engine of the law by his accuſer. The court furniſhes rotten eggs, and the attorney general pelts him <hi>ſecundum artem;</hi> whilſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer is not permitted to wipe away even the ſlime of a ſingle egg. After he has been ſufficiently beſmeared to the entire ſatisfaction of his enemies, he is taken in this filthy condition to the petit jury, who may, if <hi>Adrian</hi> pleaſes, repreſent another <hi>legal machine,</hi> called a <hi>gallows</hi>—there he is to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all coſts and charges, and go about his buſineſs: and this is called <hi>juſtice.</hi> But if this is indeed <hi>juſtice,</hi> it is ſo manufactured that the original ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is loſt in the compound.</p>
                  <p>BUT, my good fellow citizens, let us not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a parade of idle authorities, and more idle reaſonings upon them. You muſt all ſee and know that the uſe of grand juries is to guard the firſt entrance into the law, to prevent any one's being unneceſſarily expoſed to its rigour. If grand juries do their duty, an enemy ſhall not have it in his power to come behind a man and puſh him unawares into that pool of perdition, from which it is ſo difficult to eſcape, that the clerk of the court, when he has arraigned the priſoner, always adds, <hi>God ſend you a good deliverance!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THOUGH judge Mansfield, judge Blackſtone, judge <hi>Juriſperitus,</hi> judge <hi>Adrian,</hi> and all the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſince the reign of Chares I. ſhould, with one voice, tell you that, after a grand jury hath taken the oath above recited, they may indict a man upon ſlight grounds and <hi>probable</hi> teſtimony—believe them not. That they will have made <hi>diligent</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, when in fact they have made no inquiry at all, but only received ſuch evidence as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor ſhall offer—believe them not. That a
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:024407_0231_0FC705E1EC79C1E8"/>
grand jury is nothing more than a <hi>legal machine,</hi> contrived to give a formal ſanction to the will of the judge—believe them not. But rather watch thoſe who dare to advance doctrines ſo dangerous to the lives, eſtates, and reputations of the citizens of a free government.</p>

                  <head>A NEW GAME WITH CARDS FOR THE IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROVEMENT OF <hi>ORTHOGRAPHY.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>LET a pack, conſiſting of 104 cards, be prepared, by printing on each card—(with engraved orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if you pleaſe) a letter; ſo that there may be four ſets of the alphabet viz. 1ſt. a ſet of red capitals; 2d. red ſmall letters; 3d. black capitals; 4th, black ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etters—Thus there will be four ſuits, as in common playing cards; each ſuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 26 cards, or letters, of one colour and kind.</p>
                  <p>AS many as pleaſe may play at this game: but the number cannot conveniently be leſs than five.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE the cards are dealt, every player ſhould take a number of counters, ſuppoſe a dozen, which muſt all be thrown into a ſaucer or pool.</p>
                  <p>THE pack having been well ſhuffled, is ſet on the table, and the dealer takes from the top as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he may judge ſufficient for a deal (becauſe it may be inconvenient to handle ſo large a pack),
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:024407_0244_0FC70616C747BD30"/>
and then deals round by <hi>twos</hi> till each perſon has got 10 cards. The remainder, if any, he muſt again lay on the pack. This done, each perſon ſorts his hand. The cards rank according to the rank in which the letters they reſpectively bear ſtand in the alphabet—Thus, an (a) is ſuperior to a (b), and to any ſubſequent letter of its own claſs. Capitals bear alike rank amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the loweſt capital is ſuperior to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſmall letter of its own colour—Therefore a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Z will win a ſmall (a) of the ſame colour; but it ſhould be obſerved that the red letters are always ſuperior to the black; ſo that a ſmall red (Z) will take a capital black (A). The red letters are to be conſidered as trumps. There is no other diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers in the letters, except this viz. that the capital red (W) (which ſhould be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by particular ornaments in honour of the name of WASHINGTON) is ſuperior to any other card or cards whatever; it may be played down at any time the poſſeſſor pleaſes, without regard to the lead, and always wins the trick in which it is played; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the <hi>ſpadil</hi> in quadril, or <hi>pam</hi> in <hi>lu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE cards being dealt, the eldeſt hand plays; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſmall black letter, the next, and all the reſt, muſt play a black letter alſo, but it may be either a ſmall or a capital letter. If the perſon to play
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:024407_0245_0FC7061809ECC580"/>
cannot follow the colour, he may trump, that s, play down any red letter he has got. When all have played, he wins the trick, who hath played the letter of the higheſt rank; the trick muſt then be gathered up and laid by itſelf, not mixing it with other tricks that may be won afterwards.</p>
                  <p>TO avoid confuſion and diſputes, it will be beſt for every perſon, when he plays, to lay his card down before him, and not throw the cards toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the middle of the table as at whiſt; in order that it may be certainly known what card each perſon hath played, and who hath won the trick.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt trick being gathered up, the winner leads, and the play goes on as before.</p>
                  <p>WHEN all the 10 cards in each hand have been played out, the eldeſt, if he hath been a winner, begins by ſpreading one of his tricks open on the table. If there ſhould be ſix players, each trick will conſiſt of ſix cards or letters; if ſeven, of ſeven, &amp;c. He is then, out of the letters of each trick, to compoſe as many well ſpelled Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh words as he can; but he muſt not uſe or mix the letters of one trick with thoſe of another, ſhould he have more than one: And for every word ſo compoſed he is to draw a ſtake or ſtakes from the pool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="unknown:024407_0246_0FC706199BF1B790"/>No word, however, muſt conſiſt of leſs than three letters, and the names of perſons and places are not to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>IN forming the words, no regard is to be had whether the letters are black orred, capital or ſmall —all the letters of a ſingle trick may be uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, except that if the party can make out a word with all red letters, he is to draw double ſtakes tor it. Laſtly, a ſtake is to be drawn for every ſyllable of which the word conſiſts—always drawing double for what is performed with red letters only.</p>
                  <p>AFTER a winner hath examined his trick, and drawn from the pool, or thrown it aſide as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording nothing, if any other player can diſcover a word in that trick which the winner did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the diſcoverer ſhall draw the ſtakes due for that word for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>THE tricks being all examined, the whole pack muſt be well ſhuffled, and the next in turn deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the game goes on as before. When the pool is exhauſted thoſe who have gained more than their firſt depoſit are the winners, and thoſe who are deficient are by ſo much loſers.</p>
                  <div type="observation">
                     <pb n="243" facs="unknown:024407_0247_0FC7061B0153DBE8"/>
                     <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                     <p>AS the cards are not all dealt out in one hand, no one can tell what letters will be againſt him in each round, he will, therefore, be cautious or bold, according to circumſtances, in riſking his beſt letters. As ſucceſs does not depend on the number of tricks won, but on the words ſuch tricks will furniſh, each player will be careful of his vowels, without which no word can be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of ſuch conſonants as experience ſhall ſhew to be moſt ſerviceable in the compoſition of words. If, therefore, he is likely to loſe the trick, he will throw down ſuch a letter as he ſhall judge, from a view of the cards played, may lead benefit the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but, if he thinks he ſhall make the trick his own, he will enrich it with a vowel, or ſome valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſonant, as far as the rules of the game ſhall permit.</p>
                     <p>THE letters having theſe powers aſſigned to them, according to their rank, colour, and ſize, will admit of great varieties and improvements in play; but as this game is chiefly intended for children, a too great intricacy is purpoſely avoided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="unknown:024407_0248_0FC7062351777750"/>N. B. The ſame letters in any one trick may be uſed again and again, provided they can be made to form different words. For example; ſuppoſe the letters of a trick ſhould be P, S, E, T, R, C, E,—they will compoſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, viz. <hi>ſet, pet, ſpecter</hi> and <hi>ſcepter;</hi> and would draw 8. ſtakes, or 16 if they ſhould be all red letters.</p>
                     <p>TWO perſons may play, if they agree before hand how many cards ſhall make a trick; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, 4 or 5; otherwiſe there would be but two letters to a trick, which would not do.</p>

                  <head>SOME ACCOUNT OF A NEWLY DISCOVERED AND MOST COMMODIOUS METHOD OF WRITING; WHEREBY AN AUTHOR OF LITTLE OR NO GENIUS WILL BE ENABLED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF WITH MECHANICAL PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIETY. INVENTED AND FIRST MADE KNOWN BY <hi>A. B.</hi> GENT.</head>
                  <p>GENIUS is the gift of heaven, and manifeſts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by emanations altogether unexpected and ſurpriſing. Its powers are not to be obtained by application and ſtudy, but they may be aſſiſted by <hi>art.</hi> When <hi>genius</hi> hath brought forth, <hi>art</hi> takes up and nurſes the child, and carefully conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its features, deduces rules for a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="unknown:024407_0250_0FC7062B69A0AD60"/>SUCH being the connection between <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>art,</hi> it is but reaſonable that a mutual intercourſe of good offices ſhould ſubſiſt between them. For my own part, I muſt confeſs that nature hath not been over bountiful to me in the article of genius; but I am deſirous of exerting the little ſhe hath given in behalf of thoſe who may have no more than myſelf. For this purpoſe I have deviſed a method of writing on any ſubject; in which not only the ſound may be an echo to the ſenſe, if any ſenſe there be, but the eye alſo ſhall be gratified with an exhibition of mechanical elegance and propriety; the only elegance perhaps to which ſuch writers can attain.</p>
                  <p>BY this ſcheme the conſtruction of a paragraph, the progreſs of a line, and even the diſpoſition of the words, may all contribute to enforce the idea intended.</p>
                  <p>IT would be a tedious talk to form a ſyſtem of rules for this new method of writing, or to give a deſcription at large of my uſeful device; one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will fully explain the whole, ſo as to enable an author of the meaneſt capacity to underſtand and profit by the deſign; and a little practice will make it familiar to him.</p>

                     <head>A SAMPLE OF GOOD WRITING.</head>
                     <p>AN author who wiſhes to height to the riſe of excellence of <hi>good writing,</hi> muſt condeſcend to call in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical propriety to his aid. He cannot be ſublime: all at once but gradually deſcending to the profound, ſhould as gradually riſe to elegance, frequently forming a ſerpentine line, in which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Hogarth, the beauty of all things conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>AND whether he writes in plain proſe;</p>

Or would in verſe his thoughts convey,</l>
                     <l>His rhyming talents to diſplay;</l>
                     <p>and the diction ſtrict propriety ſhould prevail, and the ſenſe run parallel to each other; pleaſing as well the eye as the ear.</p>
                     <p>SOME have a happy talent for expreſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they compenſate for the want of ſentiment by the enchanting melody of their ſtile. Their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ever flowing like the waves of the ſea, and their periods cloſing in ſuch muſical cadence, that the ear is faſcinated by the magic of ſound, and the mind lull'd in a pleaſing repoſe.</p>
                     <p>OTHERS, without giving to grammar rules of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſhall arrange ſo unſkilfully their words; breaking as it were, and interrupting the ſenſe (or rather nonſenſe) they mean to communicate, by frequent (and oft times unneceſſary) parentheſis, that the ear ſtumbles over their rugged paragraphs,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:024407_0253_0FC70635EF5D2EE0"/>
as the feet would ſtumble in ſcrambling through a ſtreet, when the pavement had been broken up; over ſtones bricks, and poſts, mixed together confuſedly.</p>
                     <p>THE mind of the reader is more fa—ti— gu—ed by travelling through a ſentence ſo conſtructed, than it would be in gliding through a whole page of harmonious phraſeology.</p>
                     <p>YOUR preciſe grammarians are moſt apt to write in this ſtile, thinking that they have well acquitted themſelves, if the ſtrict rules of ſyntax are in no inſtance violated. The labourer who mixes the mortar, and he who carries the hod, may as well pretend to ſkill in architecture, as theſe haberdaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of moods and tenſes may pretend to taſte and elegance in compoſition.</p>
                     <p>OTHERS there are who affect a ſingularity of ſtile above the vulgar. It is indubitable verity, that their
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:024407_0254_0FC7063763DB94A8"/>
phraſes are collated from the moſt approved au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and applied with the moſt becoming apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, even to the very point of preciſion in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; every period is poliſhed and rounded off as round aye, as round as a robin. Whilſt others ſcorn the <hi>ORNAMENTS</hi> of language, deal in demonſtration and write, and act ever on the ſquare.</p>
                     <p>BY the foregoing example it is evident, that not only an author's ſentiments may be more forcibly impreſſed on the mind, but the reader's memory will alſo be greatly aſſiſted, if happily any thing ſo written ſhould be worth remembering.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER advantage is, that ſuch performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may with great eaſe be reduced to a kind of

                  <argument>
                     <p>☞ AN act of aſſembly paſſed in April 1782, directing all the trees in the ſtreets of Philadelphia to be cut down and removed; the following publication appeared in oppoſition. THE law was never executed, and ſoon after repealed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>For the Pennſylvania Gazette.</head>
                  <p>LOOKING over a file of papers, which lay on my table, I found a very extraordinary ſpeech, delivered by a very extraordinary orator, in our houſe of aſſembly in April laſt, which I had taken down in ſhort hand, but not from the <hi>mouth</hi> of the ſpeaker. I much wonder that this oration, with the ſurpriſing circumſtances that attended it, have not been noticed in any of the public prints: I hope the following account of that tranſaction will not be thought unworthy of a place in the Pennſylvania Gazette.</p>
                  <p>ON the 12th of April laſt, the houſe took into conſideration, and debated by paragraphs, a bill entitled,
<q>An act for regulating party-walls and partition-fences, in the city of Philadelphia, &amp;c.</q>
when, to the amazement of all preſent, the buſineſs was interrupted by a voice, perfectly articulate, proceeding from the capital of one of the columns which ſupported the ceiling of the room.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="unknown:024407_0257_0FC706412D1A9D98"/>THIS voice claimed a right to be heard on the ſubject of the bill then before the houſe.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the firſt ſurpriſe at ſuch an unuſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy had a little ſubſided, the right of a column to interfere in the buſineſs of the houſe was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and objected to; and it was urged, that no inſtance had ever occured where a <hi>wooden mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>—a <hi>blockhead</hi>—had preſumed to ſpeak in that aſſembly: that this column could, by no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of law, be admitted as the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of any part or diſtrict of Pennſylvania, having never been ballotted for, elected, or returned as a member of aſſembly—That the houſe, when fully met, neceſſarily conſiſted of a certain number of members, <hi>and no more,</hi> and that this number is full and complete, by the returns from the ſeveral counties, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the records of the houſe: therefore, if this column ſhould be allowed a voice, there muſt be a ſupernumerary member ſomewhere, which would be an abſolute violation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. And laſtly, that it is contrary to the order of nature that an <hi>inanimate</hi> log ſhould interfere in the affairs of rational beings; providence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been pleaſed to diſtinguiſh ſo obviouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>men</hi> and <hi>things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO all this the column <hi>firmly</hi> replied—That he
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:024407_0258_0FC706443B5E16F0"/>
was, properly ſpeaking, a <hi>ſtanding member</hi> of that houſe, having been duly fixed in his ſtation by thoſe who had the right and power to place him there—That he was the true repreſentative of a numerous race, deſcended in a direct line from the aborigines of this country—thoſe venerable anceſtors who gave the name of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to this ſtate, and whoſe poſterity now inhabit eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry county in it—That he was not only a member of the houſe, but one of its principal <hi>ſupporters,</hi> in as much as they could never <hi>make a houſe</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him—That he had faithfully attended the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buſineſs, having never been fined as an abſentee —And that thoſe very members who now oppoſed him, had confided in his wiſdom and intregrity, by conſtantly appealing to him <note n="*" place="bottom">The rules of the houſe are framed and hung up againſt one of the columns.</note> in every conteſt about the rules and internal economy of the houſe. And, laſtly, that as the bill under conſideration ſo nearly concerned his fellow creatures; and as he found himſelf miraculouſly endowed with the power of ſpeech for this occaſion, he was determined to make uſe of it in behalf of thoſe who could not ſpeak for themſelves. After much debate, it was determined that the houſe would hear what this importunate poſt had to ſay reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:024407_0259_0FC7064757B84BD0"/>
the bill before them: but peremtorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to allow him a vote on this or any other buſineſs in that aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>THE columnar orator, having obtained leave, addreſſed the houſe in the following and words.</p>
                  <p>"I am happy, oh! fellow citizens that ſpeech hath been given me on this important occaſion: and that I have your permiſſion to exerciſe a power, thus wonderfully obtained, in the cauſe of truth and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>"I <hi>ſtand</hi> here this day an <hi>upright</hi> advocate for injured innocence. What fury—what madneſs— oh! deluded ſenators! hath induced you to propoſe the extirpation of thoſe to whom you are indebted for ſo many of the elegancies, comforts, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of life? If the voice of juſtice is not to be regarded within theſe walls, let your own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts influence your conduct on this occaſion. For I hope to ſhew that your ſafety and happineſs are much more deeply concerned, in the buſineſs you are upon, than you are at preſent aware of.</p>
                  <p>"By the 12th ſection of the bill now depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, it is propoſed to cut down and remove
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:024407_0260_0FC70648A90480E8"/>
all the trees ſtanding in the ſtreets, lanes, or alleys of this city—What! do we then hold our lives on ſuch an uncertain tenure?

I ſhall content myſelf with reading to your honours a paſſage to this purpoſe from that ingenious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Cyrano de Bergerac</hi>—Voyage to the Moon p. 91.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>—THIS fancy of eating by himſelf made me cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to know the reaſon of it. I was anſwered, that he choſe not to taſte either the odor of meats or of herbs,unleſs they had died ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: becauſe he imagined them beings capable of grief. I am not much ſurpriſed, replied I, that ſome orders of people here abſtain from fleſh and things that have ſenſitive life; yet it ſeems to me ridiculous to fear hurting a cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage in the cutting. For my part, replied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I muſt own there appears to me good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſuch an opinion. For is not a cabbage a being exiſting in nature as you are? Have you not both her equally for your mother? and ſhe is more immediately ſo to the vegetable than to the rational production. The generation of the latter ſhe hath left to the whim of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: a rigour ſhe doth not extend to the former, in as much as ſhe <hi>obliges</hi> one to produce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whilſt one man is ſcarcely able to get more than a ſcore of his ſpecies at beſt, a head of cabbage ſhall produce four or five hundred of
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:024407_0264_0FC706592B73D720"/>
its own ſort. Should we ſay that nature hath a greater eſteem for a man then ſhe has for a cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, it would be only with a view to make us laugh; for nature is in incapable of paſſion, and can neither love nor hate. If ſhe was ſuſceptible of love, ſhe certainly would have a greater ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for the inoffenſive cabbage, than for the unrelenting man who deſtroys it.</q>
And again p. 95.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>—Who has given us the knowledge of certain beings ſuperior to us, to whom we are neither related nor proportioned, and whoſe exiſtence we find it as difficult to conceive, as the manner in which a cabbage can addreſs itſelf to its own ſpecies? To underſtand which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication our ſenſes are too weak, remember, if you can, amongſt all the ſpecies of animals one more proud than the cabbage: who, while you deſtroy him, is above complaining; yet tho' he diſdains to murmur, he thinks, nevertheleſs, the more. If he wants ſuch organs as you are maſter of, formed for wailings and tears, yet he has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers where-with to implore heaven to revenge the injury done him, and expects it will not be with-held. It is not unlikely but you may aſk, how I know the cabbage has theſe fine thoughts? but inform me firſt, can you prove it has not? or that, at the cloſe of the night, the Ruſſia cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage

                  <p>"BUT ſtill, ſays man, we have <hi>rationality</hi> and <hi>riſibility</hi> to diſtinguiſh us from the reſt of the creation; that is, when nature gave one man the power to <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſhe gave another the power to <hi>laugh</hi> at him. For our parts, we confeſs, we never <hi>reaſon</hi>; we are ſatisfied with being directed by the laws of nature, which fully enable us to anſwer the end of our creation. We pretend not to be wiſer than the hand that made us, and therefore we are guilty of no follies or exceſſes. We employ none of our powers in deviſing means for the more ſpeedy and effectual deſtruction of our ſpecies: we do all the good we can; and when we can do no more, we retire from our preſent form of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to make room for our ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>"THIS <hi>rationality,</hi> on which you ſo much value yourſelves, is, in my opinion, a ſtriking mark of imbecility and diſgrace, a puniſhment inflicted on your race, doubtleſs, for ſome heinous offence heretofore committed.

without any reaſoning upon the problem. And in terreſtrial nature there is no creature but <hi>man</hi> that is obliged to <hi>reaſon.</hi> They all perform their reſpective functions with preciſion and certainty under the influence of a law that cannot err; whilſt your <hi>reaſon</hi> is ever involving you in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and abſurdities; is ever deducing falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from falſe premiſes; and the wiſer you think yourſelves the more miſchief you generally do: what is reaſon one day is not reaſon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. About thirty years ago you <hi>reaſoned</hi> upon the diſeaſe called the ſmall-pox; and thouſands in every city and country fell ſacrifices to your <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> ſyſtem. But you have now diſcovered that your ſyſtem is no longer <hi>rational,</hi> and have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a quite different mode of practice. Accident, not reaſon, diſcovered your error; and fact and nature contradicted the learned arguments of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a lengthy treatiſe on the ſubject: and this has been the caſe in every art and ſcience; the ſolid reaſonings of one age have been diſputed, found fallacious, and deſpiſed by another.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES this, your reaſon teaches you to ſquare all nature by your ideas of truth, and you know not what truth is: For inſtance, you eat, and drink, and walk, and you ſay I have <hi>life:</hi> but yonder willow can do none of theſe, therefore it is <hi>inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi>

Deluded man! Can your weak intellects diſcover all the nice gradations of <hi>life</hi>—from the ſtone to the moſs that grows upon it; from the moſs to the ſenſitive plant, ſo called; from the ſenſitive plant to the polypus; from the polypus to the oyſter; from the oyſter to the ape; from the ape to the man; from the man to the angel; from the angel to an infinite ſeries of beings whom you know nothing of? Do you not ſee that all the exhibitions in nature are but ſo many different modifications and manifeſtations of one original eſſence or principle?

the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſection of the bill before the houſe is intended to puniſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The preamble to this ſection ſets forth— Whereas trees growing in the public ſtreets, lanes, and alleys of the ſaid city of Philadelphia do obſtruct the proſpect and paſſage through the ſame, and alſo diſturb the water-courſes and foot-ways, by the extending and encreaſe of the roots thereof, and muſt tend to ſpread fires when any break out within the ſaid city: <hi>Be it therefore enacted,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"YOUR honours have an old ſaying, called a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which naturally occurs on this occaſion: <hi>It is eaſy to find a ſtick to beat a dog.</hi> That is, a man is never at a loſs for a reaſon for puniſhing thoſe who are in his power, and whom he wiſhes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. But theſe trees, it ſeems, obſtruct the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect—of what? of many wretched buildings and ſome dirty alleys. For I deny that any one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſtreet or building in this city is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by trees than is neceſſary to the comfort of the inhabitants, and to give beauty to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.

                  </p>
                  <p>"IT is ſaid, that theſe trees obſtruct the paſſage: but ſurely this charge is not ſupported by fact. They have modeſtly ported themſelves as cloſe to the gutters and water-courſes as they can, leaving both foot-way and cart-way free and open. If, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any ſtraggler ſhould be found ſo obſtructing the paſſage, let him die the death—I have nothing to ſay in his behalf: but it is farther urged, that the aforeſaid trees diſturb and diſorder the water-courſes and foot-ways by the extenſion of their roots—if ſo, cut off the offending roots, but do not deſtroy the whole tree. When juſtice exceeds her limits, ſhe forfeits her name. Laſtly, trees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate fire—Now, a tree hath no greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in nature than fire: cut him into inch pieces, grind him into duſt, it will ſtill exiſt <hi>as wood</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, many years. Fire alone can ſuddenly ſeparate its component parts, and deſtroy its name. How then can it be apprehended that we ſhould unite

with our moſt inveterate foe for the deſtruction of the city, or join in the miſchievous purpoſes of a <hi>common incendiary,</hi> whoſe power we have moſt reaſon to dread?</p>
                  <p>"BESIDES the charges laid in the bill, two others have been ſuggeſted againſt theſe devoted trees, viz. that they obſtruct the operation of the engines in caſe of fire; and that they are not well affected to the preſent government, becauſe they remained with the enemy when they had poſſeſſion of the city.</p>
                  <p>"AS to the firſt, little need be ſaid in anſwer. When the caſe occurs, let the obſtacle be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. It is as eaſy to procure an ax as an act of aſſembly; and the removal may be eaſily and ſpeedily accompliſhed. But to depopulate a whole city, for the poſſible offence of a few individuals, is ſurely neither law nor reaſon.</p>
                  <p>"IN reply to the ſecond charge, I would aſk, Will any one pretend to ſay, that the leaving or not leaving the city on the approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marks the true line of diſtinction between <hi>whig</hi> and <hi>tory</hi>?

Where are now thoſe venerable oaks, that o'er the evening walk of ſober citizen, of muſing bard, of ſportive youths, and ſighing nymphs and ſwains, were wont to ſpread their hoſpitable ſhade? Alas! nought now remains but lifeleſs ſtumps that moulder in the ſummer's heat and winter's froſt—the habitations fit of poiſonous funge, toads, and ever gnawing Worms. <hi>Hinc illae Lachrymae!</hi> Theſe were thy feats, oh, <hi>Howe!</hi> Excuſe, great Sirs, this <hi>weakneſs</hi> in a <hi>poſt,</hi> or rather join your ſympathetic tears with mine—the loſs is yours—a loſs, the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which you have not, perhaps, duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; which I ſhall now endeavour to preſent to your attention.</p>

No ſooner have the poiſonous atoms acquired ſufficient malignity, but they leave their native cells and float in air. One of theſe inhaled, infects the blood; and ſoon a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſon, or father falls.

                  <head>DESCRIPTION OF A MACHINE FOR MEASURING A <hi>SHIP's WAY</hi> THROUGH THE SEA.</head>
                  <p>THE errors and uncertainties incident to the mariner's log, are too obvious not to be univerſally acknowledged. Were it not for the obſervations navigators are accuſtomed to make of a ſhip's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by the apparent paſſage of the water along ſide, and the ſigns that uſually preſent on approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the land, the log alone would be a very unſafe dependence.</p>
                  <p>SEVERAL attempts have therefore been made to improve the log, and render its indications more accurate, but without ſucceſs. All the machines of this kind, that I have heard of, were compoſed of a number of wheels, which were to be put in motion by the twiſting of a line let out aſtern, having a drag at the end, ſo conſtructed, as to whirl round, faſter or ſlower, according to the progreſſive motion of the ſhip.</p>
                  <p>THE objections to a machine ſo conſtructed are; <hi>firſt,</hi> if the line is not very long, the drag will be
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:024407_0279_0FC7068C51631878"/>
conſiderably affected by the ſhip's wake; and if it is very long, the twiſtings will be irregular, and the line liable to kink. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the drag is ſo heavy as to ſink below the bottoms of the waves, when the ſhip ſails faſt, it will be too heavy, and ſink too deep, when ſhe is under little way: or otherwiſe, if the drag is of a proper weight when the ſhip is under little way, it will ſkip from wave to wave when ſhe ſails with a briſk gale, and ſo be of no uſe. And, <hi>thirdly,</hi> it will be liable to moſt of the other irregularities to which the log in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe is expoſed.</p>
                  <p>THE machine now propoſed, will, it is hoped, be free from at leaſt ſome of theſe objections. And although it may not be able to aſcertain a ſhip's way through the ſea to perfect preciſion, yet if it ſhould be found to anſwer the purpoſe better; than any inſtrument hitherto contrived, it may be admitted as an acquiſition to the art of navigation.</p>
                  <p>THIS machine, in its moſt ſimple form, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by fig. 1.—AB is a ſtrong rod of iron, moveable on the joint or fulcrum; CD is a thin circular plate of braſs, rivetted to the lower extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the rod; E an horizontal arm, connected at one end with the top of the rod AB by a moveable joint F, and at the other end with the
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:024407_0280_0FC7068F1E496B00"/>
bottom of the index H by a like moveable joint; GH is the index turning on its centre I, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling over the graduated arch K; and L is a ſtrong ſpring, bearing againſt the rod AB, and conſtantly counteracting the preſſure upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late D. The rod AB ſhould be applied cloſe to one ſide of the cut-water or ſtem, and ſhould be of ſuch a length that the palate D may be no higher above the keel than is neceſſary to ſecure it from injury when the veſſel ſails in ſhoal water, or is aground. As the bow of the ſhip curves inward toward the keel M, the palate D will be thrown to a diſtance from the bottom of the ſhip, although the perpendicular rod to which it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetted lies cloſe to the bow above, and therefore it will be more fairly acted upon. The arm E ſhould enter the bow ſomewhere near the hawſer-hole, and lead to any convenient place in the forecaſtle, where a ſmooth board or plate may be fixed, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the index H, and the graduated arch K, upon it.</p>
                  <p>IT is evident from the figure, that as the ſhip is urged forward by the wind, the palate D will be preſſed againſt the water with a greater or leſs force, according to the progreſſive motion of the ſhip; and this will operate upon the levers, ſo as to immediately affect the index; making the leaſt encreaſe or diminution of the ſhip's way viſible
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:024407_0281_0FC7069A9326D8E8"/>
on the graduated arch. The ſpring L always counteracting the preſſure upon the palate, and bringing back the index on any relaxation of the force impreſſed.</p>
                  <p>A ſhip going through the ſea opens a paſſage for herſelf, making a hole in the water equal to her imerged bulk. As ſhe paſſes on, this vacancy is filled up by the tumbling in of the water from each ſide, and at the ſtern with great violence; ſo that there is a ſtrong current of water from her bow to her ſtern, paſſing under the bottom and at the ſides of the ſhip; and the force of this current is in direct proportion to the velocity of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion. This machine is therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly placed at the bow of the ſhip, where the current firſt begins, and acts fairly on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, in preference to the ſtern, where the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous cloſing of the waters cauſes a wake viſible to a great diſtance. The palate D is ſunk nearly as low as the keel, that it may not be affected by the heaping up of the water, and the daſhing of the waves at or near the water-line. The arch K is to aſcertain how many knots or miles ſhe would run in one hour, at her then rate of ſailing: but the graduations on this arch muſt not be equal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reſiſtance of the ſpring L will encreaſe as it becomes more bent; ſo that the index will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:024407_0282_0FC7069DA0820968"/>
over a greater ſpace, from one to five miles, (which I ſuppoſe to be a medium) than from five to twelve. Laſtly, the palate, rod, ſpring, and all the metallic parts of the inſtrument ſhould be covered with a ſtrong varniſh to prevent ruſt from the corroſive quality of ſalt-water and ſea-air.</p>
                  <div type="improvement">
                     <head>IMPROVEMENT OF THIS MACHINE.</head>
                     <p>LET the rod or ſpear AB, fig. 1. be a round rod of iron or ſteel; and inſtead of moving on the fulcrum or joint, as at C, let it paſs through and turn freely in a ſocket, to which ſocket the moveable joint muſt be annexed, as repreſented in fig. 2. The rod muſt have a ſhoulder to reſt on the upper edge of the ſocket and prevent it from ſlipping down. The rod muſt alſo paſs through a like ſocket at F, fig. 1. The joint of the lower ſocket muſt be fixed to the bow of the ſhip, and the upper ſocket muſt be connected with the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal arm E. On the top of the uppermoſt ſocket let there be a ſmall circular plate, bearing the 32 points of the mariner's compaſs, and let the top of the rod AB come through the center of this plate, ſo as to carry a ſmall index upon it, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in fig. 3. This ſmall index muſt be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the top of the rod on a ſquare: ſo that by
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:024407_0283_0FC706A039730800"/>
turning the index round the plate, the rod may alſo turn in the ſockets, and of courſe carry the plate D round with it, the little index always pointing in the direction of the face of the palate. The ſmall compaſs-plate ſhould not be faſtened to the top of the ſocket, but only fitted tight on, that it may be moved at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>SUPPOSE then, the intended port to bear ſouth-weſt from the place of departure, the plate muſt be turned on the ſocket till the ſouth weſt point thereon points directly to the ſhip's bow, ſo that the S. W. and N. E. line on the compaſs-plate maybe preciſely parallel with the ſhip's keel: and in this poſition the plate muſt remain during the voyage. Suppoſe then the ſhip to be ſailing in the direct courſe of her intended voyage, with her bow ſprit pointing S. W. let the little index be brought to the S. W. point on the compaſs-plate, and the palate D will neceſſarily preſent its broad face towards the port of deſtination: and this it muſt always be made to do, be the ſhip's ſailing courſe what it may. If, on account of unfavourable winds, the ſhip is obliged to deviate from her intended courſe, the little index muſt be moved ſo many points from the S. W. line of the compaſs-plate, as the compaſs in the binnacle ſhall ſhew that ſhe deviates from her true courſe. So that, in whatever direction the
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:024407_0284_0FC706A1269F2D30"/>
ſhip ſhall ſail, the palate D will always look full to the S. W. point of the horizon, or towards the port of deſtination; and, conſequently will preſent only an oblique ſurface to the reſiſting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium—more or leſs oblique as the ſhip deviates more or leſs from the true courſe of her voyage. As, therefore, the reſiſtance of the water will ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate leſs upon the palate in an oblique than in a direct poſition, in proportion to its obliquity, the index H will not ſhew how many knots the veſſel runs in her then courſe; but will (it is expected) indicate only how many ſhe gains in the direct line of her intended voyage. Thus, in fig. 5. if the ſhip's true line of her intended courſe is AB, but ſhe can ſail by the wind no nearer than AC: ſuppoſe then her progreſſive motion ſuch as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form AC, equal to 5 knots, yet on account of the obliquity of the palate D, the index H will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point to 4 on the graduated arch, ſhewing that ſhe gains no more on the true line of her voyage, viz. from A to B. Thus will the difference between her real motion and that pointed out by the index, be always in proportion to her devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the port of deſtination, until ſhe ſails in a line at right angles therewith, as AD; in which caſe the palate would preſent only a thin ſharp edge to the reſiſting medium, the preſſure of which ſhould not be ſufficient to overcome the bearing
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:024407_0285_0FC706A2B47BC2B0"/>
of the ſpring L, and the friction of the machine. So that at whatever rate the ſhip may ſail upon that line, the index will not be affected, but point to O, ſhewing that ſhe gains nothing on her true courſe. For in this caſe, and alſo when the veſſel is not under way, the action of the ſpring L ſhould cauſe the index to point to O; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the dotted lines in fig. 1. and 4.</p>
                     <p>AS the truth of this inſtrument muſt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the equal preſſure of the water againſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late D according to the ſhip's velocity, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable action of the ſpring L, there ſhould be a pin or ſcrew at the joints C and F, ſo that the rod may be readily unſhipped and taken in, in order to clean the palate from any foulneſs it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which would greatly encreaſe its operation on the index H, and thereby render the graduated arch falſe or uncertain.</p>
                     <p>FURTHER, the ſpring L may be expoſed too much to injury from the weather and ſalt-water if fixed on the outſide of the ſhip's bow. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this, it may be brought under cover by conſtructing the machine as repreſented by fig. 4: where AB is the rod, C the fulcrum or centre of its motion, D the palate, E the horizontal arm leading through a ſmall hole into the forecaſtle, M
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:024407_0286_0FC706A4461DDB60"/>
is a ſtrong chain, faſtened by one end to the arm E, and by the other to a rim or barrel on the wheel G, which by means of its teeth gives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſemicircle I and index H. The ſpring L is ſpiral, and encloſed in a box like the main ſpring of a watch: A ſmall chain is fixed to, and paſſing round the barrel, is faſtened by the other end to the fuzee W; this fuzee is connected by its teeth with the wheel G, and counteracts the motion of the palate D; NN are the two ſockets through which the rod AB paſſes, and in which it may be turned round by means of the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex R; S is the ſmall compaſs-plate moveable on the top of the upper ſocket N. The plate S hath an upright rim round its edge, cut into teeth or notches, ſo that when the index R is a little raiſed up, in order to bring it round to any point, it may fall into one of theſe notches and be detained there: otherwiſe the preſſure of the water will force the palate D from its oblique poſition, and turn the rod and index round to the direction in which the ſhip ſhall be then ſailing.</p>
                     <p>SHOULD it be apprehended that the palate D being placed ſo far forward, may affect the ſhip's ſteerage, or obſtruct her ſailing, it ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that a very ſmall plate will be ſufficient to work the machine. I ſhould ſuppoſe that one of
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:024407_0287_0FC706AD242A83B0"/>
three or four inches diameter, or leſs, might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>THE greateſt difficulty, perhaps, will be in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duating the arch K (if the machine is conſtructed as in fig 1.) the unequal diviſions of which can only be aſcertained by actual experiment on board of each ſhip reſpectively; in as much as the truth of theſe graduations will depend on three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, viz. The poſition of the fulcrum C, with reſpect to the length of the rod, the ſize of the palate D, and the ſtrength of the ſpring L. When theſe graduations, however, are once aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any one veſſel, they will not require any future alteration, provided the palate D be kept clean, and the ſpring L retains its elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>BUT the unequal diviſions of the graduated arch will be unneceſſary if the inſtrument be made as at fig. 4. For as the chain goes round the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel L, and then winds through the ſpiral channel of the fuzee W, the force of the encloſed ſpring will operate equally, or nearly ſo, in all poſitions of the index, and conſequently the diviſions on the arch K may in ſuch caſe be equal.</p>
                     <p>AFTER all, it is not expected that a ſhip's lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude may be certainly determined by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:024407_0288_0FC706AE4ADF66C8"/>
The irregular motions and impulſes to which a ſhip is continually expoſed, make ſuch an accuracy unattainable by any machinery; but if it ſhould be found, as I flatter myſelf it will, on fair experiment, that it anſwers the purpoſe much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the common log, it may be conſidered as an acquiſition to navigation.</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould be obſerved that in aſcertaining a ſhip's longitude by a time piece, this great inconvenience occurs, that a ſmall and trifling mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the time will make a very great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous error in the diſtance, run, or longitude; whereas the errors of this inſtrument will operate no further than their real amount, which can never be great or dangerous, if corrected by the uſual obſervations made by mariners for correcting the common log.<note n="*" place="bottom">An ingenious mechanic would probably conſtruct this machine to better advantage in many reſpects. The author only meant to ſuggeſt the principle, experiment alone can point out the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of applying it. He is ſenſible of at leaſt one defect, viz. that the little index R, fig. 4. will not be ſtrong enough to retain the palate D in an oblique poſition when a ſhip is ſailing by the wind; more eſpecially as the compaſs-plate S, in whoſe notched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>AN IMPROVED METHOD OF QUILLING A <hi>HARPSICHORD.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE ſtrings of a Harpſichord are made to vibrate by the impulſe of ſmall pieces of a crow-quill: theſe, from the manner in which they are applied, are compelled to perform their office to ſuch diſadvantage that many become weak and fail, with little uſe, and what is called <hi>the touch</hi> of the inſtrument, becomes thereby unequal and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable both to the performer and hearer; unleſs frequently repaired, which is one of the moſt troubleſome and difficult operations in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtrument in order.</p>
                  <p>I attempted, two or three years ago, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this imperfection. My firſt idea was to encreaſe the length of quill, that it might act more like a ſpring than it can do in the way
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:024407_0292_0FC706C56AE717E0"/>
it is now applied. I effected my purpoſe, by mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quill in the manner repreſented by fig. 1. By this means the ſpring of the quill was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly encreaſed without its horizontal length, which from the conſtruction of the inſtrument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more than about 1-4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of a inch. AB fig. 1. is the tongue of the jack in profile, C is the quill fixed tight in a hole punched ſlanting downwards through the tongue according to the dotted line. The quill is then bent upwards and made to paſs through an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hole D, punched through the upper part of the tongue, and then proceeds horizontally the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary length. This laſt hole is made large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the quill to have free play in it, ſo that the ſpring of the quill may be in the curve CD; which will not break or fail by any ſervice it has to perform.</p>
                  <p>THIS contrivance ſeemed to anſwer very well; but it was objected, that the quill being thus forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bent, was apt to ſpring back, in ſome inſtances, ſo that not only the point of the quill became too ſhort to reach the ſtring it ſhould ſtrike, but the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved part would interfere with the ſtring next behind it. And although, in the experiment, this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience rarely occured, and was rather a fault in
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:024407_0293_0FC706C604A6A0C8"/>
the execution than in the deſign, yet the project was not adopted becauſe of the uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>MY next device was to throw aſide the quills altogether; and taking hard and well ſeaſoned ſoal leather, I cut therefrom the intended <hi>tongues</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">What is commonly called the tongue, I ſhall now call <hi>the palate,</hi> and my ſubſtitute for the crow-quill I ſhall denominate the tongue.</note> which I mounted on ſprings as in fig. 2. Where A is the palate ſeen in profile, having a mortoiſe cut through it for the reception of the leathern tongue B, which is moveable in the mortoiſe on a ſmall pin; C is aback view of the ſame palate, ſhowing the zig-zag ſpring by which the tongue is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The ſpring is of fine wire, and is faſtened by one end to the root of the tongue, as at D, and by the other to a ſmall ſtaple at E.</p>
                  <p>THIS contrivance produced in effect an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fulneſs of tone, and promiſed permanency, becauſe the elaſticity required is not in the tongue which gives the ſtroke, but in the wire ſpring, which, if properly annealed will not be likely to fail.</p>
                  <p>THE objection was, that the touch was not ſo lively and agreeable as that of the common quill;
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:024407_0294_0FC706C7861E40F0"/>
but principally that the machinery was too complex and delicate for general uſe.</p>
                  <p>BOTH theſe methods are fully deſcribed in the ſecond volume of the tranſactions of the American philoſophical ſociety of Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>ENCOURAGED by at leaſt a partial ſucceſs, I again endeavoured to attain the object I had in view, and flatter myſelf that I have now fully ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>THE deſideratum is, a ſubſtance to ſupply the place of the crow-quill, ſufficiently elaſtic for the purpoſe, which ſhall afford an eaſy and brilliant touch, ſhall draw a full and pure tone from the ſtring, be applied with as much ſimplicity as the common quill, and be permanent in itſelf.</p>
                  <p>AFTER fair experiment and long trial, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing method of <hi>tongueing</hi> a harpſichord hath been found to anſwer all the above requiſites.</p>
                  <p>I took what is <hi>called velvet-cork,</hi> of the beſt kind, free from dolts, cracks or blemiſhes. I cut this cork into plates, about one quarter of an inch thick, and glued upon them thin and well poliſhed leather; from theſe plates I cut the tongues, and

preſſed them tight into mortoiſes cut for the purpoſe through the palates, in the ſame manner, and with the ſame eaſe that the common quill is fixed in the little hole punched for its reception. The cork muſt then be ſhaved off underneath, ſlanting from the point, where it muſt be very thin, to the face of the palate, and then nibbed like a pen to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per length. The touch may afterwards be nicely regulated by ſhaving away more of the cork from underneath, if requiſite, with a ſharp pen-knife or a fine file.</p>

                     <head>REMARKS.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. THE <hi>cork</hi> (as before obſerved) muſt be of the kind called <hi>velvet-cork,</hi> of an elaſtic ſubſtance, and free from imperfections of every kind.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. THE <hi>Leather</hi> ſhould be thin, well ſtretched, and of a poliſhed ſurface—That which I uſed was ſtripped from the cover of a bound book, which anſwered very well, after I had ſcraped and well waſhed its under ſurface.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. THE <hi>paſte or glue.</hi> In my firſt experiment I made common glue pretty thin, and with this I glued the leather on the cork; but found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that in very dry and froſty weather, the
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:024407_0296_0FC702C7AC9A7500"/>
touch became harſh and diſagreeable, becauſe glue in ſuch weather becomes as hard as horn. I then diſſolved a little Iſinglaſs, or fiſh glue, in hot water, and with the addition of ſome flour I made a moderately thin paſte; and with this I paſted the leather upon the cork, putting the plates under a preſs till dry: and I found it to anſwer well.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. IN cutting the tongues from theſe plates of cork faced with leather, care muſt be taken that the grain of the cork ſhall run lengthwiſe from end to end, and not a croſs the tongue. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is plain.</p>
                     <p>I have found theſe tongues to anſwer every requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. The cork is ſufficiently elaſtic for the ſervice it is to perform, and affords a lively and pleaſant touch. The poliſhed leather preſents a moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſurface of contact with the metal ſtring, and ſhields the cork, which would be ſoon cut through by the ſtring. The tone produced is full, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pure, being perfectly free from that <hi>clicking</hi> noiſe which the ſtrokes of a quill unavoidably produce, and which has been juſtly complained of in the beſt harpſichords. And laſtly, the tongue thus made will be durable, I may judge if from the experience of eighteen months and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily uſe, very few having failed in that

                  <head>DESCRIPTION OF A CANDLE-CASE.</head>
                  <p>THE deſign of this machine is to ſcreen the flame of a candle from being flaired by the wind in ſummer, or drawn by the current of air to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the chimney in winter.</p>
                  <p>THE flame of a candle is at all times much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the air. Every perſon muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in reading or writing by candle light, that the light will ſometimes acquire a rapid, vibratory motion, which occaſions the letters on the book or paper to appear and diſappear in quick ſucceſſion. This twinkling is ſo painful to the eye, that the perſon is frequently obliged to look from the book or paper for a moment, or to ſtroke his eyes with his hand. The ſenſation is very diſagreeable; and no wonder, when it is conſidered, that the iris of the eye contracts and dilates in correſpondence with every moti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the flame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="unknown:024407_0299_0FC702D46D297E30"/>THE machine I have contrived will ſhield the flame from the undulations of the air, and cauſe it to burn with a ſteady and uniform light, Fig. 1. repreſents this machine faſtened by ſcrews to a common candleſtick. A, the candleſtick; B B, two ſemicircular plates of braſs which embrace the top of the candleſtick; theſe are furniſhed with cheeks on each ſide, which are drawn cloſe together by means of the ſcrews,C C; and thereby the machine is firmly fixed to the candleſtick, and may be removed at pleaſure by taking out the ſcrews. (See the ſemicircular plates repreſented ſeparate at fig. 2.) One of theſe plates has an arm, D, connected with a crotchet E E. In the two ends of this crotchet there are ſquare holes, for the reception of the long ſquare wire F. This ſquare wire ſlips eaſily up and down through the ſquare holes; and that it may ſtand ſupported in all poſitions, and ſlide with an uniform friction, there is a ſmall piece of watch-ſpring, G, rivetted to the middle of the crotchet, and preſſing with its two ends againſt the ſquare wire. H is an arm fixed to the long wire, bearing a ſmall ring, I; this ring is a little larger than a common candle, and its uſe is to keep the candle upright, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its falling againſt the glaſs, hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if it ſhould be too looſe in the ſocket, or not ſet perpendicular in the candleſtick. K is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:024407_0300_0FC702DE6C6BDB50"/>
arm fixed on the top of the long wire, and carrying another ring, L, larger than the one juſt mentioned. This ring is for the reception and ſupport of the glaſs, M, which ſurrounds the flame of the candle, and cauſes it to burn with a ſteady light. The glaſs, M, is one of thoſe uſed for the new patent lamps: it is a tube, open at both ends, of 2 ½ inches diameter, and about 4 inches long, and has a rim round the top, by which it hangs on the ring, L. As the candle waſtes, the glaſs muſt be ſlipped down by means of the knob, N; or if it ſhould require to be ſnuffed, the glaſs may be raiſed or lowered ſo as to expoſe the wick for the purpoſe. Fig. 3 repreſents the machine detached from the candleſtick, and without the glaſs. The ſame letters of reference are put to the correſponding parts with fig. 1.</p>

                     <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                     <p>THIS contrivance fully anſwered the purpoſe intended, of keeping the flame ſteady and the light uniform; but an inconvenience occurred which was not expected. It occaſioned the candle to <hi>gutter;</hi> that is, the melted wax or tallow would collect in an undue quantity round the bottom of the wick, and run down the ſides of the candle. This was not owing to the heat of the glaſs, as I
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:024407_0301_0FC702DFAFCFF1C8"/>
at firſt imagined; for a ſtrong current of air occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the flame, kept the glaſs ſo cool, that pieces of wax or tallow would adhere to it without melting, and the glaſs might be handled without inconvenience. I know not the reaſon of this, unleſs it be, that the inner circular ſurface of the glaſs concenters the heat to a focus in that place by reflection, or that the current of air bears up the flame, ſo that it does not conſume the wax as faſt as it melted. It was obſervable that the flame was conſiderably elongated, and that it did not follow the waſte of the wax as cloſe as common, but left an unuſual portion of wick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the melted wax.</p>

                  <head>FULL AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF A TERRIBLE UPROAR WHICH LATELY HAPPENED IN A VERY EMINENT FAMILY.</head>
                  <p>IT is not long ſince the lady <hi>Pennſylva,</hi> a perſon of high diſtinction, and much eſteemed for her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wealth, and importance, was, to the ſurpriſe of every one, delivered of fine boy. She was dotingly fond of this infant; and the more ſo as the tongue of ſlander had endeavoured to caſt infamy on her and the child, by plainly calling her a whore and the boy a baſtard. But it was well known to her intimate acquaintance that ſhe had been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately married to <hi>Patriotiſm,</hi> a very worthy and honourable gentleman, who was indeed the father of the child. But <hi>Patriotiſm</hi> unfortunately died ſoon after the lady <hi>Pennſylva</hi> was brought-to-bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="unknown:024407_0304_0FC702F344FE6970"/>THE untimely death of the father greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared the ſon to the diſconſolate widow; and more eſpecially, as the boy bore a ſtriking likeneſs of her loſt huſband.</p>
                  <p>SHE called him <hi>Independence;</hi> ſhe nurſed him with care and attention, and endeavoured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch ſervants in her family as would feed and tend him, rather from motives of real affection than from mercenary views. But ſuch diſintereſted perſons were not eaſily found. Jealouſies had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken place. Some envied others for their ſtations and wages, and hatred and contempt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the family, till at laſt the jarring views and intereſts of the ſervants broke out into an open rupture—The caſe was this—</p>
                  <p>THE lady <hi>Pennſylva</hi> had hired a wet-nurſe for her child—her name was <hi>Reedina</hi>—and no one doubted but that ſhe had a ſincere affection for the baby. Nevertheleſs, ſhe had but an uneaſy time of it. Having not the beſt temper in the world, ſhe not only had many quarrels of her own upon hand, but ſhe took part alſo in thoſe of the other ſervants; in which ſhe did not exerciſe upon <hi>all</hi> occaſions an impartiality becoming the ſtation ſhe filled in the family. In ſhort, ſhe ſuffered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be influenced by thoſe who were not her
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:024407_0305_0FC702F6EB506CB8"/>
equals in abilities; and who made uſe of her power and influence to gratify their own ambitious views.</p>
                  <p>IN due courſe of time, <hi>Reedina's</hi> milk dried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,<note n="*" place="bottom">By the conſtitution of Pennſylvania, a new preſident muſt be elected every three years.</note> and it became neceſſary to get another nurſe for the infant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>REEDINA,</hi> though neceſſarily removed from her ſtation, was not willing to reſign her ſway in the family; but wiſhing to have it ſtill in her power to ſhew favour to thoſe whoſe party ſhe had eſpouſed, and to puniſh thoſe who had been too free in their ſtrictures on her conduct, ſhe found out one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Potterini,</hi> and ſtrongly recommended her as a fit perſon to ſupply her place.</p>
                  <p>MADAM <hi>Potterini</hi> was a very good ſort of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and truly attached to young <hi>Independence;</hi> but then ſhe was altogether unſkilful in the affairs of a nurſery. She knew not how to dreſs the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with propriety; and in caſe of teething, lax, belly-ach, or other diſorders incident to the tender ſtate of infancy, ſhe was ignorant of the treatment proper on ſuch occaſions; having never had the opportunity of acquiring that kind of knowledge.
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:024407_0306_0FC702FACFC87760"/>
                     <hi>Reedina,</hi> nevertheleſs, recommended her in the ſtrongeſt terms as a ſuitable nurſe for the child, and got all thoſe ſervants who were in her intereſt to join in the recommendation; not that ſhe thought madam <hi>Potterini</hi> equal to the taſk, for ſhe well knew to the contrary: but expected that <hi>Potteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's</hi> ignorance in the buſineſs of a nurſery would render her dependent upon her for advice in all things, ſo that ſhe in fact might govern the family as heretofore, although out of place.</p>
                  <p>THOSE who hated <hi>Reedina,</hi> ſaw through this deſign, and oppoſed a Mrs. <hi>Richardſon</hi> to madam <hi>Potterini,</hi> as a perſon better qualified to do honour to the ſtation.</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner was this rivalſhip known, but <hi>Reedina's</hi> party became outrageous—every thing that calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could invent, or malice inſinuate, was poured forth againſt Mrs. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and high panegyrics wrought up in favour of madam <hi>Potterini.</hi> Theſe were all anſwered with equal malignity by the partizans of the other ſide againſt <hi>Reedina</hi> and her adherents. Nothing but railing and reviling was heard in the houſe—abuſe was anſwered by abuſe, and ſlander ballanced by ſlander.</p>
                  <p>AT length the good lady <hi>Pennſylva,</hi> hoping to
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:024407_0307_0FC702FE5CA24AB0"/>
put an end to theſe diſgraceful altercations, made her election, and committed the care of her ſon, and the ſuperintendency of her family to Mrs. <hi>Richardſon.</hi> But this determination had not the deſired effect: ſcolding, lying, and abuſe were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to greater heights than ever; the ſervants were all formed into parties, and the peace of the family was entirely broken up.</p>
                  <p>NOW the principal partizans had arranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the following order:</p>
                  <p>ON one ſide, was Mrs. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> the wet nurſe: to her adhered <hi>Kitty Oſwald,</hi> one of the chamber-maids; miſs <hi>Jackſon,</hi> the ſeemſtreſs; <hi>Peggy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> the cook; her brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> the clerk; <hi>Tom Fallon,</hi> the ſcullion, with many others.</p>
                  <p>ON the ſide of the malecontents, appeared <hi>Ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> the late nurſe; <hi>Thomas,</hi> the chief ſteward; <hi>George,</hi> the under ſteward; <hi>Fanny Belly,</hi> the ſecond chamber-maid; cock-eyed <hi>Moll</hi> and <hi>Doll Frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> her underſtrappers; together with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> the late coachman; <hi>Wilkins,</hi> the footman; <hi>Henry,</hi> the lick-ſpit, and ſeveral more.</p>
                  <p>THESE perſons, however, oppoſed to each other, equally profeſſed a warm attachment to
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:024407_0308_0FC702FF36417720"/>
young <hi>Independence,</hi> and to the intereſts of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but neither ſide would allow that the other had any ſincerity in theſe profeſſions. They mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually charged each other with diſaffection, and terms of obloquy and reproach were dealt about without the leaſt regard to common decency.</p>
                  <p>THEIR diſputes and animoſities were at length wrought up to ſuch a pitch of rancour and inveteracy as to break out in actual warfare:— but all things in order—Before a poor mortal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes a taſk ſo arduous, he ſhould, out of decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and in compliance to ancient cuſtom, invoke ſupernatural help: and, if he ſhould have creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to believe that aſſiſtance hath been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even fancy that he feels himſelf inſpired, there is no doubt but he will perform his taſk with a vigour and ſpirit proportionable to the ſtrength of his faith.</p>
                  <p>COME then, thou heavenly muſe! who haſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in deſcribing the bloody frays of wrangling mortals, from the famous ſiege of Troy in ancient times, to the more famous ſiege of York-town in Virginia, of recent date! Or, if there ſhould be two of your divinityſhips, one more ſkilled in the mortal conteſts of the field, and the other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verſed in private broils and warfare of the fiſt

and tongue—even thou, who heretofore didſt guide the pen of <hi>Butler,</hi> when he ſang the frays of <hi>Hudibras,</hi> with rabble rout—thou, who didſt thy aid afford when <hi>Fielding,</hi> in exalted proſe, deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the valorous feats of <hi>Molly Seagrim,</hi> in the field of death, or Mrs. <hi>Partridge,</hi> in domeſtic ſtrife—refuſe me not thy help! but teach me how to ſcold!—Alas! my invocation is in vain—the goddeſs hears me not—I muſt therefore try what mere mortal ſtrength can do; and with no other help or inſpiration, but what <hi>Kitty Oſwald</hi> and <hi>Fanny Belly</hi> can afford, muſt venture to proceed.</p>
                  <p>IT was on a Friday morning—a day of the week branded with ill fortune from the earlieſt times; the lady <hi>Pennſylva</hi> had gone abroad on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or other. <hi>Kitty</hi> and <hi>Fanny,</hi> the two chamber-maids, were about their ordinary occupation, when <hi>Kitty's</hi> bruſh, in ſweeping the room, happened to ſtrike againſt <hi>Fanny's</hi> heel, as ſhe was making up the bed: whereupon the following dialogue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>

                  <p>THERE is ſuch an intimate ſympathy between the tongue and the hands, that when the former is in full exerciſe, the latter cannot long remain inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: for words like trumpets are but preludes to battle. <hi>Fanny</hi> replied only by ſpitting full in <hi>Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>'s face: and ſo to fiſty-cuffs they went without further ceremony, and with as keen an appetite as ever Dr. ***** ſat down to a turtle feaſt.</p>
                  <p>AS a dog, which hath not only a natural hatred,
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:024407_0313_0FC7030F32A0F7D0"/>
but a contempt for the cat, (who, though the weaker animal, excels in cunning and malice,) ſhould puſs preſume to lift her paw againſt him, ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and ſhakes her until his mouth is filled with hair, the ſpoils of the enemy: juſt ſo the enraged <hi>Kitty</hi> fell furiouſly upon poor miſs <hi>Belly,</hi> and tore from her head, not only her gauze cap, but a handful of thoſe ornaments, in which, like Sampſon's, her chief ſtrength lay: for <hi>Fanny</hi> was proud of her locks, as they were very pliable, and would ſet any way her admirers choſe they ſhould: ſhe, however, like gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malkin aforeſaid, flew upon her adverſary, and in a moment imprinted <hi>eight</hi> lines of vengeance on <hi>Kitty's</hi> cheeks, which lamented the injury in tears of blood.</p>
                  <p>SOME authors have inadvertently mentioned <hi>ten</hi> marks of retaliation: but it ſhould be obſerved that the thumbs ſeldom do execution on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

                  <p>THE noiſe of this battle ſoon brought the family together. <hi>Kitty</hi> being <hi>Fanny's</hi> ſuperior in ſtrength, and finding her ſtrength encreaſed by pain and rage, graſped her antagoniſt round the waiſt, lifted her from the floor, and in the preſence of the whole

houſhold, turned up her coats, and ſpanked her right ſoundly with the duſt-pan. <hi>Cock-eyed Moll</hi> and <hi>Doll Frowſey</hi> ſeeing their principal thus expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the hands of the enemy, ſouſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of two chamber-pots in <hi>Kitty's</hi> face.</p>
                  <p>THE company immediately arranged themſelves according to their reſpective parties, and the battle became general. <hi>Peggy,</hi> the cook, emptied a hot dripping-pan on <hi>Reedina's</hi> head, whilſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> the clerk, ſpattered her with a bottle of ink; <hi>Felon,</hi> the ſcullion, threw a quart of ſluſh on <hi>George,</hi> the ſteward's old ſcarlet cloak; but <hi>George</hi> avoided fighting openly, and only ſlily pinched his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as opportunities offered; <hi>Reedina</hi> attacked nurſe <hi>Richardſon</hi> with a carving knife, with which ſhe not only ſlaſhed her cloaths, but gave ſome ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounds in the fleſh: whilſt Mrs. <hi>Richardſon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defend herſelf with a pillow ſnatched from the cradle. All was uproar and confuſion, and in the tumult, the cradle was overſet, and little <hi>Independence</hi> lay ſprawling and bawling upon the floor, unnoticed and unpitied by the furious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants.</p>
                  <p>IN the midſt of the ſtorm, up roſe <hi>Thomas,</hi> the chief ſteward, and with great ſolemnity commanded ſilence in the name of the lady <hi>Pennſylva.</hi> Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

being ſuſpended, he called upon <hi>Kitty,</hi> and ſeverely reprimanded her as being the author, or at leaſt the encourager, of all this animoſity: he reproached her as a virago, a common ſcold, and threatened to have her well ducked and turned out of doors: he emphatically rebuked her for abuſing <hi>poor Fanny,</hi> the chamber-maid, and ſwore that ſhe ſhould anſwer for her conduct to her miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>KITTY,</hi> who had ſpunk enough, could not bear this:—<q>Yes, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> (ſaid ſhe,) you may well ſtand up for <hi>poor Fanny the chamber-maid,</hi> as you call her, and good reaſon why, truly, for all the houſe knows ſhe is your whore.

tongue, and I will make uſe of it in ſpite of you or your pitiful whore—You ſilence me!—you duck me, and turn me out of doors!—I hope we are not come to that paſs yet, that no one is to be allowed freedom of ſpeech in this family, without your gracious licence: but I will aſk my lady when ſhe comes home, whether or no, ſhe has thought proper to put the keys of our mouths into your pocket. I know you think yourſelf a very great man, Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi>—and you <hi>are</hi> a very great man, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> to be ſure; but for all that, I hope poor ſervants may perform the functions of nature without waiting for your permiſſion—and ſo for the future, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                     </q>—Her tongue was running on at this rate, like the din of a braſs candleſtick tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down ſtairs, when a thundering rap at the door announced the arrival of lady <hi>Pennſylva:</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of the terrible uproar in her family, from ſome of the neighbours, ſhe had hurried home, and was no ſooner admitted into the houſe, but ſhe ruſhed to the ſcene of action.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt object that drew her attention, was the poor infant kicking and ſcreaming under the cradle, which had been turned topſey-turvey over him. She took him up from the floor, and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in her boſom with maternal tenderneſs:
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:024407_0317_0FC7032BC95AF560"/>
ſhe then took a ſurvey of the belligerent powers, as they ſtood before her, reeking hot with the fury of battle, and exclaimed with horror:—<q>Heaven preſerve me! what do I ſee? can theſe be the ſervants of my houſe? can theſe be the choſen few in whom I have placed ſo much confidence, and to whoſe nurture and care I have entruſted my darling child?—the hope of my family?— Go, miſerable wretches; go, and cleanſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from filth, and repair your diſordered dreſs; for I will not hold converſe with you in your preſent tattered and beſpattered conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſee that you all meet me an hour hence in the great hall:—but firſt, <hi>Reedina,</hi> give up that carving knife; would you make a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe of my apartments?—oh, ſhame! ſhame!</q>
Saying this, ſhe hurried away to her chamber, oppreſſed with grief: and the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſilently ſtole off, ſome one way, ſome another, to prepare as well as they could, for the meeting in the great hall.</p>
                  <p>AT the appointed time, the lady <hi>Pennſylva</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the hall, and ſeating herſelf in an armed chair, with her little ſon in her lap, ſhe rang the bell; a ſummons which ſoon brought all the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold into her preſence. After a few moments of

                     <q>WHERE is now that heroic ardour which once animated my friends in the defence of my righteous cauſe, againſt a cruel and powerful foe? Where is now that diſintereſted zeal—that divine enthuſiaſm, which once determined you to brave every extremity, in ſupport of me and my infant ſon, when a cloud, black with ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, hung heavy over the fortunes of my houſe!

                  <head>A REMARKABLE HISTORICAL FACT, Mentioned in the records of the empire of <hi>CHINA,</hi> to be found in the great library of the royal city of <hi>PEKING,</hi> vol. <hi>3458</hi>: tranſlated from the original, by an Engliſh gentleman who reſided many years in that country, and now firſt publiſhed in the Engliſh language.</head>
                  <p>IN the reign of HOANG-TI, who was co-tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with Noah, a <hi>cacoethes,</hi> or malignant diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, raged amongſt the officers and ſervants of the emperor's court. The ſymptoms by which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifeſted itſelf, were a moſt licentious delirium, and a virulent apathy, without any apparent cauſe of phrenzy, or viſible diminution of health and ſtrength: the infected violently attacked each other, and even ſtrangers, if they croſſed their way, by diſcharging, periodically, a black corroſive ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, which always ſtained and ſometimes infected thoſe on whom it fell, to the great annoyance of the whole court.</p>
                  <p>WHEREUPON the great emperor HOANG-TI, ever careful for the good of his people, iſſued his
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:024407_0323_0FC70340D36C1F48"/>
royal mandate, commanding <hi>Cu-tan-ſla-aſh,</hi> his chief ſurgeon, and <hi>Poiſ-on-al,</hi> his chief phyſician, and <hi>Whim-ſic-al,</hi> his chief metaphyſician, to take the infected parties under their care; and after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining into the cauſe of this extraordinary diſeaſe, to apply the proper remedies, and then make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to him of the whole matter.</p>
                  <p>IN purſuance of this mandate of the emperor HOANG-TI, many perſons were apprehended, and carried to the grand infirmary. Amongſt theſe were <hi>Chink-Chink,</hi> the poet, who was one of the royal council; <hi>Twing-Twang,</hi> the muſician, who was alſo a mandarine; <hi>Fee-fa-fum,</hi> of the military; <hi>Quil-king-gum,</hi> the ſcribe; <hi>Ruſh-Tuſh,</hi> the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; <hi>Tſang-hu,</hi> and <hi>Van-ho-ai,</hi> men of letters; with <hi>Fal-fool-fi-reb-rand, Van-hoc,</hi> and many others of inferior note.</p>
                  <p>AFTER <hi>Cu-tan-ſla-aſh,</hi> the ſurgeon, <hi>Poi-ſon-al,</hi> the phyſician, and <hi>Whim-ſic-al,</hi> the metaphyſician, had duly conſidered the caſe, they were unanimouſly of opinion, that this diſeaſe was occaſioned by obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>pori belarii, ductus hypaticus,</hi> and <hi>ductus pancreaticus:</hi> that in conſequence of theſe obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the bile not being duly elaborated by the liver, or ſweetened and corrected by the pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic juice, was extravaſated into the abdomen, from
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:024407_0324_0FC7034A5F811FE0"/>
whence, aſcending through the epigaſtric region into the thorax, it ſoon reached the ſalival glands, and ſo mixed with the chyle: that a great part was uſually diſcharged through the mouth by ſpitting and ſputtering; but the remainder being ſwallowed into the ſtomach, pervaded the whole circulation of digeſtion, and finally went off in foetid urine, or in a clammy and offenſive ſweat.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus diſcovered the diagnoſtic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, the curative indications readily preſented, viz. to deterge the inteſtines by potent <hi>cathartics,</hi> to diſlodge the obſtructions by vigourous concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to open a way for the virulent matter, by promoting ſenſible and inſenſible perſpiration: and after much deliberation, it was concluded, that all theſe purpoſes might be affected by one ſimple ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, viz. THE BASTINADO; provided it ſhould be adminiſtered to the patient <hi>uſque ad ſudorem &amp; putorem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AGREEABLY to this determination of <hi>Cu-tan-ſla-aſh,</hi> the ſurgeon, <hi>Poiſ-on-al,</hi> the phyſician, and <hi>Whim-ſic-al,</hi> the metaphyſician, the patients were forthwith bound hand and foot, and the operation adminiſtered with great alacrity.</p>
                  <p>THE effect was truly aſtoniſhing: ſome, indeed,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:024407_0325_0FC7034E6C68E580"/>
required more, and others leſs, of the ſalutary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, according to the ſtrength of the diſeaſe, and obſtinacy of the patient: but in the end, all reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and were releaſed; except only the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Quil-king-gum,</hi> in whom the diſtemper was ſo inveterate, that he died under the operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any favourable ſymptoms appeared: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe, it was agreed between <hi>Cu-tan-ſla-aſh, Poiſ-on-al</hi> and <hi>Whim-ſic-al,</hi> that the body of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed ſhould be opened, in order to a more certain diſcovery of the nature of this extraordinary diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>THIS was accordingly done, and theſe learned men having made the inveſtigation with great ſkill and attention, formed a report of the caſe, and laid the ſame before the emperor, in obedience to his royal mandate.</p>

                  <p>"I ſhall ſhew that fire is only condenſed light, air is condenſed fire, water condenſed air; that earth is condenſed water, and that metals, ſtones, and all the foſſile kingdom are different modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of condenſed earth.</p>
                  <p>"SO alſo with regard to ſpirit; I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince your majeſty, and I hope, the whole world, that <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>mind,</hi> abſtracted from all adjuncts, is a ſimple eſſence or unity; not compounded of <hi>parts,</hi> but of <hi>powers</hi> only: That there can, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be no original difference between <hi>ſouls;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as one <hi>unity</hi> cannot differ from another,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:024407_0329_0FC70356FACE2B30"/>
except only in identity, and their powers being all <hi>eſſential</hi> muſt therefore be all equal.</p>
                  <p>"THAT to accompliſh the inſcrutable purpoſes of the great Creator, <hi>ſpirit</hi> became connected with, and incloſed in <hi>material</hi> organs: and being ſo incorporated cannot exhibit or exerciſe any of its powers, but ſuch as the organization of the body with which it is connected is capable of making manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>"THAT, upon theſe principles, differences in temper and abilities are not occaſioned by an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal difference of <hi>ſouls,</hi> but are the conſequences of a different organization of bodies. Inferring from this ſyſtem, that the ſoul of an ideot, when diſengaged from the faulty body with which it was united, hath all the powers and faculties of the ſoul of a philoſopher. And, further, that the ſoul of an horſe is as truly ſpiritual as the ſoul of a man.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall have the honour alſo to ſhew, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this hypotheſis, virtue and vice are not merely the effect of mechaniſm; but that the ſoul having an innate ſenſe of right and wrong, and a power of controul over the body, can at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, reſtrain or encourage its mechanical propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities;
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:024407_0330_0FC7035D7025F550"/>
of which I ſhall give a variety of convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples. The body is the ſlave of an active ſoul, but may by inattention and indulgence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the maſter. When the will of the ſoul is ſtrong, it is in vain for the body to plead laſſitude, weakneſs, or pain. Hence it is that the ſailor braves contending elements, the ſoldier faces fire and ſword, and the martyr ſmiles amidſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding flames. For <hi>Volition</hi> is an eſſential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſoul, and however poorly it may exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit its <hi>powers,</hi> according to the circumſtances of the material engine with which it is ſo intimately connected, it is always free <hi>to will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"IN this work I ſhall alſo explain to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's comprehenſion all the myſteries of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and involuntary motion; and trace the ſpirit from her firſt pantings in the <hi>punctum ſaliens,</hi> to the laſt ſtruggles of animal life.</p>
                  <p>"YOUR majeſty will then plainly ſee, that the character and conduct of the late <hi>Quil-king-gum</hi> was perfectly conſonant with the frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his body, as repreſented by <hi>Cu-tan-ſla-aſh,</hi> your chief ſurgeon, and <hi>Poiſ-on-al,</hi> your chief phyſician; and you will know alſo how far he

might, and how far he could not, have counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the propenſities of his mechanical nature.</p>
                  <p>"FOR the preſent, I can do no more than give a ſhort abſtract of deductions from his caſe.</p>
                  <p>"BUT the phyſical and metaphyſical laws by which the temper of the ſoul becomes thus conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with certain arrangements and derangements of body, are ſo ſubtile, and ſo deeply involved in the great arcana of nature, that the moſt ſimple and common phaenomenon cannot be fully account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for without developing the whole wonderful ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>"THUS when I ſhall explain to your majeſty the cauſe by which a philoſopher in a fever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a madman, and in a lethargy a fool, you will know all the myſteries of ſpirit and matter, ſeparate or conjoined: you will fully comprehend the cauſe of waking, ſleeping, and dreaming: you will ſee the ſource from whence the artiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives his fancy, and the poet his fire.</p>
                  <p>"IN all theſe points I ſhall have the honour to give the great <hi>Hoang-ti</hi> full ſatisfaction, when I ſhall have completed the arduous work I have in hand.</p>

in good decent language. Theſe were bold ſtrokes in literature. But our author outſtrips them far. That intelligent beings, under any form of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould be capable of a mutual communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ideas, is not an abſurd or improbable ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. That the brute ſpecies, manifeſtly poſſeſſed of ideas and furniſhed with at leaſt apparent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of ſpeech, might maintain a friendly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not difficult to conceive: but that dead carcaſes ſhould utter ſentiments, and hold recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intercourſe, ſeems to be a ſhocking violation of the bounds of probability. Our author, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, attempts to juſtify the ground he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by a ſyſtem of philoſophy, whimſical enough, of which the principal outlines are theſe.</p>
                  <p>HE ſtates the poſition, that whatever <hi>exiſts</hi> hath <hi>identity,</hi> or that which diſtinguiſhes it from another being however ſimilar. That bodies are ſenſible of their <hi>identity,</hi> which is manifeſted by the reſiſtance they make to any change of form, or to any diminution or addition of ſubſtance. That all material bodies have atmoſpheres adhering to their ſuperficies, or rather that thoſe atmoſpheres are the component parts of the bodies themſelves, expanded and rarefied to an imperceptible degree of fineneſs. So that bodies have, in fact, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible out-lines. What appears to us, he ſays,
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:024407_0335_0FC703722A931FC8"/>
to be the external outlines of any body, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than that line of diviſion in its atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere which ſeparates thoſe particles which are groſs enough to become the objects of viſion, from thoſe which are too refined for that purpoſe. And therefore, he infers, to no two men does the ſame object appear of equal magnitude, unleſs their eyes ſhould be formed exactly alike, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of preciſely equal powers. From which he concludes, that no one can certainly ſay <hi>here</hi> this body <hi>is,</hi> but <hi>there</hi> it <hi>is not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HE aſſerts further, that theſe atmoſpheres, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding not only the whole, but every molicule of a body, muſt ever prevent an actual contact of parts however cloſely preſſed together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is not to be found in all nature a truly ſolid body. That when bodies lye ſo near each other that their atmoſpheres interfere, there muſt be an actual intercourſe of parts between them, of which they are more or leſs ſenſible according to the vigour and activity of their reſpective atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres. And that by ſuch an interference of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpheres, ſentiments may be communicated, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the component parts of the effluviae have been highly ſublimated.</p>

                        <p>I will inform you. It has been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proved, particularly by a <hi>Doctor Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> profeſſor in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that filth, naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and corruption, are the only ſure preſervers of health. He made numberleſs experiments to aſcertain this truth. He procured ſome of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor from a pool near Edinburgh, into which the carcaſes of dogs, cats, horſes, &amp;c. and the general filth of the city are uſually thrown. This he put into a glaſs, viſcous, green, and frothy, as he found it: he took alſo ſome fair ſpring water and put it into another glaſs. Two pieces of freſh meat were ſuſpended in theſe waters, and placed in the ſame degree of heat. In a few hours, the meat immerſed in fair water began to ſmell offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and ſoon after became putreſcent; whilſt the other remained ſweet for ſeveral days; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broiled on the coals, made an excellent ſteak for the curious doctor to regale himſelf withal. Convinced by this experiment, our commiſſioners
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:024407_0338_0FC70378B3863368"/>
have directed as many carcaſes, and as much filth as can be collected, to be diſperſed through the ſtreets of this city. And it is owing to their attention that there is now no ſtreet or alley without at leaſt a reaſonable ſupply of putreſcent matter.</p>

                        <p>Well! but I am ſure there is a law for cleanſing, pitching and paving the ſtreets of this city, and a pretty heavy tax levied for the purpoſe. I am ſure I have heard my maſter curſe and ſwear bitterly whilſt he paid it. Pray, what becomes of all that money?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>CAT.</speaker>
                        <p>What becomes of it! The commiſſioners pay it away in premiums to boys who kill cats for the ſupply of this large city. Only conſider—there are at this time not leſs than three hundred dead cats lying in our ſtreets and alleys. But, alas! what is a poor cat?—not made of ſteel—ſhe cannot laſt forever—continually run over by waggons laden with cord-wood—by drays, carts, coaches, and and chains, and perpetually kicked about by horſes' hoofs. I ſuppoſe the oldeſt and tougheſt ram-cat that can be got will not wear more than a month. Well! three hundred cats per month make three thouſand ſix hundred neceſſary for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſupply of this city—and theſe are not to be

had gratis. The time is not far off when the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature will find it neceſſary to paſs a law for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the breed of cats, and even allow a handſome bounty on their importation. Our worthy ſtreet commiſſioners already find cats ſo ſcarce, that they are ſometimes obliged to put the city to an allowance. But they make up the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, by encouraging houſekeepers to throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtreets, all the offals of their kitchens; ſuch as guts, garbage, bones, feathers, oyſter-ſhells, &amp;c. And they allow the ſoap-boiler to pile up before his door, the dregs of his trade— the ſtinking ſkimmings of putrid fat, and the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put-mortuum</hi> of a whole winter's firing.</p>

                        <p>This ſyſtem of police is entirely new to me, and I believe not generally underſtood. I have known many to curſe the commiſſioners for the dirtineſs of our ſtreets, and pay with grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tax for which they ſay there is not value received.</p>

                        <p>Mere effects of ignorance and prejudice! It is now known to the learned, that the volatile ſalts ariſing from putreſcent ſubſtances are the moſt powerful antiſeptics in nature. It muſt be owing to the extreme cleanlineſs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that it is ſo often viſited with the plague. For cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:024407_0340_0FC70381066FB098"/>
is part of the religion of a Mahometan—but Chriſtians know better. The king of <hi>Spain</hi> once undertook to cleanſe the ſtreets of <hi>Madrid,</hi> by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the inhabitants to accommodate themſelves with <hi>neceſſaries;</hi> but this had well nigh cauſed an inſurrection in that great city. And the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, one and all, joined in a remonſtrance to the crown, declaring that the health of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants depended upon there being a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of human ordure ſpread over the ſtreets of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MANY of the good people, who live on the eaſt ſide of Front Street, between Arch and Vine Streets, hold the ſame philoſophical creed. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will ſtroll through that neighbourhood, from ten to twelve o'clock at night, (whether he goes along Front or Water Streets) will not fail to ſee the nymphs ruſh ſuddenly out, and pour forth plentiful libations to the goddeſs <hi>Cloacina</hi> from their ſacred urns. And whoever walks that way early in the morning, might ſuppoſe that <hi>Jupiter,</hi> enamoured with the <hi>Danaes</hi> of that diſtrict, had again deſcended in a golden ſhower. Delicate conſtitutions, ſubject to nervous and hyſterical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are ſure of finding relief by taking the air of that neighbourhood. And it is ſaid the ſtreet commiſſioners frequently direct their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:024407_0341_0FC70382669E6210"/>
walk that way to procure an appetite for breakfaſt. Moreover, it is expected, that as the ſeaſon advances, the urinous ſalts will be ſo ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the heats of the ſummer ſun, as to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate a natural phoſphorus: in which caſe that neighbourhood will apply for an exemption from the lamp-tax as an unneceſſary impoſition on that part of the city, whoſe inhabitants, like the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal fire-fly, can furniſh light from their own tails.</p>

The ſtreets being covered three or four inches thick with ſoft mud, and ſemi-fluid filth, the carriages paſs eaſily and ſilently along, without diſturbing the ſick by the rattling of their wheels, or jarring the teeth out of the jaws of the riders, as is the caſe in driving over a clean ſtone pavement. Beſides, a coach cannot run far without encountering the body of a cat: the wheels muſt unavoidably break three or four ribs of the carcaſe, and this will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford an agreeable <hi>craſh,</hi> to the great amuſement of the ladies and gentlemen within.</p>

                        <p>Yes. That booby, who has gone whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling along, little thinks how wonderfully the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine was conſtructed which he has ſo careleſsly deſtroyed. If all the rational powers of his whole genealogy, from the firſt of his name, who was got behind a hedge in Ireland, to the laſt of of his family who will be hanged in America for a robbery, could be united in one individual, he would not be able to combine matter to ſuch aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing effect, as it was arranged in the little caſket he hath now cruſhed to pieces. Good God! what work he has made! Cerebrum, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum, pia mater, dura mater, pineal gland, medullary ſubſtance, nerves, lymph, venal and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood, oſtium and peri-oſtium, all confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. Thanks, however, to bountiful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who hath ſo ordered it, that no derangement of the machine, after what is called death, ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion pain. But I was ſaying, from what you have obſerved, I begin to ſee things in a different light.</p>

And in this ſenſe any box that may have accidentally, or otherwiſe, been long ſteeped in brine, may be termed <hi>poſitively</hi> a ſalt-box, although never deſigned for the purpoſe of keeping ſalt.

<pb n="351" facs="unknown:024407_0357_0FC703CBE60EFB20"/>
viz. the triangle ABC is equal to the other equal part or triangle BCD; and further, that thoſe two triangles are not only equal, but ſimilar. For by the 105<hi rend="sup">th</hi> propoſition of the 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book of <hi>Euclid,</hi> if in two triangles, all the lines and angles of the one, are equal to all the correſponding lines and angles of the other, thoſe two triangles will be equal and ſimilar. But the leg AB of the triangle ABC, is equal to the leg CD of the triangle BCD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are two of the ſides of the ſquare ABCD, equal by conſtruction: and the leg AC is equal to the leg BD for the ſame reaſon; and becauſe the hypothenuſe BC is common to both triangles, therefore the hypothenuſe of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle ABC is equal to the hypothenuſe of the triangle BCD. Now, becauſe by the 115<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſame book, equal legs ſubtend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual angles of the ſame radii; it follows, that all the angles of the triangle ABC are equal to the correſponding angles of the triangle BDC: <hi>ergo,</hi> thoſe two triangles are equal and ſimilar: and <hi>ergo,</hi> if a ſquare be cut by a diagonal line into two equal parts, thoſe parts will be equal.

                  </opener>
                  <p>HAVING obſerved, with real concern, the ſtate of ſupineneſs and neglect into which this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſeems to have fallen, I cannot ſuppreſs the zeal that urges me to attempt ſomething that may draw your attention to the important purpoſes for which the legiſlature hath incorporated you as a philoſophical ſociety, and to propoſe ſome regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations which may, in my opinion, prove benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to this inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="360" facs="unknown:024407_0366_0FC703F69BD8F7A0"/>PREVIOUS to the late war our ſociety was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conſiderable progreſs towards becoming uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and famous: it had already attracted the notice of learned men in Europe. The communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by members at home and abroad were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and valuable; ſo that in its infant ſtate, it was enabled to publiſh a volume of tranſactions which ſtamped a credit on the ſociety, and made it an object worthy of public encouragement.</p>
                  <p>THIS fair proſpect, however, was totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt by the dreary tempeſt of war. The ſtill voice of philoſophy could not be heard amidſt the hoſtile din of arms, the thunder of the cannon, and the horrible confuſion of ravaged countries and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered cities.</p>
                  <p>BY the bleſſing of Almighty God, the prudent and heroic conduct of the citizens and ſoldiers of America, and the friendly aſſiſtance of a powerful ally, this war, which threatened ſo loudly, hath terminated in the eſtabliſhment of our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and a peace highly honourable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us.</p>
                  <p>IT is now time—it is high time—that philoſophy ſhould again lift up her head. Political ſovereignty being thus ſecured to us, the eyes of Europe are
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:024407_0367_0FC70401350FC550"/>
turned towards America—And with what view? Not altogether to contemplate the peculiarities of our government. If our ſyſtems ſhould be bad, we ſhall be the chief ſufferers; if they are wiſe and good, we ſhall reap the chief advantage— foreign nations are not directly intereſted in this ſpeculation. But they look towards us as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that may be a great nurſery of arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—As a country affording an extenſive field of improvement in agriculture, natural hiſtory, and other branches of uſeful knowledge. They look to thoſe future philoſophers, who ſhall ſearch nature in her hidden receſſes; in regions yet unexplored; in depths and caverns, which the light of day hath never yet illumined.</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner were the glad tidings of peace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, but many of the literati of Europe were haſty to encourage our purſuits by their friendly notice. The many letters, with preſents of uſeful and curious books we have lately received, evince this.</p>
                  <p>IN what an intereſting ſituation, then, are we placed? And in this intereſting ſituation permit me to aſk, what are we doing? I am truly ſorry that the anſwer to this queſtion ſhould amount to little more than this—we are returning very civil
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:024407_0368_0FC70402DB1AE378"/>
acknowledgements for the letters and preſents ſo received.</p>
                  <p>IT may, indeed, reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very citizen of America muſt find himſelf intimately intereſted in the political concerns of his country; left in an unſettled ſtate by the confuſions of war; and deeply engaged in the arrangement and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a new empire, to which the late im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant revolution hath given birth.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe excuſes, however ſubſtantial, cannot avail us long. If it ſhall be perceived, that year after year elapſes, and nothing intereſting is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, no diſcoveries made, or even attempted to be made: when it ſhall be perceived, that our barrenneſs muſt be occaſioned, either by a want of abilities, or which is, indeed, the truth, by a ſhameful want of attention, we muſt unavoidably ſink into contempt: and when this ſhall be the caſe—I will venture to propheſy—<hi>this</hi> ſociety will never regain its loſt ground. Some other future philoſophical ſociety, better modelled, and compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of more zealous members, may riſe into notice, and become uſeful: but this ſociety will ſink into oblivion.</p>
                  <p>I hope we are yet at a conſiderable diſtance
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:024407_0369_0FC7040678504A50"/>
from ſuch diſgrace; but as I apprehend we are rather verging towards it, my concern would not ſuffer me to withhold this warning.</p>
                  <p>To prove that my fears are not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foundation, I appeal to three notorious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; our ſhameful neglect of the ſtated meetings of the ſociety, the great ſcarcity of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical communications, and the tenor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of our book of minutes.</p>
                  <p>NEVER was there an aera in which philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal purſuits were more encouraged, or puſhed with more ſucceſs, than the preſent. The diſcoveries which have been made in every part of Europe, are moſt intereſting and important. Some have contrived means to ſeparate the different kinds of air, compounded in bodies, and to inveſtigate and prove experimentally their reſpective properties: others have plunged, as it were, into the element of fire, to ſearch out its ſubtle powers, and deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope that great ſecret of nature, the generation of animal heat: ſome are purſuing electrical experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the moſt promiſing aſſiduity: others are adding new worlds to our ſyſtem: and others, on principles hitherto undiſcovered, ſend up the vaſt balloon, and float in regions deemed inacceſſible to man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="364" facs="unknown:024407_0370_0FC704136B2C4AB8"/>THE door to knowledge ſeems to be wider open than ever it was: the authority of the ſchools is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving way to the authority of nature. It is now perceived, that it is not abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> that a man ſhould be what is called <hi>learned</hi> in order to be a philoſopher. A judicious and careful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the phenomena of nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, ſimple and eaſily made, may, and often do, lead the attentive enquirer to moſt important diſcoveries; even without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what are called the learned langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or of the ſyſtematical doctrines of the ſchools.</p>
                  <p>MANY, I am perſuaded, have ſuppreſſed ſtrong inclinations for experimental purſuits, from a notion than none can be a philoſopher, or ought to meddle with philoſophical enquiries, unleſs he has had what is generally called a <hi>learned education.</hi> The poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not true in reaſon or in fact:—it is not true in fact; for, many of the greateſt advances in philoſophical knowledge have been made by men not eminent for their learning: and many of the moſt uſeful improvements in mechanics have been produced by men of the moſt ſcanty educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That deſervedly and univerſally admired philoſopher the worthy preſident of this ſociety,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Franklin.</note>
                     <pb n="365" facs="unknown:024407_0371_0FC704156C37D300"/>
made ſome of his moſt important diſcoveries before he had acquired any conſiderable knowledge in ſchool learning; for he had not a liberal educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his youth. The poſition is not true in reaſon; for the language of nature is not written in Hebrew or Greek; the underſtanding thereof is not involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the contemptible quirks of logic, nor wrapt in the viſionary clouds of metaphyſical hypotheſis. The great book of nature is open to all—all may read therein—and who can read and underſtand, without worſhipping the God of nature, who thus manifeſts himſelf in the ſimplicity and power of his works?</p>
                  <p>THE idolatrous veneration heretofore paid to the theoretical philoſophy of thoſe ſages, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive half their reputation from the groſs ignorance of the ages in which they lived, is now in a great meaſure done away: men begin, without fear of condemnation, to lay aſide faith in philoſophy, and bring doctrines to the teſt of fact. The impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable myſteries and ſupernatural influences of chymiſtry have vaniſhed with the ſmoke of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and we ſee that chymical proceſſes are gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the unalterable mechanical laws of nature, which want nothing but fair inveſtigation to be underſtood. The fatal fabric of ſyſtematical phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic—that ſlaughter-houſe of one-fourth part of the
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:024407_0372_0FC7041709EDD6F0"/>
human ſpecies, is now falling to ruin. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern phyſician ſimplifies his practice, by attending to nature and fact, and following their indications in preference to the dictates of <hi>Galen.</hi> In a word, men do not now, as heretofore, act peremptorily on what may appear to be reaſon; but reaſon cautiouſly on what appears to be fact: and this muſt ſurely be the right and ſafe road to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth.</p>
                  <p>WHAT a glorious aera for the advancement of true philoſophy! The road to knowledge laid open, and the faſhion of the times leading into it.</p>
                  <p>IN the midſt of ſuch advantageous circumſtances, ſhall I again aſk the mortifying queſtion—What are we doing?—I avoid the anſwer—I would not offend—my deſign is only to rouſe the ſociety from that ſtate of ſupineneſs and lethargy into which it ſeems to have fallen, and to ſtimulate its members to a more active attention.</p>
                  <p>OUR deficiency, I am confident, is not owing to a want of men of ſtrong natural abilities, or a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of acquired learning amongſt us. Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca hath been noted for the ſagacity of her citizens. The very climate is favourable to the production of genius; and the uncultivated abilities of the
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:024407_0373_0FC704186ECF6600"/>
loweſt claſs of the natives of this country, ſeem to be as keen and diſcerning as thoſe of any country whatever. Our deficiency, then, muſt be owing merely to a want of attention, which, in our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is unpardonable.</p>
                  <p>BUT, as I have preſumed to point at the evil, it is but a reaſonable expectation that I ſhould alſo attempt to ſuggeſt a remedy. This I will readily do according to my ideas of what may be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the ſociety.</p>
                  <p>IN the firſt place, I think it requiſite that this corporation ſhould have a building of its own, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſtructed for the accommodation of our library, natural curioſities, and philoſophical appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus, with a convenient hall for the meetings of the ſociety, public orations, lectures, &amp;c. To this building there ſhould be annexed an obſervatory, a ſmall chymical laboratory, and a botanical gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. To accompliſh ſo great a deſign, the ſituation of our treaſury is certainly far inadequate. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate revenue would ſerve all the purpoſes of the inſtitution, if we were once provided with a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and apparatus; to effect which, I know of no way, but that of a general ſubſcription, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the legiſlature for ſome aſſiſtance. This once accompliſhed, our annual income might be
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:024407_0374_0FC7042215156660"/>
augmented, by obliging every new member (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary members in diſtant countries excepted) to pay <hi>eight dollars</hi> for his certificate, and to ſign an obligation to contribute <hi>twenty ſhillings</hi> per annum, to the ſupport of the funds;<note n="*" place="bottom">At this time new members paid nothing on their election, and the annual ſubſcription was only ten ſhillings from the members, and that far from being punctually paid.</note> and to be prohibited from voting, or being voted for to any office, unleſs all arrears be paid up: and if any member ſhould refuſe or neglect to pay his annual ſubſcription for three years ſucceſſively, it ſhould be deemed a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary withdrawing himſelf from the ſociety, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in caſe of abſence from the country beyond ſea, or other manifeſtly reaſonable excuſe.</p>
                  <p>I would propoſe, that in the election of counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, particular reſpect ſhould be had to chooſe ſuch as would probably duly attend the ſtated meetings of the ſociety; and that the counſellors ſo choſen, ſhould underſtand, that however other members may be at liberty to attend or not, as inclination or convenience may permit, it will be expected of them, that <hi>they</hi> ſhall regularly aſſemble at the ſtated times for promoting the purpoſes of the inſtitution; and, therefore, they ſhall be noticed by written or printed tickets, at leaſt twelve hours before the time of meeting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="unknown:024407_0375_0FC70423074AE5C8"/>THIS particular notice, however, ſhould not imply the excluſion of any other member or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſummoned only by public advertiſement, who may chooſe to attend.</p>
                  <p>THE counſellors, beſides the ſtated meetings, may hold meetings on their own adjournments, or may call themſelves together, whenever it ſhall be thought neceſſary; but ſhall do nothing deciſive concerning the ſociety, in their own adjourned meetings, but only digeſt and plan mere matters of buſineſs, to be recommended and determined upon at the next ſtated meeting of the ſociety.</p>
                  <p>MY object herein is, that all matters of buſineſs, being duly conſidered and prepared, the attention of the ſociety may not be too much engaged in matters of little importance to philoſophy; ſo that the converſations at the ſtated meetings, may be moſtly employed in philoſophical ſubjects with as little interruption as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>BUT above all, and as a principal object, I would recommend that at every ſtated meeting of the ſociety, or at leaſt as often as may be convenient, one or more philoſophical experiments ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually be exhibited. The particular experiment to be determined upon at the preceding meeting, in
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:024407_0376_0FC70428D5D65118"/>
order that the curators, whoſe ſpecial duty it ſhould be, may provide the requiſites, and ſee that the neceſſary apparatus be in order for the purpoſe: and if any experiment be ſuggeſted by a member, it ſhall be performed at the expence of the treaſury, provided a majority of members preſent when it is propoſed ſhall ſo determine: and every experiment made, with the view in making it, and the final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ſhould be fully recorded in a book to be kept for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>SUCH are the outlines of a reform, which I think would remedy the evils complained of—and for the following reaſons:—firſt, as to the neglect in attending the meetings of the ſociety. The exhibition of curious, and ſometimes new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the converſations and reaſonings which ſuch experiments would naturally occaſion, muſt, I think, unavoidably engage the attention of many who now abſent themſelves for want of induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of entertainment or inſtruction. Secondly, the ſcarcity of philoſophical communications: this would alſo probably be remedied, as the ſeeing experiments performed, and the poſſeſſing conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient opportunities of bringing conceived truths to the teſt of fact, would incite and produce eſſays on many uſeful and curious points, which now live only in idea, and die in neglect. And, thirdly,
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:024407_0377_0FC704318E49C2B8"/>
our book of minutes would ſhew that they record the proceedings of a philoſophical ſociety.</p>
                  <p>TO conclude, I wiſh this addreſs may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as preparatory to a motion I ſhall now make —which is—</p>
                  <p>"THAT a committee may be appointed to take into conſideration the conſtitution, laws, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the ſociety; and to propoſe ſuch alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, amendments, and additions thereto, as they may think moſt likely to advance this ſociety, and promote the good purpoſes for which it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: and that the ſaid committee propoſe the moſt promiſing means by which a building, and a complete philoſophical apparatus, may be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and report at the next meeting, or as ſoon as may be convenient."</p>

                  <head>ACCOUNT OF A <hi>WORM</hi> IN A <hi>HORSE'S EYE.</hi> (Read in the Philoſophical Society,
<date>Sept. 26, 1783.</date>)</head>
                  <p>HAVING been myſelf a witneſs to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curious fact, I thought it ſhould not paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recorded, eſpecially as it occured in this city, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immediate notice of the philoſophical ſociety.</p>
                  <p>A report prevailed laſt ſummer, that a horſe was to be ſeen, which had a living ſerpent in one of his eyes. At firſt I diſregarded this report; but ſeveral of my acquaintance, who had been to ſee the horſe, confirming the account, I had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to go myſelf, taking a friend along with me.</p>
                  <p>THE horſe was kept in Arch-ſtreet, and belonged to a free negro. I examined the eye with all the attention in my power, being no ways diſpoſed to credit the common report, but rather expecting
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:024407_0379_0FC70438ABE41968"/>
to detect a fraud or vulgar prejudice; but was much ſurpriſed to ſee a real living worm within the ball of the horſe's eye. This worm was of a clear white colour, in ſize and appearance much like a piece of white bobbin; it ſeemed to be from 2 ½ to 3 inches in length, which, however, could not be exactly aſcertained, its whole length never appearing at one time, but only ſuch a portion thereof as could be ſeen through the iris, which was greatly dilated. The creature was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, lively, vermicular motion, ſometimes retiring ſo deep in the eye as not to be ſeen at all, and at other times approaching ſo near to the iris as to become plainly and diſtinctly ſeen; at leaſt ſo much of it as was within the field of the iris. I could not diſtinguiſh its head, neither end being perfectly exhibited whilſt I viewed it; and, indeed, its motion was ſo briſk and conſtant as not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſo nice an examination.</p>
                  <p>THE horſe's eye was exceedingly inflamed, ſwoln, and running; I mean the muſcles contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the eye-ball, and he ſeemed to be in great pain; ſo that it was with difficulty the eye could be kept open for more than a few ſeconds at a time: and I was obliged to watch favourable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a diſtinct view of this tormentor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="374" facs="unknown:024407_0380_0FC7043A3948DB20"/>I believe the horſe was quite blind in that eye, for it appeared as if all the humours were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together, and that the worm had the whole orb to range in; which, however, was not of a diameter ſufficient for the worm to extend to its full length, as far as I could diſcover. The humours of the eye were beginning to grow opake, like a chilled jelly, and ſoon afterwards became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo, as I was informed.</p>
                  <p>AS this is an uncommon circumſtance, and may affect ſome philoſophical doctrines, it is much to be lamented, that the horſe had not been purchaſed, and the eye diſſected for better examination.</p>
                  <p>THAT there was a living, ſelf-moving worm in the ball of this horſe's eye, free from all deception or miſtake, I am moſt confident. How this worm got there, or (if bred in ſo remarkable a place) where its parents came from, or how they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to depoſit their ſemen, or convey their egg into the eye of an horſe, I leave for others to determine.</p>

                  <p>SITTING at my door one evening laſt ſummer, I took a ſilk handkerchief from my pocket, and ſtretching a portion of it lightly between my two hands, I held it before my face, and viewed through the handkerchief one of the ſtreet lamps, which was about one hundred yards diſtant, expecting to ſee the threads of the handkerchief much magnified. Agreeably to my expectation, I obſerved the threads were magnified to the ſize of coarſe wires; but was much ſurpriſed to find, that although I moved the handkerchief to the right and left before my eyes, the dark bars did not ſeem to move at all; but remained permanent
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:024407_0382_0FC7044207592638"/>
before the eye. If the dark bars were occaſioned by the interpoſition of the magnified threads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eye and the flame of the lamp, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they would move and ſucceed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the threads were made to move and paſs in ſucceſſion before the eye; but the fact was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                  <p>TO account for this phenomenon, exceeds my ſkill in optics. You will be ſo good as to make the experiment; and if you find the caſe truly ſtated, as I doubt not you will I ſhall be much obliged by a ſolution on philoſophical principles.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE experiment you mention with a ſilk hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, and the diſtant flame of a lamp, is much more curious than one would at firſt imagine. For the object we ſee is not the web of the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief magnified, but ſomething very different, as appears from the following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. A diſtinct image of any object placed cloſe to the eye, cannot be formed by parallel rays or ſuch as iſſue from a diſtant luminous point; for all ſuch rays paſſing through the pupil, will be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at the bottom of the eye, and there form an image of the luminous point. The threads of the handkerchief would only intercept part of the rays, and render the image leſs brilliant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. If the croſs bars we ſee were images of the ſilk threads, they muſt paſs over the retina, whilſt the threads are made to paſs over the pupil;
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:024407_0384_0FC704465FB96DF0"/>
but this, as you obſerve, does not happen for they continue ſtationary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. IF the image on the retina was a picture of the object before the eye, it muſt be fine or coarſe according to the texture of the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. But it does not change with changing the ſilk, nor does it change on removing it farther from the eye. And the number of the apparent threads remains the ſame, whether ten, twenty, or thirty of the ſilk threads paſs acroſs the pupil at the ſame time. The image we ſee muſt, therefore, be formed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> this can be no other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> ſurfaces of bodies as deſcribed by <hi>Newton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT is well known in optics, that different images, of the different points of objects without the eye, are formed on the retina by pencils of rays, which before they fall on the eye are inclined to each other in ſenſible angles: and the great uſe of teleſcopes is to encreaſe theſe angles regularly, in a certain ratio, ſuffering ſuch rays as were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel before they enter the teleſcope to proceed on parallel after paſſing through it. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended image which we ſee in this experiment muſt therefore be formed by pencils of rays, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:024407_0385_0FC7044F390AC498"/>
they entered the eye, had very conſiderable degrees of inclination with reſpect to each other. But coming from a ſmall diſtant flame of a lamp, they were nearly parallel before they paſſed through the ſilk handkerchief. It was therefore the threads of ſilk which gave them ſuch different directions.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE the ſilk is placed to the eye, parallel rays of light will form a ſingle lucid ſpot as at A
<figure/>
in the figure, and this ſpot will ſtill be formed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by ſuch rays as paſs through the little meſhes uninfluenced by the threads. But ſuppoſe the perpendicular threads by their action on the rays to bend a part of them one degree to the right and left, another part two degrees; there will now be four images formed, two on each ſide of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one at A. By a ſimilar action of the horizontal threads, this line of five lucid ſpots will be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:024407_0386_0FC704510EDCF650"/>
into five other lines, two above and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, making a ſquare of 25 bright ſpots, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by four perpendicular dark lines and four horizontal ones; and theſe lucid ſpots and dark lines will not change their places on moving the web of ſilk over the eye, parallel to any of its threads. For the point of the retina on which the image ſhall fall, is determined by the incidence of the rays with reſpect to the axis of the eye, and not by the part of the pupil through which they paſs.</p>
                  <p>IN order to make my experiments with more accuracy, I made a ſquare of parallel hairs about half an inch each way; and to have them near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parallel and equidiſtant, I got a watch maker to cut a very fine ſcrew on two peices of ſmall braſs wire. In the threads of theſe ſcrews, 106 of which made one inch, the hairs were laid, 50 or 60 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Looking thro' theſe hairs at a ſmall opening in the window ſhutter of a dark room, 1-30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch wide and three inches long, holding the hairs parallel to the ſlit, and looking towards the ſky, I ſaw three parallel lines, almoſt equal in brightneſs, and on each ſide, four or five much fainter, and growing more faint coloured and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct the further they were from the middle line,
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:024407_0387_0FC70452583E5450"/>
which I knew to be formed of ſuch rays as paſs between the hairs, uninfluenced by them.</p>
                  <p>THINKING my apparatus not ſo perfect as it might be, I took out the hairs, and put in others, ſomething thicker; of theſe 190 made one inch, and therefore the ſpaces between them were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 1-250<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of an inch. The three mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lines of light were now not ſo bright as they had been before, and the others were ſtronger and more diſtinct; and I could count ſix on each ſide of the middle line ſeeming to be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from each other, eſtimating the diſtance from the centre of one to the centre of the next. The middle line was ſtill well defined and colourleſs, the next two were likewiſe pretty well defined, but ſomething broader, having their inner edges tinged with blue, and their outer edges with red: the others were more indiſtinct, and conſiſted each of the priſmatic colours, in the ſame order, which, by ſpreading more and more, ſeemed to touch each other at the fifth or ſixth line, but thoſe near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the middle were ſeparated from each other by very dark lines, much broader than the bright lines.</p>
                  <p>FINDING the beam of light which came through the window-ſhutter divided into ſo many diſtinct
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:024407_0388_0FC7045905837020"/>
pencils, I was deſirous of knowing the angles which they made with each other. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I made uſe of a ſmall priſmatic teleſcope and micrometer, with which I was favoured by <hi>Dr Franklin.</hi> I faſtened the frame of parallel hairs before the object glaſs, ſo as to cover its aperture entirely: then looking through the teleſcope, I meaſured the ſpace between the two firſt ſide lines, and found the angular diſtance between their inner edges to be 13′ 15″; from the middle of one to the middle of the other 15′ 30″; and from the outer edge of one to the outer edge of the other 17′ 45″. In the firſt caſe, I had a fine blue ſtreak in the middle of the object, and in the laſt a red ſtreak. The other lines were too faint, when ſeen through the teleſcope to meaſure the angles they ſubtended with accuracy; but from ſuch trials as I made, I am ſatisfied, that from the ſecond line on one ſide, to the ſecond on the other ſide, and ſo on, they were double, triple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quadruple, &amp;c. of the firſt angles.</p>
                  <p>IT appears then, that a very conſiderable portion of the beam of light paſſed between the hairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at all bent out of its courſe; that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmaller portion was bent, at a medium, about 7′ 45″ each way; the red rays a little more, and the blue rays a little leſs; another ſtill ſmaller por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:024407_0389_0FC7045B81F18730"/>
15′ 30″; another 23′ 15″, and ſo on. But that no light, or next to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>one, was bent in any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle leſs than 6′, nor any light of any particular colour in any intermediate angle between thoſe which ariſe from doubling, tripling, &amp;c. of the angle in which it is bent in the firſt ſide lines.</p>
                  <p>I was ſurpriſed to find that the red rays are more bent out of their firſt direction, and the blue rays leſs, as if the hairs acted with more force on the red than on the blue rays; contrary to what happens by refraction, when light paſſes obliquely through the common ſurface of two different mediums. It is, however, conſonant to what ſir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> obſerves with reſpect to the fringes that border the ſhadows of hairs and other bodies; his words are—<q>And, therefore, the hair, in cauſing theſe fringes, acted alike upon the red light, or leaſt refrangible rays, at a greater diſtance, and upon the violet or moſt refrangible rays, at a leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and by thoſe actions diſpoſed the red light into larger fringes, and the violet into ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fringes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>BY purſuing theſe experiments, it is probable that new and intereſting diſcoveries may be made reſpecting the properties of this wonderful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>light,</hi> which animates all nature in the eyes
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:024407_0390_0FC7045CD33FFA80"/>
of man, and perhaps, above all things, diſpoſes him to acknowledge the Creator's bounty. But want of leiſure obliges me to quit the ſubject for the preſent.</p>

                     <p>HAVING gone through the uſual courſe of education in this ſeminary of learning; having paſſed the ordeal trials of private and public exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, I am now in full expectation of receiving thoſe parchment honours, which are to teſtify the ſucceſs of my ſtudies, and prove, to a believing world, that my labour hath not been in vain.</p>
                     <p>BUT it has been inſinuated to me, that before my temples can be crowned with collegiate laurels,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:024407_0395_0FC700466A996D10"/>
it is expected that I ſhould addreſs you, ladies and gentlemen, in an elegant ſpeech on this grand occaſion.</p>
                     <p>UNREASONABLE as this demand ſeemed to be, nevertheleſs, being long accuſtomed to ſubmit, I earneſtly endeavoured to comply with it. I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to books, to ſolitary walks, ardent invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the uſual provocatives to good writing. I choſe for my ſubject the dignity of the ſciences, and the excellent mode of attaining them in this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. I began with a warm apoſtrophe to this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in manner and form following:—Oh, ye ſacred walls! ye venerable ſtools and benches! and thou, expanded arch! that haſt ſo often echoed back the ſweet effuſions of thoſe aſpiring youths who have, in times paſt, been nurtured within your hallowed precincts—hear! oh hear! one of your lateſt ſons teſtify the ardour with which he feels himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired!—Thus far, all was well—but what to ſay next was the difficulty. Whilſt I was making eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible effort to proceed, an unlucky line of a diſtreſſed poet, who was compoſing new-year's verſes, popped into my head, viz.
<q>What can I ſay, that ha'nt been ſaid before?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS ridiculous queſtion quenched all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm in a moment—like a ſpark drawn from the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:024407_0396_0FC700481841CEF0"/>
prime conductor, the electrometer fell inſtantly, and I gave up the point.</p>
                     <p>NOTHING could be more unfortunate: I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly propoſed, ladies and gentlemen, to have made you a very fine ſpeech, in the cuſtomary ſtyle, but my good intention having been thus unhappily fruſtrated, I muſt e'en depend upon the chance of the moment for what I ſhall ſay; and I doubt not, but that you, my benevolent hearers, will at leaſt wiſh me good luck, and a happy eſcape from my my preſent difficulty.</p>
                     <p>ALTHOUGH I am under a neceſſity to change the intended ſtile of my ſpeech, I ſhall not entirely abandon the ſubject I had choſen; but ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give this polite audience ſome juvenile ſtrictures on the preſent ſyſtem of what is called a learned education: in doing which, I hope I may be allowed the privilege of ſpeaking freely without giving offence. Although I ſhall never think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſcharged from the obligations I owe to theſe my kind and reverend inſtructors, for their care and attention to me; yet, being now emancipated from their immediate control, I ſhall take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of giving a free ſcope to my ſentiments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding how far they may run foul of the ſtated opinions and prejudices of the ſchools.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:024407_0397_0FC7004CF4C18228"/>TO begin, then, the detail of our inſtruction.— After the youngſter hath been taught to ſpell, read, and write, in his mother tongue, he aſcends the firſt ſtep of learned education.—The <hi>Latin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> is the object, to attain which, a Latin gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar is put into the poor boy's hands. This gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar is called the rudiments or foundation of that language: by which one might ſuppoſe, that the grammar had been given by inſpiration, and the Romans derived their language from it. But the fact is juſt the reverſe; for in every language, the grammar is, and muſt neceſſarily be, the reſult, and not the origin of that language: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this undeniable truth, the Latin muſt be inculcated according to the method and diſcipline of the ſchools, <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> in more ſenſes than one.—Well! through this grammar, at all events, the bewildered pupil muſt wade, groping for a year or two in utter darkneſs, and learning by rote a complicated ſyſtem of rules, the propriety or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which it is impoſſible for him to ſee in any inſtance.</p>
                     <p>THESE rules are framed partly in elegant proſe, and partly in much more elegant verſe, in order, I ſuppoſe, to inſinuate to the ſtudent ſome taſte for Latin poetry, whilſt he is learning the rudiments of the language. If I had not, ladies, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024407_0398_0FC70050F44BDCF8"/>
regard for your ears, and no ſmall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for my own teeth, I would give you a ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our grammar verſification.</p>
                     <p>AFTER theſe rules have been got by rote, as I ſaid before, it may be thought that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neceſſary to the knowledge of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tongue—But Alas! this is only the beginning of troubles—The rules muſt not only be got by memory, but the exceptions alſo to thoſe rules—Now, good people, you muſt know that theſe exceptions, are ſo very numerous, that, in many caſes, it is immaterial which you chooſe for a ſtandard, the rule itſelf, or the exception.</p>
                     <p>THE excellency of this method of teaching a language by means of its grammar, may be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a familiar parallel. You muſt know, ladies, that when a man ſtands, or walks, or performs any motions of the body, ſuch poſitions and motions are all reducible to mathematical principles. In all caſes, it is neceſſary that what is called the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of gravity ſhould be ſupported, were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the perſon muſt unavoidably fall to the ground: and thus are all our movements redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to ſyſtem. Now, if the preſent mode of education is right, and who dares aſſert it is not, you ſhould not ſuffer your children to walk,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024407_0399_0FC70055F5257800"/>
or even attempt to walk, before they have learned theſe rules, for which purpoſe you muſt neceſſarily provide mathematical nurſes and geometrical danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſters. Oh the excellence of learning! What delight muſt it afford the fond parent, to ſee young maſter ſtanding like the rafters of a houſe, and miſs dancing in triangles, rhomboides, and trapeziums.</p>
                     <p>BUT to proceed. We will ſuppoſe the young ſtudent hath made ſome advances in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Latin language, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod propoſed. The firſt obſervable conſequence is, that he loſes, or at leaſt gains, no ground in a taſte for the elegancies of his native tongue. His diction becomes ſtiff and awkward, and his hand writing intolerable. So that whilſt he is ſtudying the anatomy of a dead language, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a ſtranger to the beauties of the living.</p>
                     <p>IT is probable that there are many amongſt the ladies, whom I have now the honour to addreſs, who have never ſtudied grammar, or know any thing of its rules; and yet I venture to affirm, that a few lines, written by your fair hands, and dictated by gentle nature, ſhall convey more lively ſenſibilities, and ſhall find a ſhorter way to the heart, than a whole page—aye, or forty of them —compoſed by the moſt learned grammarian, with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024407_0400_0FC7005928526340"/>
                        <hi>Dilworth</hi> on his right hand, and <hi>Entick</hi> on his left.</p>
                     <p>IN the mean time the aſſiduous youth reads <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoſis,</hi> for the improvement of his morals; and learns from <hi>Horace,</hi> to be chaſte and temperate. <hi>That</hi> time which might uſefully be employed in ſtudying the hiſtories of thoſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with whom we are, or may be connected, is conſumed in reading the delectable and lamentable ſtory of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and queen <hi>Dido.</hi> The one, a hero of ſo inſignificant a caſt, that all the laudable ingredients of his character may be compriſed in the words <hi>Pius Aeneas;</hi> and the other, to ſpeak delicately, not the moſt ſhining example of female virtue and moderation. The one, a diſcourteous knight, and the other a furious enamorata.</p>
                     <p>IT juſt occurs to me, that Dido's greateſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, that ſhe lived in a barbarous age, when lawyers were not to be had for love or money. Had her famous amour happened in our day, ſhe might have recovered at leaſt £. 750 damages;<note n="*" place="bottom">This alludes to a circumſtance of the time ſomething like the caſe of queen <hi>Dido.</hi>
                        </note> which, all things conſidered, would have been
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024407_0401_0FC7005D36BEF038"/>
much better than cutting her throat upon a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile—As deſperate Dido did—This by the bye.</p>
                     <p>THE young ſtudent is at length fitted for the higher claſſes of ſcience. He learns mathematicks, geography, natural philoſophy, logic, ethics, and metaphyſics.</p>
                     <p>WITH reſpect to the three firſt, I would only ſay—That if they were diveſted of ſome ſcientific pedantry (I mean as they are taught in the ſchools), they are worthy the attention of a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, inaſmuch as they advance the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth; for of all valuable things, <hi>truth</hi> is the moſt valuable.</p>
                     <p>BUT of all the ſyſtems of complicated nonſenſe, that ever puzzled the buſy brains of mortal man, <hi>logic</hi> is ſurely the moſt inſignificant. An art which no ingenuity can apply to any one uſeful purpoſe of life. Imagine to yourſelves, gentle hearers, a ſociety of <hi>logicians,</hi> whoſe converſation in the common occurrences of life ſhould be conducted in <hi>ſyllogiſtic</hi> mode and form. The learned houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper goes to market, and endeavours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the butcher to lower the price of his mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in <hi>celarent;</hi> the butcher enforces his demand in <hi>barbara.</hi> The logical lover alſo attacks his dulcinea in form. He aſſures her, in <hi>particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives,</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:024407_0402_0FC70062D48098A0"/>
that he is enamoured of her charms; and from theſe premiſes, draws an artful concluſion, that ſhe ought to encourage his paſſion, and return his love. The lady replies, in <hi>univerſal negatives.</hi> The gallant then plays off his whole battery in a compacted <hi>ſorites.</hi> The lady anſwers only in the <hi>ſimple form</hi>—a weakneſs is diſcovered in her <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle term</hi>—ſhe is reduced to a <hi>dilemma,</hi> and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>IN ſuch a proceſs, what is to become of Cupid and his darts! What is to become of the logic of the eyes, and a thouſand nameleſs expreſſions of the feelings of the heart, which nature alone can dictate? What is to become of them! Why they are entirely out of the queſtion. Syllogiſms—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ſyllogiſms, muſt ſupply their place. What is learning good for, unleſs it makes us wiſer than nature?</p>
                     <p>BUT I may be told that logic never was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſuch purpoſes; and that its uſe is the diſcovery of truth, and the detection of error— Here I join iſſue—and am bold to aſſert, that from the days of Ariſtotle to the preſent moment, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are not indebted to <hi>logic</hi> for the diſcovery of any one uſeful truth, or the detection of any one dangerous error—and further—that no man ever was <hi>convinced</hi> by a ſyllogiſm—But I obſerve
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024407_0403_0FC700658CD1D470"/>
their reverences begin to frown—I ſhall, therefore, not urge this ſubject any further.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ETHICS</hi> and <hi>metaphyſics</hi> bring up the rear of a learned education. It would tire your patience, my indulgent hearers, ſhould I enter upon a detail of all the whimſical abſurdities with which theſe ſciences abound. If a man ſhould conduct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through life, according to the ſtrict rules of <hi>ethics,</hi> he would be juſt as ridiculous as the knight of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> governing himſelf in the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occurrences by the ſolemn formalities of chivalry.</p>
                     <p>AS to <hi>metaphyſics,</hi> it is a viſionary ſyſtem, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in uncertain concluſions are drawn from uncertain premiſes, and in which the very terms uſed have no determinate meaning. The whole is an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious fabric built in air; having no real, known foundation, whereon to reſt: not unlike the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan creed, that the world ſtands upon the horns of a bull; the bull on the back of an elephant; the elephant on a great tortoiſe; and the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe upon nothing.</p>
                     <p>IT muſt be owned, however, that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to metaphyſics for ſome very curious and entertaining riddles: ſuch as—that <hi>infinite</hi> carried <pb n="11" facs="unknown:024407_0404_0FC70066AC007720"/>
beyond <hi>infinity</hi> becomes <hi>finite</hi>—that one <hi>infinity</hi>
may be twice as long as another <hi>infinity</hi>—that <hi>ſoul</hi>
is not <hi>matter,</hi> and that <hi>matter</hi> is not <hi>ſoul;</hi> and in ſhort, that it is no matter whether there be any ſoul or not—Oh! the heighths and the depths of learning!</p>
                     <p>THUS, ladies and gentlemen, I have given you the outlines of a ſcholaſtic education. My firſt intention was to have diſcuſſed this ſubject in high ſtrains of panegyric; but as this will be better done by ſome of my fellow-ſtudents, I refer you to them for thoſe ſublime flights of imagination which pleaſe the ear, but have nothing to do with the underſtanding or with truth.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude my addreſs with one reaſonable requeſt, which is, that you, my benevolent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, may extend the ſame indulgence to me you uſually do to the orators of this place, by forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every word you have heard as ſoon as you have left this hall <note n="*" place="bottom">There is a pulpit on the ſtage, and the hall is frequently uſed as a place of worſhip.</note>.</p>
                     <p>AS our deſign looks no farther than preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, it would be unfair to make us reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the opinions we ſport with, which ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024407_0405_0FC70068217BAF90"/>
never after riſe up in judgment againſt us. I urge this, not merely for my own ſake, but in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of my fellow-ſtudents alſo, who will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in the heat of their zeal, advance many things, which they would no more undertake to ſupport than I, if called upon, would defend the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and ſtrictures I have juſt had the honour to deliver.</p>

                     <p>FOR my part, I do not find myſelf diſpoſed to throw my judgement into the common ſtock, to be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024407_0407_0FC70076C09A3490"/>
carried down by the undiſtinguiſhing current of popular opinion—<hi>Peace, liberty,</hi> and <hi>independence!</hi> Very pretty words indeed; they look exceedingly well on paper; whether they be written in round hand, Italian hand, ſquare text, German text, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other text, provided they be fairly written. This may pleaſe the eye; but let us conſider a little how they will ſatisfy the underſtanding; how far they are calculated to meet the approbation of an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, penetrating mind: and this will beſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained by taking a view of the conſequences and effects which they are likely to produce.</p>
                     <p>AS to the firſt—Can any thing be more abſurd than to ſuppoſe that <hi>peace</hi> is really productive of happineſs? Is not the contrary demonſtrable? Let us, for a moment, imagine that all the inhabitants of the world ſhould remain for a whole century in perfect peace and harmony. That no ſuch thing as public war, or private quarrels, ſhould exiſt in that period, a ſituation, to be ſure not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nature having wiſely ordered matters other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but ſuppoſe it to be ſo, What would be the conſequence? The uninterrupted friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between nations by commerce, and between individuals by contract, would ſoon reduce the wealth of the world to a level. All emulation would ceaſe, and every ſpur to induſtry be blunted,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024407_0408_0FC70079C814CD48"/>
or done away. Luxury and inſolence would, like a general plague, infect communities, and ſpread their baneful influences every where. The courſe of human life, running on in even channels and an unbroken calm, would become inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably tedious, and engender green melancholy, and four diſcontent, unleſs accidental diſcoveries of artificial gratifications, for artificial appetites, ſhould now and then occaſion ſome ſlight varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the diſguſting ſcene, by affording a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary but fatal relief. A miſerable corruption of morals, debauchery, and conſequent languor and diſeaſe, would reduce the human ſpecies to a ſtate of degeneracy; inſomuch, that for aught I know, a ſecond deluge would be neceſſary to purge the earth of its filthy inhabitants. No, it is <hi>war</hi>— ſpirited <hi>war,</hi> the claſhing of intereſts, interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſions, public conteſts, and private animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that give energy to the purſuits of men, and furniſh a theatre whereon the heroic virtues of the heart, and the active powers of the mind, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit themſelves to advantage. Look round, and you will find that nature, in all her works, ſhews a fondneſs for conteſt, having made oppoſition the life of the world. What is animal health but a due mixture of contending qualities? Solids melting into fluids, and fluids coagulating into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids; acids and alkalies maintaining perpetual war, and ruſhing together in eſſerveſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024407_0409_0FC7007AE9122518"/>
inteſtine motions from fermentation and digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; muſcles contracted by muſcles, pulling in oppoſite directions, and every property balanced by another of a contrary nature: let all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conflict be compoſed; let the animal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm be in perfect peace, and the certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence will be death and putrefaction. So alſo in the elements: ſhowers of rain, ſtorms of wind, thunder and lightning, are abſolutely neceſſary in the oeconomy of our atmoſphere. Without theſe, the healthful air would ſoon become a peſtilential vapour, and the vaſt ocean, a ſtagnant pool of corruption. It is manifeſt, therefore, that nature delights in conteſt; and never intended that either the moral, or material world ſhould remain in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted peace.</p>
                     <p>AS to <hi>liberty,</hi> it is difficult to ſay in what it really conſiſts. Men having not yet affixed any preciſe idea to the word. The people of different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have very different notions of it. What a European would call <hi>liberty,</hi> a <hi>Cherokee</hi> Indian would conſider as a moſt cruel reſtraint. If the word be taken in its fulleſt extent, viz. a right and power to do whatever we pleaſe, it is a privilege which no man ever did or could enjoy; an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate of nature, in which men are ſuppoſed to have lived without control, and in which every
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024407_0410_0FC7008166023D68"/>
individual was a ſovereign, has ſerved as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of many ingenious ſyſtems, and learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations, by civilians, moraliſts, and metaphyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but even theſe profound philoſophers are ſo far from eſteeming ſuch a ſtate a bleſſing, that they derive all the advantages of civil ſociety, and the good of mankind from a reſignation of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty, which they aſſure us is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the ſecurity and happineſs of the individual.</p>
                     <p>BUT if we take the word in a more limited ſenſe, as it is generally conſidered, when the terms <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>political</hi> liberty are uſed, I would aſk, what are the great advantages derived from it? or, rather, what inconveniences does it not bring with it? <hi>Civil liberty</hi> conſiſts, chiefly, in a people's being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by no laws, but ſuch as they have themſelves made or aſſented to; in not being obliged to part with their property without their conſent; and in holding their lives and eſtates ſecure from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious reſentments of arbitrary power, or the graſping hand of over-weening avarice: but ſhould not a prudent man conſider that all this liberty brings with it a deal of trouble and expence?</p>
                     <p>HAD <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſuccceded in her views with reſpect to this country, we ſhould not have been
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024407_0411_0FC7008495050310"/>
put to the laborious taſk of framing laws for our own government, a taſk which we ſeem but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently qualified to perform; we ſhould have been rid of the intolerable plague, the heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, feuds, cabals, and chicaneries attending popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar elections, and we ſhould have been eaſed of the enormous expence of aſſemblymen's wages, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, fees and ſalaries to the officers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a thouſand other charges and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to which we muſt now be ſubjected: we ſhould have had nothing more to do, but to pay when called upon, and obey when commanded. This further conſideration ought alſo to have ſome weight, that if we had been cruelly and unjuſtly oppreſſed by a people three thouſand miles off, all the world would have pitied our ſituation, which is no ſmall conſolation in trouble, and exclaimed againſt the tyranny of our oppreſſors: whereas, ſhould things go wrong now, we ſhall have none to blame but ourſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when we complain, the natural anſwer will be, if you have placed men in power who abuſe their truſt, it is your own fault:—why did you not make a better choice? Your ſufferings are the effect of your own folly, and therefore you deſerve no pity. Theſe are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſiderations. As to property being ſecured by political liberty, I would obſerve that this is a poſition more ſpecious perhaps than true. The
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024407_0412_0FC7008572727978"/>
payment of no taxes, but ſuch as are levied by our own conſent, form a pretty arrangement of words and ideas; but, ſtrictly ſpeaking, the fact is ſeldom really ſo. No man pays a tax with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that is, he would rather not pay it, if he could refuſe with honour and ſafety. The payment of taxes is always attended with ſome reluctance of mind, and often with open murmurings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, either as to the time, purpoſe, or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tax. The caſe is quite otherwiſe when money is taken from us by the ſtrong hand of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power: all reaſoning, all deliberation is out of the queſtion—we have nothing to do but pay—and ſo the mind is ſaved a deal of trouble and vexation. This <hi>paying</hi> may, indeed, have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to poverty—and ſo much the better; for poverty incites induſtry, and induſtry is the mother of health and contentment.</p>
                     <p>TO illuſtrate my meaning by a familiar inſtance: ſuppoſe a traveller meets a friend on the road, who requeſts him to give or lend him a ſmall ſum of money for a preſent purpoſe: the traveller he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates; he cannot decently refuſe; and yet he would rather the requeſt had not been made: in this conflict his mind ſuffers no ſmall anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſhould a highwayman preſent a piſtol to his breaſt, and with oaths and imprecations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

his caſh, with what chearfulneſs, with what expedition will he produce his purſe? and think himſelf happy in coming off ſo well.</p>
                     <p>WITH reſpect to life's not being ſecure under a deſpotic government, I have only to obſerve, that no one can juſtly complain of an injury he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffered; and that after the evil hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the party will not be in a condition to complain. So much for civil liberty.</p>
                     <p>BUT <hi>independence,</hi> cries the American; What have you to ſay againſt <hi>independence</hi>? The glory of our country, the reward of our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the fruit of our ſeven years ſufferings, and bloody conteſt. This is mere popular excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Let us view the thing in its true light, and we ſhall find that all the diſadvantages atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding civil liberty, ſome of which I have enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, are applicable to independence, together with many additional conſequences.</p>
                     <p>WHILST we were dependent upon Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we had no trouble in ſtudying the characters, cuſtoms, and manners of foreign nations; the Engliſh were ſo kind as to furniſh us with all their ideas on theſe ſubjects. They told us, that the <hi>French</hi> are a trifling and contemptible nation;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024407_0414_0FC7009260223A10"/>
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are proud, ſullen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful; the <hi>Germans,</hi> oſtentatious; the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> boors; the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> ſavages; and, in ſhort, that the Engliſh were themſelves the only people fit to live and govern the word, as if all other nations held their dominions by uſurpation. How eaſy was it to believe all this? Implicit faith ſaves an infinity of trouble. How happy were we in ſubmitting to the government, adopting the prejudices, and aping the manners of a nation, which we conceived to be the glory of the world, and the perfection of human nature?</p>
                     <p>WHEREAS, now, we are under the painful ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of altering our ſentiments. We are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by actual experience to acknowledge, that the <hi>French</hi> are a brave, generous, and poliſhed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and that none of the other nations are, in truth, ſuch as they have been repreſented to us. Our commercial connections will convince us that human nature is fundamentally the ſame in every country. That good and bad men are to be found in every climate; and that the people of England have not actually monopolized all the virtue and wiſdom of the world. Every convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of error, is a violence done to the mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the forcible eradication of a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024407_0415_0FC70093870BAA48"/>
muſt be attended with a painful ſenſation. The blind man is happy in his blindneſs, and the ignorant content with his ignorance. The wiſeſt of men, has ſome where told us, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of wiſdom is the encreaſe of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER inconvenience attending our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is this—The impoſts and duties heretofore laid on our commerce, contributed to the revenue of a prince three thouſand miles diſtant, it was therefore not thought diſreputable for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to evade the payment of thoſe duties, if he could. How delightful was it to exerciſe every ſpecies of ingenuity and craft in bilking collectors and cuſtomhouſe officers! And how ſweet was the enjoyment of the profits ſo obtained! But our independence has deprived us of all theſe commercial advantages; as it would be diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and even wicked, to evade the duties laid by our own laws, and for the ſupport of our own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

If, notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, and all I might have ſaid, you will be ſo blind as to prefer a ſtate of freedom, with all its cares and troubles, to a ſtate of dependence and ſlavery, which requires nothing but implicit faith, and implicit obedience:

                     <head>☞ AT a public commencement in the univerſity, an argument was held for and againſt the practice of DUELLING; the following ſpeech was written for the young gentleman who took the defenſive ſide.</head>
                     <p>— I Marvel my fellow-ſtudent did not aſcend the pulpit, and deliver his pious harangue from thence. You have been entertained, my worthy hearers, with a ſort of chapter againſt DUELLING: the orator has entrenched himſelf behind certain texts of ſcripture, and ſome vulgar prejudices— theſe make up the ſum total of his argument; for, as to the reſt, it was mere declamation.</p>
                     <p>YOU may make what uſe you pleaſe of his fine ſpeech; but if you imagine that his private ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coincide with his public declamation, you may find yourſelves much miſtaken. He has too much good manners to interrupt me, or he would probably aſk,—how I came to know his private ſentiments? I anſwer from his own words juſt now delivered: "I hope, (ſaid he) this polite audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will give me a candid hearing upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and entertain no unfavourable ſentiments of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024407_0418_0FC700A13B64C1F8"/>
my courage, though I ſhould condemn it"—mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the practice of duelling. This preparatory <hi>ſalvo</hi> may be paraphraſed thus: "I am going, good people, to give you a declamation againſt the cuſtom of fighting duels. This you muſt know is not an undertaking of my own choice, but has been impoſed upon me. I muſt, therefore, make the beſt of it I can. But if you, or any of you, ſhould conclude from what I ſhall now ſay, that I have not courage to defend my inſulted honour, I tell you before hand, you have miſtaken your man." This much, indeed, I can anſwer for the gentleman—I have known him ſome conſiderable length of time, and have not found him more meek and patient than his neighbours: but I leave him to anſwer for himſelf, and only requeſt your kind attention, whilſt I offer ſome arguments in anſwer to his fine ſpeech, and in juſtification of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of duelling.</p>
                     <p>THE gentleman has told us, that duelling derives its origin from the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and thoſe other barbarous nations which over-ran Europe, and extinguiſhed all the refinements of art, ſcience, and morality: that theſe ſavages, not having ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſufficient to determine in matters of private controverſy, referred the diſpute to the deciſion of heaven, by bringing the parties to mortal combat,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024407_0419_0FC700A3626C6C78"/>
under a belief that God would interfere in favour of right and juſtice.</p>
                     <p>SUPPOSING this to have been the real pedigree of duelling, I think it no diſhonourable one: it was neither irreverend nor irrational to believe in a particular, as well as a general providence, and to ſubmit to his unerring judgment and all-ſeeing eye, the detection of truth, and the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>BUT I ſhall delve much deeper for the root of this practice; and am confident in aſſerting, that it is not founded in the cuſtoms of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular age or nation, barbarous or civilized; but is inherent in the nature of man; is part of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal conſtitution, and coeval with his creation.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE laws were formed for reſtriction, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation given for inſtruction, man walked in the paths of natural liberty: he had a right to every thing his ſtrength or wiſdom could acquire, and to reſent every injury according to his power and magnanimity. This right was indelibly recorded in the texture of his conſtitution: his Creator had given him ſuch paſſions of the mind, and ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of body for the purpoſe, as could by no means be miſtaken. The ultimate object was the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024407_0420_0FC700A4E54AC4A8"/>
of the individual, in its ſuſtenance and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: but the race of mankind greatly encreaſing, their intercourſes and interferences became more frequent. The weak and timid were not able to ſtand againſt the ſtrong and courageous: they loſt their property, and had not ſtrength to recover it: they received inſults and injuries, and had not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to reſent. At length they had recourſe to cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to obtain that ſecurity which they could not accompliſh by valour; and formed a device which ſhould put the weakeſt upon a footing with the ſtrongeſt of their own ſpecies. This was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of civil ſociety. A ſolemn compact was made, wherein every individual, for himſelf, and for his poſterity, reſigned his natural liberty, and natural rights, into the hands of the collective body of the whole.—And what did the individual receive in return? Why a ſolemn aſſurance, that all his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould be redreſſed, his property ſecured, and his perſonal rights and dignities ſupported and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by <hi>the whole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT is on this compact that I ground my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in defence of duelling. The powers of this <hi>whole,</hi> or of ſociety, are exhibited and exerted in the execution of laws. To the laws, therefore, muſt every individual apply for juſtice. And I do not heſitate to acknowledge, that in all caſes,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024407_0421_0FC700AE1CD272D0"/>
where the laws can give compotent ſatisfaction, no man ought to attempt the redreſs of his own wrongs. But if there ſhould be caſes wherein a man may ſuffer the moſt attrocious injuries, and the moſt provoking indignities, for which the laws have made no proviſion at all, or no adequate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, I ſay recourſe may and ought to be had to original natural rights for redreſs; the compact between the <hi>whole</hi> and the individual having been ſo far violated on the part of ſociety.</p>
                     <p>FOR inſtance; if my neighbour ſhould claim a title to my land, it would be very abſurd in me to ſend him a challenge to determine on titles by ſword and piſtol. The laws of the country are quite competent to this buſineſs, and by the ſocial compact aforeſaid, I, or my anceſtors for me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſubmit the determination to them. But if an adverſary, either in my preſence, or behind my back, ſhould load me with unmerited abuſe, ſtain my reputation with injurious falſehoods, and ſcandalize me with the approbrious terms of <hi>rogue, raſcal, ſcoundrel, villain,</hi> &amp;c. how am I to obtain redreſs? I appeal to the laws; the learned judge puts on his ſpectacles, and after turning over his common place book, and referring to many folio authorities, he tells me, with phlegmatic ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that he can find no ſuch words there: that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024407_0422_0FC700AF45D59B48"/>
the law has aſſigned no meaning to theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations; and that my action will not—Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and earth! what has my wounded honour to do with law meanings? Hath not all the world agreed in the obloquy of theſe terms? Do they not imply every thing that is baſe, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and contemptible? But they are not known in law. Very well; I appeal then to thoſe laws which are not too learned to underſtand, nor reluctant in recognizing the manifeſt injury that has been done to me; I appeal to the court of nature, where I am ſure my action will lie. I ſay, that in ſuch inſtances, the compact with my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors hath been broken by ſociety; and that neither they, or myſelf, ever gave up this right of appeal.</p>
                     <p>IT ſeems then ſufficiently manifeſt, that I ſtill retain a natural right to reſent thoſe injuries for which the laws of ſociety have made no proviſion. But how am I to do this? By ſecret machinations! by poiſons! by aſſaſſination! No—Heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid! Neither the laws of nature, or of honour, juſtify ſuch treacherous practices. I reproach my adverſary with the unprovoked wrong. I call him forth to defend the licentiouſneſs of his tongue by the valour of his arm. I generouſly put myſelf upon the ſame footing with my foe. I expoſe my
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024407_0423_0FC700B028846BD8"/>
life in defence of my reputation, which is dearer than life, and depend upon Heaven, and the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my cauſe, for the important event.</p>
                     <p>IT is in vain to oppoſe a few ſophiſtical reaſons and vulgar prejudices, to a cuſtom authoriſed by nature, confirmed by the practice of every age and nation, ſanctified by divine permiſſion, and avowedly eſtabliſhed by the civil law.</p>
                     <p>IT may be thought that I have ventured too far in theſe aſſertions; but I have ventured no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I can well juſtify.</p>
                     <p>THAT it is authoriſed by nature, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſufficiently ſhewn. That it hath been the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every age and nation, will not be denied. Hiſtory abuduantly proves it. That it hath been ſanctified by divine permiſſion, may be ſhewn in many inſtances. Not to be tedious, I ſhall only refer to the famous duel fought between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah</hi> in the valley of <hi>Elah.</hi> But that this cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or at leaſt the principle on which it is founded, is eſtabliſhed by the civil law, requires a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.</p>
                     <p>I aſk, then, in what law of nature is the law of nations founded which juſtifies public war?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024407_0424_0FC700B1B5A35A90"/>
What ſay the books? The moſt approved writers on this ſubject? They tell us, that if a diſpute happens between two princes, or the nations over which they preſide, there is no power on earth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to determine the controverſy. There are no degrees in ſovereignty. Nations are to be conſidered as individuals in a ſtate of nature, and the civil law is nothing more than the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſpecting individuals applied to nations, ſo far as that can be done with conſiſtency. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay theſe authorities, as there is no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge impowered to determine a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy between nation and nation, the parties muſt, and have a right to, take up arms, and reſt their cauſe on the bloody arbitrament of war; truſting that Heaven will favour the right. In fact, the contending nations fight a great and mighty duel. And are not theſe the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon which I have endeavoured to juſtify private duels? If all the powers of earth ſhould agree to a form a national ſociety, and ſhould reſign their reſpective individual ſovereignties into the hands of <hi>the whole,</hi> and form a ſyſtem of a general law for the adjuſtment of national controverſies, and the redreſs of national wrongs, public war would then become unjuſtifiable, unleſs in caſes where no proviſion had been made by the general ſyſtem: in ſuch caſes the contending
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024407_0425_0FC700BCA8D45CB0"/>
powers would certainly go to war, and fight a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional duel.</p>
                     <p>HAVING been thus large in eſtabliſhing a ſolid foundation whereon to reſt my argument, I ſhall not take up much of your time in what remains. I ſhall rather ſuggeſt hints than dilate opinions on the uſes and benefits which ſociety derives from the exiſtence of this cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>FOR theſe we need only look into the ſcenes of polite life, public aſſemblies, the army, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and the courts of princes. If every hot tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, over-bearing, ill-mannered fellow could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his ſurly humour, or vent his capricious ſpleen without apprehending any conſequences, but ſuch as the heavy paced law might bring on, our ſcenes of pleaſure, urbanity, and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would become bear-gardens of confuſion, reſounding with noiſy broils, and malicious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercations. A duel—the fatal determination of ſword or piſtol is a very ſerious buſineſs. Even the moſt paſſionate and imprudent caveller, will be cautious how he involves himſelf in ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an affair. And this conſideration keeps many a licentious ſpirit within the limits of decorum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:024407_0426_0FC700BE7019C050"/>A prudent man will take every reaſonable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very honourable, means to prevent a quarrel from coming to ſo critical an iſſue, and will advance as far towards explanation and reconciliation as may be conſiſtent with his enjoyment of that reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem, without which life itſelf is of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value.</p>
                     <p>I readily acknowledge, that duels ſometimes happen upon too trivial occaſions; and that the rational and honourable means of clearing up miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and reconciling differences, are not always employed as they ſhould be; but the abuſe of any principle or practice ſhould not be admitted as an argument for its abolition,</p>
                     <p>LASTLY, the rays of beauty ever gild the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of the brave. He who has not ſpirit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own honour, will make but a poor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the delicate ſex. The lovely nymph will turn aſide from the ſighing inſignificance of the perfumed coward; and ruſh to meet the hero, panting with love and the toils of war. When an <hi>Alexander</hi> and a <hi>Thais</hi> unite, every voice is ready to join in chorus with the poet.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>WE have invited you to this place, and you have condeſcended to accept of our invitation. It is rather too late now to enquire what our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities can furniſh for your entertainment; or, what your expectations ought to be. Here we are, and notwithſtanding much ſelf-ſufficiency and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering hope, on the part of my companions, it turns out juſt as I expected; that we muſt depend on your good nature for a favourable reception, and not on the excellence of our performances.</p>
                     <p>MY own opinion was much oppoſed to the whole ſcheme, being greatly apprehenſive, that we ſhould only expoſe ourſelves before ſo polite and judicious an audience. But no—it would be <hi>fourth
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024407_0428_0FC700C740EC63A0"/>
of July</hi>—every one had ſomething clever to ſay on the occaſion—the ſubject would recommend itſelf —the ladies would be pleaſed—the gentlemen would have too much complaiſance to oppoſe their opinions with harſh criticiſms—and all would be well:—I wiſh it may be ſo with all my heart.</p>
                     <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that this public ſpeaking is but a dull kind of entertainment, eſpecially when adminiſtered by young and unexperienced orators, on ſubjects which have been ſo frequently and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveſtigated, as to leave ſcarce a flower in the field for us to gather. In this ſituation what more can we do than make a very good bow at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our ſpeech, and a much better one at the end of it; and ever this is more than we are all able to perform, as you may have already obſerved.</p>
                     <p>IT is cuſtomary with profeſſed and ſkilful ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſupplicate the candid indulgence of their auditors. This is frequently, with them, only a ceremonious compliment; but with us, you may depend upon it, it is a ſincere and earneſt requeſt. For it muſt certainly exerciſe the moſt practiſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to ſee a lad ſtand, bolt upright for half an hour, like the definition of a perpendicular line in Euclid, and utter what he calls a <hi>ſpeech;</hi> or to ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther

                        </gap> oration; as if eloquence was the produce of agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of body and ſtrength of lungs. The only apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy that can be made is, that we do the beſt in our power, and are in hopes of performing better hereafter.</p>
                     <p>TO ſpeak in public with propriety and effect, requires many talents, natural and acquired. The object of all public ſpeaking is <hi>perſuaſion:</hi> to make other people believe or act according to the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's mind. For this purpoſe, it is neceſſary that the orator ſhould have a <hi>pleaſing addreſs, a lively imagination, a thorough knowledge of his ſubject, and a good ear,</hi> with reſpect to the language in which he is to deliver his ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>FIRST impreſſions have an unavoidable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the mind. The moſt judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial hearers conceive ſome predilection for, or prejudice againſt, the ſpeaker on his very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. It is, therefore, of great importance, that a genteel manner, and graceful addreſs, ſhould beſpeak the favourable attention of the audience; otherwiſe, the orator will not only have to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the difficulties incident to his ſubject, but muſt alſo labour againſt a foreign influence: whereas a genteel figure, graceful deportment, and a pleaſing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024407_0430_0FC700CDDF58F6A0"/>
addreſs, ſometimes operate in his favour to greater advantage than all the force of his arguments; and what is of infinite importance, he is ſure of the good opinion of the ladies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A lively imagination</hi> will enable the orator to throw an air of novelty over his ſubject, and to preſent it in points of view in which it hath not frequently been conſidered. To enforce his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with apt alluſions, and embelliſh the whole with ſtriking metaphors. To hear a dull and hackneyed ſubject elaborately diſcuſſed by a dull and phlegmatic ſpeaker, affords about as much entertainment, as to hear a demonſtration from Euclid, proving a propoſition, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; or a ſtring of logical ſyllogiſms, proving nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A thorough knowledge of his ſubject,</hi> I have laid down as the next requiſite in a public ſpeaker. This, I confeſs, is not abſolutely neceſſary; as there are many who make a very tolerable figure without it. It might, indeed, be extremely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to make this rule ſtrict and general, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there would be danger of ſilencing one third of the gentlemen of the bar; one-half of the orators of the pulpit; and three-fourths of the ſpeakers in parliaments and houſes of aſſembly:
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024407_0431_0FC700CEE4E140F0"/>
yet it ſeems but reasonable, that an author ſhould have ſome knowledge of the ſubject he is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and, therefore, this rule is rather recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended than inſiſted upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A good ear</hi> is the laſt mentioned, though not the leaſt important qualification of a good ſpeaker. If his language is pure, his periods harmoniouſly arranged, and his voice melodiouſly adapted to the conſtruction of every ſentence, the orator will not fail to charm his hearers, even though there ſhould be but a very ſcanty portion of ſolid ſenſe diluted in his flowing rhetoric. The mind is inſenſibly captivated by pleaſing ſounds, and the moſt obdurate judgment yields to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic influence of ſweet harmony. It is, therefore, abſolutely neceſſary that authors of little ſenſe ſhould pay great attention to the powers of ſound; for every hearer expects to be either inſtructed or pleaſed; and he has a right ta expect it.</p>
                     <p>IT is next to impoſſible to lay down rules for harmonious compoſition. When words and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are ſo arranged, as to produce a pleaſing melody, all acknowledge the effect, but none can point out that particular conſtruction in which the magic conſiſts. Grammar rules have nothing to do with it; for a ſentence may be ſtrictly gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024407_0432_0FC700D0763E5A40"/>
and yet as offenſive to the ear as the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of a ſaw. For inſtance, obſerve the contraſt between the two following ſentences; both of which are equally unexceptionable in point of grammar.</p>
                     <p>"SOME have a happy talent of expreſſion, whereby they compenſate the want of ſentiment, by the melody of their ſtyle; their language, ever flowing like a wave of the ſea, and their periods cloſing in ſuch muſical cadence, that the ear is faſcinated by the magic of ſound, and the mind lulled in a pleaſing repoſe."</p>
                     <p>"OTHERS, without giving to grammar rules offence, ſhall arrange ſo unſkillfully their words, breaking, as it were, and interrupting the ſenſe, or rather nonſenſe, they mean to inculcate, by frequent (and oft-times unneceſſary) parentheſis, that the ear ſtumbles through the rugged para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, as the feet would ſtumble in ſcrambling through a ſtreet, when the pavement had been broken up, over bricks, ſtones, and poſts, mixed together confuſedly."</p>
                     <p>A fine ſpeech, like a fine lady, enforces atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and captivates the heart. When it deſcribes
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024407_0433_0FC700DB5F9DC000"/>
pleaſing objects, it is beautiful nature, dreſſed by the graces; when it ſoars in the ſublime, it ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſoul, and animates the nobler paſſions: it gives to perſuaſion irreſiſtible force, and bids the tear of pity fall, like the dew of heaven—gently fall—on virtue in diſtreſs.</p>

                     <p>I AM ſenſible of the dangers and difficulties to which an orator expoſes himſelf, who boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures to oppoſe public prejudices, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict eſtabliſhed opinions, and yet without this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary heroiſm, philoſophic truth had never been brought to light. A rigid adherence to doctrines generally admitted, would have fixed us at this day in the errors of ancient ſyſtems, or have left us involved in the whimſical vortices of the modern <hi>Deſcartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE generality of mankind receive for truth, whatever may be handed to them as ſuch, by thoſe whom they have been accuſtomed to eſteem as men of profound learning. They are not anxious to enquire for themſelves; becauſe enquiry is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with trouble, and it is much eaſier for them to adopt the opinions of others, than to form opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for themſelves. Had aſtronomers told the multitude, that the ſun is twice the diſtance, or but
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024407_0435_0FC700DEC0536F60"/>
half the diſtance from the earth, that he is now ſuppoſed to be, it would have been ſo believed; not one in a million would have thought of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the error by calculation. But woe to the man who attempts to unhinge the popular ſyſtem! <hi>Galileo</hi> was impriſoned and perſecuted for aſſerting that the earth revolved on its axis, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled publicly to renounce a truth of which he was fully convinced, and of which there is now no doubt remaining.</p>
                     <p>THESE preparatory obſervations I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as an apology for the manner in which I propoſe to handle the ſubject aſſigned to me: to wit, <hi>the uſe and advantages of what are called the learned languages in the education of youth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THESE advantages ought, indeed, to be very great and manifeſt to compenſate for the precious time ſpent in acquiring them. Let us, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if poſſible, lay aſide former prejudices, and conſider the ſubject with candour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality.</p>
                     <p>THE benefits to be expected from the ſtudy of the dead languages, muſt, I think, flow from ſome or all of the following ſources. It muſt either
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024407_0436_0FC700E7AFA03320"/>
open a door of knowledge, to which there is no other means of acceſs, or will poliſh the manners, and enrich the mind with ideas not otherwiſe to be acquired; or will ſerve as a key to all other languages, and become a vehicle of univerſal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
                     <p>WITH reſpect to the firſt I venture to aſſert, and think it will hardly be controverted, that there is no ancient author, Latin, Greek, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew; philoſopher, hiſtorian, or poet, of any reputation, whoſe exiſting works have not been tranſlated by able hands into moſt of the modern languages of Europe. So that there can be no knowledge contained in thoſe works to which the reader of the preſent day may not have acceſs by the eaſy medium of his native tongue. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ancients have been minutelv ſcrutiniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every article of value held up to public view, and faithfully reflected from the mirrours of modern languages.</p>
                     <p>NEITHER can I ſee, in the ſecond place, how an acquaintance with the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew tongues ſhould neceſſarily poliſh the manners, or enrich the mind with ideas not otherwiſe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Is there an inherent magic, a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fecundity, in thoſe ancient languages which
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024407_0437_0FC700E88EBAA910"/>
modern modes of ſpeech cannot boaſt? When a plain man reads in his Bible theſe words:
<q>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God;</q>
has he not the ſame ideas ſuggeſted, and an equal comprehenſion of their meaning with the learned ſcholar when he teads in loftier tone, "<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>."—Surely there can be no difference. As to poliſhing the manners, a minute and technical knowledge of the learned languages hath an effect ſo notoriouſly to the contrary, that to call a man <hi>a mere ſcholar,</hi> is as much as to ſay, he has no manners at all.</p>
                     <p>BUT perhaps languages, like medals, acquire a value merely from their antiquity. If ſo, we ought to eſtabliſh ſchools for teaching the Chineſe tongue, which is certainly more ancient than either Latin or Greek, and, as ſome contend, than even the Hebrew itſelf. Look where we will for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing pre-eminence in theſe dead languages, ſuch as may juſtify the great expence of time and ſtudy neceſſary to acquire them, and candour muſt acknowledge that ſuch pre-eminence is not to be found.</p>
                     <p>BUT, ſays the third poſition, they ſerve as a key to all modern languages, and may be made a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal means of communication.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:024407_0438_0FC700E9EE7A1DF8"/>THE only purpoſe of language is to convey ideas. If modern ſpeech does this, it is complete; if it does not, it is no language. What neceſſity then for a key? When a perſon ſays <hi>a houſe,</hi> or <hi>a man,</hi> is he not as well underſtood as if he ſhould add, that the one was called <hi>domus,</hi> and the other <hi>homo,</hi> by the ancient Romans? <hi>Terms</hi> are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arbitrary; and general conſent alone adapts them to the things they are deſigned to repreſent. And ſurely the general conſent of the moderns is as reſpectable and valid as the general conſent of the ancients. The truth is, there is no natural connection between <hi>words</hi> and <hi>things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IF ſuch a connection was to conſtitute the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a language, we muſt acknowledge, that the infant excels in propriety when he calls a ſheep <hi>baa,</hi> or a dog <hi>bow-wow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT the Latin tongue, it is ſuppoſed, may ſerve as a univerſal means of communication between people of different nations. True; and ſo may any other language, if univerſally admitted and taught. The Latin tongue does not ſeem to be peculiarly and excluſively adapted to this purpoſe. For, notwithſtanding that it has been inculcated with ſo much aſſiduity by innumerable private tutors, and public ſchools, for ſo many hundred years;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024407_0439_0FC700F0D76570E0"/>
yet the French, is at this day, a more univerſal language than the Latin. The experiment has been fairly made and urged to the extent; yet but few write in Latin, and fewer ſtill uſe it as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of converſation. As to Greek, it is no where in faſhion but in the ſchools; and none but the Jews make uſe of the Hebrew. To what purpoſe then are ſo many years ſpent in acquiring theſe obſolete languages? Why, truly, that one in ten thouſand may read ancient authors in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, whilſt the unhappy ten thouſand muſt put up with faithful tranſlations.</p>
                     <p>AN obſervation or two on the method of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe learned languages ſhall cloſe my ſpeech on this occaſion, which I perceive <hi>ſome</hi> think is already longer than it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>IT might ſeem ſtrange to aſſert, that few teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a language, according to the preſent mode of teaching, have any taſte for its beauties or knowledge of its powers. And yet this is manifeſtly a general truth; accuſtomed, as they are, to treat it by detail, and hackneyed in a critical conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its component parts, they, almoſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, loſe all ſenſe of its general effect, and become ſtrangers to that ſpirit of expreſſion, in which its principal elegance conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:024407_0440_0FC700F4536E6938"/>FOR the ſame reaſon, the pupil never acquires a true taſte for the learned languages, till after he has been emancipated from the ſhackles of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical inveſtigation.</p>
                     <p>TO teach a language by means of its grammar is beginning at the wrong end; for no language ever originated in a grammar: and what is worſe, all the energy and ſpirit of a language muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily evaporate in a grammatical conſtruction. Let us take an example from our own tongue. Suppoſe the following paſſage, from <hi>Mr Pope,</hi> to be put into the hands of a boy learning Engliſh.</p>
                     <l>"Heaven firſt taught letters for ſome wretch's aid,</l>
                     <l>"Some baniſh'd lover, or ſome captive Maid.</l>
                     <l>"They live, they ſpeak, they breathe what love inſpires</l>
                     <l>"Warm from the ſoul, and faithful to its fires:</l>
                     <l>"The virgin's wiſh, without her fears impart,</l>
                     <l>"Excuſe the bluſh, and pour out all the heart;</l>
                     <l>"Speed the ſoft intercourſe from ſoul to ſoul,</l>
                     <l>"And waft a ſigh from Indus to the pole."</l>
                     <p>FORTHWITH the learned grammarian, and his induſtrious pupil, fall to work on theſe beatiful lines. They mince them without mercy into verbs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, nouns and pronouns, ſubſtantives and adjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, gerunds, participles, articles and particles; and God knows what. But in this general laceration,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024407_0441_0FC700F5219C81E8"/>
What will become of the melody of the verſe, the delicacy of ſentiment, the elegance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, with many nameleſs graces, not defined in the rules of grammar? Alas! all would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in the ſcholaſtic proceſs. As well might an anatomiſt diſſect a living body, with a view to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the nature and ſeat of the ſoul that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates it, as a grammarian to inveſtigate the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a language, by reſolving it into its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent parts.</p>
                     <p>BUT what would this author ſay, could he be a witneſs of ſuch a chemical diſtillation of his charming lines? or what would <hi>Horace</hi> do, if he could be preſent in a modern ſchool, and hear one of his elegant odes frittered into all the ſmall ware of the ſyntax? What would he do? He would break the pupil's head, and put the tutor to death.</p>
                     <p>BUT my zeal for truth is hurrying me beyond the bounds of diſcretion; the time may come when teachers will be convinced that languages are not to be ſquared by rule and compaſs, as lands are ſurveyed; and that it is not neceſſary to ſearch antiquity for the means of a reciprocal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of ideas; and that languages moſt in uſe, are, in truth, the moſt uſeful to be known.</p>

                     <p>MY fellow ſtudent has entertained you with a diſſertation on the learned languages, and added ſome ſtrictures on the method of teaching them in modern ſchools. He has handled the ſubject in his own eccentric way; and has, I doubt not, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from this polite audience all the credit his ingenuity deſerves.</p>
                     <p>BUT ingenuity is not truth; and falſe reaſoning, however varniſhed with wit, is falſe reaſoning ſtill.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not attempt to imitate my friend in the vivacity of his ſtile; but he muſt excuſe me, if I endeavour to expoſe the fallacy of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſcue ſo conſiderable a branch of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern education from the obloquy his caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour hath been pleaſed to throw upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:024407_0443_0FC700FE58A96A60"/>HAVING myſelf been duly fermented with gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic froth; kneaded and moulded by the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the ſchools; baked, and as it were, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hot from the claſſical oven, and incruſted with ſcience, can I hear theſe ſlanders on the learned languages, which I have been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to reſpect, and which I have acquired with ſo much painful ſtudy, and yet ſit ſilent by? No! the fire of old Rome, and the ſpirit of Athens, will not brook ſuch indignity.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt aſſertion, and indeed the ground on which he chiefly reſts, is, that all ancient authors of any repute have been tranſlated into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern languages; from which he infers, that the originals are of no further uſe. He might with equal reaſon have ſaid, becauſe a ſhadow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the true out lines of the ſubſtance, it is of equal value, and will anſwer the ſame purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>BUT there are numberleſs beauties to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the ſcholar in the original, and a force and propriety ariſing from what is called the <hi>idiom</hi> of a language which no tranſlation can convey: not only this, but the real meaning of the author, even in the original, is not always preciſely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained by the learned themſelves—how then ſhall it be found in a tranſlation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:024407_0444_0FC7010123B76EC0"/>TO prove this, we need only look at the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous notes upon Horace, or the various rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Virgil, in which the moſt profound ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars have differed in opinion; and about which they have diſputed, confuted, and refuted each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time immemorial. What delightful obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! What glorious uncertainty! Will a tranſlation furniſh any thing like this? Surely not. The terms of a known and living language are too well underſtood to admit of much altercation. All is a dead or languid preciſion. The ſyſtem, the the doctrines, the arguments of a modern author may be queſtioned and canvaſſed; but ſeldom his meaning, if he has any meaning at all.</p>
                     <p>THE great and excellent uſe of the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages conſiſts, in my opinion, in the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
                     <p>FIRST, They afford the moderns an inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſource of ingenious altercation and profound conjecture: and,</p>
                     <p>SECONDLY, By deriving the technical terms of every art and ſcience from theſe languages, a myſterious obſcurity is obtained which throws a veil over the face of truth, and ſcreens the rays of of knowledge from vulgar eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:024407_0445_0FC701072CF4D9A0"/>AS to the firſt; in the various readings of ancient authors, in notes, critical and explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and in notes upon thoſe notes, what a field is opened for profound erudition! And when the modern commentator finds himſelf hard puſhed, it is but ſuppoſing an error to have crept into the text; it is but altering a letter or two, as occaſion ſhall require, and he can make the original ſupport his comment with all the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſon in the world. And however a brother critic may diſpute his conjectures, he is ſure that the author himſelf will never come back to decide the conteſt and put him to ſhame. An obſcene ſentence will furniſh a literary feaſt, and one half of a long Greek or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word has been ſufficient to occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>on a ſchiſm, and give the world a new religious ſect.</p>
                     <p>I know of no modern author ſo rich in this kind of learning as <hi>Shakeſpeare.</hi> He wrote on the verge of the old and modern Engliſh, and has ſo blended the idioms of the writers of his day, with thoſe of their grandfather's, as to occaſion much delightful uncertainty and ingenious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentating. This, together with the incorrect manner in which his works have been handed to us, have afforded a glorious opportunity for gueſs-work: and <hi>Pope, Warburton, Theobald, Johnſon,</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:024407_0446_0FC70108BB07C548"/>
and many others have exerciſed their talents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>BUT I haſten to the ſecond advantage I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as peculiar to the dead languages; to wit, that by deriving terms from them into the arts and ſciences, a myſterious obſcurity is obtained, which throws a veil over the face of truth, and ſcreens the rays of knowledge from vulgar eyes.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the barbarous nations of the north over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Europe, they obliterated almoſt; every trace of ſcience: a few monks only were in poſſeſſion of the ſeeds of learning, contained in the remaining works of ancient authors. When the day of knowledge again began to dawn, theſe manuſcripts were held in great repute; and when printing was invented, copies of them were exceedingly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. As theſe were then the ſources of ſcience, no man was eſteemed learned, who had not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the languages in which they were written. Such was their uſe at that time: very different, but not leſs important, is their uſe at this day: by means of repeated tranſlations, the treaſures of the ancients have been laid open to public view. Science, diveſted of myſtery, would loſe its value, and men of learning forfeit that reſpect which the vulgar owe to profound erudition, were it not that
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024407_0447_0FC7010A2BEE3B28"/>
the philoſopher, the ſcholar, the man of ſcience in every department, hath taken care to borrow a profuſion of technical terms from the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which throws a mantle of myſtery over his profeſſion, and covers the ſecrets of his art from the admiring multitude: ſo that modern learning conſiſts, not ſo much in the ſtudy of <hi>things,</hi> as in the knowledge of <hi>terms.</hi> The author of <hi>Hudibras</hi> very juſtly obſerves, that</p>
                     <l>"All a rhetorician's rules</l>
                     <l>"Teach nothing but to name his tools."</l>
                     <p>AND ſo it is, for the moſt part, in every ſcience —and ſo it ought to be—for if it were otherwiſe; if the terms uſed by men of learning were given in the vulgar tongue, every body would underſtand them, and ſcience ſoon become contemptible. For inſtance; a grave and learned phyſician thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his patient:
<q>Sir, your diſorder is an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrax,</hi> and I ſhall preſcribe an emollient <hi>cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                        </q>
The poor man is filled with fear, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and reſpect: but had he been told in plain Engliſh—
<q>You have got a boil, and muſt apply a poultice of bread and milk;</q>
he would deſpiſe both the doctor and the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>IT is the Greek and Latin languages that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024407_0448_0FC7011094753A78"/>
theſe high ſounding words, ſo ſingular to the ear, when the ſenſe is concealed.</p>
                     <p>SOUNDS have a delightful effect upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind; eſpecially articulated ſounds: and the effect is ſtill more certain, when they have either no meaning at all, or the meaning is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                     <p>AN ignorant woman, weeping aloud under the influence of a powerful preacher, was aſked the cauſe of her lamentation: Oh, ſir! ſaid ſhe, don't you hear thoſe charming words, <hi>Meſopotamia, Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia,</hi> and <hi>Phrygia?</hi> And I knew a lady during the late war, who did not poſſeſs one political principle, or had any preciſe idea of the real cauſe of conteſt between Great-Britain and America, and yet was a profeſſed and confirmed <hi>tory:</hi> merely from the faſcination of ſounds. The <hi>imperial crown,</hi> the <hi>royal robes,</hi> the <hi>high court of parliament,</hi> the <hi>lord chancellor of England,</hi> and ſo on, were words of irreſiſtible influence. Whilſt captain <hi>A,</hi> the taylor; colonel <hi>B,</hi> the tavern-keeper; and even <hi>general Waſhington,</hi> the farmer, only created con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But I am perſuaded, if ſome Indian chief, with a long Cherokee or Mohawk name, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024407_0449_0FC70113665A9E68"/>
our armies, ſhe would have thought much more reſpectably of the American cauſe.</p>
                     <p>THIS being truth, and a truth founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will any one pretend to ſay, that the Greek and Latin languages are of no uſe? What! ſhall we call things by downright vulgar Engliſh names? Shall not the phyſician have his <hi>paregorics</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpaſmodics;</hi>
his <hi>lenitives</hi> and <hi>ſedatives;</hi> his <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſtics, cathartics,</hi> and <hi>diuretics?</hi> Shall not the lawyer have his <hi>fieri facias,</hi> his <hi>ſcire facias,</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorares?</hi>
Or the divine his <hi>latitudinarians, millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, ſublapſarians,</hi> and <hi>ſupralapſarians?</hi> Shall the chymiſt give up his hard words, and the botaniſt his technical terms, in the knowledge of which his whole ſcience conſiſts? Deplorable will be the ſtate of erudition when this ſhall be the caſe. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, indeed, might encreaſe and become more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally diffuſed; but <hi>learning</hi> would be no more. We might then ſay, ſuch a man is a man of <hi>genius,</hi> of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> of <hi>underſtanding;</hi> but where ſhould we find the man of <hi>profound erudition:</hi> one who would ſpurn at the ſimplicity of nature's works, and plunge in ſyſtem, deeper than common ſenſe could even fathom?</p>
                     <p>BUT thanks to our univerſities, colleges, aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024407_0450_0FC70115CA865600"/>
and ſchools; or rather thanks to the learned languages, which they ſo laboriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate; ſuch as aera, it may be preſumed, is yet far diſtant.</p>

                     <p>YOU have lately been entertained with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, which, for novelty, ſplendor, and decorum juſtly merited univerſal admiration and applauſe. If, beſides the magnificence of the thing itſelf, we take into conſideration the important occaſion that induced it, it muſt be acknowledged to have been an object moſt intereſting and truly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime.</p>
                     <p>YOU will readily ſuppoſe, that I refer to the <hi>grand federal proceſſion,</hi> performed in celebration of that memorable day which gave to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>independence</hi>; and alſo of the late
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024407_0456_0FC70128E5E71C18"/>
happy eſtabliſhment of a liberal and efficient go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, on which the future dignity and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of America is to be founded.</p>
                     <p>TO give ſtability, energy, and reſpectability to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—to concenter the ſtrength of a nation for national purpoſes; and at the ſame time leave to the people at large a full ſecurity in, and enjoyment of, eſſential rights, is a problem in politics which has employed the pens of the moſt enlightened men in every civilized age and country; may we not hope that it was reſerved for the genius of America to ſolve this difficult problem; and ſhew to the world a ſyſtem of government poſſeſſing all the requiſites which theory demands, and producing all the effects which can reaſonably be expected from experiment?</p>
                     <p>THE circumſtances under which our federal conſtitution hath been framed and eſtabliſhed, are ſo new and unprecedented, that we may hope for new and unprecedented good conſequences in its operation.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt outlines of moſt of the political ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems of Europe were originally deſignated by the ſword, not by the pen; were the fruits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or the offsprings of rude neceſſity, not the production of deliberate choice, the conſequences
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024407_0457_0FC70131CDDADC18"/>

                     <p>THUS ſituated, and thus inſtructed, they ſelected, by a free choice, a competent number of tried pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots and able ſtateſmen, to frame for them a ſyſtem of general government.

and it contains within itſelf a conſtitutional right of amendment, when ever experience and concurring opinions, ſhall deem amendment neceſſary; circumſtances ſufficient in themſelves to ſilence all objections. For the people have not given up to their rulers all power, with only a ſcanty reſervation of enumerated privileges for themſelves; but they have delegated enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted powers, reſerving all their eſſential rights.</p>

This done, the members proceed to ballot for the compoſition, whatever it may be; each member taking out one ſubſtantive, one adjective, two verbs, and four particles from the boxes reſpectively; and ſo they proceed, repeating the operation, until they have drawn the number of words, of which, according to a previous determination, the compoſition is to conſiſt. Some ingenious member is then requeſted to take all the ballots or words ſo obtained, and

                  <p>IN the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſection of our conſtitution or frame of government it is written —<q>The members of the houſe of repreſentatives ſhall be choſen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually by ballot, by the freemen of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>on the ſecond Tueſday in October for ever.</hi>
                     </q>
And in the laſt clauſe of the ſame ſection, is alſo written, that the general aſſembly—<q>ſhall have no power to add to, alter, aboliſh, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe</hi> any part of this conſtitution.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:024407_0470_0FC7015FA46CB8E8"/>NOW I ſay, and it is moſt manifeſt, that our late aſſembly have, not by implication, but directly and expreſsly, violated the conſtitution, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged and infringed the eſſential right intended to be ſecured by the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſection.</p>
                  <p>THEY have paſſed a law declaring, that if a free man, however fully entitled to vote, ſhall come on the ſecond Tueſday in October at 30 ſeconds after eight o'clock, and offer his ballot, it ſhall not be received; his right ſhall be forfeited; his vote ſhall be illegal, and of no effect—What! becauſe I am old and infirm—becauſe I have not ſtrength to puſh through a croud, and force a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through contending parties—becauſe I am a peacable, modeſt man, and cannot kick <hi>conſtitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts,</hi> and elbow <hi>republicans,</hi> out of my way, muſt I be disfranchised? muſt I be told—"Sir, you are too late—your vote is good for nothing."—I appeal to the conſtitution—ſee, here it is! It ſays I may vote on the ſecond Tueſday in October— this is the ſecond Tueſday in October—I am qualified to vote, and here is my ticket—<q>You are miſtaken, (ſay the judges and inſpectors) this is not Tueſday—we are advanced 30 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds upon Wedneſday morning.</q>
How can that be gentlemen? Is not a day at leaſt 12 hours long?—ſome ſay 24 hours—<q>Ay! it
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024407_0471_0FC701637A582C28"/>
uſed to be ſo formerly; but the act of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly has altered that matter, and made the ſecond Tueſday in October but ſix hours long, viz. from 2<note n="*" place="bottom">The election ſeldom opened before two.</note> to 8 o'clock.</q>
But, pray gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, here are 40, here are 50, here a hundred citizens want to give in their votes. We are come to exerciſe the right of freemen; the right our conſtitution has given us, according to law— according to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſection of our frame of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and we think the aſſembly cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of this right—"No matter: what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies what you think? Here is the law; read it; you muſt be disfranchiſed for this year at leaſt— you have committed an unpardonable offence— you have forfeited your right—you have come 30 ſeconds after 8 o'clock—Go! Go home! eat hearty, and become ſtout and ſtrong—learn to box, to puſh, to kick, to ſwear, to wrangle and ſcramble, and next year, perhaps, you may ſtand ſome chance, but you muſt not complain now —the law is equitable—it is as good for <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſt</hi> gooſe, as for <hi>republican</hi> gander—ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party may have the benefit of it; but the ſtrongeſt will prevail." But, gentlemen, for God's ſake! I am neither a gooſe nor a gander; I only want to vote. "Away! Away! we will hear no
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024407_0472_0FC70165AAB18508"/>
more; the act of aſſembly ſhuts the door in your face."</p>
                  <p>BUT, ſeriouſly, I look upon this abridgement of the time of voting as a dangerous innovation and direct violation of the conſtitution. It is calculated to ſerve party purpoſes, and to ſecure the preſent reigning influence in the ſeats of power.</p>
                  <p>LET me ſuppoſe a caſe, not impoſſible or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant—may I not ſay, not improbable—Suppoſe a ſet of judges, or inſpectors, or a majority of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be ſtrong in the intereſts of a particular party—Suppoſe a number of voters of the ſame party to be collected together, to go early to the place of election, and take poſſeſſion of all the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues—will it not be in the power of theſe judges and inſpectors to create what delays they pleaſe? to inſtitute ſcrupulous and tedious enquiries? to make many miſtakes, and to be very nice and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in rectifying theſe miſtakes? in ſhort, by a thouſand artifices, not eaſily detected, ſo to ſpend the time allotted, that others may have little or no chance left? Let the proceedings of next Tueſday be well watched: for myſelf, I am no party man; but I have impartially conſidered the conduct of thoſe in power, and have found it ſuch as ought to
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024407_0473_0FC70167648DF8A0"/>
alarm the cool and diſpaſſionate freemen of the commonwealth.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>E they not made the conſtitution a ſtalking horſe to cover their ſiniſter deſigns? Have they not moulded, and expounded, and twiſted it every way (as lord Peter did his father's will) for the advancement of their ambitious views? Have they not reverſed and aboliſhed charters without legal cauſe? Have they not paſſed <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial laws, either to ſerve thoſe they did, or to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe they did not like? And have they not by their late law disfranchiſed many hundred citizens of their right to vote at the general elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? They certainly have—for I am confident, that let the inſpectors, clerks, &amp;c. be ever ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and impartial, it is impoſſible that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted election can be fairly completed within the time preſcribed, viz. from two to eight o'clock; and that, if an account ſhould be taken through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtate, of thoſe who will be <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from voting by this law, they will amount to many hundreds. Heretofore, elections have been known to continue two or three days, and the cloſing of the poll was never attempted till all had a full and fair opportunity. But it ſeems to be a general ſcramble now—firſt come
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024407_0474_0FC7016EA56326D8"/>
firſt ſerved—and wo to your eight o'clock gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>THE charter and eſtates of the college were forcibly wreſted from the rightful poſſeſſors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as it was ſaid, the truſtees had many years ago paſſed a rule which ſeemed to narrow the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that inſtitution: and yet the ſame men, who were then ſuch rigorous obſervers of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inſtitutions, can now abridge the time allowed by our frame of government for voting at general elections, and arbitrarily cut away at leaſt one half of that time—and this ſhall be no offence at all—Lord Peter will expound the conſtitution, and make all right.</p>
                  <p>IF my fellow-citizens ſee this matter in the light I do, they will bring this law to the teſt, by making the following experiment:—let three or four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable citizens (having an indiſputable right to vote) in each or any of the counties, reſerve their tickets till ſome ſhort time after eight o'clock, and then offer them to the proper officers in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of witneſſes. If their votes ſhould be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as they probably will, let a ſuit be inſtituted, and ſo bring the queſtion to a legal iſſue: I am perſuaded there is no court but will adjudge the act to be illegal and of no force, as to this clauſe,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024407_0475_0FC7016F66458410"/>
becauſe the conſtitution is paramount to any act of aſſembly; and it expreſsly declares, that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the ſtate may vote on the ſecond Tueſday in October for ever.</p>
                  <p>IF the aſſembly have a right to limit the time of voting to eight o'clock, they have the ſame right to fix it at ſeven, or ſix, or three: and ſo ſome future aſſembly may take from us the right of voting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, by making the period ſo ſhort, that, by the time the clerks have ruled their books and mended their pens, the golden moments may elapſe, and the minutes of grace paſs away.</p>
                  <p>A curious queſtion in law.—Does the act mean <hi>true</hi> or <hi>apparent</hi> time? For the ſun will on that day be 12 minutes too faſt: be this as it may, it will be very proper that the ſtate-houſe clock ſhould be cleaned, and put under good regulation, previous to the election, and that it ſhould be ſet with great accuracy on the morning of the day (if any morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be allowed to a day of ſix hours) by ſome ſworn artiſt, and in the preſence of the judges. But I don't know what they will do in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where there are no public clocks: the watches of the judges may happen to go a little too faſt, or too ſlow, according to their judgment of the run of votes. For, let me obſerve, that ten or a dozen
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024407_0476_0FC7017216842518"/>
additional votes may be of the greateſt importance in a conteſted election, and change the political complexion of the ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">The effect of this law (as was before obſerved) turned out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expectation of the conſtitutional party who framed it. At the enſuing election, it was manifeſt when eight o'clock drew near, that the run of votes had been in favour of the republican tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: ſoon afterwards a ſtrong body of the conſtitutionaliſts came up to vote, but the clock ſtruck, and it was inſiſted that the election ſhould be cloſed according to the law. The chief-juſtice (M'Kean) who was on the ground, was conſulted on the occaſion, and he gave his opinion, that the election might he kept open for another hour, <hi>to allow for the variation of watches:</hi> but no attention was paid to ſuch an abſurd opinion: the doors were cloſed with great ſhoutings, and the republican ticket was ſucceſsful.</note>

                  <head>A WORD OF ADVICE: OR THE PENNSYLVANIA ASSEMBLYMAN'S VADE-MECUM.</head>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH the conſtitution of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, amongſt other good things, enjoins that the people ſhould chooſe men <hi>moſt noted for wiſdom,</hi> to repreſent them in general aſſembly; yet as electors are not always ſo attentive to this injunction as they ſhould be, it may be preſumed that in ſo promiſcuous a body as our general aſſembly, compoſed of men collected from every part of the ſtate, there may be ſome, to whom a word or two of inſtruction may not be amiſs. To ſuch, if any ſuch there ſhould be in our preſent aſſembly, the following rules of legiſlative conduct are ſubmitted.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:024407_0478_0FC70178E8F4C1A8"/>1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. You are to conſider your election into the general aſſembly of the ſtate, as one of the moſt important events of your life; becauſe the powers with which the conſtitution hath inveſted you, and the duties of your ſtation, are of the moſt extenſive and ſerious conſequences: no leſs than to bear a part in the framing and eſtabliſhing of laws, which are to bind the citizens of this great common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. You are to conſider yourſelf not merely a member for the county which elected you, but a repreſentative of the ſtate at large; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould the ſuppoſed particular intereſts of that county come in competition with the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the ſtate, you ſhould not heſitate in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up: for the public good ſhould be the polar ſtar of your conduct. Members of aſſembly are too apt to think, that if by their vote or influence they can ſcreen the county in which they live from a ſhare of the public burthen, or procure for it ſome extraordinary privilege, they will merit great applauſe from their neighbours, whom they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their only conſtituents. But ſuch narrow principles diſhonour the ſeat of legiſlation. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is one body politic: its diviſion into counties is artificial, and for convenience in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, and other good purpoſes;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024407_0479_0FC7017B857ADCD0"/>
but the true intereſts of each, and of the whole, are inſeparable. Should members of aſſembly accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom themſelves to think otherwiſe, and boaſt of advantages gained for a particular county at the expence of the general good, it would be, as if the left hand ſhould boaſt, that it had cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to make the right hand do the moſt work. If you ought not to conſider yourſelf as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative only of a particular county; much leſs are you to ſuppoſe that it is your duty to ſupport, at all events, the intereſts and influence of a deſignated party. Such a conduct would be a direct violation of your oath of office.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. THE people have veſted you <hi>perſonally</hi> with the power of legiſlation, and you cannot delegate or aſſign that power to any other perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatever. Your conſtituents look for the exerciſe of <hi>your</hi> judgment, and for <hi>your</hi> vote foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereon, and not for another's through you. Attend to arguments and opinions, within and without; make full uſe of every means that may inform your underſtanding: but when you come to give your vote, let that vote be purely and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your own. It would be a wicked proſtitution of the truſt repoſed in you, ſhould you, by any compact with a ſelect number of your brethren, bind yourſelf to give your voice contrary to your
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024407_0480_0FC7017CEA5B3360"/>
judgement: for inſtance, ſhould you hold private meetings with ſuch ſelect members, and engage with them to give your <hi>aye</hi> or <hi>nay</hi> in the general aſſembly, on a queſtion to be agitated, according to the determination of a majority of this private aſſembly,<note n="*" place="bottom">A known practice of the conſtitutional party.</note> this would be a very ſerious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous offence—an offence for which you might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e impeached and diſgraced.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. As the people expect to be governed by laws of your making, it is highly improper to apply to the judges of the ſupreme court to frame bills for you, or to reviſe bills already framed; except in caſes of mere technical knowledge. Judges ſhould have nothing to do with the making of laws, which they are afterwards to explain and execute. It is a determined maxim in politics, that the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and executive powers of government ſhould be kept carefully ſeparate and diſtinct. How very improper would it be, ſhould a judge, in explaining a diſputed point of law, have it in his power to ſay —I know the intention of the legiſlature to have been thus, or thus, <hi>for I myſelf framed and drew this law.</hi> It is always dangerous to ſuffer the judges to tamper with the laws of the land, in any ſtage of their proceſs, either in the making or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them. Much better would it be for the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024407_0481_0FC70189EAC89360"/>
people to receive the laws pure from the ſource of legiſlation, even though a few technical errors ſhould ſometimes occur, than to ſubmit them to be <hi>reviſed, corrected,</hi> and <hi>amended</hi> by the learning of the bench, eſpecially in a conſtitution which admits but of one branch of legiſlature. Should an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion happen wherein the houſe would wiſh to be informed on a mere point of law, the proper way is, to ſtate queries in writing, and ſend them to the judges for their anſwer: but on no account ſhould a bill of the houſe be ſubmitted to their correction. The judges already have a very formidable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the execution of the laws: if, by cuſtom, they ſhould acquire a like influence over the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, the people would be expoſed to all the dangers of an abſolute government, without even the ſmall ſecurity of reſponſibility. If the ſame officious hands are to cook the broth, and make us ſup it, we ſhall ſoon have reaſon to complain of ſcalded mouths and ſick ſtomachs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. As it is of the greateſt importance that the acts of the legiſlature, and the minutes of the houſe, ſhould be preſerved pure and unadul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, it may not be amiſs to keep a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye over the clerk of the houſe, as it is much in his power to play tricks with the laws, minutes, and papers of the aſſembly, ſhould he be ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024407_0482_0FC7018B3A6CD150"/>
To prevent this, it is your duty to ſee that the laws, as ſoon as enacted, are faithfully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately lodged in the roll's-office, and upon no no account ſuffer the clerk to take them to his own lodgings. After the ſeals have been affixed to a law, the houſe, or a committee of the houſe, ſhould never loſe ſight of it, till it is ſafely lodged with the recorder.</p>
                  <p>You ſhould alſo take care that the votes of the houſe are, in due time, entered fairly on the book of minutes, and compared with the rough drafts; and that the printed copies be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, and corrected by, the fair entries; <hi>and not the fair entries made from the printed Minutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſhould frequently inſpect the files of the houſe to ſee that the papers are properly arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and endorſed; for this will enable you to detect the clerk in caſe he ſhould attempt to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, ſecret, or deſtroy any of the papers entruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care. And it would not be a miſs if you ſhould now and then take up a return, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or other paper, which the clerk hath been reading to the houſe, to ſee whether he has given it a faithful reading or not. Theſe attentions are proper, can give no juſt cauſe of offence, and will keep the clerk ſtrictly in his duty.</p>
                  <p n="6">

Theſe may nevertheless well anſwer the purpoſe of their appointment, and diſcharge the truſt repoſed in them, by a conſcientious exerciſe of judgement, firmneſs of mind, and integrity in voting. There are others who can add to theſe qualities the talents of eloquence, reaſoning, and perſuaſion. Should you be of the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, give all poſſible attention to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments urged for and againſt the point in queſtion; but in order to guard againſt the impoſitions of ſophiſtry, the fallacy of which you may not have ingenuity enough to detect, together with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, take into conſideration the character of the ſpeaker. If you have obſerved and know him to be a man of an open, candid, and independent ſpirit, you may with the more ſafety yield to the impreſſions his eloquence ſhall make; but if you have reaſon to believe that he is ſubtle, ſelfiſh, and crafty, or that he is either the tool or the ring leader of a party, hear him with jealouſy, and riſk no more than what ſtrong conviction will juſtify. At all events, let no reaſoning, however ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, induce you to give your vote contrary what you <hi>feel</hi> and believe to be for the promotion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral juſtice and the public good. There is in
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024407_0484_0FC7018E39432248"/>
every good mind an internal ſenſe of right and wrong, which you may ſafely depend upon, even though your underſtanding ſhould not be highly illuminated: and it will be better to run the riſk of an error of judgement than not to vote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this internal ſenſe. There cannot be a more contemptible ſituation, than for a man ſo highly intruſted to reſign himſelf implicitly to the government of another in the very buſineſs for which he was ſo intruſted. Since the public voice has placed confidence in you, you ought to have confidence in yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>SHOULD you be one of thoſe who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to public ſpeaking, and qualified to take a part in the debates of the houſe, guard againſt a habit of oppoſition, which may inſenſibly grow upon you. In queſtions of trivial importance be content with voting according to your judgement, and reſerve your powers of elocution for great occaſions. Let not the vigour of debate ever puſh you beyond the bounds of civility, or induce you to infringe the rules of the houſe; and never ſuffer your temper to be unhinged—If you do, your opponent will gain an advantage over you, which perhaps, neither the ſubject of debate, nor his arguments thereupon, would have given him.</p>

                  <p>THE bill publiſhed for conſideration, entitled
<q>an act for amending the penal laws of this ſtate,</q>
will probably be taken up before long, in order to be paſſed into a law.</p>
                  <p>So great a revolution in the municipal law of our country, ought not to take place without due conſideration on the part of the legiſlature, and ſuch attention to the ſubject by the citizens at large, as the importance of it ſeems to require.</p>
                  <p>I have daily looked for ſome ſtrictures on this bill in our public papers, and am ſurpriſed to find that it hath hitherto paſſed unnoticed. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a public act is likely to interfere with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts or views of any ſet of men, or party, all hands go to work, and we are diſtracted with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> but meaſures which have

                  <p>A report has been lately made to the houſe, recommending an abridgement of the fees and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries of public officers. Immediately the whole fraternity is in an uproar—the craft—the craft is in danger! At the head of the malecontents, with ſolemn ſtep and ſtately ſtride, appears the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and formidable <hi>Juriſperitus,</hi> ſounding forth his own praiſe, as with a brazen trumpet, and loudly deſcanting on his vaſt abilities and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled ſervices. One might ſuppoſe, from his account, that if the gentlemen at preſent in office ſhould be affronted, and throw up their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the whole commonwealth could not furniſh another ſet of equal wiſdom, integrity, and ſound whiggiſm.</p>
                  <p>THE lamentable outcry of <hi>Juriſperitus</hi> has led me to conſider the bill under conſideration, only in one point of view, viz. the enormous power it will veſt in the judges of the ſupreme court, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to thoſe other powers which have been
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024407_0488_0FC7019D334342B0"/>
from time to time accumulating in their hands. Let us look at the liſt which <hi>Juriſperitus</hi> hath himſelf enumerated.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES the great power and influence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily attendant on the office of chief juſtice—
<q>he is, by vitue of that office, <note n="*" place="bottom">He ſhould have ſaid by virtue of ſpecial acts of aſſembly, or an ordinance of congreſs.</note> judge in the high court of errors and appeals; a judge of the court of admiralty ſeſſions for the United States of America; a judge of the court of admiralty ſeſſions for this ſtate, and a truſtee of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>univerſity. He is alſo to decide upon all claims againſt eſtates forfeited to the commonwealth, and the forfeiting perſons; and has power to perpetuate teſtimony; take care of the perſons and eſtates of ideots and lunaticks; and is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all cauſes relating to alimony and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</q>
To this catalogue our preſent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have added an act to empower the juſtices of the ſupreme court to ſupply defects in the titles to lands, occaſioned by the loſs of deeds, &amp;c. and the now propoſed bill for amending the penal laws, will give them a power to puniſh criminals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their diſcretion, within the limits of fourteen years cruel ſervitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="unknown:024407_0489_0FC6FD0377C6AFC0"/>WHEN we conſider the ſum total of power, and of courſe of influence, thus inſenſibly accumulating in the hands of two or three individuals, it ſeems highly expedient that government ſhould not only avoid further delegations of ſpecial powers; but keep a watchful eye over the exerciſe of thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delegated.</p>
                  <p>THERE is not, in our ſyſtem of juriſprudence, a more formidable body of operative power than that veſted in the judges of the ſupreme court. The executive council, and houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, are compoſed of many individuals, and theſe liable to annual changes; but the judges are few in number, and permanent in office for ſeven years at leaſt, and hold their commiſſions, as <hi>Juriſperitus</hi>
obſerves, in fact, during good behaviour. The exact time at which a judge's commiſſion expires, is not matter of public notoriety: when this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, it may be renewed in ſo ſecret and ſpeedy a manner by his friends in council, that before thoſe who may have been injured by mal-adminiſtration can make complaint, or the people have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of expreſſing their diſguſt, if any there ſhould be, the judge is re-inſtated, and then no dog muſt bark. Exceſſive power has a natural tendency to debauch the beſt diſpoſition; but when it falls into the hands of a proud, capricious, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024407_0490_0FC6FD064CD16EE0"/>
man, its operation ſhould be watched with a jealous eye.</p>
                  <p>THE effect of the propoſed alteration in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws, will be to inveſt the judges of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court with a <hi>diſcretionary</hi> power to puniſh within certain limits. This is, in fact, veſting them with legiſlative authority within thoſe limits. It is a diſtinguiſhing mark of a free government, that the people ſhall know before hand, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the laws annex to every offence; and, therefore, ſuch a ſyſtem is called a government of of laws, and not of men. But within the ſcope of the preſent bill, no offender can tell what his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is to be, till after conviction. The <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> at leaſt, is to be determined by the particular ſtate of mind the judge happens to be in at the time of paſſing ſentence. Vexations and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments may ſend his honour to court in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill humour, and then wo to the culprits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THE knowledge of this part of juriſprudence (ſays Blackſtone, vol. IV. p. 2.) which teaches the nature, extent, and degrees of every crime, and adjuſts to it its adequate and neceſſary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, is of the utmoſt importance to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual in the ſtate. For, (as a very great
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:024407_0491_0FC6FD07612FB658"/>
maſter of the crown law <note n="*" place="bottom">Foſter.</note> has obſerved upon a ſimilar occaſion) no rank or elevation in life, no uprightneſs of heart, no prudence or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of conduct, ſhould tempt a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he may not at ſome time or other be deeply intereſted in theſe reſearches. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the beſt amongſt us, the vices and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable paſſions of others, the inſtability of all human affairs, and the numberleſs unforeſeen events which the compaſs of a day may bring forth, will teach us, upon a moment's reflection, that to know <hi>with preciſion</hi> what the laws of our country have forbidden, and the deplorable conſequences to which a wilful diſobedience may expoſe us, is a matter of univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</q>—<q>The criminal law (p. 3.) ſhould be founded upon principles which are <hi>permanent, uniform,</hi> and <hi>univerſal.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>HOW ſeriouſly applicable theſe maxims and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are in a government, which, from the nature of its conſtitution, muſt ever be expoſed to the virulence of contending parties, will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every one. Under ſuch a government, no judge ſhould be truſted with <hi>diſcretionary</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the adminiſtration of penal law. There is ſufficient reaſon to believe, that a ſcarlet robe is
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024407_0492_0FC6FD0DD1F68E78"/>
not a certain ſecurity againſt the operation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty influence, petulence of temper, or an ambitious thirſt of power.</p>
                  <p>THERE is no reading the bill in queſtion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving, that the burthen of the ſong is, <hi>the diſcretion of the court;</hi> ſuch and ſuch crimes ſhall be puniſhed with a ſervitude not exceeding fourteen years, <hi>at the diſcretion of the court;</hi> ſuch others, not exceeding ſeven years, <hi>at the diſcretion of the court;</hi> and ſo on, in almoſt every ſection. And, finally, the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſection gives to theſe <hi>diſcreet</hi>
judges a power to determine on the reformation of the puniſhed party, and to grant or refuſe him, at their diſcretion, a certificate, announcing to all men, that he is actually ſo reformed. Which certificate is to operate as a legal <q>diſcharge from all claims and demands of the party injured, and alſo as a pardon of the guilt and infamy of the offence, and give the party a new capacity and credit.</q>
The thing would have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete if the act had given theſe demi-gods a power of granting religious abſolution, as well as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>THERE are ſome crimes of ſuch infamy, that the ſtain is not wiped off by the party's ſuffering the penalty of the law. One who has ſtood in
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024407_0493_0FC6FD1117180878"/>
the pillory for perjury, cannot afterwards ſerve on a jury. But the effect of a pardon is to reſtore him, in the eye of the law, to the ſame credit he had before the accuſation (except only in caſes where the blood is attainted). The power of pardon is lodged, in England, (other than in caſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment) excluſively in the crown: and, in Pennſylvania in the executive council. But, by this bill, the power of pardon, after puniſhment, is veſted in the ſame men who awarded the penalty— a power incompatible with the genius of the common law, or the common rules of political prudence.</p>
                  <p>THE common law of England abhors the truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judges with a diſcretionary diſpenſation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; moſt of the inſtances wherein they are ſo intruſted are by virtue of ſpecial acts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and ought to be conſidered as exceptions to the general rules of common law. This reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the diſcretion of judges cannot ſafely be extended to matters of ſo ſerious import, as the awarding a ſevere and diſgraceful ſervitude within the large limits of fourteen days to fourteen years; and afterwards granting a pardon, with all its legal operations, or with-holding it, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of the judge, who, like our preſent chief juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, may be only <hi>a man,</hi> and not <hi>a God,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024407_0494_0FC6FD12088F0E28"/>
the inherent virtues of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>I am far from objecting to the general intent of this bill: I think, with the aſſembly, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh criminal law, which hath hitherto been our model, is by much too ſanguinary, and has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed puniſhments to crimes in very undue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions—proportions not drawn from policy, reaſon, or equity. But this bill, if paſſed into a law, will make the matter worſe than before. I acknowledge, that under the ſyſtem propoſed by this bill, a diſcretionary power muſt be lodged ſomewhere, and think it can no where be lodged ſo ſafely as with the jury who find the fact. The proportion of puniſhment, equitably due according to the nature of the offence, is not a queſtion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the technical ſubtleties of the law; but ariſes from the particular circumſtances of the caſe, all things conſidered; and an honeſt, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and conſcientious jury, are as competent to this purpoſe, as the moſt profound judge. They will neceſſarily have heard the ſtate of the whole matter, with the arguments for the proſecution, and in behalf of the priſoner; and being a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary body, accidentally brought together, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled for the occaſion, are more likely to do ſubſtantial juſtice, than a judge who is ſo hackneyed
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024407_0495_0FC6FD14D84E6980"/>
in criminal proſecutions, as to conſider a citizen accuſed and not convicted, as a cauſe ſtifled, <note place="bottom">Vide Vol. I. p. 202.—Ibid. p. 205.</note> or loſt to the commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>IF juries were ſo entruſted, they would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold their office in higher eſtimation than they do now: they would ſpurn at the idea of their being <note place="bottom">Vide Vol. I. p. 202.—Ibid. p. 205.</note> 
                     <hi>legal machines,</hi> ſubject to the management of the court: and feeling themſelves competent to the buſineſs, would execute their duty with dignity, propriety, and good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>As juries determine the <hi>quantum</hi> of damage in a civil action, there ſeems to be no reaſon why they ſhould not alſo determine the <hi>quantum</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in a criminal proceſs, within ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits as the law ſhall preſcribe.</p>
                  <p>WHY ſhould the legiſlature aſſign ſo large and dangerous a field of power to judges, becauſe of their ſuppoſed law knowledge, in a matter where law knowledge can be of no poſſible uſe? For, after the fact has been fairly found, the ſubtleties of law are at an end, at leaſt they have nothing to do with the intrinſic demerit of the offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:024407_0496_0FC6FD161CE0EDD8"/>I have been told, and I believe it is ſo, that one of the judges framed this bill; no wonder then that the chorus of the ſong ſhould be—<hi>at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the court:</hi> I wiſh they would get the court of admiralty to ſet theſe pleaſant words to muſic; it would delight their honours much, if they have any ears for muſic, but I am told they have none; they would, however, ſtrain hard to bear a bob in the burthen of ſo charming a ſong.</p>
                  <p>REASONABLE objections may perhaps be made to the veſting even a jury with ſuch enormous power. If ſo, I cannot ſee why the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the bill may not be anſwered by annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral crimes, as heretofore defined in law, periods of ſervitude, fixed and aſcertained according to enormities of their reſpective offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ſo make our penal laws leſs ſanguinary. If the portionment of puniſhment ſhould not in all inſtances be ſtrictly equitable, they will at leaſt be <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>known;</hi> and council may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or reprieve, in particular caſes, when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall make ſuch an interference proper and juſt.</p>

two or three individuals. When we ſee judges becoming profeſſed and buſy partymen: when we ſee them conſtantly interfering in the buſineſs of the legiſlature: influencing members of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: drawing reports for committees, and framing bills for the houſe: uſurping juriſdiction not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by law: expounding acts of aſſembly with dictatorial authority at improper times, and in improper <note n="*" place="bottom">At the general election in October laſt the chief juſtice, expounding the law to the judges of the election, told them that although the law directed the buſineſs to be cloſed, and the doors to be ſhut, at eight o'clock, yet they might go on till nine, <hi>to allow for the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of watches.</hi>
                     </note> places; and working every engine to promote their own power and influence—I ſay, when we ſee theſe things, we ſee <hi>ſymptoms</hi> of a growing tyranny, ſtrong as <hi>Bunbury's ſymptoms of horſemanſhip</hi>: we ſee that the diſcretion of ſuch men ought not to be ſo largely truſted. If this act ſhould take place, the form of our government will in effect be changed—It will no longer be <hi>republican</hi> it will be <hi>deſpotic,</hi> at leaſt within the field of criminal juriſprudence, which is a large and important field. For what is depotiſm? but a diſcretionary uſe of power, without being legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amenable for the juſt exerciſe of it. In this ſituation will our judges be by virtue of this act. For who ſhall call them to account? If they
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024407_0498_0FC6FD1F5E3CB518"/>
ſhould award one man four weeks, and another fourteen years puniſhment for the ſame offence— for a crime of the ſame enormity, under all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, will an action lie againſt them, or can they be impeached for the injuſtice? Surely not—The legiſlature having veſted them with <hi>diſcretionary</hi> powers, they will be the ſole judges of that diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>IT is time to look about—Our aſſemblies have been too much diſpoſed to look upon the ſupreme court as a reſervoir for all power, which they knew not where elſe to lodge. Let them take care that this reſervoir does not overflow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge them, with their rights and liberties.</p>
                  <p>I hope my fellow citizens will ſee the danger of the propoſed act for amending the penal laws of the ſtate: that theſe obſervations will induce ſome other hand to take up the ſubject; and that every one will join in checking the exorbitant power of the ſupreme court</p>

                  <head>For the Pennſylvania Packet.</head>
                  <p>I OBSERVE by the paper of this day, that Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday next is appointed by our houſe of aſſembly for taking up the bill called <hi>the penal law,</hi> which has been publiſhed for conſideration, and is now ripe for the forms of legiſlation. This bill ſeems to be of very ſerious importance in the juriſprudence of our commonwealth. Innovations are always to be ſuſpected, and prudence dictates that novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, under the guiſe of improvement, ſhould be ſtrictly ſcrutinized, leſt an oſtenſible benefit ſhould ſerve as an introduction to many overballancing evils. But I truſt that our repreſentatives will proceed with proper caution in a meaſure which will not only change the long eſtabliſhed ſyſtem of penal laws, but will, in effect, amount to a transfer of the great power of apportioning puniſhments to crimes from the ſovereignty of the ſtate, where it certainly ought to be, to two or three individuals, where it certainly ought not to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:024407_0500_0FC6FD27F977BF08"/>I heartily approve of the general purpoſe of this bill, in making penal laws leſs ſanguinary, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting periods of diſgraceful labour in the room of fatal executions and corporal puniſhments; but in as much as it leaves the apportionment of theſe periods to the diſcretion of the ſupreme court, it is a bill pregnant with dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and eſtabliſhes a deſpotic form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment within the field of its operation. For, true deſpotiſm is nothing more than a power to puniſh according to will and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>TRUE it is, that our legiſlature ſtill reſerves the right of aſcertaining the crime; but if the degree of puniſhment is to be determined by the will of the court, it may not be long before ſome learned judge will enlarge on the inconvenience of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature's troubling itſelf with ſuch matters, and prepare a bill for inveſting himſelf, and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with the whole diſpenſation of criminal law.</p>
                  <p>IN a government like ours, it is highly neceſſary to be watchful over the movements of thoſe in whom we confide—much more ſo than in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments leſs free; becauſe thoſe in whom we truſt have the all powerful ſanction of the people at large for whatever they do within the precincts
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024407_0501_0FC6FD29548547D8"/>
of legal power, and it is certainly within theſe limits to ruin us according to law.</p>
                  <p>OUR aſſembly have undoubtedly a right to enact this bill into a law—Let us indulge imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in, at leaſt, poſſible conſequences ſhould it be enacted.</p>
                  <p>OUR judges have unavoidably an official in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the petit jury in criminal trials. They alſo recommend to council for pardon, when they think fit, and the council not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver execute againſt their recommendation; but, as I am told, ſeldom pardon without it. And now, by this bill, they are to be empowered by law to apportion puniſhments to crimes according to their own diſcretion. By their means the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of law and the high prerogative of mercy will be veſted in the ſame individuals—In men ſubject to paſſions and prejudices, are unfit to be ſo highly truſted.</p>
                  <p>SUPPOSE a caſe—<hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> have committed preciſely the ſame offence, viz. Burglary. <hi>A</hi> has reſpectable connections and friends; <hi>B</hi> has none. <hi>A</hi>'s friends are not only reſpectable, but they happen to be of the ſame party in the politicks of the ſtate with his honour: or they belong to
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024407_0502_0FC6FD2C6A74DDB0"/>
the ſame religious congregation. <hi>B</hi> is a foreigner; he has no friends or connections; or, if he has, they are of the adverſe party to the judge—may we not ſuppoſe the diſcretion of the court would exerciſe itſelf very differently with reſpect to theſe criminals, however equal their demerits? A few days may ſerve to expiate the crime of <hi>A</hi>; but <hi>B</hi> muſt labour fourteen years for not having better friends and more powerful influence in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. This may ſeem too ſtrong a caſe; but it is no more than what the law will juſtify. Any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reaſons for ſuch a diſcrimination will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to excuſe the judges as men, for what they may do as officers, under the law.</p>
                  <p>IF it did not appear from the face of this bill that it is a direct violation of our conſtitution, by making our government a government of men, and not of laws in criminal caſes; yet the quarter from which it originated ought to raiſe a virtuous jealouſy in the minds of the people. It is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptom when we ſee men, already high in power, graſping ſtill at more, and ever deviſing ways and means to encreaſe their official influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>TO point out all the evils, and political ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms of the bill under conſideration, would require more time, and more law knowledge, than I can
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024407_0503_0FC6FD2F14EFE8B8"/>
command; but I am confident that ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be injurious to the ſecurity and juſtice intended by the common law, and ſubverſive of the ſpirit of our free conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>I hope our legiſlature will not haſtily part with ſo high a prerogative of ſovereign power, or ſubject the citizens of this ſtate, who may hereafter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, to be puniſhed at the diſcretion of the judges.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with an extract to the purpoſe from 4 Black. ch. 29. pa. 377.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is, moreover, one of the glories of our Engliſh law, that the nature, though not always the quantity or degrees <note n="*" place="bottom">This reſpects pecuniary fines, which, as the author afterwards explains, cannot be fixed preciſely by law, but muſt vary according to the nature of the offence, the abilities of the offender, and other circumſtances.</note>, of puniſhment, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained for every offence; and that it is not left in the breaſt of any judge, or even of a jury, to alter the judgement which the law has beforehand ordained for every ſubject alike, without reſpect of perſons. For if judgments were to be the private opinions of the judge, men would then be ſlaves to their magiſtrates,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024407_0504_0FC6FD368D62A2C0"/>
and would live in ſociety without exactly knowing the conditions and obligations which it lays them under. And beſides, as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents oppreſſion on the one hand; ſo, on the other it ſtifles all hopes of impunity or mitigation with which an offender might flatter himſelf, if, his puniſhment depended on the humour or diſcretion of the court. Whereas, where an eſtabliſhed penalty is annexed to crimes, the criminal may read their certain conſequence in that law which ought to be the unvaried rule, as it is the inflexible judge, of his actions.</q>

                  <head>A SUIT IN THE HIGH COURT OF HONOUR. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>THIS piece of humour was founded on the idea of eſtabliſhing a high court of honour (See vol. I. page, 151), and accidentally occaſioned the following ſingular ANECDOTE.</p>
                        <p>THE piece had been incloſed in a cover, addreſſed to <hi>James Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Eſq. for whom it was deſigned, and ſent to his houſe. Mr Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not being at home, his ſervant received the packet, and ſtuck it behind the parlour looking glaſs. Cap. ††††† who was frequently deranged in his mind, and at ſuch times full of notions of plots and conſpiracies, went into Mr Wilſon's parlour wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hout knocking when none of the family happened to be there; and ſeeing the packet in the frame of the looking glaſs took it down and went off with it.</p>
                        <p>THERE was at this time a cauſe agitated in the ſupreme court of great popular attention, in which <hi>Mr Wilſon,</hi> and moſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the bar, were engaged.</p>
                        <p>THE next day I went to court, and happening to be ſeated near Mr. Wilſon, I aſked him if he had received my packet; he told me he did not get home till late in the evening; that the ſervant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him there had been a letter for him, and that he had put it behind the glaſs; but that it had all at once diſappeared, and no body could give any account of it, although enquiry had been made through the whole family.</p>
                        <p>WHILST we were thus talking, a cry of, make way there! was heard in the court, when capt. †††††, having puſhed his way through the crowd, appeared before the bar with papers in his hand. He interrupted the lawyer who was then ſpeaking, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the judges that he had papers in his hand which would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately clear up and determine the cauſe before the court; and that he had alſo diſcovered a moſt horrible and dangerous plot, partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtate, and partly againſt the judge of admiralty: confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he had made this great diſcovery by breaking into and robbing that gentleman's houſe, pointing to Mr. Wilſon; declaring that ſo far as he was amenable for the robbery, he ſtood ready to ſubmit to the laws.</p>
                        <p>THE papers, which I immediately knew to be mine, were handed up to the bench, and the chief juſtice was preparing to read the contents aloud to the court; but I forced my way to him, and and whiſpered him, that it was only a piece of literary ſport be- Mr. Wilſon and me, and very unfit for the public ear on ſuch an occaſion. The papers were then delivered to Mr. Wilſon, and the audience aſſured that they did not concern the preſent cauſe.</p>

                  <head>A LETTER TO THE REV. DOCTOR WHITE, RECTOR OF CHRIST CHURCH AND ST. PETER'S ON THE CONDUCT OF A CHURCH ORGAN.</head>
                  <p>I AM one of thoſe who take great delight in ſacred muſic, and think, with royal David, that heart, voice, and inſtrument ſhould unite in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great Supreme.</p>
                  <p>A ſoul truly touched with love and gratitude, or under the influence of penitential ſorrow, will unavoidably break forth in expreſſions ſuited to its feelings. In order that theſe emanations of the mind may be conducted with uniformity and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming propriety, our church hath adopted into
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024407_0513_0FC6FD5B6294C498"/>
her liturgy, the book of pſalms, commonly called <hi>David's Pſalms,</hi> which contain a great variety of addreſſes to the Deity, adapted to almoſt every ſtate and temperature of a devout heart, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in terms always proper, and often ſublime.</p>
                  <p>TO give wings, as it were to this holy zeal, and heighten the harmony of the ſoul, <hi>organs</hi> have been introduced into the churches. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of inſtrumental muſic to the purpoſes of piety is well known to be of very ancient date. Indeed, originally, it was thought that muſic ought not to be applied to any other purpoſe. Modern improvements, however, have diſcovered, that it may be made expreſſive of every paſſion of the mind, and become an incitement to levity as well as ſanctity.</p>
                  <p>UNLESS the real deſign for which an organ is placed in a church be conſtantly kept in view, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more likely to happen than an abuſe of this noble inſtrument, ſo as to render it rather an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to, than an aſſiſtant in, the good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which the hearers have aſſembled.</p>
                  <p>GIVE me leave, ſir, to ſuggeſt a few rules for the conduct of an organ in a place of worſhip, according to my ideas of propriety.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:024407_0514_0FC6FD609A495AD8"/>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. The organiſt ſhould always keep in mind, that neither the time or place is ſuitable for exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting all his powers of execution; and that the congregation have not aſſembled to be entertained with his performance. The excellence of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſt conſiſts in his making the inſtrument ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient and conducive to the purpoſes of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. None but a maſter can do this. An ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary performer may play ſurpriſing tricks, and ſhew great dexterity in running through difficult paſſages, which he hath ſubdued by dint of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious labour and practice. But <hi>he</hi> muſt have judgement and taſte who can call forth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the inſtrument, and apply them with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and effect to the ſeriouſneſs of the occaſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. The voluntary, previous to reading the leſſons, was probably deſigned to fill up a ſolemn pauſe in the ſervice; during which, the clergyman takes a few minutes reſpite, in a duty too lengthy, perhaps, to be continued without fatigue, unleſs ſome intermiſſion be allowed: there, the organ hath its part alone, and the organiſt an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſhewing his power over the inſtrument. This, however, ſhould be done with great diſcretion and dignity, avoiding every thing light and trivial; but rather endeavouring to compoſe the minds of the audience, and ſtrengthen the tendency of the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024407_0515_0FC6FD640408A760"/>
heart in thoſe devout exerciſes, in which, it ſhould be preſumed, the congregation are now engaged. All ſudden jirks, ſtrong contraſts of <hi>piano</hi> and <hi>forte,</hi> rapid execution, and expreſſions of tumult, ſhould be avoided. The voluntary ſhould proceed with great chaſtity and decorum; the organiſt keeping in mind, that his hearers are now in the midſt of divine ſervice. The full organ ſhould ſeldom be uſed on this occaſion, nor ſhould the voluntary laſt more than <hi>five minutes</hi> of time. Some relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, however, of this rule may be allowed, on feſtivals and grand occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. The <hi>chants</hi> form a pleaſing and animating part of the ſervice; but it ſhould be conſidered, that they are not ſongs or tunes, but a ſpecies of <hi>recitative,</hi> which is no more than ſpeaking muſically. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as melody or ſong is out of the queſtion, it is neceſſary that the harmony ſhould be complete, otherwiſe <hi>chanting,</hi> with all the voices in uniſon, is too light and thin for the ſolemnity of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There ſhould at leaſt be half a dozen voices in the organ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>llery to fill the harmony with baſs and treble parts, and give a dignity to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Melody may be frivolous; harmony, never.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:024407_0516_0FC6FD6843CD9E18"/>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The prelude which the organ plays imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the pſalm is given out, was intended to advertiſe the congregation of the pſalm tune which is going to be ſung; but ſome famous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſt, in order to ſhew how much he could make of a little, has introduced the cuſtom of running ſo many diviſions upon the ſimple melody of a pſalm tune, that the original purpoſe of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude is now totally defeated, and the tune ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed by the fantaſtical flouriſhes of the dexterous performer, that not an individual in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can poſſibly gueſs the tune intended, until the clerk has ſung through the firſt line of the pſalm. And it is conſtantly obſervable, that the full congregation never join in the pſalm before the ſecond or third line, for want of that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which the organ ſhould have given. The tune ſhould be diſtinctly given out by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with only a few chaſte and expreſſive deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſuch as none but a maſter can give.</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The interludes between the verſes of the pſalm were deſigned to give the ſingers a little pauſe, not only to take breath, but alſo an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for a ſhort retroſpect of the words they have ſung, in which the organ ought to aſſiſt their reflections. For this purpoſe the organiſt ſhould be previouſly informed by the clerk of the verſes
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024407_0517_0FC6FD69AFE1ACD8"/>
to be ſung, that he may modulate his interludes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>TO place this in a ſtrong point of view, no ſtronger, however, than what I have too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved to happen; ſuppoſe the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to have ſung the firſt verſe of the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> pſalm.</p>
                  <l>"Let all the juſt to God with joy</l>
                  <l>Their chearful voices raiſe;</l>
                  <l>For well the righteous it becomes</l>
                  <l>To ſing glad ſongs of praiſe."</l>
                  <p>How diſſonant would it be for the organiſt to play a pathetic interlude in a flat third, with the ſlender and diſtant tones of the echo organ, or the deep and ſmothered ſounds of a ſingle diapaſon ſtop?</p>
                  <p>Or ſuppoſe again, that the words ſung have been the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the vi<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pſalm.</p>
                  <l>"Quite tired with pain, with groaning faint,</l>
                  <l>No hope of eaſe I ſee,</l>
                  <l>The night, that quiets common griefs</l>
                  <l>Is ſpent in tears by me"—</l>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="unknown:024407_0518_0FC6FD6B29FEF230"/>
How monſtrouſly abſurd would it be to hear theſe words of diſtreſs ſucceeded by an interlude ſelected from the fag end of ſome thundering figure on a full organ, and ſpun out to a moſt unreaſonable length? Or, what is ſtill worſe, by ſome trivial melody with a rhythm ſo ſtrongly marked, as to ſet all the congregation to beating time with their feet or heads? Even thoſe who may be impreſſed with the feelings ſuch words ſhould occaſion, or in the leaſt diſpoſed for melancholy, muſt be ſhocked at ſo groſs in impropriety.</p>
                  <p>THE interludes ſhould not be continued above 16 bars in <hi>triple,</hi> or ten or twelve bars in <hi>common</hi> time, and ſhould always be adapted to the verſe ſung: and herein the organiſt hath a fine oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhewing his ſenſibility, and diſplaying his taſte and ſkill.</p>
                  <p n="6">6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The voluntary after ſervice was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to eradicate every ſerious idea which the ſermon may have inculcated. It ſhould rather be expreſſive of that chearful ſatisfaction which a good heart feels under the ſenſe of a duty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. It ſhould bear, if poſſible, ſome analogy with the diſcourſe delivered from the pulpit; at leaſt, it ſhould not be totally diſſonant from it. If the preacher has had for his ſubject, penitence
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024407_0519_0FC6FD789CE1A958"/>
for ſin, the frailty and uncertainty of human life, or the evils incident to mortality, the voluntary may be ſomewhat more chearful than the tenor of ſuch a ſermon might in ſtrictneſs ſuggeſt; but by no means ſo full and free as a diſcourſe on praiſe, thankſgiving, and joy, would authorize.</p>

                  <head>SURVEYING.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE been long urged by an invincible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to attempt ſome thing for the public good, or public convenience, ſo as to render my name famous amongſt the benefactors of mankind. As my deſire is much ſtronger than my abilities, I am obliged to be content with humble attempts at diſcoveries of limited importance; for I confeſs that my genius is not of the higheſt rank.</p>
                  <p>THE project which has lately employed my thoughts, and which I am now about to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, will not be valued as conducive to the happineſs of mankind in a ſerious ſenſe; yet I hope the novelty of the deſign, and its affording a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable gratification at a very ſmall expence, will entitle me to ſome reputation with the public: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it ſhall be conſidered, that I do not, like other projectors and diſcoverers, make an emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ingenuity, but freely give the fruits of my ſpeculations to my beloved fellow citizens,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024407_0521_0FC6FD7AF031D848"/>
in the firſt place, and through to them, to the world at large.</p>
                  <p>I have frequently thought that the arts and ſciences might be extended beyond the limits of their profeſſed objects, and applied with advantage to other purpoſes than thoſe for which they ſeem directly intended. I remember that when I was a boy, my father ſaw me boring a hole with the leg of my compaſſes, for which he reproved me, and adviſed me never to uſe a thing in a way which it was not deſigned—But <hi>Dr. Franklin,</hi> who was preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declared himſelf of a different opinion; and ſaid he had often admired the dexterity of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who would occaſionally ſweep the hearth with the bellows, and blow the ſire with the hearth-bruſh.</p>
                  <p>I once ſaw an elaborate work of an ingenious Frenchman, by which any perſon was enabled to compoſe an infinite number of minuets without the leaſt knowledge of muſic, or any other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a box and dice.</p>
                  <p>THIS readineſs in applying things to purpoſes for which they ſeem not deſigned has often been of the greateſt importance in caſes of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. The adventures of <hi>Robinſon Cruſoe,</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024407_0522_0FC6FD7C69618180"/>
the hiſtories of perilous voyages and ſhip-wrecks, afford innumerable inſtances of the great advantage of ſuch a talent.</p>
                  <p>I am by profeſſion a <hi>ſurveyer</hi>; not indeed of the firſt rate reputation, yet I can execute my buſineſs with tolerable accuracy, and have given ſatisfaction to my employers. I, not long ſince, ſurveyed a tract of land, the boundaries of which were ſo ſingular, that when I came to plot the lines and courſes from my table book, I was ſurpriſed to find that the ſurvey exhibited the lines of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man face. This ſuggeſted to me the idea of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the art of <hi>ſurveying</hi> to the purpoſe of <hi>portrait painting</hi>—Only conſider, candid reader, what an advantage this muſt be to the world—Who is there that does not wiſh to ſee a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful likeneſs of thoſe eminent perſonages he reads of in hiſtory? Their actions indeed are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but theſe may appear in very different lights to different people, and admit of very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous comments, for want of knowing the ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which influenced thoſe actions. Now there is no better way known, of aſcertaining a man's intrinſic character, than by the indication of his countenance: hence the ſcience of phyſiognomy, and the great encouragement <hi>portrait painting</hi>
hath found. But painting on canvaſs is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024407_0523_0FC6FD895FC8CB88"/>
and original likeneſſes very ſcarce. As to <hi>engravings,</hi> they are by no means to be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon; every copyiſt varies more and more from the original: ſo that by the time a man has been dead forty or fifty years, however emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he may have been, the prints bearing his name, are no more like him, than the ſign of the king of Pruſſia in third ſtreet is like that monarch. The thing ſhould be brought to a <hi>mathematical</hi>
certainty. And this, I flatter myſelf, I have been ſo lucky as to accompliſh.</p>
                  <p>THE operation is quite eaſy, both to the party and to the artiſt. There is nothing more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that to take a correct outline of the perſon's profile, by throwing the ſhadow of his face <note n="*" place="bottom">Or of his whole perſon.</note> upon a ſheet of paper—a familiar and well known prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, then let the artiſt take his ſcale and dividers, and carefully meaſure all the courſes and diſtances of the lines which form the boundaries of the ſhadow. By the ſame means of courſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the ſituation, form, and ſize of the eye, eye brow, mouth, &amp;c. &amp;c. may be preciſely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained; and thus by the help of a few letters and figures, may the exact likeneſſes of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages be tranſmitted to poſterity, and made as
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:024407_0524_0FC6FD8B68AB4528"/>
public as a common advertiſement, and at as little expence.</p>
                  <p>WHAT ſatisfaction would it not afford us at this day to be poſſeſſed of an accurate ſurvey of the faces of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Mark Anthony, Cicero, Virgil, Horace,</hi> and other renowned characters, who are now only known by their works and exploits.</p>
                  <p>MY project will, moreover, be particularly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to private families; a man may, in the diviſion of his eſtate, ſo contrive it as to leave his likeneſs in a tract of land. So that his grandſon will have nothing to do but conſult his title deeds, take down the lines and courſes of his farm, and by plotting them on paper may at any time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the portrait of his deceaſed anceſtor, and ſurvey his ground and his grandfather at one and the ſame time; whoſe reſemblance will be thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to his family, ſubject to no variation, but the variation of the needle.</p>
                  <p>MY ſcheme will be ſufficiently manifeſted by an example. And this I ſhall give by tranſcribing from my table book the courſes and diſtances of the tract of land which gave me the firſt idea of applying the practice of ſurveying to the purpoſes of portrait painting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:024407_0525_0FC6FD8CED6B4608"/>THE following is an exact copy of the courſes and diſtances, and the drawing is plotted from them with as much accuracy as the ſubject would admit.</p>
                  <p>FROM an aſſumed point A, run a line S. 67° 30′ W. 52 perches, to a point B; thence N. 5° W. 64 perches to C; thence N. 7° W. 36 perches to D; thence due weſt, 60 perches to E; thence N. 48° E. 110 perches to F; thence N. 13° E. 60 perches to G; thence N. 45° E. 190 perches to H; thence N. 77° E. 108 perches to I; thence S. 5° W. 240 perches to K; thence along the ſame courſe 120 perches to L; thence S. 78° W. 180 perches to M; and thence 30 perches to the place of beginning.</p>
                  <p>THESE lines form external boundaries of the tract. For a further deſcription, the following courſes and diſtances muſt be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>FROM the point A continue the line B A, 100 perches to N; thence N. 29°. E. 48 perches to a point. From the point C a ſoul ditch runs eaſtward 35 perches. From the point D it is 25 perches to the edge of a circular hill bending weſtward, and over D is an eliptical hollow 40 perches long, where it joins the ſouthermoſt part
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024407_0526_0FC6FD8EA7E8EF28"/>
of the circular hill. The ſoil of this eliptical hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is very moiſt and unctuous: and fit for the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of Tobacco—From the point F a piece of woodland runs N. 48° E. 59 perches to a point, and thence tends ſouth-eaſterly 45 perches. This copſe of woods is of an eliptical form, beginning very narrow at F and encreaſing to 10 perches in width at the northernmoſt point of the curve, and thence decreaſes in width to the ſouth-eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternmoſt point, where it is very thin.</p>
                  <p>IN a due north and ſouth line paſſing through the point M, and at the diſtance of 180 perches north of M, aſſume a point 0, and from that point draw a line N. 70° W. 30 perches. From a point in this line, a little to the weſtward of 0, draw another line running ſouthweſtwardly 25 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, forming an angle of 35° with the other line. About 20 perches from the angular point 0 draw a circular line perpendicularly and <hi>looking</hi>
weſtward. Theſe three lines will form a mixed triangle, whereof two of the legs will be right lines, and the third a portion of a ſphere. The northern leg of this triangle is fringed with ruſhes, being the edge of a watery ſoil, it muſt therefore be penciled ſomewhat thicker and ſtronger than the ſouthern leg, which ſhould be rather faintly ſketched than abſolutely drawn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="unknown:024407_0527_0FC6FD98D8E89A28"/>FROM the point G run a line N. 60° E. 150 perches to a point P; thence South 46° E. 20 perches to Q; thence ſouth 30° W. 130 perches to R; thence due ſouth 20 perches to S; thence S. 62° E. 95 perches to T; and thence 70 perches to K.</p>
                  <p>FROM the middle of the line S T, there is a circular piece of riſing ground, being 45 perches on the line S T, and ſtretching ſouth-weſterly 25 perches. At the foot of this riſing ground is a copſe, thick covered with wild bruſh and coarſe underwood, of a circular ſhape, whoſe diameter from N. E. to S. W. is 45 perches, and from N. W. to S. E. 40 perches.</p>
                  <p>ALL the ſpace bounded by the lines G, H, I, K, T, S, R, Q, P, is a cold, moiſt, and barren ſoil, producing nothing but a profuſion of coarſe reeds, rank and long. Theſe have been ſo blown down by weſterly winds, that from G they tend to the E. N. E; from P Q to the N. E. and from R S eaſtwardly. Theſe reeds run over the boundary line I K very ſtraggling and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, ſo as to cover and conceal that line: and therefore the line I K muſt not be drawn abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but only dotted, or traced, being no more than the average courſe of the long reeds. From
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024407_0528_0FC6FD9A2D30EC88"/>
the whole line T K, the reeds run due ſouth, and are very thick and long. All this muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the pencil. Laſtly, all the ſharp angles of the figure muſt be moderately rounded off, and all the lines made ſomewhat arching, but ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The eye of the artiſt will beſt direct him how to dreſs the lines and angles ſo as to anſwer the general deſign.</p>
                  <p>IF the above courſes and diſtances are carefully laid down upon paper, and the directions obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will produce the drawing of a human face: and if the draftſman ſhould have any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable judgment in things of this kind, and a warm imagination, he may fancy that he diſcovers a likeneſs of ſome perſon or other. I plotted my ſcale of ½ inch to 100 perches.</p>
                  <p>I have it in contemplation to improve my device, by aſcertaining, in fixed terms, the manner in which a profile ſo drawn may be coloured to the life, and thereby make the likeneſs perfect. For this purpoſe I had recourſe to <hi>heraldry;</hi> and hoped by means of <hi>or, argent, gules,</hi> &amp;c. to dictate preciſely the complexion, colour of the hair, eyes, &amp;c. but could not find terms ſufficient to expreſs the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary teints: and as to the termination <hi>iſh,</hi> which ſome make uſe of, as in blueiſh, greeniſh, rediſh,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:024407_0529_0FC6FD9B27905390"/>
&amp;c. it is too vague and indeterminate for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Unleſs, therefore, I can find ſome known art or ſcience which will furniſh definitions of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours as certain and intelligible, as ſurveying gives us lines and courſes, I ſhall be obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſet of appellations anſwerable to all the principal colours, and as many of their gradations and mixtures as are uſual in portrait painting. Theſe being once admitted, will ſerve for ever after. Thus, in engraving, the directions of the ſtrokes of the engraver aſcertain the colours or <hi>blazoning</hi> of a coat of arms. When it became generally admitted that horizontal ſtrokes ſhould indicate <hi>blue,</hi> perpendicular ſtrokes, <hi>red;</hi> dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal ſtrokes, <hi>green;</hi> and ſo on, all uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty was removed.</p>
                  <p>PERHAPS Mr. Pine and Mr. Peale may take it into their heads, that I have made this diſcovery public, with a malicious intention to injure them in their profeſſion; but I proteſt before all men, that I have a conſiderable eſteem for thoſe ingenious gentlemen, and would willingly have ſuppreſſed my project out of tenderneſs to them, had not an urgent ſenſe of the duty I owe to my fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at large, overbalanced the influence of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate attachments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="unknown:024407_0530_0FC6FD9CA0E17EE8"/>IT will be in vain for any projector, in France, England, or elſewhere, to diſpute with me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this invention, unleſs he can produce a publication of a ſimilar ſcheme, bearing date prior to this month of November 1784. But, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all miſtakes, I wiſh our philoſophical ſociety would be ſo good as to make a minute of my diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: and it would be ſtill better, if <hi>Mr. Patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

                  <p>A Man who is <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to be entertained may find amuſement in the moſt common occurrences of life.

                  <p>THIS diverſity of diſpoſition is founded in the original conſtitutions of the parties.

of life. His eye immmediately diſcovers any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of countenance, or manner, becauſe he is always loooking for ſingularities; and he finds ſomething to divert him in the moſt common tranſactions, becauſe he is always hunting for diverſion.</p>
                  <p>I have myſelf, ſome tincture of this diſpoſition; and, when diſengaged from more ſerious buſineſs, I ſally forth with a deſign to ſeek for entertainment.

                  <p>ONE fellow drives along with ſuch heedleſs impetuoſity, that he treads in the gutters inſtead of ſtepping over them, and runs againſt the poſts, which he might eaſily avoid.

                  <p>AT another time, I apply to the ſtreets for a different ſpecies of diverſion. I walk round a ſquare, and attend to all the ſcraps and fragments of converſation I can pick up <hi>en paſſant.</hi> When I return home I write theſe on ſeparate pieces of paper: and then amuſe myſelf with arranging them in ſuch order as to produce, if poſſible ſome apparent connection.

Whereupon the phyſician immediately <hi>hoiſts Dickenſon college,</hi> and with equal eloquence deſcants upon its <hi>narrow bottom.</hi>—"Look, ſays the divine, on this capacious diſk—on the one ſide ſits the <hi>pope</hi>; on the other ſide ſits <hi>Luther;</hi> and ſee how ſnug <hi>Calvin</hi> lies between them both." "Its all wrong, replies the phyſician, <hi>Calvin</hi> has no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there: he will be choaked—he will be ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted—he will be ſqueezed to death—here is a fine <hi>narrow bottom</hi> more fit for his accommodation. He can have it all to himſelf—he is a <hi>uſurper</hi> there, but <hi>this</hi> is his own fleſh and blood." From words they proceed to blows.

                  <head>A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN IN AMERICA, TO HIS FRIEND IN EUROPE, ON WHITE-WASHING.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE peculiar cuſtoms of every country appear to ſtrangers awkward and abſurd, but the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants conſider them as very proper and even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Long habit impoſes on the underſtanding, and reconciles it to any thing that is not manifeſtly pernicious or immediately deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>THE religion of a country is ſcarcely held in greater veneration than its eſtabliſhed cuſtoms: and it is almoſt as difficult to produce an alteration in the one as in the other. Any interference of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024407_0540_0FC6FDC222A54728"/>
government for the reformation of natural cuſtoms, however trivial and abſurd they may be, never fails to produce the greateſt diſcontent, and ſometimes dangerous convulſions. Of this there are frequent inſtances in hiſtory. Bad habits are moſt ſafely removed by the ſame means that eſtabliſhed them, viz. by imperceptible gradations, and the conſtant example and influence of the higher claſs of the people.</p>
                  <p>WE are apt to conclude that the faſhions and manners of our own country are moſt rational and proper, becauſe the eye and the underſtanding have long ſince been reconciled to them, and we ridicule or condemn thoſe of other nations on account of their novelty: yet the foreigner will defend his national habits with at leaſt as much plauſibility as we can our own. The truth is, that reaſon has little to do in the matter. Cuſtoms are for the moſt part arbitrary, and one nation has as good a right to fix its peculiarities as another. It is of no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to talk of convenience as a ſtandard: every thing becomes convenient by practice and habit.</p>
                  <p>I have read ſomewhere of a nation (in Africa I think) which is governed by twelve counſellors. When theſe counſellors are to meet on public bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, twelve large earthen jars are ſet in two rows,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024407_0541_0FC6FDC4F9E69220"/>
and filled with water. The counſellors enter the apartment one after another, ſtark naked, and each leaps into a jar, where he ſits up to the chin in water. When the jars are all filled with counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, they proceed to deliberate on the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the nation. This, to be ſure, forms a very groteſque ſcene; but the object is to tranſact the public buſineſs: they have been accuſtomed to do it in this way, and therefore it appears to them the moſt rational and convenient way. Indeed, if we conſider it impartially, there ſeems to be no reaſon why a counſellor may not be as wiſe in an earthen jar as in an elbow chair; or why the good of the people may not be as maturely conſidered in the one as in the other.</p>
                  <p>THE eſtabliſhed manners of every country are the ſtandards of propriety with the people who have adopted them; and every nation aſſumes the right of conſidering all deviations therefrom as barbariſms and abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Chineſe</hi> have retained their laws and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms for ages immemorial: and although they have long had a commercial intercourſe with Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations, and are well acquainted with their improvements in the arts, and their modes of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization, yet they are ſo far from being convinced
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:024407_0542_0FC6FDCEED48CDD0"/>
of any ſuperiority in the European manners, that their government takes the moſt ſerious meaſures to prevent the cuſtoms of foreigners taking root amongſt them. It employs their utmoſt vigilance to enjoy the benefits of commerce, and at the ſame time guard againſt innovations that might affect the the charactereſtic manners of the people.</p>
                  <p>SINCE the diſcovery of the <hi>Sandwich</hi> iſlands in the South-Sea, they have been viſited by ſhips from ſeveral nations; yet the natives have ſhewn no inclination to prefer the dreſs and manners of the viſitors to their own. It is even probable that they pity the ignorance of the Europeans they have ſeen, as far removed from civilization; and value themſelves on the propriety and advantage of their own cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p>THERE is nothing new in theſe obſervations, and I had no intention of making them when I ſat down to write, but they obtruded themſelves upon me. My intention was to give you ſome account of the people of theſe new ſtates; but I am not ſufficiently informed for the purpoſe, having, as yet, ſeen little more than the cities of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> I have diſcovered but few na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſingularities amongſt them. Their cuſtoms and manners are nearly the ſame with thoſe of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:024407_0543_0FC6FDD06212D6E0"/>
England, which they have long been uſed to copy. For, previous to the late revolution, the Americans were taught from their infancy to look up to the Engliſh as the patterns of perfection in all things.</p>
                  <p>I have, however, obſerved one cuſtom, which, for ought I know, is peculiar to this country. An account of it will ſerve to fill up the remainder of this ſheet, and may afford you ſome amuſement.</p>
                  <p>WHEN a young couple are about to enter on the matrimonial ſtate, a never failing article in the the marriage treaty is, that the lady ſhall have and enjoy the free and unmoleſted exerciſe of the rights of WHITE-WASHING, with all its ceremonials, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and appurtenances. You will wonder what this privilege of <hi>white-waſhing</hi> is. I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give you an idea of the ceremony, as I have ſeen it performed.</p>
                  <p>THERE is no ſeaſon of the year in which the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may not, if ſhe pleaſes, claim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally fixed upon for the purpoſe. The attentive huſband may judge, by certain prognoſtics, when the ſtorm is nigh at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly fretful, finds fault with the ſervants, is diſcontented with the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:024407_0544_0FC6FDD8029A1F58"/>
children, and complains much of the naſtineſs of every thing about her: theſe are ſymptoms which ought not to be neglected, yet they ſometimes go off without any further effect. But if, when the huſband riſes in the morning, he ſhould obſerve in the yard, a wheelbarrow, with a quantity of lime in it, or ſhould ſee certain buckets filled with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of lime in water, there is no time for heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He immediately locks up the apartment or cloſet where his papers, and private property are kept, and putting the key in his pocket, betakes himſelf to flight. A huſband, however beloved, becomes a perfect nuiſance during this ſeaſon of female rage. His authority is ſuperſeded, his commiſſion ſuſpended, and the very ſcullion who cleans the braſſes in the kitchen becomes of more importance than him. He has nothing for it but to abdicate, for a time, and run from an evil which he can neither prevent nor molify.</p>
                  <p>THE huſband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are ſtripped of their furniture—paintings, prints, and looking-glaſſes lie in huddled heaps about the floors; the curtains are torn from their teſters, the beds crammed into windows, chairs and tables, bedſteads and cradles crowd the yard; and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets, cloth cloaks, old coats, under
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:024407_0545_0FC6FDDA24EC7038"/>
petticoats, and ragged breeches. <hi>Here</hi> may be ſeen the lumber of the kitchen, forming a dark and confuſed maſs for the fore-ground of the picture; gridirons and frying-pans, ruſty ſhovels and broken tongs, joint ſtools, and the fractured remains of ruſh bottomed chairs. <hi>There</hi> a cloſet has diſgorged its bowels—rivetted plates and diſhes, halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, broken wine-glaſſes, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of forgotten phyſic, papers of unknown pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſeeds and dryed herbs, tops of tea-pots, and ſtoppers of departed decanters—from the rag hole in the garret, to the rat hole in the cellar, no place eſcapes unrummaged. It would ſeem as if the day of general doom was come, and the uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils of the houſe were dragged forth to judgment. In this tempeſt, the words of king <hi>Lear</hi> unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſent, and might with little alteration be made ſtrictly applicable.</p>
                  <l>"—Let the great gods</l>
                  <l>"That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads</l>
                  <l>"Find out their enemies now. Tremble thou wretch</l>
                  <l>"That haſt within thee undivulged crimes</l>
                  <l>"Unwhipt of juſtice—"</l>
                  <l>"—Cloſe pent up guilt,</l>
                  <l>"Rive your concealing continents, and aſk</l>
                  <l>"Theſe dreadful ſummoners grace."</l>
                  <p>THIS ceremony completed, and the houſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:024407_0546_0FC6FDDBA1565CE0"/>
evacuated, the next operation is to ſmear the walls and ceilings with bruſhes, dipped in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of lime called WHITE-WASH; to pour buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of water over every floor, and ſcratch all the partitions and wainſcoats with hard bruſhes, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſoft ſoap and ſtone-cutter's ſand.</p>
                  <p>THE windows by no means eſcape the general deluge. A ſervant ſcrambles out upon the pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, at the riſk, of her neck, and with a mug in her hand, and a bucket within reach, daſhes innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable gallons of water againſt the glaſs panes, to the great annoyance of paſſengers in the ſtreet.</p>
                  <p>I have been told that an action at law, was once brought againſt one of theſe water nymphs, by a perſon who had a new ſuit of clothes ſpoiled by this operation: but after long argument it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that no damages could be awarded; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the defendant was in the exerciſe of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal right, and not anſwerable for the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And ſo the poor gentleman was doubly non-ſuited; for he loſt both his ſuit of clothes and his ſuit at law.</p>
                  <p>THESE ſmearings and ſcratchings, theſe waſhings and daſhings, being duly performed, the next cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial is to cleanſe and replace the diſtracted fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024407_0547_0FC6FDE3C7AF9720"/>
You may have ſeen a houſe-raiſing, or a ſhip-launch—recollect, if you can, the hurry, buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, confuſion, and noiſe of ſuch a ſcene, and you will have ſome idea of this cleanſing match. The misfortune is, that the ſole object is to make things <hi>clean.</hi> It matters not how many uſeful, ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or valuable articles ſuffer mutilation or death under the operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame undergo the ſame diſcipline: they are to be made <hi>clean</hi> at all events; but their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is not worthy of attention. For inſtance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a number of ſmaller prints are piled upon it, until the ſuper-incumbent weight cracks the lower glaſs —but this is of no importance. A valuable pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is placed leaning againſt the ſharp corner of a table; others are made to lean againſt that, till the preſſure of the whole forces the corner of the table through the canvas of the firſt. The frame and glaſs of a fine print are to be cleaned; the ſpirit and oil uſed on this occaſion are ſuffered to leak through and deface the engraving—no matter! If the glaſs is clean and the frame ſhines it is ſufficient —the reſt is not worthy of conſideration. An able arithmetician hath made a calculation, founded on long experience, and proved that the loſſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction incident to two white-waſhings are equal
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024407_0548_0FC6FDE5647A0340"/>
to one removal and three removals equal to one fire.</p>
                  <p>THIS cleanſing frolic over, matters begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their priſtine appearance: the ſtorm abates, and all would be well again: but it is impoſſible that ſo great a convulſion in ſo ſmall a community ſhould paſs over without producing ſome conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. For two or three weeks after the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the family are uſually afflicted with ſore eyes, ſore throats, or ſevere colds, occaſioned by exhalations from wet floors and damp walls.</p>
                  <p>I know a gentleman here who is fond of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for every thing in a philoſophical way. He conſiders this, which I call <hi>a cuſtom,</hi> as a real, periodical diſeaſe, peculiar to the climate.— His train of reaſoning is whimſical and ingenious, but I am not at leaſure to give you the detail. The reſult was, that he found the diſtemper to be incurable; but after much ſtudy, he thought he had diſcovered a method to divert the evil he could not ſubdue. For this purpoſe, he cauſed a ſmall building, about twelve feet ſquare, to be erected in his garden, and furniſhed with ſome ordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheapeſt ſort. His hope was, that when the white-waſhing frenzy ſeized the females of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:024407_0549_0FC6FDE6E324DF38"/>
they might repair to this apartment, and ſcrub, and ſcour, and ſmear to their hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and ſo ſpend the violence of the diſeaſe in this out-poſt, whilſt he enjoyed himſelf in quiet at head-quarters. But the experiment did not anſwer his expectation. It was impoſſible it ſhould, ſince a principal part of the gratification conſiſts in the lady's having an uncontrolled right to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her huſband, at leaſt once in every year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of government into her own hands.</p>
                  <p>THERE is a much better contrivance than this of the philoſopher's: which is, to cover the walls of the houſe with paper. This is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally done. And though it does not aboliſh, it at leaſt ſhortens the period of female dominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies, and made ſo ornamental that the women have admitted the faſhion without perceiving the deſign.</p>
                  <p>THERE is alſo another alleviation of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's diſtreſs. He generally has the ſole uſe of a ſmall room or cloſet for his books and papers, the key of which he is allowed to keep. This is conſidered as a privileged place, even in the white-waſhing ſeaſon, and ſtands like the land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> amidſt the plagues of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But then he
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:024407_0550_0FC6FDED07466D40"/>
muſt be extremely cautious, and ever upon his guard: for ſhould he inadvertently go abroad, and leave the key in his door, the houſe maid, who is always on the watch for ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, immediately enters in triumph with buckets, brooms, and bruſhes—takes poſſeſſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and forthwith puts all his books and papers <hi>to rights,</hi> to his utter confuſion, and ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious detriment. I can give you an inſtance.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman was ſued at law, by the executors of a mechanic, on a charge found againſt him in the deceaſed's books to the amount of £ 30. The defendant was ſtrongly impreſſed with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that he had diſcharged the debt and taken a receipt; but as the tranſaction was of long ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he knew not where to find the receipt. The ſuit went on in courſe, and the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached when judgment ſhould be obtained againſt him. He then ſat down ſeriouſly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine a large bundle of old papers, which he had untied and diſplayed on a table for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In the midſt of his ſearch he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called away on buſineſs of importance. He forgot to lock the door of his room. The houſe maid who had been long looking for ſuch a op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, immediately entered with the uſual implements, and with great alacrity fell to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:024407_0551_0FC6FDEF263D98B8"/>
the room and <hi>putting things to rights.</hi> One of the firſt objects that ſtruck her eye was the confuſed ſituation of the papers on the table. Theſe, without delay, ſhe hudled together like ſo many dirty knives and forks; but in the action a ſmall piece of paper fell unnoticed on the floor, which unfortunately happened to be the very receipt in queſtion. As it had no very reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table appearance, it was ſoon after ſwept out with the common dirt of the room, and carried in a duſt pan to the yard. The tradeſman had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to enter the credit in his book. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant could find nothing to obviate the charge, and ſo judgment went againſt him for debt and coſts. A fortnight after the whole was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and the money paid, one of the children found the receipt amongſt the dirt in the yard.</p>
                  <p>THERE is alſo another cuſtom, peculiar to the city of Philadelphia, and nearly allied with the former. I mean that of waſhing the pavements before the doors every Saturday evening. I at firſt ſuppoſed this to be a regulation of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; but, on further enquiry, I find it is a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rite preparatory to the Sabbath: and it is, I believe, the only religious rite in which the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſectaries of this large city perfectly agree. The ceremony begins about ſunſet and continues
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:024407_0552_0FC6FDF0E558B310"/>
till ten or eleven at night. It is very difficult for a ſtranger to walk the ſtreets on thoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. He runs a continual riſk of having a a bucket of dirty water daſhed againſt his legs; but a Philadelphian born is ſo much accuſtomed to the danger that he avoids it with ſurpriſing dexterity. It is from this circumſtance that a Philadelphian may be known any where by a certain ſkip in his gait. The ſtreets of New York are paved with rough ſtones. Theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are not waſhed, but the dirt is ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſwept from between them that they ſtand up ſharp and prominent, to the great annoyance of thoſe who are not accuſtomed to ſo rough a path. But habit reconciles every thing. It is diverting enough to ſee a Philadelphian at New York. He walks the ſtreet with as much painful caution as if his toes were covered with corns, or his feet lamed by the gout: whilſt a New York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as little approving the plain maſonry of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, ſhuffles along the pavement like a parrot upon a mahogany table.</p>
                  <p>IT muſt be acknowledged that the ablutions I have mentioned are attended with no ſmall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; yet the women would not be induced by conſideration to reſign their privilege.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="unknown:024407_0553_0FC6FDF3A258C538"/>NOTWITHSTANDING this ſingularity, I can give you the ſtrongeſt aſſurances that the women of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica make the moſt faithful wives, and the moſt attentive mothers in the world. And I don't doubt but you will join me in opinion, that if a married man is made miſerable only for one week in a whole year, he will have no great cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the matrimonial bond.</p>
                  <p>THIS letter has run on to a length I did not expect; I therefore haſten to aſſure you that I am as ever.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE ſeen a piece in the <hi>Pennſylvania Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,</hi> and republiſhed in <hi>Mr. Carey's</hi> Muſeum, upon the cuſtom of <hi>White-waſhing,</hi> in which that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty of a good houſe-wife is treated with unmerited ridicule. I ſhould probably have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the fooliſh thing; but the ſeaſon approaching, which moſt women think ſuitable for cleanſing their apartments of the ſmoke and dirt of the winter, I hear this ſaucy author diſhed up in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry family, and his flippant performance quoted whenever a wife attempts to exerciſe her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prerogative or execute the duties of her ſtation.</p>
                  <p>WOMEN generally employ their time to better purpoſe than in ſcribbling. The care and comforts of a family reſt principally on their
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:024407_0555_0FC6FDFF920CAAA0"/>
ſhoulders. Hence it is that there are but few famale authors; and the men, knowing how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary our attentions are to their happineſs, take every opportunity of diſcouraging literary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments in the fair ſex. We hear it echo'd from every quarter—
<q>My wife cannot make verſes, it is true; but ſhe makes an excellent pudding—She can't correct the preſs; but ſhe can correct her children, and ſcold her ſervants with admirable diſcretion—ſhe can't unravel t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And this they call praiſing a wife, and doing juſtice to her good character.</p>
                  <p>I ſay women generally employ their time to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe than in ſcribbling; otherwiſe this face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious writer had not eſcaped ſo long unanſwered. We have ladies who ſometimes lay down the needle and take up the pen; I wonder none of them have attempted ſome reply. For my part I do not pretend to be an author: I never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in print in my life, but I can no longer forbear ſaying ſomething in anſwer to ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence.</p>
                  <p>ONLY conſider, Mr. Editor, our ſituation. Men are naturally inattentive to the decencies of
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:024407_0556_0FC6FE0075556D58"/>
life; but why ſhould I be ſo complaiſant? I ſay they are naturally naſty beaſts. If it were not that their connection with the refined ſex poliſhed their manners, and had a happy influence on the general oeconomy of life, theſe lords of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would wallow in filth, and populous cities would infect the atmoſphere with their noxious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours. It is the attention and aſſiduity of the women that prevent men from degenerating into ſwine.</p>
                  <p>HOW important, then, are the ſervices we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! And yet for theſe very ſervices we are made the ſubject of ridicule and fun—Baſe ingratitude! nauſeous creatures! Perhaps you may think I am in a paſſion—No, Mr. Editor, I do aſſure you I was never more compoſed in my life; and yet it is enough to provoke a ſaint to ſee how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably we are treated by the men—Why, now, there's my huſband, a good enough ſort of a man in the main, but I will give you a ſmall ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of him. He comes into the parlour, the other day, where, to be ſure, I was cutting up a piece of linen. "Lord, ſays he, what a clutter here is —I cannot bear to ſee the parlour look like a tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's ſhop—beſides, I am going to make ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant philoſophical experiments, and muſt have ſufficient room." You muſt know my huſband is
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:024407_0557_0FC6FE03973A9050"/>
one of your would-be philoſophers. Well—I bundled up my linen as quick as I could, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to darn a pair of ruffles, which took up no room, and could give no offence. I was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, to watch my lord and maſter's impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs. In about half an hour the tables were covered with all manner of trumpery—bottles of water, phials of drugs, paſteboard, paper and cards, glue, paſte and gum-arabic, files, knives, ſciſſars and needles, roſin, wax, ſilk, thread, rags, jags, tags, books, pamphlets and manuſcripts.— Lord bleſs me! I am almoſt out of breath, and yet I have not enumerated half the articles. Well! to work he went, and although I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the object of his manoeuvres, yet I could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſcover that he did not ſucceed in any one operation: I was glad of that—yes, I confeſs, I was glad of that, and good reaſon too. After he had fatigued himſelf with miſchief, like a monkey in a china ſhop, and had called the ſervants to clear every thing away, I took a view of the ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. I ſhall not even attempt a minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription—ſuffice it to ſay, that he had overſet his inkſtand, and ſtained my beſt mahogany table with ink; he had ſpilt a quantity of vitriol upon my carpet, and burned a hole in it; my marble hearth was all over ſpotted with melted roſin; he had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:024407_0558_0FC6FE05FA1965D8"/>
three china cups, two wine glaſſes, a tumbler, and one of my beſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>, as I ſaid before, I perceived that he had not ſucceeded in any one operation. By the bye—tell your friend the white-waſh ſcribbler, that this is one way by which our cloſets become furniſhed with— <q>halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wine glaſſes, tops of tea pots, and ſtoppers of departed decanters.</q>
I ſay, I took a ſober view of the dirt and devaſtation my philoſophical huſband had made; and there I ſat, <hi>like patience on a monument, ſmiling at grief;</hi> but it worked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly—yes, Mr Editor, it worked inwardly, I would almoſt as lieve the melted roſin had been in his throat, and the vitriol upon his ſkin, as on my dear marble hearth and my carpet. It is not true that women have no command over their own feelings; for not withſtanding this groſs provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I ſaid nothing, or next to nothing; I only obſerved, very pleaſantly, that a lady of my acquaintance had told me, that the reaſon why philoſophers are called <hi>literary</hi> men, is becauſe they frequently make a great <hi>litter</hi>—not a word more—However, the ſervant cleared away, and down ſat the diſappointed philoſopher. A friend dropt in ſoon after—"Your ſervant Sir,—how do you do?" "Oh Lord! I am almoſt fatigued
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:024407_0559_0FC6FE0EC8D0F928"/>
to death—I have been all the morning making philoſophical experiments." I was now more hardly put to it to ſmother a laugh, than I had been juſt before to contain my reſentment. My <hi>precious</hi> went out ſoon after with his friend—And I, as you may well ſuppoſe, immediately muſtered all my forces—bruſhes, buckets, ſoap, ſand, lime-ſkins, and cocoa-nut ſhells—all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of houſe-wifery were employed. I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the beſt philoſopher of the two, for my experiments ſucceeded, and his did not—all was well again, except my broken ware and my carpet —my poor vitriolized carpet, which ſtill remains a mournful memento of philoſophic fury; or rather of philoſophic folly.</p>
                  <p>THIS operation was ſcarce over, when in came my <hi>experimental dear,</hi> and told me with all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference in the world, that he had invited ſix gentlemen to dine with him at three o'clock—it was then paſt one—I complained of the ſhort no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice—"Poh! Poh! ſays he, you can get a leg of mutton, and a loin of veal, and a few potatoes, and it will do well enough—Heaven's! what a chaos muſt the head of a philoſopher be!—A leg of mutton, a loin of veal and potatoes! I was at a loſs whether I ſhould laugh or be angry.
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:024407_0560_0FC6FE108371AB08"/>
But there was no time for determining—I had but an hour and a half to do a world of buſineſs in. My carpet, which had ſuffered in the cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental philoſophy in the morning, was deſtined to be ſhamefully diſhonoured in the afternoon by a deluge of filthy tobacco juice—Gentlemen ſmokers and chewers, love ſegars and pigtail bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than carpets.</p>
                  <p>THINK, Mr Editor, what a woman muſt endure under ſuch circumſtances; and then, after all to be reproached with her cleanlineſs, and to have her white-waſhings, her ſcowrings and ſcrubbings made the ſubject of public ridicule, is more than patience can put up with.</p>
                  <p>WHAT I have now exhibited is but a ſmall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the injuries we ſuffer under the boaſted ſuperiority of the men. But we will not be laughed out of our cleanlineſs. A woman would rather be called ***** than <hi>ſlut;</hi> as a man would rather be called a <hi>knave</hi> than <hi>fool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had a great deal more to ſay, but I am called away—We are juſt preparing to <hi>white-waſh</hi>— Yes, I ſay to <hi>white-waſh</hi>—the bruſhes are ready, the buckets are paraded—my huſband is gone
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:024407_0561_0FC6FE1714512048"/>
off—ſo much the better—When one is about a thorough cleaning, the firſt dirty thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved is one's huſband—I am called for again— adieu!</p>

                     </gap> I can.</p>
                  <p>I was born in an obſcure village in England. My father could neither read nor write, but had a moſt profound veneration for men of genius and learning. He carried this blind paſſion ſo far, that he was frequently the ſubject of ridicule; and ſometimes ſuffered real loſs by ſharpers who impoſed themſelves upon him for ſcholars, and authors neglected by the ungrateful world, or men of genius, on the point of producing the moſt important diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>MY father reſolved to do better by me than his father had done by him; and therefore put me to a charity-ſchool as ſoon as I was eight years old. After two years cruel perſecution, I was whipped through the ſpelling-book as far as words of five ſyllables. It took me three months and a half to ſpell the word <hi>liberality;</hi> in which time I received 97 ſtrokes of the ferule on my right hand, and 53 on my left; 8 times I wore the dunce's cap; and 5 times publicly whipt. Beſides theſe, I received one hundred and thirteen ſtripes with a rattan acroſs my ſhoulders, and ſuffered two hundred and twenty five pinches of my right ear. At laſt I could ſpell the word <hi>liberality.</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="unknown:024407_0565_0FC6FE216E43B448"/>
But being no longer able to bear this cruel diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, I took to my heels and ran off.</p>
                  <p>I was running enough to elude the ſearch my father made for me for two years, and ſubſiſted by hiring myſelf occaſionally as a ſervant. At laſt, I offered myſelf to a farmer, who had ſeen an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement anſwering my deſcription. He ſecured me, and ſent me back to my father, who loaded me with reproaches and abuſe. He gave overall expectation of making me a ſcholar, and fixing his hopes upon my brother <hi>Dick,</hi> bound me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to a ſhoemaker.</p>
                  <p>I was almoſt as unſucceſsful here as at the free-ſchool. I acquired a tolerable knack at botching and patching, but could never arrive at the ſkill of making a whole ſhoe.</p>
                  <p>AFTER I had in vain tried for four years to make myſelf maſter of the buſineſs, I conceived a thorough diſlike to the trade, and throwing down my ſtrap and laſt, I once more threw myſelf into the hands of fortune.</p>
                  <p>My father died ſoon after, and my mother did not think me worth enquiring after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="unknown:024407_0566_0FC6FE2854A0BB30"/>I went through various ſcenes of employ for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years: In which time I had great opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of making obſervations on men and manners. I contracted many prejudices; I ſtored up many opinions, and learned many words: but the word <hi>liberality</hi> was never out of my mind; it had been impreſſed on my memory, and, I may ſay, engraved on my fleſh.</p>
                  <p>AT length I engaged in the ſervice of a man very famous in the learned world; a celebrated author in theology and natural philoſophy. I lived with him many years. I adopted all his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not becauſe I underſtood them, but becauſe I lived with him, and they were his principles, and becauſe I derived no ſmall credit from this connection; as the moon is admired for the light ſhe affords, not that ſhe is luminous in herſelf, but becauſe ſhe is within the influence of the ſun's rays. I was more than the ſervant, I was the companion of this great man; and as the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are apt to think that knowledge may be taken, like the itch or ſmall-pox, by contagion, I acquired a conſiderable literary reputation amongſt illiterate men. I turned the electric wheel for my patron; I kindled his fire; I brought him water; I handed him books from the ſhelves, and bottles from the cloſet; and ſo I became a <hi>philoſopher.</hi> Moreover,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:024407_0567_0FC6FE29A2D90158"/>
I carried his manuſcripts to the printer, and brought back the printed ſheets for correction; and ſo I became a <hi>theologiſt.</hi> It is true, I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unlucky in my zeal to ſerve him; I inadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcharged his accumulated electricity; I cracked his jars, and broke his bottles; I burned his clothes with vitriol, and his fleſh with aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis; and frequently ſtumbled in my way to the printer's, and plunged his manuſcript in the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. But he was a <hi>philoſopher,</hi> and bore all with patience.</p>
                  <p>STILL the word <hi>liberality</hi> preſſed upon my mind. My maſter and I differed in opinion about dephlogiſticated air: I thought he was very <hi>illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral;</hi>
and ſo we parted, and I determined to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel far and near in ſearch of true <hi>liberality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ran through moſt of the countries in Europe, in hopes of finding this precious jewel. But, alas! to no purpoſe. In <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in tranſubſtantiation and the pope's infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the people of <hi>France</hi> believe in nothing at all; of courſe there could be no <hi>liberality</hi> in thoſe countries. In <hi>Italy,</hi> they prefer the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of <hi>Ingenhouzen,</hi> to that of my maſter and friend; this I thought very <hi>illiberal,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our difference. In <hi>Geneva,</hi> they believe in
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:024407_0568_0FC6FE2DDE609C80"/>
predeſtination, a doctrine I abhor: and in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> the citizens make a practice of hiring themſelves as ſoldiers to foreign princes.</p>
                  <p>I once thought I ſhould find what I was in ſearch of, amongſt the rude but uncorrupted inhabitants of the <hi>Alps</hi>: but after ſojourning with them many days, I diſcovered that they eſteemed the large <hi>wens</hi> which moſt of them had hanging to their chins as very ornamental, for my part I thought them extremely ugly, and ſo I concluded, that there could be no <hi>liberality</hi> on the <hi>Alps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT would be a uſeleſs taſk to enumerate all the particulars in which the people of every nation differed from me in opinion, and diſappointed me in the object of my purſuit. True genuine <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi>
was not to be found amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>AT length I returned to England. Here I found things worſe than ever. My friend's <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology</hi>
was publicly conteſted, and ſome of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines even reprobated. Not only this, but the nation was engaged in a war with the people of America, on principles which I could not approve. Convinced, that there was no <hi>liberality</hi> in England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I determined to croſs the Atlantic, and ſeek for it in America.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="unknown:024407_0569_0FC6FE308D60B2A8"/>ON my arrival in this country, I was much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined to find that the doctrine of the Trinity was generally received and profeſſed; a doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which I had acquired the ſtrongeſt antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy from my maſter, the great philoſopher. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as war raged in the country, there was no time for theological diſquiſitions; and as the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the war was clearly on the ſide of the Americans, I reſolved to take an active part in their cauſe, and enliſted myſelf a ſoldier in the Pennſylvania line. I went through inexpreſſible toil and danger, in marches, counter-marches, ſkirmiſhes and battles, and was finally wounded at the ſiege of <hi>York-Town,</hi> when lord Cornwallis and his army ſurrendered to the allied forces of France and America.</p>
                  <p>After the peace, I ſupported myſelf by cobling and patching, and employed my leiſure hours in combating the doctrine of the Trinity, and deviſing grand ſchemes <hi>for public utility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AT length government thought fit to eſtabliſh a corps of invalids, and ſitted up the eaſt wing of the ſtate-houſe for their accommodation, and I now belong to this corps. As we have no great deal to do, our duty being very ſlight, I have ſpent much time in watching the progreſs of a
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:024407_0570_0FC6FE321B01DD38"/>
building near our quarters, intended as a hall for the Philoſophical Society. Although it is not quite a year ſince the firſt ſtone was laid, the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is already completed; but <hi>when</hi> the roof will be raiſed, can be known only to men of profound erudition and nice calculation—to finiſh my hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of which but little now remains—</p>
                  <p>As I ſtood looking on, whilſt the labourers were digging this philoſophical cellar, I took particular notice of the ſeveral <hi>ſtratums</hi> of loam, ſand and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they appeared. I procured ſamples of each, and ſubmitting them to <hi>hyperſtratical</hi> experiments, I found that they were all of different <hi>pacific</hi> gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This extraordinary circumſtance ſtrongly prejudiced me in favour of the ſociety and their propoſed hall, and I concluded that I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find <hi>true liberality</hi> in the bottom of this ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entific cellar.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as it was completed, and covered with rough boards, I conveyed my bench and cobling tools to this ſubterraneous temple of Minerva. And here I may be ſeen daily toiling for <hi>public utility</hi> in the double capacity of cobler and author.</p>
                  <p>MY ſituation, ſo contiguous to the ſeat of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation and other offices of ſtate, has made me of

no ſmall uſe in the commonwealth. And the truth is, that I am now <hi>oppreſt with public buſineſs</hi>—I have heeltaped counſellors; patched the upper leather of judges; examined the <hi>ſoles</hi> of aſſembly men, and given ſome of them better <hi>underſtandings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING that the care of the ſtate is thus daily preſſing upon me, I enjoy good health, owing to the <hi>ſallibrity</hi> of my philoſophical work-ſhop: for, it is ſo ingeniouſly conſtructed, that the <hi>atmoſpheric</hi> air is compelled to deſcend and diſplace the <hi>memphitic</hi> air common in cellars and confined places.</p>
                  <p>FROM this profound habitation I ſhall date my future eſſays, and expect that my performances will procure me no ſmall credit with the public, if the people have any <hi>liberality.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>☞A warm diſpute had taken place between <hi>Mr. Moore,</hi> a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and <hi>Mr. Lewis,</hi> a lawyer. The parties attacked each other with great acrimony in the public papers; and the conteſt drew in friends on both ſides, who ſoon became principals in the quarrel. Private challenges began to paſs; and what are called the rules of honour were publickly diſcuſſed. One gentleman went ſo far as to publiſh a general challenge in the newſpaper, undertaking to defend Mr. Lewis's ſide of the queſtion againſt all perſons whatſoever. It ſeemed very probable that this quarrel would have had a fatal iſſue amongſt ſome of the parties, when the following piece of ridicule made its appearance, which turned the laugh of the town upon the combatants, entirely cruſhed the whole affair, and laughed the rules of honour out of countenance. The parties forgave each other ſooner than they forgave the author.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA PACKET.</head>
                  <p>I Mentioned in a former eſſay that my greateſt ambition is to become famous by the invention of ſome ingenious or uſeful project which ſhall be generally approved and adopted. At the ſame time I communicated to the public, a device, which, from its novelty and convenience, I thought could not fail of ſucceſs. In vain, however, have I looked for that applauſe which I ſtill think juſtly due to the fruit of genius, ripened by the labours
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:024407_0573_0FC6FE3D6D509600"/>
of the underſtanding. The author and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance are no more thought of.</p>
                  <p>I have at different times, publiſhed ſeveral other devices of rare invention, which have all found the ſame fate. Whether the fault lies with me, or with the public, I ſhall not preſume to ſay; but as my love of fame is invincible, I ſhall go on projecting and contriving in hopes ſome lucky hit may accompliſh my purpoſe, by procuring me the honour I ſo ardently deſire.</p>
                  <p>As I am now growing old in the buſineſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and frequent diſappointments have taught me to be leſs ſanguine in my expectations; and, like other authors, to depend more on a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous poſſeſſion of the public caprice than on the intrinſic merits of my own performance.</p>
                  <p>MY preſent deſign, which I offer with great modeſty, reſpects an improvement in the art of <hi>printing;</hi> and is a device to ender it not only expreſſive of an author's narrative, opinions, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; but alſo of the peculiarities of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the vivacity of his feelings.</p>
                  <p>As I have as due a regard to literary honeſty as to any other kind of honeſty, I candidly confeſs
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:024407_0574_0FC6FE3EA6F3F450"/>
that I took the hint from an ingenious work of a <hi>Mr. Steele</hi> of London, who has contrived and publiſhed a ſcheme for noting down, in certain muſical characters, the riſings, fallings, and various inflections of the voice in common converſation or in public ſpeaking. So that not only the matter of an oration, but even the <hi>manner</hi> of the orator may be ſecured and tranſmitted to poſterity.</p>
                  <p>MY contrivance has this advantage over his, that no new characters are neceſſary to it. Thoſe commonly uſed in printing are ſufficient for the purpoſe. Beſides, his project is only calculated to aſcertain the <hi>fortes</hi> and <hi>pianos,</hi> and various <hi>ſlides</hi> of the human voice in ſpeaking; whereas mine is contrived to deſignate the <hi>fortes</hi> and <hi>pianos,</hi> and various <hi>ſlides</hi> of the temper in writing.</p>
                  <p>MY ſyſtem is founded in a practice which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture herſelf dictates, and which every one muſt have obſerved, I mean that of elevating the voice in proportion to the agitation of mind, or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of the ſpeaker. Thus a reprimand is given in a higher tone than admonition: and a perſon in a fright or in paſſion, exerts his lungs according to the <hi>quantum</hi> of terror or rage with which he is affected.</p>
                  <p>NOW I would have the degrees of vociferation
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:024407_0575_0FC6FE40566D60F8"/>
—ſuch as <hi>pianiſſimo, piano, forte, fortiſſimo,</hi> with all the intermediate gradations deſignated by the ſize of the letters which compoſe the emphatic words. And for this the various ſpecies of types from  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  <p>THE ingenious authors of advertiſements have I confeſs, in ſome ſort anticipated my deſign. We often ſee.</p>
                  <p>

a ſhip to be ſold, or ſome choice article to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, in Engliſh Roman.</p>
                  <p>AND as a further enforcement to attention, I have ſeen the figure of a hand, with a crier's bell in the act of ringing, advertiſing an auction of houſehold furniture. Every one ſtriving to be heard in preference by a ſuperior magnitude of types. At preſent there are none who roar out in louder, or blacker characters, than the printers themſelves for Rags.</p>
                  <p>THERE is no looking at the firſt page of the daily advertiſer without imagining a number of people hallowing and bawling to you to buy their goods or lands, to charter their ſhips, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that a ſervant or a horſe hath ſtrayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. For my part I am ſo poſſeſſed with this idea, that as ſoon as I take up the paper of the day, I turn over to articles of Intelligence as quick as poſſible, leſt my eyes ſhould be ſtunned by the

                     <hi>occular uproar</hi> of the firſt page. For I am a peaceable man, and hate nothing more than the confuſed noiſe of a mob.</p>
                  <p>MY project, then, conſiſts in this, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in compoſing any work ſhould adapt the ſize of his types to the ſpirit of his author, ſo that a reader may become, in ſome degree perſonally acquainted with a writer whilſt he is peruſing his work. Thus an author of cool and equable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits might take Bourgeois Roman for his medium, and would probably never riſe higher than Great Primer; whilſt a paſſionate man, engaged in a warm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, might thunder away in French Canon.</p>

                     <pb n="185" facs="unknown:024407_0578_0FC6FE4CE3D03298"/>IT follows of courſe that authors of great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, ſhould be charged higher than meek writers for printing a work of the ſame length, on account of the extraordinary ſpace their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances muſt neceſſarily occupy; for theſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic, wrathful types, like ranters on a ſtage, or Burgoyne at Saratoga, will demand ſufficient elbow room.</p>
                  <p>For example—ſuppoſe a newſpaper quarrel to happen between M and L<note n="*" place="bottom">Leſt ſome ill diſpoſed perſon ſhould maliciouſly miſapply theſe initials I think proper to declare that M ſignifies <hi>merchant,</hi> and L Lawyer.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>M begins the attack pretty ſmartly in Long primer.</p>
                  <p>L replies in Pica Roman.</p>

and at laſt the conteſt ſwells up to Raſcal, Villain, Coward, in five line pica; which indeed is as far as the art of printing or a modern quarrel can conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently go.</p>
                  <p>A philoſophical reaſon might be given to prove that large types will more forcibly affect the optic nerve than thoſe of a ſmaller ſize, and therefore become mechanically expreſſive of ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and vigour; but I leave this diſcuſſion for the amuſement of the gentlemen lately elected into our philoſophical ſociety.

                     <pb n="187" facs="unknown:024407_0580_0FC6FE55E1EADC80"/>I recollect a caſe in point; ſome few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the war, the people of a weſtern county, known at that time by the name of the <hi>Paxton boys,</hi> aſſembled on account of ſome diſcontents, and came down in great numbers, with hoſtile intentions againſt the peace of government, and with a particular view to ſome leading men in the city. <hi>Sir John St Clair,</hi> who had aſſumed military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the defence of the city on this occaſion, met one of the obnoxious perſons <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſrael P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had Sir John only ſaid, that he had ſeen his name mentioned in the manifeſto, it is probable he would not have been ſo ſeriouſly alarmed; but the unuſual ſize of the letters was to him a plain indication that the inſurgents were determined to carry their reſentment to a proportionable extremity</p>
                  <p>I could confirm my ſcheme by innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in fact and practice. The title page of every book is an example. It announces the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject treated of in conſpicuous characters; as if the author ſtood at the door of his edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE journeymen printers have alſo a cuſtom founded on the ſame principles. They diſtinguiſh every ſheet of printing by a letter of the alphabet, which may be ſeen at the bottom of the firſt page of every ſheet in any book. When they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this alphabetical enumeration as far as the letter O, they are ſure to ſend the editor a proof ſheet with an O! as big as a dollar; intimating, that the fatigue and labour they have gone through is ſo great, as to make them cry aloud for ſome gratuitous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</p>
                  <p>IT was reſerved for me to improve theſe hints into a project of general utility. It is indeed high time that ſuch a ſyſtem ſhould be formed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged.

For what, alas! are a few <hi>Capitals</hi> and <hi>Italies</hi> in the hands of a vigorous author? and yet theſe are the only typographical emphatics now in uſe. In perſonal altercations, nature has furniſhed ample means of expreſſion. The muſcles of the face; the motion of the eyes; the action of the body; the limbs, and even the hands and fingers —all unite in enforcing the feelings of the ſoul, and giving additional expreſſion to language—Let art do the beſt ſhe can in caſes where theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſigns of ſentiment cannot be diſplayed.</p>
                  <p>IT is truly lamentable, and has given me much concern, to obſerve with what languor a late reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſpute, and alſo a late law controverſy, have been conducted; not for want of a proper ſpirit in the combatants, but merely for want of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient vehicle of rage and reſentment.</p>

                     <pb n="196" facs="unknown:024407_0589_0FC6F91E0DC3C5F0"/>THE great queſtion—"<hi>What is the beſt form of government?</hi>" ſeems as far from being determined as ever; the politicians of different nations not having come to any compromiſe on this important ſubject. The reaſon, I ſuppoſe is, becauſe no form of government can be deviſed that ſhall neceſſarily involve in itſelf the happineſs or unhappineſs of the people. There is, in fact, no mechanical affinity between theſe two objects. The multitude are happy or not, according to their ideas of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by which they are reſtrained; and theſe ideas are not the produce of ſpeculative knowledge, but are derived from the prejudices of education: whilſt the more enlightened judge of government by the manner in which its powers are exerciſed and juſtice adminiſtered. So that inſtead of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining on the happineſs of a people by the nature of their political conſtitution, we ſhould reverſe the poſition, and judge of their political conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by its effects on the people; or, in other words, that is the beſt government which is beſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered. This truth ſeems to be generally admitted by writers on the ſubject. The purſuit now, is not for a form of government that ſhall neceſſarily and mechanically make the people moſt happy; but for ſuch a conſtitution as may be moſt effectual in ſecuring them from being made miſerable.</p>

                     <hi>GREAT-BRITAIN</hi> is, I believe, the only nation that hath fairly tried the experiment. All other governments, that I know of, have certain deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated characters: they are either deſpotic, monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, ariſtocratical, or democratical. But the Engliſh conſtitution is none of theſe, and yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the nature of each. Their writers tell us, that by mixing the forms, they enjoy all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective advantages, and that they reciprocally check each other, ſo as to counteract all their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dangers and inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>ALL this is made very clear in theory; but if we attend to facts, we ſhall find that the ſcheme does not fully anſwer the great purpoſes it ſeems to promiſe. Their hiſtory is a proof; wherein we ſee perpetual ſtruggles between the crown and the people for encroachments of power on the one hand, or an extenſion of privileges on the other: and their annual publications, and frequent changes of men in office, in modern as well as ancient times, ſhew them to be ſubject to all the evils of faction and inſtability. The truth is, that ſo nice an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of ſo complicated a machine—ſuch a due proportion of ſtrength in the component parts that they ſhall not interfere with or impede each other —ſuch an accurate diſpoſition of heterogeneous powers, that each ſhall naturally find out its own
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:024407_0591_0FC6F9206BCE0510"/>
ſpecific gravity, and reſt in quiet, can only exiſt in theory; the paſſions of mankind will ever prevent its continuance in fact.</p>
                  <p>DON'T be alarmed: I am not going to diſcuſs this intricate ſubject at large; I wonder how I got ſo far into it: I have neither leiſure, inclination, or ability to purſue it. I had fixed my attention only on one particular part of the Engliſh conſtitution, on which I mean to give you my ſentiments; and reſpecting this, I have been for ſome weeks paſt making aſſiduous and minute enquiries—I mean the <hi>adminiſtration of juſtice by grand and petit juries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt firſt give you as conciſe a detail as I can of this eſtabliſhment, that you may the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my obſervations upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GRAND JURIES</hi> are only made uſe of in caſes of criminal proceſs, or public offence; <hi>petit juries</hi> in all caſes of trial, whether for a breach of the laws, for private wrongs, or property in diſpute. <note n="*" place="bottom">There are ſome ſpecies of trials in England, where juries are not concerned; but it is not neceſſary to enumerate them here, as my preſent object is only the trial by juries.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE ſheriff of the county or diſtrict, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:024407_0592_0FC6F921DB0F1FC0"/>
of a writ directed to him by the judges, makes out a liſt of 24 honeſt and ſubſtantial free-holders, that is men of character, who poſſeſs a real or land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſtate in the county. To each of theſe he ſends a written or printed notice to attend the court on a certain day. If the ſheriff does his duty, theſe ought to be men moſt reſpectable for property, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and abilities; ſo that poverty may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to a corrupt abuſe of their office, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance lead them to an abſurd exerciſe of it.</p>
                  <p>NOT leſs than twelve, or more than twenty-three, are competent to the formation of a grand jury. Generally from fifteen to eighteen are conſidered as a ſuitable number.</p>
                  <p>WHEN theſe are convened in court, the oath of office is adminiſtered to them, which is a very ſtrict one. They ſwear that they will not accuſe any perſon for hatred or malice; or ſuffer any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to eſcape unaccuſed from any favour or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or hope of reward. Thus qualified they retire to any apartment they pleaſe to perform the duty the law hath aſſigned to them.</p>
                  <p>THEY are called the <hi>grand inqueſt</hi> for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: becauſe it is their buſineſs to enquire of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences that may have been committed within that
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:024407_0593_0FC6F9237425DA80"/>
diſtrict, and preſent them to the notice of the court. They are to receive information from every ſource; but particularly from the officer called the <hi>king's attorney,</hi> or the proſecutor in behalf of government. The bills of accuſation are all framed by this offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who ſends them to the grand jury for enquiry, together with the witneſſes in ſupport of the bills.</p>
                  <p>THE jury then proceed to make a careful inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the charge, to examine the witneſſes, and conſider the whole matter in a large and liberal view; but the accuſed perſon is not ſuffered to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and make his defence, this not being the time aſſigned for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>IF the grand jury, or a majority of them, find ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe to believe that the party is guilty of the crimes alledged againſt him, their foreman, in behalf of the whole body, endorſes on the bill <hi>billa vera,</hi> or <hi>a true bill;</hi> if otherwiſe, he endorſes the word <hi>ignoramus,</hi> as much as to ſay, this charge may be true, but we do not know that it is ſo. The rejection of a bill by the grand jury does not operate as an acquittal; for the party may be again indicted for the ſame offence, if fuller teſtimony in ſupport of the accuſation can afterwards be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:024407_0594_0FC6F928F8A94B78"/>THE bills, thus endorſed, are brought into court and delivered to the judges. The party againſt whom the bill is found (as it is called) muſt be then ſent for, and perſonally appear in court. If this cannot be done, the trial muſt be put off till he can be taken and brought to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the accuſed perſon appears, the bill, now called an <hi>indictment,</hi> is diſtinctly read to him by the clerk of the court, who peremptorily demands of him whether he is <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty</hi> of the charge as laid in the indictment. If the party abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to anſwer, the court cannot, according to the ſtrict rules of common law, proceed againſt him; becauſe he does not voluntarily ſubmit his cauſe to that juriſdiction, by aſſenting to or denying the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation: for the law does not allow that any court hath an official power to determine on a man's life or property, unleſs by his own act he conſents, or ſeems to conſent, to ſubmit himſelf to its juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is ſuppoſed to be done by his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his plea, that is, by acknowledging or denying the charge brought againſt him.</p>
                  <p>THERE have been inſtances in former times of perſons ſtanding <hi>mute,</hi> and refuſing to plead to the indictment; to remedy which, a moſt abſurd and barbarous practice was admitted to enforce an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:024407_0595_0FC6F92BB42ED360"/>
The party was taken to priſon, and laid upon his back, naked, on the floor of a dungeon, his arms and legs were tied by four cords to the four corners of the dungeon: he was ſparingly fed with the moſt coarſe and ordinary bread that could be got, and drink brought him from the neareſt ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; a weight was alſo laid upon his breaſt, and a like weight daily added, until, by his intolerable ſituation, he was compelled to anſwer <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty.</hi> This operation is called in their books <hi>paine forte &amp; dure.</hi> But this ſavage proceſs is now obſolete: and it is declared by ſtatute, that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtinately mute ſhall be an equivalent to a confeſſion of guilt, and ſentence ſhall be paſſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. The caſe never occurs now. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner generally pleads <hi>not guilty,</hi> and is thereby ſaid to join in iſſue, and put himſelf upon his trial. If he is a ſtranger, or ſo poor that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage an advocate to aſſiſt him in his defence, the judges always aſſign him council, and allow him ſome ſhort time for preparation.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the day of trial comes, the priſoner is again ſent for to court; for it is eſſential to the proceſs that he ſhould be perſonally preſent during the whole buſineſs. The ſheriff hath previouſly ſummoned a number of perſons to ſerve on the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit jury.</hi> Twelve perſons, and no more, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:024407_0596_0FC6F93032C88CA0"/>
for this purpoſe; but he generally returns forty-eight or more names to the court, according to circumſtances, becauſe the accuſed hath a right to make many objections. Theſe names are called over in court, and the perſons who appear are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented one by one before the priſoner, who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to look at him, and ſay whether he has any objection to his being one of the jury which is to determine his fate. If the crime charged is capital, the priſoner has a legal right to <hi>challenge perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> twenty of the perſons offered for jurymen, that is, to ſet them aſide from caprice, from a diſlike to their countenances, or any other ſecret motive, without giving any reaſon for his ſo doing; and he has, moreover, a right to challenge or object to as many more as he ran give ſufficient reaſons for rejecting: ſuch as the perſon offered being in any degree intereſted in the event; his having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the matter, by declaring his opinion in converſation; his having heretofore been convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of perjury, with many other cauſes of legal diſability.</p>
                  <p>WHEN this inveſtigation is gone through, and twelve unexceptionable perſons appear, who have all been ſworn, <hi>well and truly to try the cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, and a true verdict give according to the evidence,</hi> they are put together in a convenient
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:024407_0597_0FC6F931C8583B00"/>
place, to hear the whole matter, and muſt not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate until a final deciſion is given; nor muſt any perſon whiſper or ſpeak to them (except when they aſk queſtions of the court or of the witneſſes) or deliver any meſſage or writing to them; any of theſe happening would vitiate the whole proceſs. Yet the judges, the lawyers employed, or the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, may addreſs them aloud in open court. If a juryman ſhould have occaſion to retire during the trial, he muſt aſk leave of the court, and a conſtable muſt attend him the whole time of his abſence, and the proceedings muſt be ſuſpended till his return.</p>
                  <p>THE trial commences by the king's attorney<note n="*" place="bottom">Or the clerk of the court for him.</note> reading the indictment aloud to the jury: after which he produces his witneſſes in ſupport of the accuſation. Theſe witneſſes muſt all be examined on oath, and deliver their teſtimony <hi>viva voce</hi> in the preſence of the priſoner, and of the whole court. After the king's attorney hath done with a witneſs, the advocate for the priſoner croſs examines him: he aſks him queſtions which may tend to embarraſs him: he preſſes him as to the certainty of his knowledge: he endeavours to make him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf; or ſay ſomething that may indicate
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:024407_0598_0FC6F934023A86B0"/>
paſſion or intereſt; and exerciſes every art that may tend to invalidate his teſtimony, or weaken its force. If theſe manoeuvres, however, are carried too far, the judge will, or ought to, interfere, and check a too great licentiouſneſs in the treatment of a witneſs. When the king's attorney hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all his teſtimony, he addreſſes the jury; he recapitulates what the witneſſes have advanced; he enforces the law, and applies it to the preſent caſe; and ſupports his arguments by authorities from the books reſpecting caſes of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>THE council for the priſoner then produces his witneſſes in behalf of the accuſed, who are alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally croſs examined by the king's attorney. When the whole of the teſtimony has been exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of which the judges and the council take notes in writing, the lawyer for the priſoner begins his defence: he dwells upon, and enforces every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable circumſtance: he endeavours to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date or throw doubts upon the proofs againſt him: he labours to explain away the law, and finally addreſſes himſelf to the tender feelings of the jury. He muſt now diſplay the whole of his abilities, for he is not allowed to ſpeak again. The king's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney then replies; he obviates the objections that have been made, either to the teſtimony or to
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:024407_0599_0FC6F93568E5DD28"/>
his ſtatement of the law; he points at the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the defence; and enlarges upon the proof againſt the priſoner; and, laſtly, ſubmits the whole matter to the determination of the jury.</p>
                  <p>THERE is then a cuſtomary, but not a neceſſary, indulgence allowed to the priſoner in capital caſes: and this I think a very pathetic part of the proceſs. The accuſed perſon has been all this time a ſilent ſpectator of the proceedings; but he is now permitted to addreſs the jury himſelf, and tell his own ſtory in his own way.</p>
                  <p>THIS, conſidering his critical ſituation, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a very intereſting part of the ceremony; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the party is indeed innocent of the crime alledged, but labouring under a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unlucky circumſtances and untoward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. I have been more affected by the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple narrative of the priſoner himſelf, than by all the finiſhed eloquence of the council who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took his defence.</p>
                  <p>AFTER this, the judge ſums up the whole of the teſtimony to the jury: he omits unneceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, and brings pointedly into view all thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which are of any importance either for or againſt the priſoner: and opens and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:024407_0600_0FC6F939DF6CFF88"/>
the law, if in the leaſt doubtful, and often inſtructs the jury what determination they ought, in his opinion, to give.</p>
                  <p>THE jury, being now charged with the whole matter, are conducted to ſome private apartment, where they are ſhut up, and a conſtable is placed on the out ſide of the door; and there they muſt remain, ſecluded from all external communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whatever, without meat, drink or ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of any kind until they ſhall have <hi>unanimouſly</hi>
agreed in their judgment. Any <hi>one</hi> diſſenting voice will annihilate the verdict or deciſion. When they have all agreed, they give notice thereof to the conſtable at the door, who immediately ſends information to the judge. The court, if not then ſitting, forthwith convenes, and the priſoner is again ſent for; for it is abſolutely neceſſary that the verdict ſhould be given in his preſence. The jury then come into court, and the clerk having called over their names, to ſhew that none are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, aſks them if they have agreed in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict?—they anſwer in the affirmative. He then demands of them, whether the priſoner is <hi>guilty</hi>
or <hi>not guilty</hi> of the crime with which he ſtands charged?—to which the foreman of the jury, in behalf of the reſt, anſwers <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> as the caſe may be. This the clerk immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:024407_0601_0FC6F93C2575C860"/>
and then deſires the jury to attend to their verdict, as the court hath recorded it, demanding aſſent, which is again given.</p>
                  <p>THIS determination is called a <hi>verdict,</hi> or <hi>vere-dictum.</hi> Becauſe the law preſumes that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever twelve impartial men, ſo ſelected, ſo ſworn, and ſo inſtructed, ſhall, with united voice, declare, muſt inevitably be the truth: neither will the law ſuffer a verdict, ſo given and recorded, to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doubted or conteſted.</p>
                  <p>IF the priſoner has been found <hi>guilty,</hi> the judge aſks him what he has to ſay why the ſentence of the law ſhould not be pronounced againſt him? For, even in this laſt ſtage, the priſoner may, if he can, ſhew ſome defect in the proceedings, ſome uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the indictment, or other irregularity of force ſufficient to arreſt the judgment. For when the law preſumes that the jury have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the truth, it ſuppoſes the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to have been fair, regular and legal; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the verdict is not founded on ſuch a baſis as the law requires, and therefore is not that legal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible truth it looks for. If the priſoner has no ſuch plea to make, judgement is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him; and he has no chance left but that of the king's pardon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="unknown:024407_0602_0FC6F93EA9C2C7D8"/>THERE are ſeveral minutiae in this proceſs, and ſome exceptions which I have omitted; but the above is the general outline of trial in criminal caſes.</p>
                  <p>IN diſputes about property, and actions for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the ſame principle pervades the conduct of the ſuit; that is, to give the accuſed perſon all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible opportunity of defence. In civil cauſes, however, there is no grand jury; neither of the parties have a right to make peremptory challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and the jury are not ſo rigidly treated as in caſes of life and death; yet their determination or verdict muſt be <hi>unanimous,</hi> as in the former caſe; and there is no reverſing their verdict, but by diſcovering ſome error in the proceedings, or ſome fraud or corruption in the jury</p>
                  <p>SUCH is the mode of adminiſtring juſtice in this country. A ſyſtem which is deemed the palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Britiſh liberty, and the ſubject of perpetual panegyrick. And no wonder; ſince, as a ſyſtem, nothing can be more perfect; inaſmuch as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to ſhield the pooreſt individual in the community againſt the ſecret ſtrokes of wealthy malice, or the open violence of overweening power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="unknown:024407_0603_0FC6F94466230BD8"/>BUT I have given you a delineation of what the practice ought to be, not what it may be. If the ſeveral parts of this machine ſhould in all inſtances operate according to their reſpective deſtinations, and no further, it would be very difficult for a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to eſcape, and next to impoſſible that an innocent man ſhould ſuffer: and in conteſts about property, there would be the greateſt reaſon to expect that impartial and ſubſtantial juſtice muſt take place.</p>
                  <p>I could myſelf enlarge, with the zeal of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, on the external beauty of this admirable fabric, and its apparent ſtrength as a bulwark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt oppreſſion. But let us now conſider the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to which this conſtitution is liable, and how far the good purpoſes of an excellent theory may be evaded or perverted in the execution.</p>
                  <p>IN the firſt place, the ſheriff ſelects and returns ſuch perſons as he pleaſes to ſerve on both juries: and here he has uncontrolled opportunity of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his own partialities, if he has any, reſpecting the perſons to be tried, or the cauſe depending: for it matters not what private paſſions or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the juries may have, provided they are <hi>legally</hi>
unexceptionable; and popular governments are ſo ſubject to party rage, that ſuch partialities in the ſheriff may ſometimes be expected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="unknown:024407_0604_0FC6F94695968510"/>INDEED, it is not uncommon for people here to form a judgment of the iſſue of a doubtful cauſe, from a knowledge of the jury which is to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. It is to guard againſt the ſheriff's <hi>packing</hi>
a jury, as it is called, that peremptory challenges are allowed in capital caſes.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the grand jury is formed, the judge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways addreſſes them from the bench. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led charging the grand jury, and ſhould, according to the original deſign, be no more than a general delineation of their duty, and the law definitions of the crimes and offences of which they are to make enquiry, and preſent to the juriſdiction of the court: becauſe theſe men being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elected from the maſs of the people, are not ſuppoſed to be verſed in legal preciſion and niceties. But the judge often takes this opportunity of going farther: he inſinuates to them, that they may indict on mere <hi>probable</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; that they ſhould attend only to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in behalf of the proſecution, and have nothing to do with any witneſſes but thoſe whom the king's attorney ſhall ſend to them; and that if they find the bill, it will amount to nothing more than a kind of legal accuſation, which, if wrong, will be afterwards ſet right by the petit jury. But this is a deviation from the original conſtitution, which placed the grand jury at the firſt entrance
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:024407_0605_0FC6F9476194A248"/>
of the law to ſcreen the innocent from malicious proſecutions. For what with confinement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and infamy, a man may be effectually ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the grand jury's finding a bill againſt him, although he may be afterwards fully acquitted by the petit jury.</p>
                  <p>THUS charged, however, the grand jury retire. Now it ſhould be conſidered that theſe are called off from their ordinary buſineſs to perform a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary duty, not very agreeable in itſelf, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no profit; but, on the contrary, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what expenſive. The ideas they have imbibed from the charge, have a great tendency to relax the binding force of their oath of office: their preſent duty is in the law line, and they do not pretend to underſtand law: but the judge who does under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, has inſtructed them; and on his opinion they reſt the ſanctity of their oath, and the rights of their ſtation. When ſuch principles prevail, the real uſe of a grand jury is in a great meaſure ſet aſide, and the inſtitution becomes rather a burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ceremony, than a real advantage.</p>
                  <p>THE judge has a manifeſt influence over both the grand and petit juries; but he muſt exerciſe this with moderation and diſcretion; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have in general a pretty juſt knowledge of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024407_0606_0FC6F952548480A0"/>
their fundamental rights; theſe they will ſuffer to be impaired through indolence, inattention, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, but will never ſuffer them to be directly violated or called in queſtion. The judge may inſinuate any thing, but if he openly aſſumes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional powers over the jury, he is ſure to be oppoſed with invincible firmneſs. And when ever an open conteſt of this kind happens, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will certainly have the popular current in their favour, unleſs they ſhould be ſo notoriouſly in the the wrong as to preclude all defence of their conduct.</p>
                  <p>THE petit jury, are now to be formed, or, as it is called, <hi>impannelled.</hi> And here again is a large field for contrivance and addreſs. In ſuits for damages or for property, great dexterity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed on both ſides for ſecuring proper men on the jury. So great are the apprehenſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairneſs and diſadvantage in this particular, that it is common for the parties in the ſuit to demand that the cauſe ſhall be tried by what is called a <hi>ſtruck jury.</hi> When this happens the prothonotary, or clerk of the court, makes out a liſt of 48 good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men of the county, and from this liſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or their attornies for them, alternately ſtrike out the names of ſuch as they do not approve until there are but 24 names left.

24 are ſummoned by the ſheriff to attend the court, and the firſt 12 of the number who ſhall make their appearance on the day of trial, and anſwer to their names, are to compoſe the jury who are to determine the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the jury have been impannelled, have heard the teſtimony and the arguments, and the judge has ſummed up the whole matter, they retire to form their verdict. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as I before obſerved, they are excluded from all external communication, ſuſtenance, or comfort. By theſe means they are compelled to make up a unanimous opinion or ſtarve, be the caſe never ſo doubtful or difficult. In this lies the principal fallacy of the ſyſtem; inaſmuch as it is next to an impoſſibility that twelve men, of various tempers, abilities and knowledge, ſhould freely and decidedly unite in judgment on a diſputable and uncertain caſe. The truth is, they ſeldom ſuffer any great extremities for conſcience ſake<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>"And wretches hang, that jurymen may dine."</p>

                        </bibl>
                     </note>. The laſt impreſſions they received came from the judge; his ſtation, his authority, his knowledge in the law, will give an almoſt invincible force to theſe impreſſions. And the reſult is, that nine times in ten, the verdict, eſpecially in civil caſes, is made conformably to his opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="unknown:024407_0608_0FC6F95667C85F38"/>THE deſignated legal power of an Engliſh judge is not very conſiderable; but the <hi>official influence</hi>
he has over the determinations of juries, ſubjects, in a great degree, the lives and property of the people to his judgment or caprice. And this maſked power is the more dangerous; becauſe, if he ſhould be partial, unjuſt, or corrupt, his conduct is ſcreened by the intervention of the jury, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deciſion being their verdict, not his.</p>
                  <p>BUT ſuppoſe the judge ſtates the caſe impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to the jury, without making any attempt to bias their judgment; the conſequence is, that ſome leading man in the jury will bring over the reſt to his opinion, or ſome very obſtinate man wear out the patience of his fellows. There have been inſtances when eleven have agreed upon a verdict and the perſevering twelfth has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to change their minds, and yield to the ſuperior ſtrength of his conſtitution. It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens that a verdict is put to the vote, and the minority accedes to the opinion of the majority. But moſt commonly the verdict is determined by the advice of the judge, or the opinion of one of the jury of more reputed knowledge than the reſt. So that in diſputable caſes, it ſeldom, if ever, happens that the final verdict is that free, clear, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous deciſion of twelve impartial men, under
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:024407_0609_0FC6F95B0296B458"/>
oath, which the law preſumes, and which the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem requires. If two or more of the jury ſhould be of contrary opinions, and neither will give way, no verdict can poſſibly be given in. In ſuch a caſe, which ſometimes occurs, there is but one remedy, which indeed is not countenanced by law, but ſuggeſted by neceſſity. It is this. The ſheriff, or ſome body for him, ſteals away one of the jury from the bar, ſo that when the clerk calls over their names, it is found that there are but eleven jurymen, and this invalidates all the proceedings. The buſineſs muſt be put off to another court, and the whole proceſs begun <hi>de novo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF, when the verdict is given in, the judge ſhould not approve of it, he ſometimes takes the liberty of ſending back the jury to reconſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if they perſiſt, he muſt finally ſubmit and record the verdict. But ſuch caſes ſeldom occur. In general the juries take their tone from the judge's charge. When they have given in their deciſion, they are diſcharged, and diſperſe, and are never after accountable for what they have done, unleſs in caſes of manifeſt corruption. It is with them, as with all popular bodies—the individuals never think themſelves reſponſible for what the whole have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="unknown:024407_0610_0FC6F95C7086BAC0"/>IN cauſes which do not ſo much depend upon expoſitions of law, ſuch as an equitable adjuſtment of long and intricate accounts, or ſatisfaction for injuries which cannot ſo well be aſcertained by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal teſtimony, it is cuſtomary for the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties to conſent in open court to a reference. Whereupon the judges nominate three or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different perſons to hear and arbitrate the matters in variance. Theſe arbitrators are not compelled to be unanimous, neither are they ſubjected to the other reſtrictions of a jury. They meet when and where they pleaſe, they inveſtigate the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their own manner, and in their own time, and finally ſend their award in writing to the court. And this award, when received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, becomes the judgment of the court.</p>
                  <p>ARBITRATIONS are liable to this imperfection. The arbitrators not having the opinion of the judge to reſt upon, not being reſtrained by rigid rules, being few in number, and moving in an enlarged ſphere of inveſtigation, are more pointed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perſonally anſwerable, in reputation at leaſt, for the rectitude and propriety of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. In this ſituation, the general aim, in difficult caſes is, if poſſible, to ſatisfy both the contending parties, and ſo avoid the complaints or cenſures of either; and this they frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:024407_0611_0FC6F95DF4948A70"/>
by halving the value in diſpute between them, when it can be done; and thus ſubſtantial juſtice is done to neither.</p>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH the Engliſh law leans ſo ſtrongly in favour of the accuſed in criminal caſes, giving every reaſonable advantage to the party who is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his defence, yet the form of proceſs is ſo decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo well underſtood, that unneceſſary delays ſeldom occur; but this is far from being the caſe in civil actions, which are attended with ſo many complex circumſtances, forms, and delays, all which incur a conſiderable expence, that the plaintiff, unleſs in very plain caſes, ſuch as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed bond, or note of hand, had better put up with a ſmall injury or loſs, than to proſecute his ſuit, although in the end he ſhould prove ſucceſsful. For here the the law is ſo unreaſonably in favour of the defendant, and allows him ſo many dilatory pleas, cauſes of adjournment, and removals from court to court, that a wealthy wrong-doer, with the help of able council, may weary out the moſt equitable claimant by exhauſting his patience and his purſe.</p>
                  <p>WHEN an action is brought, the right or wrong of the caſe, or what is called the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the cauſe, never come into view till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:024407_0612_0FC6F9641D5191C8"/>
the cloſe of the buſineſs. The only queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, whether the plaintiff hath brought, and conducted his claim, according to the ſtrict forms of law, which forms are not ſettled by any code or determinate ſyſtem; but muſt be gathered from the authorities, that is, from the reports of former determinations when like points of proceſs have been conteſted. The intention of throwing theſe obſtacles in the way of juſtice is to prevent the plaintiff from over-reaching the defendant in any ſtage of the proceſs. But the evils attending this extreme caution are more than a balance to the dangers it is deſigned to obviate.</p>
                  <p>IT would be in vain for me to give you the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the many cauſes of delay that may legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occur in the purſuit of a manifeſtly equitable title to a tract of land, whole volumes would be inſufficient to the purpoſe; my preſent object on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects the mode of trial by jury, not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice of the law in this country.</p>
                  <p>THE reſult of my obſervations amounts to this, that perfection is not to be looked for in human inſtitutions. The Britiſh form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as Britiſh juriſprudence, exhibits a ſpecious appearance of perfect ſecurity to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but this perfect ſecurity exiſts only in the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:024407_0613_0FC6F96675A24538"/>
theory; the propoſed object of the ſyſtem is to enſure to the people all the good effects of wiſdom and integrity in their rulers and officers of juſtice; but wiſdom and integrity are abſolutely neceſſary to the due execution of the plan. So that the effects promiſed muſt in fact precede the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is a political <hi>petitio principii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN England, all laws are ſuppoſed to be made by the free conſent of the people, by means of their repreſentatives; and judical deciſions to be the verdict of twelve impartial men, unanimous in their opinions. Neither of theſe poſitions are ſtrictly true in fact. It is moſt notorious, that, in the firſt caſe, the members of parliament fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently purchaſe the voices of the people, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſell their own and votes to the king or his miniſter; ſo that the king can almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways command a majority of parliamentary voices. And, in the ſecond caſe, the authority of the judge moſt commonly influences the verdict of a jury; ſo that in truth, the king makes the laws, and the judges execute them, whilſt the people only <hi>ſeem</hi> to do both;—and they remain content with this <hi>ſeeming,</hi> until adminiſtration becomes too manifeſtly oppreſſive and corrupt. When this happens they ſtruggle for original rights, by
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:024407_0614_0FC6F9691A719B88"/>
inſurrections and revolutions; which is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular remedy common to every government, when that government is ſo exerciſed as to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.</p>
                  <p>THESE remarks may perhaps appear too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but they are founded in truth. A candid Engliſhman would acknowledge, that the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections I have pointed at, may, and ſometimes do, occur in their political ſyſtem; but he would urge, and with ſome reaſon too, that, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered, all evils balanced, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences averaged, the conſtitution of his country is the ſafeſt and beſt yet deviſed for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe two difficult problems—<hi>The ſecurity of the people's rights, with the dignity and vigour of government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will readily acknowledge, that, upon the whole, juſtice is well admininiſtred in this country; but I believe this is more owing to the abilities and integrity of their judges, than to the infallibility of their ſyſtem. A bad judge might be a curſe to the people, without directly violating the legal rules of his official conduct.</p>
                  <p>FOR my own part, I am of opinion, that the happineſs of a people depends more upon their
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:024407_0615_0FC6F971EF79E670"/>
national character than their form of government. A truly enlightened people cannot be enſlaved real deſpotiſm cannot be exerciſed, unleſs the maſs of the people are either ſtupidly ignorant, groſsly licentious and immoral, or extremely begotted. In the firſt caſe, they ſubmit to every impoſition, becauſe they know nothing of the rights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the origin of delegated power; in the ſecond, they become enervated by luxury, and indifferent to thoſe rights and privileges, of which they have rendered themſelves unworthy; and, in the third, their tyrant will take care to have the prieſthood on his ſide, and make the conſciences of his ſubjects the chains by which he will hold them in the moſt abject ſervitude; or, which is not improbable, the prieſthood will be themſelves the tyrants, and keep both the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>OF all the means by which a nation may be made miſerable, this laſt is the moſt wicked and moſt effectual. Freed from this ſervitude, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot, in this age of the world, long remain either ſtupidly ignorant, or groſsly immoral; but inexorable bigotry and rooted ſuperſtition lock up the doors of knowledge and preclude reformation.

                  <argument>
                     <p>☞ AN attack was made upon the Bank of North America, by a then prevailing party. <hi>Mr. T. Payne,</hi> author of a very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pamphlet, which he publiſhed in the beginning of the late war, under the title of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> took up his pen in defence of the Bank. This performance occaſioned the following ironical anſwer; which, however, was never publiſhed; as the ſucceeding houſe of aſſembly ſoon repealed the act for disfranchiſing that inſtitution.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>THE REMARKS OF <hi>UNCOMMON SENSE</hi> ON A LATE PAMPHLET ENTITLED DISSERTATIONS ON GOVERNMENT, THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK, &amp;c. BY THE AUTHOR OF <hi>COMMON SENSE.</hi> 1785.</head>
                  <p>IT is ſaid of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that he would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to move the globe of the earth, provided a place could be had whereon he might erect his machine. So it is with ſpeculative authors in every
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:024407_0619_0FC6F97C9DF70D10"/>
ſcience. Grant them only a few firſt principles or <hi>data,</hi> ſo called, becauſe they muſt depend upon the reader's benevolence for admiſſion, being either not true in fact, or incapable of proof; I ſay, grant but theſe, and the ſubſequent reaſoning cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be controverted. Give an ingenious author a point whereon to reſt the fulcrum of his argument, and he will move whole ſyſtems, phyſical, moral, or political.</p>
                  <p>THE manifeſt purpoſe of the pamphlet before me is to juſtify the <hi>Bank of North-America</hi> as a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtitution, notwithſtanding that it hath been declared by act of aſſembly to be a pernicious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and incompatible with the public ſafety; and to ſhew that the legiſlature had no legal right to deprive it of its charter; and alſo to cenſure and ridicule a reſpectable committee of the houſe, upon whoſe report the act for disfranchiſing the bank was founded.</p>
                  <p>IN order to prove that the aſſembly had no right to retract a charter once granted, without ſome legal forfeiture or breach of conditions on the part of the grantees, he reſts the fulcrum of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on certain firſt principles of government. Now, if theſe firſt principles ſhould be found on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination to be laid on hollow ground; that is, that
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:024407_0620_0FC6F97E1D5DC6C8"/>
however true they may be in reaſon, they are not true in fact, it will follow, that the author, the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, the argument, and the bank of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, muſt all ſink together—Let us then take a ſhort view of this writer's ground work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>COMMON-SENSE</hi> tells us, that in all governments there muſt be a ſovereign power ſomewhere, and that the repoſitory where this ſovereignty is placed is the firſt criterion of diſtinction between a deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic form of government and a free country: that in the firſt, it is poſſeſſed by an individual in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary right; in the ſecond, it is held by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large, and by them periodically aſſigned to their delegates or repreſentatives.</p>
                  <p>THE fallacy of this ſuppoſed axiom conſiſts in his conſidering ſovereign power as a ſimple elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary principle; whereas it is manifeſtly diviſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to at leaſt two component parts: viz. <hi>power,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only in reference to the act or thing done, or to be done; and <hi>will,</hi> conſidered as influencing and dictating the exerciſe of that power. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in a mill, the <hi>power</hi> of grinding corn is in the ſtones, wheels, and movements of the machine; but the <hi>will</hi> is in the miller, who ſuperintends and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns its operations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="unknown:024407_0621_0FC6F98419673068"/>A mere act of <hi>power</hi> may be exerciſed without the concurrence of the <hi>will</hi>: and that there may be a <hi>will,</hi> without a <hi>power</hi> to carry it into effect, will not be denied. Now the true criterion of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between a deſpotic rule and the free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennſylvania conſiſts in this; that in the former caſe, the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> are both inherent in an individual and his ſucceſſors; whereas in Pennſylvania, the <hi>power</hi> of making laws is in the houſe of aſſembly; but the <hi>will</hi> that ſuggeſts, dictates to, and influences this <hi>power,</hi> is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with certain learned and worthy perſons, who are not members of that houſe, and who are not veſted with the power of actually making laws.</p>
                  <p>I begin to perceive that I have involved myſelf in a very difficult and ſubtle argument—I wiſh I may be able to make myſelf underſtood.</p>
                  <p>A majority of voices in the houſe of aſſembly have an undoubted right to order the ſeals of the commonwealth to be affixed to a bill which hath previouſly paſſed the forms of legiſlation. The ſeals being thus affixed, that bill becomes a law, binding on all whom it may concern, being citizens of the ſtate. Now this is a mere naked act of <hi>power,</hi> the authenticity of which does not at all depend on a
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:024407_0622_0FC6F9866F5FCAD8"/>
genuine concurrence of <hi>will</hi> in thoſe who exerciſe it; for the <hi>will</hi> is either directly or remotely the offspring of the underſtanding; yet the law would be valid, although the majority that voted it into exiſtence, ſhould be totally ignorant of its principles and operation.</p>
                  <p>I will put a caſe, which I confeſs, is a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd one; but it will ſerve to illuſtrate my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>SUPPOSE a conteſt ſhould ariſe reſpecting the true tranſlation of a paſſage in the original Hebrew bible; and that this difference of opinion ſhould occaſion ſuch hot diſputes and angry parties in the ſtate as to make it neceſſary for the legiſlature to interfere and determine the point. Suppoſe innumerable petitions <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> to be laid before the houſe, and that at laſt a committee ſhould be appointed to <hi>enquire</hi> and report upon the merits of the queſtion. This committee having no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Hebrew tongue will naturally apply to ſome learned men—heads of one of the parties, but not members of the houſe, who will tell them—
<q>This is a buſineſs you do not underſtand—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblymen never read Hebrew, they only read newſpapers—but we will draw up a report for you.</q>
The report is accordingly drawn up by
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:024407_0623_0FC6F98802D03318"/>
theſe learned men—the committee adopt it—they lay it before the houſe—a bill is drawn conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thereto, and paſſed into a law, and ſo the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is decided. Now, in this tranſaction there is a manifeſt ſeparation of the <hi>will</hi> from the <hi>power.</hi> The committee had the power of preſenting the report, and the houſe of paſſing it into a law; but neither the committee nor the houſe could poſſibly exerciſe any <hi>will</hi> on a ſubject of which they had not the leaſt knowledge or underſtanding. Their <hi>will</hi> might, indeed, be exerciſed in the ſervice of the party they wiſhed to favour, but not in the deciſion of the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>On theſe principles I venture to aſſert in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a late committee on the affairs of the bank, againſt the aſperſions of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> that, let their report be proper or improper, let the law paſſed thereupon be juſt or unjuſt, no cenſure can poſſibly lie againſt the committee, becauſe, ſome few inſtances excepted, no man is reſponſible for an act in which his <hi>will</hi> did not concur.</p>
                  <p>BUT the committee does not ſtand in need of this or any other defence: their report was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſt and proper, and exhibited an intimate knowledge of the conſtitution and tendency of the bank of North-America: as I ſhall fully ſhew
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:024407_0624_0FC6F98ED2C69C30"/>
when I come to enumerate the high crimes of the preſident, directors, and ſtockholders of our national bank.</p>
                  <p>SOVEREIGNTY being thus diviſible into <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> the advantage of our free government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that let who will exerciſe the <hi>power</hi> in the houſe of legiſlation, the <hi>will</hi> of government may be poſſeſſed by worthy and enterpriſing men out of the houſe, by which the labour of law-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is divided and becomes eaſy and advantageous.</p>
                  <p>ON this ſingularity in our political ſyſtem is founded a doctrine, not long ſince advanced by learned men, which, if eſtabliſhed, muſt fully anſwer the purpoſes of thoſe who diſcovered it, viz. that aſſemblies, juries, and ſuch confidential appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are nothing more than LEGAL MACHINES, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Vol. I. p. 205</note>
deſigned to give legal ſanction to the views of thoſe, who from ſuperior abilities and official greatneſs, are beſt qualified to influence and direct them. It would be a ſtrange thing indeed if the mill ſhould grind what ſort of grain it pleaſed, and go, or ſtop, according to its own caprices.</p>
                  <p>THAT <hi>Common Senſe</hi> has taken a wrong ground of argument is plain from this. He gives a copy

our bill of rights, and from thence deduces his ſyſtem of reaſoning. It had been more to the purpoſe, if, inſtead of a bill of <hi>rights,</hi> he had given us a bill of <hi>facts.</hi> A bill of rights is a very uſeful thing in the commencement of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; like leading ſtrings for a child it aſſiſts it in walking before it has ſtrength to go alone. But when the government is eſtabliſhed, what occaſion can there be for a bill of rights? When the houſe is built, the ſcaffolding ſhould be taken away. When the Ship is launched, ſhe leaves her former ſupports behind.</p>
                  <p>IT may be aſked if the bill of rights and our frame of government are no longer to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, where ſhall we look for a rule of conduct?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>precedent</hi> will always furniſh ſufficient rules of conduct. In the commencement of a republic, it is plain there can be no <hi>precedents:</hi>
all things are then new; and a bill of rights, and a deſignated conſtitution, muſt be the ſtandards of authority. As the republic advances in ſtrength and ſtability, <hi>precedents</hi> ſprout ſpontaneouſly, kill the roots of original rights, and in time occupy the whole ground. The only difficulty is to create and eſtabliſh the firſt precedent. This done, it
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:024407_0626_0FC6F991B00D6058"/>
will ſoon become a powerful engine. Like an anchor to windward, it will enable the ſkilful pilot to warp the ſhip againſt wind and tide. It will alſo prove very prolific; for a good <hi>precedent,</hi> like a good potatoe, contains within itſelf the eyes or germs of many future precedents or potatoes.</p>
                  <p>FOR example—In an early period of our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal exiſtence it ſeemed no great impropriety that committees of the houſe of aſſembly ſhould take the opinions of the judges on queſtions reſpecting mere law-points. But this ſoon grew to a cuſtom of ſending not queſtions only, but the bills them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the judges for conſideration. Thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, their honours ſoon undertook to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and even draw petitions to the aſſembly for or againſt meaſures which they wiſhed to promote or oppoſe; to frame reports for committees; and originated bills for the legiſlature; and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, by <hi>precedent,</hi> an out-of-doors influence, ſo ſtrong as virtually to poſſeſs the <hi>will</hi> of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; leaving to the houſe of aſſembly the more <hi>mechanical power</hi> of enacting laws.</p>
                  <p>THUS hath a total change, in effect, taken place in our conſtitution. We began with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle branch of legiſlation, and it is manifeſt that we
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:024407_0627_0FC6F997305346E0"/>
have now three diſtinct branches, viz. an upper houſe, a lower houſe, and a legiſlative council. Our upper houſe, it is well known, meet at the ſtate houſe in Cheſnut Street; the lower houſe aſſemble at the Indian Queen in Market Street<note n="*" place="bottom">The members of aſſembly, who at this time combined to form a majority in the houſe, uſed to meet in the evening at the Indian Queen, and there debate on queſtions which were to be agitated next day in the houſe. After debate, the queſtion was put to vote, and the then minority were to vote next day in aſſembly, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own judgments, but according to this previous determination. Such was the compact between them. See Page 86.</note>, and the judges from the ſupreme court form the legiſlative council. This council, in conjunction with the lower houſe, is the repoſitory of the <hi>will</hi>
of our ſovereignty, having a direct influence upon the acts of government whilſt under deliberation. And the council have, by <hi>precedent,</hi> acquired a ſeparate and excluſive right of <hi>reviſing, altering, and amending,</hi> the laws <hi>after they have been enacted and publiſhed.</hi> And thus hath our bill of <hi>facts</hi>
introduced a form of government very different from that deſignated in our bill of <hi>rights</hi> and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>HAVING ſhewn, to ſatisfaction I hope, that <hi>common Senſe</hi> hath entirely miſtaken the preſent conſtitution of Pennſylvania, it follows, that all
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:024407_0628_0FC6F99A0FAB8D08"/>
his arguments, founded on what our ſyſtem of government <hi>was,</hi> inſtead of what <hi>it is,</hi> muſt fall to the ground. Amongſt theſe, the firſt in rank is a ſubtile diſtinction between an <hi>act</hi> and a <hi>law.</hi> The deſign of which is to ſhew that there are not two ſorts of juſtice in nature. That the ſame juſtice which binds individuals in a bargain, ſhould bind the public in contracts. That the aſſembly, as the repreſentative body of the people, have a right to make contracts with individuals, and that the party or parties contracted with, have an intereſt in the bargain, which they cannot juſtly be deprived of by a mere arbitrary change of opinion in the grantor. Becauſe, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is an <hi>act,</hi> and not a <hi>law,</hi> ſubject to repeal at pleaſure. And ſo applying this doctrine to the caſe of the bank, he infers that the aſſembly had no right to deprive that corporation of its character.</p>
                  <p>BUT the fallacy of this reaſoning will appear, by conſidering the facts and principles juſt ſtated; I mean the ſeparation of the <hi>will</hi> from the <hi>power,</hi> in the ſovereignty of Pennſylvania.</p>
                  <p>SUPPOSE a remonſtrance to be made to the houſe of aſſembly, repreſenting, in ſtrong and plauſible terms, the injuſtice in thus depriving the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:024407_0629_0FC6F99B646A8668"/>
bank of its charter, without any legal conviction of its offence, or forfeiture on the part of that inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the natural anſwer would be,
<q>the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of this houſe is determined by a majority of voices; <hi>that</hi> majority is ſecured by the lower houſe, and influenced and directed by the legiſlative council. All the power we have is to enact laws, but what thoſe laws ſhall be, depends upon thoſe wiſe men who are in poſſeſſion of the ſovereignty of <hi>will.</hi> If any thing ſhould be wrong, we are not reſponſible, being nothing more than <hi>legal machines.</hi> Go to thoſe who direct our proceedings, and perhaps they may give you ſatisfaction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>SHOULD application then be made to the lower houſe, and legiſlative council, they would ſay,
<q>We have not the power to make laws, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal them; we can neither give charters, nor take them away; the ſeals of the commonwealth are not in our poſſeſſion; the houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is alone competent to your purpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND herein conſiſts the excellency of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that let things go a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they will, there is nobody to blame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:024407_0630_0FC6F99E0C5906A8"/>THE diſtinction between an <hi>act</hi> and a <hi>law</hi> made by <hi>Common Senſe</hi> has no real foundation; becauſe he places what he calls an <hi>act</hi> of aſſembly upon the footing of a grant or contract not revocable at pleaſure. But the binding force of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts depends upon a concurrence of the <hi>will</hi> and the <hi>act.</hi> And, therefore, a grant, bond, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, executed under compulſions, reſtraint, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due influence, is of no validity. Now, the <hi>will</hi>
being ſevered from the <hi>power,</hi> in our ſyſtem of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, it is impoſſible that acts of government ſhould be no more than contracts. All acts of aſſembly are in fact <hi>laws,</hi> and as ſuch, liable to be reviſed, amended, or totally repealed, let <hi>Common Senſe</hi> ſay what he will.</p>
                  <p>IN the caſe of a grant or charter under ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied conditions, there can be no doubt, but that the grantees are ſtrictly bound by the terms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; but, it would be beneath the dignity of government, that it ſhould be bound by any conditions whatever: <hi>ſovereign power</hi> ſcorns reſtraint.</p>
                  <p>I well recollect, that, in an argument held before a la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e houſe of aſſembly, reſpecting the bank, the advocate for thoſe who wiſhed to overturn that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, proceeded on the grounds and principles
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:024407_0631_0FC6F99F4DC93878"/>
I have above ſtated. Much was urged in favour of the <hi>power</hi> of the houſe. The ſame <hi>power,</hi> he ſaid, that creates, can annihilate: it would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, that the legiſlature can <hi>do,</hi> but cannot <hi>undo;</hi> and ſo on. But, not a word of the juſtice or injuſtice, the morality, or immorality, of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action; for theſe concern the <hi>will</hi> and not the <hi>power,</hi> and were points on which the orator knew the houſe was not reſponſible, for the reaſons I have given above. I remember alſo, that I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain great lawyer <note n="*" place="bottom">The Ch— J—.</note>, at that time, whether he thought that houſe could repeal the law for emancipating negroes, and ſo make them ſlaves again? He anſwered, that it had a legal power ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>SINCE then all acts of the legiſlature are laws, and as ſuch may be altered or repealed at pleaſure, to what purpoſe has this author taken ſo much pains? Can a pamphlet invalidate a law of the land? Will our aſſembly-men be ruled by the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Common Senſe?</hi> Will they ſuffer the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the ſtate to be bound in ſhackles? God forbid, that they ſhould ſo far forget themſelves their friends, and adherents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="unknown:024407_0632_0FC6F9A83A9D95B0"/>LET us now take a ſhort view of the preſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the bank. A learned and enlightened committee of the houſe of aſſembly, <hi>after a fair and impartial enquiry,</hi> have found and reported—
<q>That the bank, as at preſent eſtabliſhed, is in every view incompatible with the public ſafety</q>
—and a law founded on this report, hath been du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enacted, taking from that inſtitution the charter which the imprudence of a former aſſembly had <hi>granted and confirmed to it.</hi> To what purpoſe then, I again aſk, has <hi>Common Senſe</hi> taken ſo much pains? This corporation, ſo far as it depends for exiſtence on the charter in queſtion, exiſts no more. This cannot be denied. Does this author expect that our preſent aſſembly ſhould work miracles, and raiſe the dead? He cries out againſt the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of the proceedings that disfranchiſed the bank; what good can this do? After a criminal has been executed, what purpoſe can it anſwer to to diſcover inſufficiencies in the court that convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, or irregularities in his trial? Will theſe diſcoveries bring the man to life, and give him the chance of a new and fairer trial? Surely not.</p>
                  <p>A corporation can have but <hi>one</hi> life, viz. a legal or political life; but an individual may have <hi>two</hi> lives, and may exiſt in one, though deprived of the other—that is, an individual may be alive and in
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:024407_0633_0FC6F9A99BB8E0C8"/>
health in <hi>fact,</hi> and at the ſame time abſolutely dead in <hi>law.</hi> An inſtance of this happened ſome time ſince in the county of York. At a court of common pleas there, an ingenious lawyer contrived to have a report brought into court, that the plaintiff, in a certain action then depending, had ſuddenly died. This report was circulated with ſuch probable circumſtances that nobody doubted but that the poor man was dead. The action of courſe abated by the death of the plaintiff, and it was ſo entered upon the docket. At the next court the plaintiff appeared in <hi>propria perſona,</hi> and complained loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the injury that had been done him by this falſe report: but the ingenious lawyer aforeſaid, roſe up and aſſured the court that the man was dead, notwithſtanding his impertinent intruſion there: and for the truth of this, he appealed to the entry on the docket; hoping that the court would not allow any teſtimony to be given in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to a record, which, he obſerved, is the higheſt ſtandard of truth known in law.</p>
                  <p>NOW, although an individual may enjoy a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or two-fold life—as is clear from this man's being capable of a double death, for the plaintiff certainly died over again—yet corporations having no real, but only a political exiſtence, can die but once. Well! then, the annulling the charter of
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:024407_0634_0FC6F9AC208322A8"/>
the bank, having deprived that inſtitution of its political life, ſo far at leaſt as it depended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <note n="*" place="bottom">The bank had a charter from Congreſs, as well as from the ſtate of Pennſylvania</note> it neceſſarily follows that this bank is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, demiſed, deceaſed, and departed. And there is but one way left, that I know of, in which it can make its appearance amongſt us; and that is, by the walking of its diſcontented ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>SOME have thought that the bank may ſtill be conſidered as politically exiſting, by virtue of the charter it holds under the Congreſs of the United States: but as this is a very nice queſtion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with law learning, I ſhall reſerve it for future diſcuſſion in a chapter by itſelf. It only remains now to ſhew, that the bank has juſtly deſerved the fate it has found, by enumerating ſome of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold crimes and miſdemeanors it has committed, and the horrible dangers and evils to the ſtate with which that inſtitution was pregnant.</p>
                  <p>I cannot do this better than by following the ſteps of that enlightened committee, who may be ſaid to have been the jury which paſſed between the commonwealth and the bank on its life and death, under the ſacred ſanction of an oath of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:024407_0635_0FC6F9AD5C4C08A8"/>
They have found facts, which, after verdict, ought not to be diſputed; that is to ſay—</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>THE committee, to whom were referred the petitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bank, eſtabliſhed at Philadelphia, and who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to enquire, whether the ſaid bank be compatible with the public ſafety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, beg leave to report: that it is the opinion of this committee, that the ſaid bank, as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtabliſhed, is in every view incompatible with the public ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That in the preſent ſtate of our trade, the ſaid bank has a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to baniſh a great part of the ſpecie from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo as to produce a ſcarcity of money, and to collect into the hands ot the ſtockholders of the ſaid bank, almoſt the whole of the money which remains amongſt us. That, the accumulation of enormous wealth in the hands of a ſociety who claim perpetual duration, will neceſſarily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be entruſted in the hands of any ſet of men, whatſoever, without endangering the public ſafety. That, the ſaid bank, in its corporate capacity, is empowered to hold eſtates to the amount of ten millions of dollars; and, by the tenor of the preſent charter is to exiſt for ever, without being obliged to yield any emolument to the government, or to be at all dependant upon it. That, the great profits of the bank, which will daily encreaſe as money grows ſcarcer, and which already far exceeds the profit of European banks, have tempted foreigners to veſt their money in this bank, and thus to draw from us large ſums for intereſt. That foreigners will doubtleſs be more and more induced to become ſtock-holders, until the time may arrive, when this enormous engine of power may become ſubject to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign influence: this country may be agitated with the politics of European courts, and the good people of America reduced once more into a ſtate of ſubordination and dependence upon ſome one or other of the European powers. That, at beſt, if it were even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally deſtructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic. We have nothing in our free and equal government capable of balancing the influence which the bank muſt create; and we ſee nothing, which in the courſe of a few years, can prevent the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the bank from governing Pennſylvania. Already we have felt its influence indirectly interfering in the meaſures of the legiſlature. Already the houſe of aſſembly, the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, have been threatened that the credit of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per currency will be blaſted by the bank. And if this growing evil continues, we fear the time is not very diſtant when the bank will be able to dictate to the legiſlature what laws to paſs, and what to forbear.</q>
                     </note> THAT the bank, as eſtabliſhed, is incompatible with the public ſafety. That, in the preſent ſtate of trade, it had a direct tendency to baniſh ſpecie from the country, and thereby accumulate it in the hands of the ſtock-holders.

thoſe very citizens who are inſtrumental in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing wealth from the country, will neceſſarily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be truſted in the hands of a ſet of men, not attached to the party whoſe intereſts the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee wiſh to promote, without endangering the very exiſtence of that party.

That, the profits of the bank being in money, muſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſe, as money grows ſcarcer; and has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo far exceeded the profits of European banks, as to tempt foreigners to encreaſe this ſcarcity of money, by veſting large ſums in the bank, for which they only draw intereſt. That, foreigner after foreigner, may be thus tempted by our encreaſing ſcarcity of money, until all the ſpecie of Europe ſhall be accumulated in the bank; and then princes and ſtates will hold annual meetings for the election of a preſident and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to manage this enormous engine of power: and ſo our country will be again agitated by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean politics, and the good people of America, by poſſeſſing the wealth of foreign nations, will become dependant upon them. That even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing no interference of foreigners, yet our own citizens being ſtockholders might in time, by baniſhing all the ſpecie from the country, become ſo enormouſly rich and powerful as to ſeize on the government of the ſtate, ſubvert the conſtitution, and give legiſlative authority to the preſident and directors of the bank.</p>
                  <p>AFTER this black catalogue of offences and
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:024407_0638_0FC6F9B719C11BF0"/>
poſſible evils, who will ſay that the bank hath not juſtly merited political death? But beſides theſe pernicious effects, theſe fears and apprehenſions, other evil deſigns and abominable practices have been ſuggeſted againſt this inſtitution—ſuch as, that Mr. F—, once in every week, riſes at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and with a dark lanthorn in his hand, enters the vaults of the bank through the ſubterraneous paſſage leading from the cellars of his own houſe into thoſe vaults; that he there meets <hi>Belzebub and Blackbeard the pirate;</hi> and that theſe three, ſitting upon boxes of money, hold conſultations, and conſpire againſt the peace and ſafety of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. That one of the ſchemes of this infernal triumvirate is to bribe the <hi>Algerines</hi> with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the bank to ſeize upon all American veſſels, except thoſe in which R— M—, eſq. is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted: and another is to change our republican form of government to a monarchy.

                     <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                     <p>IN a government profeſſedly <hi>free,</hi> that is a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of laws, binding on the whole by the conſent of legal repreſentatives of the whole, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that not only the laws themſelves, but what is called the practice of the law, ſhould be better underſtood by the people at large.</p>
                     <p>IT is in vain for a perſon not verſed in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the profeſſion to look into books of reports for the hiſtory of a trial at law. He may as well look for religion in the works of <hi>Jacob Behmen,</hi> or the practice of phyſic in <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> He will find the ſubject matter concealed in technical jargon, and a cloud of artificial terms, to many of which profeſſors themſelves have not yet aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a determinate meaning.</p>
                     <p>WHEN a law firſt iſſues from the hands of the legiſlature it is generally ſufficiently intelligible. It
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:024407_0642_0FC6F9C34DA32A48"/>
is like metal from the ſmelting furnace. But when it has undergone the operations of a judicial forge, it aſſumes appearances very different from its firſt form. For law is the moſt malleable thing in nature, and what with the heat of conteſt and the hammers of legal forms, it ſoon becomes, in judicial conſtruction, no more like the original than a bar of iron is like the pig of metal from which it has been forged.</p>
                     <p>I think it would be of conſiderable uſe, that this proceſs ſhould be delineated at large; that the people may have an opportunity of knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own acts are executed according to their ſpirit and intent, and whether, what is called the common law, is fairly conſtrued and applied in their courts of juſtice, or not.</p>
                     <p>I know of no better way to effect this, than by recommending that all trials and law proceedings ſhould be publiſhed in detail, with as ſparing a uſe of mere profeſſional language as poſſible.

                     <p>
                        <hi>LAWRENCE LANDLORD</hi> was ſeized in fee of 300 acres of land: that is, it was his own eſtate. He leaſed 100 acres thereof, together with a farm-houſe, barn, orchard, &amp;c. to his neighbour <hi>Timothy Tenant,</hi> for a term of years, reſerving a certain rent, and covenanting for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpecific articles and privileges: amongſt theſe was the following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>AND it is hereby further agreed by and between the ſaid parties, that the ſaid <hi>Timothy Tenant</hi> ſhall at all times, during the term of this preſent leaſe, preſerve, keep, and ſet apart for the uſe, benefit, and behoof, of the ſaid <hi>Lawrence Landlord,</hi> the <hi>apple-ſkins or parings of all the apples uſed in the ſaid Timothy

Tenant's family; to the intent and purpoſe that the ſaid Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and raiſe up his pig or pigs</hi>: Provided always, that the ſaid <hi>Lawrence Landlord,</hi> by himſelf or his ſervants, and at his own expence, coſt and trouble, ſhall ſend for, fetch, carry, or cauſe to be carried, away the apple-ſkins or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings aforeſaid, for the purpoſes aforeſaid.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>AND ſo it was, that under a conſtruction of this clauſe, and by advice of council learned in the law, <hi>Lawrence Landlord</hi> had ſent for and taken away the APPLES growing in the orchard of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy Tenant.</hi> Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Timothy</hi>

                        <p>May it pleaſe your honours! and you, gentlemen of the jury!—In this cauſe I am coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for the plaintiff. It is an action of treſpaſs, and the cauſe of action is ſet forth in the declaration,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:024407_0648_0FC6F9DC71E03FE0"/>
which ſtates; that on the 10th day of October, in the year 1783, Lawrence Landlord, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, did with his ſervants and accomplices, enter the demeſne of the plaintiff, and with force and arms, and ſo forth, then and there did take and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away one buſhel of apples, the property of the plaintiff, and of the growth and produce of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain orchard, which then was, and ſtill is, in the rightful tenure, poſſeſſion, and occupancy, of the plaintiff; by virtue of a certain leaſe or contract, the term of which was not then, nor is yet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                        <p>IF the court pleaſes, I ſhall proceed to eſtabliſh the facts, by exhibiting a copy or counterpart of the leaſe, and producing witneſſes to prove the wrong and injury done.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>
                           <hi>Court.</hi> Z.</speaker>
                        <p>May it pleaſe your honours! we will ſave the gentleman the trouble, and the court their time and attention, by demurring to the tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony offered. We admit the facts, and ſhall reſt our defence upon the legal conſtruction of the clauſe in the leaſe, which reſerves to Lawrence Landlord all the <hi>apple-ſkins</hi> or <hi>parings,</hi> and ſo forth; and ſhall ſhew moſt clearly, that both by the intendment of the parties, and the very words of the contract, all apples growing on the premiſes were reſerved to the uſe of the leſſor.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                           <hi>Coun.</hi> X.</speaker>
                        <p>Here then, if the court pleaſes, we join iſſue. It is not pretended that we have in any inſtance violated the terms of our leaſe, or incurred any forfeiture. The clauſe in conteſt: is in theſe words:
<q>And it is hereby further agreed by and between the ſaid parties, that the ſaid Timothy Tenant ſhall at all times, during the term of this preſent leaſe, preſerve, keep, and ſet apart, for the uſe, benefit and behoof the ſaid Lawrence Landlord, the apple-ſkins, or parings, of all the apples uſed in his, the ſaid Timothy Tenant's family, to the intent and purpoſe, that the ſaid Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and raiſe up his pig or pigs. Provided always,</q>
and ſo forth.</p>
                        <p>NOW, it lies with the defendant to ſhew that there is no difference between the apple ſkins or parings, and the <hi>apples</hi> themſelves.</p>
                        <p>THE facts being admitted, no further opening of the cauſe is neceſſary. The court and jury will perceive the point on which it turns, viz. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and legal operation of the clauſe juſt read. I ſhall wait for the arguments and authorities that may be produced on the other ſide, only obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the preſent, that the injury we have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hath been very grievous; the peace of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:024407_0650_0FC6F9E27079C270"/>
has been diſturbed by ſtrangers entering with a uſurped authority, and ſnatching, as it were, the victuals from our mouth, and from the mouths of our children. And further, that if this right ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the leſſor, we ſhall have loſt not only the dumplins of that day, but all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dumplins, apple-pies and apple-puddings, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the term of our leaſe.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>
                           <hi>Coun.</hi> Z.</speaker>
                        <p>May it pleaſe your honours! and you, gentlemen of the jury! In this cauſe wherein Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy Tenant is plaintiff, and Lawrence Landlord defendant; I am council for the defendant. As there is no diſpute about the facts, much time will be ſpared, and the argument brought within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs.</p>
                        <p>WE are charged, gentlemen of the jury, with having, with force and arms, and ſo forth, taken certain apples from an orchard in the tenure of the plaintiff. Setting aſide the literal meaning of thoſe formidable words—<hi>with force and arms,</hi> which in this <hi>pul-lace,</hi> are mere forms of law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no meaning at all. I ſay, ſetting aſide theſe formidable words, we acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we took certain apples from an orchard in the tenure of Timothy Tenant the plaintiff; and we contend, and we hope we ſhall be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:024407_0651_0FC6F9E366320BB0"/>
to this honourable court, by arguments moſt <hi>cul-lear</hi> and <hi>pul-lain,</hi> drawn from the <hi>pe-ureſt</hi>
fountains of law, and ſupported by moſt reſpectable authorities, that we have committed no wrong whatever; no <hi>bur-reach</hi> of our contract; and that Timothy Tenant hath no rightful cauſe of <hi>compul-laint</hi>
againſt us. And why? Becauſe we ſay, when we aſſigned this eſtate to the leſſee, we <hi>expur-reſsly</hi>
reſerved the <hi>fur-ruit</hi> of this orchard to our own uſe, or rather to the uſe of our pig or pigs. And how will this appear? moſt <hi>cul-learly</hi> by attending to the clauſe in the leaſe, which is the object of our <hi>pur-reſent</hi> diſcuſſion.</p>
                        <p>THIS <hi>cul-lauſe,</hi> gentlemen of the jury, is in theſe words: "And it hereby further agreed by and between the ſaid parties," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>NOW, may it pleaſe the court, here is a full and <hi>com-pul-lete</hi> agreement, covenant or contract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the leſſor and leſſee.</p>
                        <p>AN <hi>agur-reement,</hi> gentlemen of the jury, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in law, <hi>agregatio mentium de re aliqua facta vel facienda:</hi> that is, a concurrence of will in the parties, reſpecting ſomething done or to be done; and a contract or covenant is an <hi>agur-reement</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated and ſolemnized in full form of law.
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:024407_0652_0FC6F9E52D1C2050"/>
Further, may it pleaſe the court, obligation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from contracts are divided and diſtinguiſhed, <hi>ex re,</hi> from a thing done; <hi>ex verbis,</hi> from words; <hi>ex literis,</hi> from writing; and <hi>ex conſenſu,</hi> from conſent.</p>
                        <p>NOW I ſhall <hi>pur-rove</hi> to the ſatisfaction of the court and jury, that the preſent contract is full and <hi>com-pul-lete</hi> in all theſe eſſential circumſtances; that is to ſay; <hi>ex re, ex verbis, ex literis,</hi> and <hi>ex-conſenſu.</hi> And, if ſo, we apprehend it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as <hi>cul-learly</hi> as a <hi>pur-roblem</hi> in Euclid, that the leſſor had a right to take the <hi>apples</hi> of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and give them to his pigs. May it pleaſe the court, the <hi>res, rem,</hi> or <hi>re,</hi> in this contract, is the right reſerved by the leſſor to enter the <hi>pur-remiſes</hi>
of the leſſee, and take away all the apple-ſkins or parings of apples, and ſo forth; the very words of the leaſe. Now, if the court pleaſes, how is this <hi>res, rem,</hi> or <hi>re,</hi> confirmed and eſtabliſhed? Why, <hi>ex verbis</hi> from the words of the clauſe, and <hi>ex literis</hi> from the letters which compoſe thoſe words; and the <hi>ex conſenſu</hi> is <hi>cul-lear</hi> beyond the poſſibility of a doubt, by the ſeals and ſignatures of the parties, ſolemnly executed in the <hi>pur-reſence</hi>
of ſeveral ſubſcribing witneſſes.</p>
                        <p>I now come, if the court pleaſes, to prove by
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:024407_0653_0FC6F9F0415B1390"/>
ſolid argument, ſupported by a <hi>cul-loud</hi> of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities moſt reſpectable in law, that by the word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-ſkins and parings, <hi>the apples</hi> themſelves will paſs by <hi>con-ſtur-ruction</hi> of law and right reaſon.</p>
                        <p>NOW, if your honours pleaſe, it is moſt <hi>pul-lain</hi>
and manifeſt, that the apple ſkin cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be transferred, given or taken away, without the apple itſelf paſſing therewith. And why? For this <hi>pul-lain,</hi> and <hi>cul-lear</hi> reaſon, becauſe, if the apple-ſkin or paring be ſevered or ſeparated from the apple, it is no longer an <hi>apple-ſkin,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, in its ſevered ſtate, only the <hi>ſkin of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
and ſo ſaith the law. Coke's Reports, Part II<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> page 225, <q>Severance of corn, is the cutting and carrying it off from the ground; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the ſetting out the tithe from the reſt of the corn, is called <hi>ſeverance:</hi>
                           </q>
moſt <hi>cul-learly</hi>
then, the cutting the ſkin from the apple, is a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;</hi>
and ſuch a ſeverance as the law notices and recognizes. Gentlemen of the jury! I hope I am underſtood; this is a very important point. I ſay, there is a material difference between an apple ſkin and the ſkin of an apple. And, why? Becauſe a reſervation of the apple-ſkin is, by <hi>conſtur-ruction</hi> of law, a reſervation of the apple itſelf. And, why? For this <hi>pul-lain</hi> and manifeſt reaſon; becauſe, when the outward bounds, lines,
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:024407_0654_0FC6F9F1A7840EF0"/>
or limits; or, as the law expreſſes it, the <hi>pars continens</hi> of any matter or thing is <hi>diſcur-riptively</hi>
conveyed, aſſigned, or reſerved, the internal parts of that matter or thing muſt alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, aſſigned, or reſerved, otherwiſe there would be an abſolute <hi>ſeverance,</hi> which the law abhors; for, it is an adjudged caſe, that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in common of a horſe cannot ſevere their property.</p>
                        <p>BUT, may it pleaſe your honours! I haſten to produce authorities directly in point: and firſt, if the court pleaſes, I will take up O'Farrell's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, page 106.</p>

under the penalty of twenty ſhillings for every offence, to be recovered by the overſeers of the poor, for the uſe of the poor of the county in which the offence ſhould be committed. <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi>
and others were overſeers of the poor for the county of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and brought their action under the ſtatute againſt the defendant. And it was in proof that the defendant had pared his thumb nails and his great toe nails on <hi>Friday,</hi>
                                       <pb n="262" facs="unknown:024407_0655_0FC6F9F3271ABA18"/>
to wit: on Friday, the— day of —, at twelve o'clock in the night of the ſame day.</p>
                                    <p>COUNCIL for the defendant demurred to the facts; obſerving, that as this was a penal law, it ought to be ſtrictly conſtrued. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, took three points of defence, viz. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it was urged, that <hi>night</hi> is not <hi>day,</hi> and the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute expreſsly ſays <hi>Fri-day</hi> and not <hi>Fri-night;</hi>
and the proof is, that the cutting was at night. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it was contended, that twelve o'clock on Friday night is in fact the beginning of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday morning, and therefore not within the ſtatute. And, <hi>thirdly,</hi> that the words of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute are UNGUES DIGITORUM—Anglici—<hi>the nails of the</hi> FINGERS, and the teſtimony only reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <hi>thumbs and great toes.</hi>

                                    <p>THE jury gave in a ſpecial verdict: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after long adviſement, the judges were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly of opinion, on the firſt point, that in conſtruction of law, day is night and night is day; becauſe a day conſiſts of 24 hours, and the law will not allow of fractions of a day <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>NOW, may it pleaſe the court, from this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it is <hi>moſt cul-lear,</hi> that apple-ſkins are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and that apples are apple-ſkins. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ſaying that the ſmalleſt particle of doubt cannot remain in the <hi>unpur-rejudiced</hi> mind. But to make the matter ſtill more <hi>cul-lear and pul-lain,</hi> as if it were poſſible to demonſtrate <hi>demonſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> here is an act of aſſembly—an act of our own government, which brings the matter home to the very door of the <hi>pur-reſent</hi> caſe. Acts of aſſembly, printed volume, page 314. This, if the court pleaſes, is an act for laying an exciſe on cyder, and the words are "all apples or apple-ſkins."—Now the article <hi>or</hi> is in this place neither conjunctive nor disjunctive, but <hi>pe-urly</hi>
explanatory: as if the law had ſaid, all apples— or, which is the ſame thing, all apple-ſkins.</p>
                        <p>HERE, Gentlemen of the jury, the legiſlature hath declared itſelf on the very point before the
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:024407_0657_0FC6F9FFDDEECBC8"/>
court. And it is <hi>cul-lear</hi> as the ſun at noon day when not a <hi>cul-loud</hi> is to be ſeen in the ſky, that apple-ſkins or parings and the apples themſelves are, in <hi>conſtur-ruction</hi> of law, one and the ſame thing. And it follows, as undeniably as a <hi>pur-obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>m</hi>
in Euclid, that when the preſent leſſor reſerved the apple-ſkins or parings, he, at one and the ſame time, reſerved the apples alſo for his uſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the contract <hi>expur-reſſes</hi> it, for the uſe of his pig or pigs.</p>
                        <p>FOR what would be the conſequence, may it pleaſe the court—what would be the conſequence of any other conſtruction? If the leſſee ſhould eat the apples himſelf, would this fatten the leſſor's pigs? Surely not—Would the dumplins and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-pyes of the <hi>pul-laintiff's</hi> children fatten the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's pigs? Surely not—Would the cyder made by Timothy Tenant raiſe up the pigs of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Landlord? Surely not—Does the clauſe in the leaſe ſay that the tenant ſhall have all the apples, and leave only the ſkins of apples for the landlord? It ſays no ſuch thing.</p>
                        <p>WITH the leave of the court, I will put a caſe—Suppoſe a miller hath a ſack of meal: I aſk him what he will take for that ſack, and we agree
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:024407_0658_0FC6FA0110AD97A0"/>
for twenty ſhillings. After the agreement, and after I have paid the ſtipulated price, the <hi>cur-rafty</hi>
miller may as well empty out the meal and give me the void ſack for my money, as that the <hi>pul-laintiff,</hi> in the <hi>pur-reſent</hi> cauſe, ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by this honourable court to eat the apples himſelf, and give only the ſkins of apples to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</p>
                        <p>GENTLMEN of the jury! this is a cauſe of <hi>gur-reat</hi>
magnitude, no leſs than determining by ſolemn adjudication the diſtinction between an apple-ſkin and the ſkin of an apple. But I have the fulleſt confidence that this enlightened court and jury, will ſee as <hi>cul-lear</hi> as the ſun when not a ſingle <hi>cul-loud</hi> intervenes, that the ſkin of an apple is or may be the ſkin of any apple; but an apple-ſkin is the ſkin of a known and determinate apple; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to and circumſcribing that apple; being in truth the <hi>pars continens</hi> thereof. As if one ſhould take an apple in his hand, and ſay—<hi>this,</hi> pointing to the part, (having cut the apple in half) is the apple ſeed—<hi>this,</hi> (ſtill pointing to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective parts,) is the apple-core—<hi>this,</hi> is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pulp—and <hi>this,</hi> (ſtill pointing,) is the apple ſkin—the <hi>pars continens</hi> of the whole; and ſo, altogether, viz, ſeed, core, pulp and ſkin, make
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:024407_0659_0FC6FA022D4B3ED0"/>
up a full and <hi>com-pul-lete</hi> apple—or, as the law would expreſs it, an apple-ſkin <hi>pars pro toto</hi>—for the law delighteth in brevity.</p>
                        <p>MAY it pleaſe the court, I come now, in as few words as poſſible, to anſwer an argument which may be brought on the other ſide, founded on theſe words in the clauſe under conſideration: <q>Of all the apples <hi>uſed</hi> in his the ſaid Timothy Tenant's family.</q>
And here, moſt <hi>pur-robably,</hi> the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of council for the <hi>pul-laintiff,</hi> will obſerve with his uſual ingenuity, that theſe words ſtrongly indicate a ſeverance to be intended. Otherwiſe, as he will ſay, how ſhall the apples be uſed in the family of the leſſee, if, under the term <hi>apple-ſkins,</hi> the whole, that is, both ſkins and apples are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the leſſor?</p>
                        <p>SUCH an argument might have weight with a leſs enlightened jury than that I have the honour now to addreſs. But let us <hi>bur-ring</hi> this ſeeming reaſon to the teſt of law, that unerring rule of right, that apex, ſummit, and perfection of human reaſon, and we ſhall ſoon ſee the miſt of error va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and the <hi>cul-lear</hi> ſun of truth <hi>bur-reak</hi> forth with unrivalled <hi>ur-radiance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE words are:
<q>of all the apples <hi>uſed</hi> in his
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:024407_0660_0FC6FA03B8691DC8"/>
(the <hi>pul-laintiff's</hi>) family.</q>
We will now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if the court pleaſes, the doctrine of USES, as laid down in the books. And here it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the <hi>habendum</hi> of every deed conſiſts of two limitations; the one of eſtate or property which the feoffee, or party poſſeſſive, ſhall receive by the deed; and the other the limitation of the <hi>uſe</hi> or <hi>uſes</hi>: that is, for whoſe uſe he ſhall hold the property: by which means the poſſeſſion is in one man, and the uſe or <hi>pur-rofit</hi> in another. And for this, I turn to <hi>Gilbert's</hi> law of uſes, page 175.
<q>An uſe, at common law, was an equitable right which he reſerved, who conveyed a legal eſtate to another; upon truſt and confidence, that the perſon to whom he ſo conveyed it, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſuffer him to take the rents and profits of the land.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>HERE then it is <hi>pul-lain</hi> to demonſtration, that the leſſor, the defendant in the <hi>pur-reſent</hi> cauſe, hath reſerved the <hi>pur-rofits</hi> or <hi>fur-ruits</hi> of the land although he has leaſed the ſoil itſelf to the <hi>pul-laintiff.</hi> And how has he done this? Not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the apples <hi>gur-rowing</hi> on the premiſes. This would have been equivocal and uncertain, as the vulgar tongue for the moſt part is. And why? Becauſe it is not certain and determinate what an
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:024407_0661_0FC6FA0CC84B5250"/>
apple is—There are <hi>fur-ruits,</hi> which in common parlance are called <hi>oak-apples;</hi> others <hi>balſam ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> others <hi>crab-apples,</hi> and ſo forth: and even potatoes are denominated <hi>les pommes de terre;</hi> that is, <hi>earth apples;</hi> or, as ſome tranſlate it, <hi>the apples of the earth.</hi> How, I ſay, has the leſſor made his reſervation? Not by reſerving the ſkins of apples; for then <hi>ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> the leſſor's pigs would have nothing but the offals, the excrementitious parts of the <hi>fur-ruit</hi> to fatten on. But he has, with <hi>tur-rue</hi> legal preciſion, reſerved the apple-ſkins which include the apples themſelves; as the metes and boundaries of a tract of land <hi>incul-lude</hi> and convey the land itſelf, with all its buildings, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pur-rovements</hi> and appurtenances. And why? Becauſe by a maxim of law, <hi>cujus eſt ſolum ejus eſt uſque ad coelum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT to return to the doctrine of uſes—<hi>Gilbert's</hi> law of uſes page 26:
<q>Though at common law <hi>ceſtuy que uſe</hi> had no power over the land, yet he might alien the uſe; becauſe every one might diſpoſe of the rights that are in him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>HERE then, if your honours pleaſe! we ſee, that the leſſor, the <hi>pur-reſent</hi> defendant, hath a power, not only to uſe the apples himſelf, but
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:024407_0662_0FC6FA10671975E0"/>
might, if he ſo thought fit, ſell or diſpoſe of them to another. <hi>A fortiori</hi> ſhall he give them to his own pigs. And why? Becauſe, ſaith this <hi>bur-right</hi> luminary of law, <hi>Baron Gilbert,</hi>
                           <q>Every man may diſpoſe of the right that is in him</q>

                        <p>BUT I ſhall not take up the time of this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able court, by heaping proof upon proof, or in attempts to elucidate the <hi>ur-radiance</hi> of the ſun.</p>
                        <p>I confidently ſubmit the defendant's cauſe to the court and jury: having, as I hope, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every ſcintilla of doubt in the <hi>unpur-rejudiced</hi> mind.</p>

authorities to be genuine. I did not chooſe to interrupt him at the time; but he may obviate the objection now if he can; the authority I allude to was cited from the printed volume of our acts of aſſembly, page 314. in theſe words, "all apple ſkins or apples." Now, I ſay that this is a falſe and erroneous publication of the law, and of no authority. I have here, if the court pleaſes, a certified copy of this law taken from the original record in the roll's office.

You knew it was my deſire that you ſhould find this bill, and that ought to have ſatisfied you—Conſcience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! The court is the keeper of a grand jury's conſcience; I am ſure I ſent you a ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to ſatisfy your conſcience; all we want of you is to give legal form to our proceedings—It
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:024407_0666_0FC6FA20DDAE05C0"/>
would be a fine court indeed, if a parcel of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant merchants ſhould have it in their power to controul our proceedings in the adminiſtration of juſtice—But you have other reaſons than conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for this conduct. How dare you receive other teſtimony than ſuch as had been qualified and furniſhed by the court? But this ſhews your extreme ignorance of law—of even the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of law.</p>

<pb n="274" facs="unknown:024407_0667_0FC6FA2282854F38"/>
have got a wrong notion of your own office and character, I mean as the law conſiders you; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your individual knowledge or merits may be, as a grand jury, the law defines you to be a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of unlearned men, got together to form a part of the <hi>legal machinery</hi> of the court. As to your oath of office; this is alſo nothing more than a law-form, and like other law forms, hath, or may have, a very different import from what the ſame words would have in common acceptation; the true intent and meaning of this oath has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to you by the chief juſtice, in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent charge, previous to your entering on the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your office. You were then told, that when this oath enjoins you diligently to enquire, and true preſentment make, it means nothing more, in the law language, than that you are to conſider, from the teſtimony furniſhed by the court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there may not be probable cauſe of ſuſpicion, that the accuſed party is guilty of the crime laid to his charge; and this ought to have ſatisfied you; for as I before obſerved, <hi>a grand jury is only a legal machine, manageable at the diſcretion of the court.</hi>

                        <p>We are now ready to give judgment on the ſpecial verdict in the cauſe, <hi>Timothy Tenant</hi>
againſt <hi>Lawrence Landlord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE legal conſtruction and operation of a clauſe of reſervation in a leaſe granted by the defendant to the plaintiff, is the ſole point on which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of this cauſe muſt depend. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve made, is,
<q>of the apple-ſkins or parings of all the apples uſed in his, the ſaid Timothy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's, family; to the intent and purpoſe, that the ſaid Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and raiſe up his pig or pigs.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE diſtinction between an apple-ſkin and the ſkin of an apple was well ſupported by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for the defendant. And the caſe cited from <hi>O'Farrel's</hi> reports cloſely applied. This caſe of <hi>Miſtake verſus Blunder</hi> gave riſe to many learned comments on the <hi>ſtatute of nails.</hi> Amongſt theſe a very ſcarce tract hath fallen into my hands, written by the greateſt lawyer of his day. He is large on all the points taken in that cauſe: and on the ſecond, he ſays, that twelve o'clock on Friday night may be conſidered as one o'clock on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning, or as eleven o'clock on Friday night,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:024407_0671_0FC6FA32DFCAE698"/>
at the diſcretion of the court: becauſe, in all caſes where a ſtatute fixes a preciſe and determinate time, one hour each way is ſuppoſed to be allowed to the judges, in their deciſions thereupon, <hi>to make up for the variations of clocks and watches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT to the point. This leaſe or contract, is a deed; and deeds are to be conſidered with reſpect to their <hi>form</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> as to the firſt, it is not contended but that this deed is regular in point of <hi>form.</hi> Let us then conſider the <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> The ſubſtance of any deed is the intention of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, at the time of executing it. For all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities which the law requires have no other end or tendency but that of ſubſtantiating and fixing, in the moſt laſting and unequivocal terms, the will and intention of the contractors. We will now bring the clauſe in queſtion to the teſt of this rule. The words are,
<q>All apple-ſkins and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</q>
and ſo forth; "To the intent," and ſo forth, "That the leſſor ſhould <hi>fatten and raiſe up his pigs.</hi>" Now it ſignifies nothing what we are to underſtand by apple-ſkins or parings; what is the eſſence? What is the ſubſtantial part? What <hi>ought to have been</hi> the will of the parties in this contract? Certainly the raiſing and fattening of pigs was, or ought to have been, the principal object. And, for this reaſon, becauſe the law looks, with a
<pb facs="unknown:024407_0672_0FC6FA3C31DB9490"/>
                           <pb n="279" facs="unknown:024407_0673_0FC6FA3E2E13BEF0"/>
friendly eye on the raiſing of hogs, and making of pork and bacon, for theſe are amongſt the ſtaple commodities of our country. And we find many acts of aſſembly for the encouragement of the breed of hogs. Such as the act making it penal for any one to alter the mark of a marked, or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,</hi> hog; and the act laying a duty on all roaſted pigs under the age of ſix months, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joing them to be <hi>killed ſparingly</hi>—and alſo one other remarkable act, lately paſſed, for making hogs, pigs, and ſwine free of the city, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unmoleſted egreſs and regreſs through our ſtreets, lanes, and alleys. Under this act, a hog may have his <hi>quare impedit</hi> againſt any ſtreet commiſſioner or citizen who ſhall obſtruct his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or moleſt him in the exerciſe of his right; yet it hath been holden, that a hog may not, by virtue of this act, enter the houſes, parlours, or chambers of the citizens.</p>
                        <p>THUS we ſee that the law hath a ſpecial reſpect to the raiſing and fattening of hogs. And what the law intends to be done, it alſo intends to be well done, or in the beſt and moſt effectual manner. Now, how ſhall the leſſor's pigs be beſt raiſed up and fattened? Not by being fed with huſks, ſkins or parings; but by eating of the fruit itſelf, which contains moſt of the ſaccharine or nutritious juices of the tree.</p>

This was matter of ſurpriſe and ſpeculation, as it was well known that the roof was not more than twelve years old, and therefore its defects could not be aſcribed to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural decay by time.</p>
                     <p>ALTHOUGH there were many different opinions reſpecting the cauſes of this deficiency, yet all agreed that the family could not ſleep in comfort or ſafety under it.</p>

                     <p>THESE ſkilful architects accordingly met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after a thorough examination of the faulty roof, they found,</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> That the whole fabric was too weak.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> That there were indeed <hi>thirteen</hi> rafters; but that theſe rafters were not connected by any braces or ties, ſo as to form a union of ſtrength.</p>

                     <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> THAT the ſhingling and lathing had not been ſecured with iron nails, but only wooden pegs<note place="bottom">Paper Currency.</note>, which ſwelling and ſhrinking by ſucceſſions of wet

and dry weather, had left the ſhingles ſo looſe, that many of them had been blown away by the wind; and that before long, the whole would, probably, in like manner be blown away.</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> THAT the cornice was ſo ill proportioned, and ſo badly put up, as to be neither an ornament nor of uſe: and,</p>
                     <p n="6">6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> That the roof was ſo flat as to admit the moſt idle ſervants in the family, their playmates and acquaintance, to trample upon and abuſe it<note n="*" place="bottom">Want of dignity in government.</note>.</p>
                     <p>HAVING made theſe obſervations, theſe judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous architects were of opinion, that it would be altogether vain and fruitleſs to attempt any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or repairs in a roof ſo defective in all points, and therefore propoſed to have it entirely remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that a new roof, of a better conſtruction, ſhould be erected over the manſion-houſe: and they alſo prepared a drawing or plan of a new roof, ſuch as they thought moſt excellent for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, duration, and ornament. In forming this plan, they conſulted the moſt celebrated authors in ancient and modern architecture, and brought into their deſign the moſt approved parts, ſelected from the models before them; and finally endeavoured
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:024407_0679_0FC6FA540E4CB4A0"/>
to proportion the whole to the ſize of the building, and the ſtrength of the walls.</p>
                     <p>THIS propoſal of a new roof, it may well be imagined, became the principal ſubject of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the family: and the opinions of it were various, according to the judgment, intereſts, or ignorance of the diſputants.</p>
                     <p>ON a certain day the ſervants of the family had aſſembled in the great hall to diſcuſs the important queſtion.

A great number of tenants had alſo gathered out of doors, and crowded the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and avenues to the hall, which were left open for them, that they might hear the arguments for and againſt the new roof.</p>
                     <p>NOW, there was an old woman, known by the name of <hi>Margery the midwife,</hi> who had got a comfortable apartment in the manſion-houſe. This woman was of an intriguing ſpirit, of a reſtleſs and inveterate temper, fond of tattle, and a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief-maker.

                        <hi>MARGERY</hi> was, for many reaſons, an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable enemy to the new roof, and the artichects who had contrived it. Amongſt theſe, two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were very obvious. Firſt: the mantle-piece, on which her cups and platters were placed, was made of a portion of the great cornice; and ſhe boiled her pot with the ſhingles that blew off from the defective roof: and, ſecondly, it ſo happened that, in the conſtruction of the new roof, her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be conſiderably leſſened.</p>
                     <p>NO ſooner, therefore, did ſhe hear of the plan propoſed by the architects, but ſhe put on her old red cloak, and was day and night trudging amongſt the ſervants and tenants, crying out againſt the new roof, and the framers thereof. Amongſt theſe ſhe had ſelected <hi>William, Jack,</hi> and <hi>Robert,</hi> three of the ſervants, and inſtigated them to oppoſe the plan recommended. She cauſed them to be ſent to the great hall on the day of debate, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:024407_0681_0FC6FA579BFBC1E0"/>
them with innumerable alarms and fears, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning arguments, and ſpecious objections.</p>
                     <p>NOW, the principal argument and objections with which <hi>Margery</hi> had inſtructed William, Jack, and Robert, were theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> THAT the architects had not exhibited a bill of ſcantling <note n="*" place="bottom">Bill of rights.</note> for the new roof, as they ought to have done; and, therefore, the carpenters, under the pretence of providing timber for it, might lay waſte whole foreſts, to the ruin of the farm.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> THAT no proviſion was made in the plan for a trap door <note n="†" place="bottom">Liberty of the preſs.</note> for the ſervants to paſs through with water, if the chimney ſhould take fire, and that in caſe of ſuch an accident it might hereafter be deemed penal to break a hole in the roof, for acceſs, to ſave the whole building from deſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> THAT this roof was to be guarded by battlements<note n="‡" place="bottom">Standing army.</note>, which in ſtormy ſeaſons, would prove dangerous to the family, as the bricks might be blown down and fall on their heads.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> IT was obſerved, that the old roof was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:024407_0682_0FC6FA63126A8210"/>
with twelve pedeſtals, <note n="*" place="bottom">Trial by jury.</note> ranged along the ridge, which had been objects of univerſal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Whereas, according to the new plan, theſe pedeſtals were only to be placed along the eaves of the roof over the walls. As to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pola, ſome of the objectors ſaid it was too heavy, and would prove a dangerous burden to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whilſt others inſiſted that it was too light, and would certainly be blown away by the wind</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> IT was urged, that the thirteen rafters would be ſo ſtrongly braced together, that the individual and ſeparate ſtrength of each rafter would be loſt in the compounded and united ſtrength of the whole <note n="†" place="bottom">That the ſovereignties of the ſeveral ſtates would be abſorbed in the general government.</note> and ſo this roof might be conſidered as one ſolid maſs of timber, and not as compoſed of diſtinct rafters like the old roof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> THAT, according to the propoſed plan, the ſeveral parts of the roof were ſo framed as to mutually ſtrengthen and ſupport each other; and therefore, there was great reaſon to fear, that the whole might ſtand independent of the walls;
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:024407_0683_0FC6FA64698C7980"/>
and, that in time the walls might moulder away, and the roof remain ſuſpended in the air, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction to all who ſhould come under it <note n="*" place="bottom">That it would be a conſolidated government, and might exiſt independent of the people or of the ſtates.</note>.</p>
                     <p>TO theſe objections, JAMES, the architect, in ſubſtance replied.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> AS to the want of a bill of ſcantling, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if the timber for this roof was to be purchaſed from a ſtranger, it would have been quite proper to have ſuch a bill, leſt the ſtranger ſhould charge in account more than he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to; but as the timber was to be cut from our own lands, a bill of ſcantling was both uſeleſs and improper. It was of no uſe, becauſe the wood always was, and always would be, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the family, whether growing in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or fabricated into a roof for the manſion-houſe; and improper, becauſe the carpenters would be bound by the bill of ſcantling; which, if it ſhould not be perfectly accurate, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not to be expected, either the roof would be defective for want of ſufficient materials, or the carpenters muſt cut from the foreſt, without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which is penal by the laws of the houſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="306" facs="unknown:024407_0684_0FC6FA660F626E48"/>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> TO the ſecond objection, he ſaid, that a trap-door was not properly a part in the frame of a roof; but there could be no doubt but that the carpenters would take care to make ſuch a door in the ſhingling for the family to carry water through, <hi>dirty</hi> or <hi>clean,</hi> to extinguiſh fire, either in the chimney or on the roof; and that this was the only proper way of making ſuch a door.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> AS to the battlements, he inſiſted, that they were abſolutely neceſſary for the protection of the whole houſe. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Becauſe, in caſe of a ſudden attack by robbers, the family could defend themſelves behind theſe battlements, and annoy and diſperſe the enemy. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> If any of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining buildings ſhould take fire, the battlements would ſcreen the roof from the deſtructive flames. And, 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, they would retain the rafters in their reſpective places, in caſe any of them ſhould, from rottenneſs or warping, be in danger of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the general union, and injuring the other parts of the roof: obſerving alſo, that the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould always be ready for theſe purpoſes, as there would be neither time nor opportunity for raiſing battlements after an aſſault was actually made, or a conflagration begun. As to the bricks being blown down, and falling on the heads of the people, he ſaid the whole would always be in
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:024407_0685_0FC6FA6E54069E10"/>
the power of the family, who could at any time repair or remove any looſe and dangerous parts; and there could be no doubt but that their vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance would be fully ſufficient to prevent accidents of this kind.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> WITH reſpect to the twelve pedeſtals, he acknowledged their uſe and beauty; but obſerved that theſe, like all other things, were only ſo in their proper places, and under circumſtances ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their nature and deſign: and he inſiſted that the ridge of a roof was not the place for pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals, which ſhould reſt on the ſolid wall, being made of the ſame materials; and ought, in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, to be conſidered as ſo many projections, or continuations of the wall itſelf, and not as compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts of the wooden roof. As to the cupola, he ſaid, that all agreed that there ſhould be one of ſome kind or other; as well for a proper finiſh to the building, as for the purpoſe of indicating the winds, and containing a bell to ſound the alarm in caſes of neceſſity. The objections to the propoſed cupola, he ſaid, were too contradictory to merit a reply.</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> TO the fifth objection, he anſwered: that the intention really was to make a firm and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial roof, by uniting the ſtrength of the thirteen rafters: but that this was ſo far from annihilating
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:024407_0686_0FC6FA70795F9B58"/>
the ſeveral rafters, and rendering them of no uſe individually, that it was manifeſt, from a bare inſpection of the plan, that the ſtrength of each contributed to the ſtrength of the whole, and that the exiſtence of each and all was eſſential to the exiſtence of the fabric as a roof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> AND laſtly, he ſaid, that the roof was, in truth, ſo framed as that the parts ſhould mutually ſupport and check each other. But it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely abſurd, and contrary to the known laws of nature, to infer from thence, that the whole frame could ſtand ſelf-ſupported in the air. For, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever its component parts might be combined with reſpect to each other, the whole muſt neceſſarily reſt upon and be ſupported by the walls. That the walls might, indeed, ſtand for a few years in a ruinous and uninhabitable condition, without any roof; but the roof could not, for a moment, ſtand without the ſupport of the walls: and finally, that of all dangers and apprehenſions, this of the roof's remaining after the walls are gone, was the moſt abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>IT was mentioned before, that whilſt this debate was going on in the great hall, the windows and doors were crowded with attendants. Amongſt theſe, was a half crazy fellow, who was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:024407_0687_0FC6FA747A8F7098"/>
to go at large as a harmleſs lunatic.<note n="*" place="bottom">A furious writer under the ſignature of <hi>Philadelphienſis.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi> however, thought he might be a ſerviceable engine in promoting oppoſition to the new roof. As people of deranged underſtandings are eaſily irritated, ſhe exaſperated this poor fellow againſt the architects, and filled him with terrible appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions from the new roof; making him believe that the architects had provided a dark hole in the garret, where he was to be chained for life. Having by theſe ſuggeſtions filled his mind with rage and terror, ſhe turned him looſe amongſt the crowd, where he roared and bawled to the great annoyance of the bye-ſtanders.</p>
                     <p>THIS circumſtance would not have been noticed, but for the opportunity of exhibiting the ſtyle and manner in which a half deranged and highly irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind will expreſs itſelf. One of his rhapſodies ſhall conclude this narrative.</p>

                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This fuſtian is a burleſque of a paper publiſhed under the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of PHILADELPHIENSIS; the original is ſubjoined, taken from the Independent Gazetteer of Dec. 19, 1787.

Where is that puſillanimous wretch that can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to this contumely? Is not this the language of Britain in the years 1775 and 1776 renewed?

As a villain, who ſecreted to rob and murder in the ſilent hour of night, iſſues forth from his lurking place before the people have retired to ſleep, and thus fruſtrates his infernal deſign by impatience; ſo, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the luſt of dominion has urged theſe deſpots on to the adoption of meaſures that will inevitably, and I hope immediately, unhinge every part of their conſpiracy againſt the rights of their fellow-men, and bring on themſelves infamy and diſgrace.</p>

man. Oh God! what a monſter is man! that a dog ſhould be nouriſhed and pampered up by him with dainties, whilſt a being poſſeſſed of knowledge, reaſon, judgment, and an immortal ſoul, bought with no leſs a price than the blood of our divine Redeemer, ſhould be driven from his door, without admitting him, even for a moment, to aſſuage his hunger with the crumbs that might fall from his table.</p>
                     <p>BUT the members of the federal convention were men who have been all tried in the field of action, ſay ſome; they have fought for American liberty: then the more to their ſhame be it ſaid. Curſe on the villain, who protects virgin innocence only with a view that he may himſelf become the raviſher; ſo that, if the aſſertion was true, it only turns to their diſgrace; but, as it happens, it is not true, or at leaſt only ſo in part. This was a ſcheme taken by the deſpots and their ſycophants to bias the public mind in favour of the conſtitution; for the convention was compoſed of a variety of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: ambitious men, jeſuits, tories, lawyers, &amp;c. formed the majority, whoſe ſimilitude to each other conſiſted only in their determination to lord it over their fellow-citizens; like the rays that, converging from every direction, meet in a point,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:024407_0697_0FC6F78CEB09F5A8"/>
and their ſentiments and deliberations concentered in tyranny alone; they were unanimous in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a government that ſhould raiſe the fortunes and reſpectability of the <hi>well born</hi> few, and oppreſs the plebeians.</p>

                     <dateline>PHILADELPHIA,
<date>Jan. 19, 1788.</date>
                     </dateline>
                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received your letter by Mr ***** and am very ſorry to find that your exertions in the county of ***** have been attended with ſo little ſucceſs. I expected long before this to have heard of a commotion begun. It is indeed high time that ſomething vigorous ſhould be attempted, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſpirit of our cauſe will languiſh, and when once that ſpirit hath evaporated it will not be in our power to recal it.</p>
                  <p>YOU know it was always our opinion, that the great gun ſhould be charged here in the city, and
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:024407_0702_0FC6F7A5CC6631C0"/>
fired off in one of the weſtern counties. I am ſure I have not been remiſs in my part of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Have I not already charged it with eleven cartridges well rammed down; and when I am every moment expecting the exploſion, you only urge me to double my diligence and ram away. In ſhort, I am almoſt weary of this fruitleſs toil. I don't find that my publications have had the deſired effect here; I would fain hope that they have been more operative in the counties; if ſo, you ſhould have informed me, for I want encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than a ſpur.</p>
                  <p>WHILST I am iſſuing number after number of my Centinel, all written with a freedom and ſpirit ſufficient, one would think, to rouſe the people; I ſay, whilſt I am doing this, the ſtates, one after another, either unanimouſly, or by very large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorities, are ratifying the new conſtitution. You have heard, or will hear, that Connecticut has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted it by a majority of 127 to 40 in their ſtate convention. Beſides this, I have the mortification to ſee my Centinels printed, and re-printed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver replied to. Attempts to anſwer would afford freſh ſources of argument; can any thing be more provoking or diſcouraging? I have rung the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the liberty of the preſs; the trial by
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:024407_0703_0FC6F7A90BF2F9A8"/>
jury; deſpotiſm and tyranny: and am reduced to the neceſſity of repeating in different words the ſame railings againſt the new conſtitution, and the ſame abuſe againſt the framers of it.</p>
                  <p>THE novelty of this boldneſs is over, and my pieces are now ſcarcely read. I am aſtoniſhed that ſuch extraordinary exertions have had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle effect with the people. I have directly, and without reſerve, called the members of the late ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral convention, with general W—n at their head, villians, traitors, fools and conſpirators, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively and individually, and yet the mob does not riſe. I have often told you, that it is of no great importance on which ſide an inſurrection takes place—all that is neceſſary, is to have a commotion begun. A faction can always turn public confuſion to its own account. I was in great hopes that the attack upon Major Boyd's houſe would have produced ſomething; it was indeed ſerviceable to our party, but the flame was too weak to ſpread; the law interfered and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed it entirely. A mob is not worth a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs, by its great numbers, or the weight and influence of its leaders, it can ſtoutly look law in the face, and bid defiance to its operation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="unknown:024407_0704_0FC6F7B198CAD510"/>YOU tell me that you have enliſted about 60 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents—but what can they do? 600 in each of the counties would have been more to the purpoſe. Either you muſt have been very negligent, or your influence in the county is not as great as you gave us reaſon to believe.</p>
                  <p>YOU ſay you have conſtantly attended at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, vendues, funerals and other public meetings —liberally treated thoſe whom your thought it might be of uſe to gain—diſtributed my Centinels, and watched the moſt favourable opportunities for inflaming the minds of the people. This is all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; but if the conſequence has been no more than the aſſociation of 60 inſurgents, it is certainly very poor doings. If our friends have done no better in the other counties, and I have not yet heard that they have done any thing, our party had better tack about, and cry up the new conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that ſome of us may ſtand a chance at leaſt for a ſhare in the loaves and fiſhes. For if, notwithſtanding our oppoſition, this new conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſhould be eſtabliſhed, we ſhall always be looked upon as diſaffected to the government, and unfit to be truſted with offices under it.</p>
                  <p>OUR champions in the other ſtates begin to fall off. You have ſeen, I ſuppoſe, governor R—'s
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:024407_0705_0FC6F7BA1B9E1180"/>
letter; and I am told, that R— H— L— and Mr. M— have dropped all oppoſition. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome extraordinary exertions are made, and ſpeedily too, our whole ſcheme muſt fall to the ground. Only imagine what a ridiculous figure I make here. I am every week publiſhing things, which, in any other country would bring the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the gallows, as a ſeditious diſturber of the public peace—and yet nothing comes of it. My performances, as I ſaid before, do not even provoke a reply. Can any thing be more mortifying? In the mean time, the new conſtitution is taking root in the other ſtates. And it muſt be confeſſed, that in every inſtance where the people have been legally brought together, either in conventions, or as aſſemblymen, grand juries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or otherwiſe, they have uniformly declared themſelves in favour of it. Theſe are great obſtacles to our views. We have affected the popular ſide of the queſtion, and the voice of the people is decidedly againſt us. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, not ſupported by the body, the citizens is always denominated <hi>faction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO conclude, unleſs we can do ſomething ſpeedily, towards raiſing a reſpectable commotion in the ſtate, it is my opinion that we ought to prepare for join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general current in favour of this new ſyſtem of government: and this may be plauſibly effected by
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:024407_0706_0FC6F7BE2927A8E8"/>
declaring that we never had any thing in view but the good of our country: that the new conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeared, in our judgments, to contain many things objectionable, and ſome things even danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to the liberties of the people. But as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion ſeems to be otherwiſe, we reſign our prejudices to the will of the majority, as every good citizen ought to do: and ſince we find that the propoſed ſyſtem of a federal government is indeed likely to be eſtabliſhed, we ſhall not be behind any in zealous exertions for its ſupport.</p>
                  <p>THINK of theſe things, and let me hear from you as ſoon as poſſible. In the mean time,</p>

                  <head>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE <hi>DISEASES</hi> OF THE <hi>MIND</hi>; WITH A SCHEME FOR PURGING THE MORAL FACULTIES OF THE <hi>GOOD PEOPLE</hi> OF <hi>PENNSYLVANIA.</hi> QUITE NEW AND VERY PHILOSOPHICAL.</head>
                  <p>THAT there is an intimate connection between the ſoul and the body, and that the one is apt to be affected by the diſorders and irregularities of the other, is a truth too manifeſt to be controverted. How this connection is formed, to what extent it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and what are the viſible organs of the body which compoſe the intermediate links of union, with
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:024407_0715_0FC6F7DA4B8CF478"/>
the inviſible faculties of the mind, are problems which have been often in vain attempted. I neither pretend to have found out the ſecret, nor have I, at preſent, any plauſible hypotheſis to propoſe on this delicate ſubject.</p>
                  <p>THIS mutual influence, however, which plainly exiſts between ſpirit and matter in all animals, and more eſpecially in man, hath produced many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing devices for remedying the diſorders of the mind, which ſeem to be beyond our reach, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the organs of the body, which are within our power. A late ingenious author <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Ruſh.</note> has gone great lengths in this hypotheſis, in his "<hi>Diſſertation on the effect of phyſical cauſes on the moral faculty.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>FOR my own part, I believe there is ſome truth in the doctrine; and that, in particular caſes, if applied with great judgment, a partial and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary effect may be obtained. But if the ſeat of the diſeaſe ſhould really be in the mind, it will be in vain to expect a <hi>radical</hi> cure, by medical attacks on the body, which can do no more than for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deprive the mind of the inſtruments by which ſhe exhibits her diſtempered faculties.</p>
                  <p>FOR inſtance: ſuppoſe a perſon to be of an iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:024407_0716_0FC6F7E179214650"/>
captious diſpoſition, ſubject to violent and ungovernable guſts of paſſion. To reduce his body by phlebotomy, emetics, cathartics, a ſlender regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. would probably produce a dejection of ſpirits, and an apparent calmneſs of temper. But muſt this man be kept all his life time in a ſtate of debility? For there is no doubt but that as ſoon as health and vigour are allowed to return, the angry diſpoſitions will return too, and perhaps with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed inveteracy, on account of the reſtriction. So, alſo, if I ſhould be infected with a troubleſome itch for ſcribbling—which heaven forbid! and my friends, with a view to a cure, ſhould deprive me of pen, ink, and paper. For the preſent, to be ſure, I could not ſcribble: but would the itch be removed?—Far from it—the ſcribbling matter being refuſed a diſcharge, would accumulate, and become more virulent: and ſo ſoon as the neceſſary inſtruments or organs of exhibition could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, I ſhould ſcribble worſe than ever.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſcheme of whipping the mind over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's ſhoulders will not, I apprehend, anſwer any permanent purpoſe: and I know of no well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated caſes in ſupport of the doctrine. Hath government ever cured a propenſity to theft by the adminiſtration of the whipping-poſt or the wheel-barrow? Amongſt the innumerable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:024407_0717_0FC6F7E26ED0F088"/>
that have been made, I never heard of one ſucceſsful inſtance—No; it ſeems more natural, that mental remedies ſhould be preſcribed for mental diſorders; and corporeal phyſic for bodily diſeaſes. Let there be phyſicians and metaphyſicians as two diſtinct profeſſions. I do not mean by <hi>metaphyſicians,</hi> ſuch as are now profeſſors in univerſities and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; but <hi>practiſing metaphyſicians,</hi> who ſhall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the diſorders and irregularities of the human mind, and preſcribe for their cure.</p>
                  <p>I have conſidered this matter very attentively, and am confident that many of the cares and evils of life might be removed or alleviated by a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous metaphyſical treatment. The firſt difficulty would be to gain the confidence of the patient in a new ſcience; for this confidence would be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the metaphyſical as it is to the phyſical cure of diſeaſes—and even more ſo—for the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would have a great ſhare in the buſineſs, and muſt indeed ſerve as apothecary to the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſician. Wherein does the virtue of pills, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and plaiſters principally conſiſt? Surely not ſo much in the ingredients of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as in the implicit faith of thoſe to whom they are adminiſtered: a proof of which is, that no ſooner is the compoſition generally known but it ſinks into general contempt; nobody will take a
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:024407_0718_0FC6F7E55A02A160"/>
detected noſtrum. If, then, this confidence, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith of the patient, is ſo uſeful in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>material</hi> medicine, much more ſhould it be cultivated and depended upon in a <hi>metaphyſical</hi>
caſe. Poſſeſſed of this, I would undertake, with flattering hopes of ſucceſs, to heal the maladies of the mind by the uſe of diſcreet and obviouſly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means.</p>
                  <p>FOR inſtance: ſhould I find my patient diſpoſed to melancholy, and his mind clouded with imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary doubts, difficulties, and fears, by poring over polemical divinity, and wading deep in inſcrutable myſteries; I would preſcribe a round of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, much company, and frequent changes of companions. I would by every artifice provoke him to frequent laughter, and plunge him deep in the vanities of this wicked world: but they ſhould be vanities only; for I would on no account violate the bounds of ſtrict morality.</p>
                  <p>TO a patient of a contrary caſt: vain, fickle, loquacious, and full of levity, I would forbid the moſt innocent recreations. I would preſcribe a chapter in the hiſtory of the martyrs every morning before breakfaſt: he ſhould ſtudy algebra till din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time; in the evening he ſhould hear a long dull ſermon delivered with an unbroken monotony;
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:024407_0719_0FC6F7E619429168"/>
and ſhould himſelf read one of our acts of aſſembly before going to bed: and I would continue my regimen and remedies until I ſaw an entire change of diſpoſition take place, and a radical cure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>BUT I am preparing a full account of the diſeaſes of the mind, with the proper mode of treatment in each, illuſtrated by a variety of caſes. This work hath coſt me much ſtudy and deep ſearches into human nature, and the ſubtile ſprings and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moral faculty. Although my book is almoſt ready for publication, yet the evils of the preſent time call ſo loudly for redreſs, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not delay giving an extract from my chapter on the <hi>epidemic</hi> diſeaſes of the mind, in hopes it may be of immediate uſe.</p>

                        <hi>CACOETHES maledictionis,</hi> or an inſatiable rage for ſlander and abuſe. This diſeaſe is peculiar to free governments. The proximate cauſes are envy, diſcontent, and an over-weening ambition. The diagnoſtic ſymptoms are an inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of men of wealth or abilities, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of thoſe in public offices, and an unuſual predominance of party ſpirit: and the criſis of the diſtemper is an acrimonious eruption, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging a deal of prurient matter in private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, or in the public papers. The curative
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:024407_0720_0FC6F7F93A754D30"/>
indication is manifeſt, for this, like many other mental diſeaſes, is beſt managed by allowing a free emiſſion of the peccant humours, and permitting the moral faculty to purge itſelf by natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of the malevolent ichor.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS quotation ſuggeſts an obſervation or two which will lead directly to my preſent purpoſe. It is recommended, that the moral faculty ſhould be permitted to <hi>purge itſelf</hi> by natural diſcharges. Now, there are but two poſſible ways by which the mind can diſcharge her contents in the <hi>cacoethes maledictionis;</hi> viz. by <hi>actions,</hi> and by <hi>words;</hi> either by ſpeaking, ſcolding, ſtorming, ſwearing, writing, or publiſhing. When theſe means are forbid, or not conveniently obtained, the diſeaſe breaks out into <hi>actions;</hi> viz. beating, bruiſing, mawling, cuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, kicking, and even murdering, killing, and ſo forth: and, therefore, a free ſcope ſhould be given to <hi>words,</hi> as the moſt ſalutary and ſafe iſſue of the malignant matter.</p>
                  <p>THE art of printing has been a great bleſſing to mankind, inaſmuch as it affords a moſt convenient opportunity for the people to diſcharge their minds of indigeſted crudities and rankling ſpleen. Before this invention, murders, aſſaſſinations, rebellions, and revolutions, were much more frequent than
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:024407_0721_0FC6F7FCB1FFB2A8"/>
ſince. The poiſoned cup, and the bloody dagger, are not known in countries where the preſs, and and the free uſe of it, are allowed. As this is a new and a very deep remark, I hope it will be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. I know that the leſs ſanguinary character of modern times is generally attributed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of civilization. But how has this civilization been advanced? Certainly by the vent which the preſs affords for the morbid minds of the people to get rid of their impurities, and by keeping up a free circulation of ideas, ſo neceſſary to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal health of man. As a proof, we ſee that, in countries where a free acceſs to the preſs is not permitted, the <hi>ſtilletto</hi> is, even at this day, in uſe.</p>
                  <p>I come now to make the propoſal which I had in view when I ſat down to write this paper; a propoſal which, I flatter myſelf, will correct and mollify, if not totally remove, the virulence of party ſpirit and perſonal animoſity in this ſtate, and eſpecially in the city; and ſweeten and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the political atmoſphere of our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The preface to this my project is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, rather long; but it was neceſſary to ſhew the metaphyſical grounds on which it is founded.</p>
                  <p>LET there be two public papers inſtituted. The one a weekly and the other a daily paper.
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:024407_0722_0FC6F7FE31F82128"/>
Let the printers be commiſſioned by government, and allowed competent ſalaries for their time and trouble. They ſhould be <hi>commiſſioned,</hi> becauſe all other printers ſhould be prohibited from interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their department. One of theſe papers may be entitled <hi>The Freeman's Convenience,</hi> and the other <hi>The Chronicle of Scandal.</hi> Let theſe offices be always open as places where the good people of Pennſylvania may eaſe their minds without reſtraint, rebuke, or any hindrance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And whereas ſome men are naturally baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and do not like to be ſeen doing their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, there ſhall not only be a number of fictitious ſignatures provided for their concealment, but the printer ſhall, for the purpoſe of decency, have a tin plate fixed in his window, fronting on a little alley, if his ſituation will permit, otherwiſe on the ſtreet; in which, there ſhall be a ſlit, or opening large enough to receive, ſecretly, any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious matter; and it ſhall, for diſtinction's ſake, be thus inſcribed—"<hi>Wha' wants me?</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the printers, their papers, and their authors ſhould all be <hi>outlawed.</hi> That is, they ſhould be conſidered as beyond the reach of any cenſure or penalty of common or ſtatute law, or reſtrictions by any ordinance, proclamation, or regulation whatever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="unknown:024407_0723_0FC6F807213F0C20"/>BY this inſtitution all our other public papers would be kept free from impurities, and occupied, as they ought to be, with intereſting or amuſing articles of intelligence, grave or humourous eſſays, advertiſements, &amp;c. and all the filth of the city would be carried off by the two commiſſioned papers. So that after a little time, it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſhocking to good manners for a man to vent his ſpleen in one of the public <hi>news</hi>-papers, properly ſo called, as it would be to commit an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent evacuation in a private parlour, or a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic aſſembly. And thus alſo would the minds of the people be kept ſweet and healthy. For we may refine as we will, but the mind certainly has her indecencies as well as the body, and, when overloaded with indigeſted matter, muſt find a vent ſomewhere. For nature will be obeyed, and ſurely good policy requires that a ſuitable place ſhould be provided for the purpoſe, rather than that the public ſenſe ſhould be continually offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the evacuations of every diſtempered mind, which, though neceſſary, are neither decked with roſes nor perfumed with amber.</p>
                  <p>YET I would not exclude from the common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the city attempts at wit and ſatire, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle effuſions in verſe, in the poet's corner. A ſarcaſm is nothing more than ſpitting; and ſo it is uſual

to ſay—"He has ſpit his ſpite"—A crude attempt at humour is parallel with blowing one's noſe, for ſuch humours are apt to collect in cold conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and a young poetaſter may be put into a conſiderable perſpiration by the ſcorching flames of love—Theſe may all happen in the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany without offence, provide they are conducted with decency; and they are certainly neceſſary to health.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude with an account of two caſes, in proof of my general ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>I knew a young man, about 32 years of age, who, from loſſes in trade and croſſes in love, began to grow melancholy, retired and diſcontented. He came to me for advice. I aſked him if he had ever tried to write verſes. He told me that he had upon two or three occaſions, and found that he could tack rhymes together pretty well; but had no thoughts of cultivating the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. But I adviſed by all means to try what he could do in that way. He followed my preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and employed himſelf for a year or two in writing ſonnets to Mira, Odes to Liberty, and Elegies to birds, and dead lap-dogs, with a variety of other ſubjects, according to the courſe of the humours that infected his mind. He is now of a calm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:024407_0725_0FC6F80A5E502D78"/>
habit, but far from melancholy; on the contrary, he is delighted with his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and enjoys the comfort of <hi>ſelf-applauſe,</hi> which, after all, is the moſt ſubſtantial comfort of life.</p>
                  <p>MY ſecond inſtance is that of a German Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who has had, or thinks he has had, a viſion, in which the myſteries and oeconomy of the ſpiritual world was manifeſted to him. He has told me the ſtory of this viſion, and a very long ſtory it is—but I heard it all with patient attention. Some time after, he wanted to tell me the ſame ſtory over again, but I begged to be excuſed. Upon which he candidly aſſured me, that he found it abſolutely neceſſary to relate the hiſtory of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at leaſt once a week, otherwiſe he grew reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uneaſy in his mind. He came indeed full up to my preſent ſyſtem, and ſaid, and in direct terms, that it was <hi>a neceſſary evacuation of his mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE practice of the law affords, I confeſs, a convenient out-let for much mental virulence. Not only what are called <hi>ſpite-actions,</hi> but many ſuits of a more ſober aſpect, are only extravaſations of mental bile. But this proceſs is to expenſive and too tedious for general uſe. My propoſal
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:024407_0726_0FC6F814E678E850"/>
is, I think, much better in every reſpect. It is a ſcheme by which envy and revenge may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified without danger and without coſt, and abuſe, ſlander, and invective ſpend themſelves, like rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, in harmleſs exploſions. For no man, in his ſenſes, will ever think of giving credit to any thing contained in the <hi>Freeman's Convenience or Chronicle of Scandal.</hi>

                  <p>☞As I not only drew up for publication the following account of the grand proceſſion, performed at Philadelphia on the 4th of July 1788; but had no ſmall ſhare in planning and directing the arrangement of it, and as it was a ſpectacle as ſingular in itſelf as the occaſion was extraordinary, I have thought proper to give it a place here, that the remembrance of it may have one more chance of preſervation in addition to thoſe of the Newſpapers of the time.</p>

                     <p>ON Friday the 4th of July 1788, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Philadelphia celebrated the declaration of <hi>Independence,</hi> made by the Thirteen United States of America on the 4th of July 1776, and the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>conſtitution,</hi> or frame

of government propoſed by the late general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the ſtates, and now ſolemnly adopted and ratified by ten of thoſe ſtates.</p>
                     <p>THE riſing ſun was ſaluted with a full peal from Chriſt Church ſteeple, and a diſcharge of cannon from the ſhip, <hi>Riſing Sun,</hi> commanded by Captain Philip Brown, anchored off Market ſtreet, and ſuperbly decorated with the flags of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in alliance with America.</p>
                     <p>TEN veſſels, in honour of the ten ſtates of the preſent union, were dreſſed and arranged the whole length of the harbour; each bearing a broad white flag at the maſt-head, inſcribed with the names of the ſtates reſpectively in broad gold let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the following order; <hi>New Hampſhire,</hi> oppoſite to the Northern Liberties; <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> oppoſite to Vine ſtreet; <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to Race ſtreet; <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> to Arch ſtreet; <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to Market ſtreet; <hi>Delaware</hi> to Cheſnut ſtreet; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland,</hi> to Walnut ſtreet; <hi>Virginia</hi> to Spruce ſtreet; <hi>South Carolina,</hi> to Pine ſtreet; and <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> to South ſtreet. The ſhips along the wharfs were alſo dreſſed on the occaſion; and as a briſk ſouth wind prevailed through the whole day, the flags and pennants were kept in full diſplay; and exhibited a moſt pleaſing and animating proſpect.</p>

                        <pb n="351" facs="unknown:024407_0729_0FC6F81FE06672E8"/>ACCORDING to orders iſſued the day before, the ſeveral parts which were to compoſe this grand proceſſion, began to aſſemble at eight o'clock in the morning, at and near the interſection of South and Third-ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>NINE gentlemen, diſtinguiſhed by white plumes in their hats, and furniſhed with ſpeaking trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, were ſuperintendants of the proceſſion; viz. general <hi>Mifflin,</hi> general <hi>Stewart,</hi> colonel <hi>Proctor,</hi> colonel <hi>Gurney,</hi> colonel <hi>Will,</hi> colonel <hi>Marſh,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Moore,</hi> major <hi>Lenox,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter Brown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE different companies of military, trades and profeſſions, had previouſly met in various parts of the city, of their own appointment; where they were ſeparately formed by their officers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conductors, and marched in order with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective flags, devices, and machines, to the place of general rendezvous. As theſe companies arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſucceſſion, the ſuperintendants diſpoſed of them in the neighbouring ſtreets in ſuch manner as that they might eaſily fall into the ſtations they were to occupy in forming the general proceſſion, as they ſhould be ſucceſſively called upon. By this means the moſt perfect order and regularity was effectually preſerved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="352" facs="unknown:024407_0730_0FC6F82942EC7D48"/>AFTER a ſtrict review of the ſtreets of the city, it had been determined, that the line of march ſhould be as follows. To commence at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of South and Third-ſtreets; thence along Third-ſtreet to Callowhill-ſtreet; thence up Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowhill-ſtreet to Fourth-ſtreet; thence along Fourth-ſtreet to Market-ſtreet; and thence to UNION GREEN, in front of Buſh-Hill—<hi>William Hamilton, eſq.</hi> having kindly offered the ſpacious lawn before his houſe at Buſh-Hill for the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the day.</p>
                     <p>THE ſtreet commiſſioners had, the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gone through the line of march, and directed the pavements to be ſwept, the trees to be lopped, and all obſtacles removed.</p>
                     <p>ABOUT half after nine o'clock the GRAND PROCESSION began to move; of which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as correct a detail as could be procured.</p>

horſes. This building was in the form of a dome, ſupported by 13 Corinthian columns, raiſed on pedeſtals proper to that order: the frize decorated with 13 ſtars. Ten of the columns were complete, but three left unfiniſhed. On the pedeſtals of the columns were inſcribed, in ornamented cyphers, the initials of the 13 American ſtates. On the top of the dome was a handſome cupola, ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a figure of plenty, bearing a cornucopia, and other emblems of her character. The dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this building were as follows—10 feet diameter—11 feet to the top of the cornice—the dome 4 feet high—the cupola 5 feet high—the figure of plenty 3 ½ feet high—the carriage on which the building was mounted 3 feet high—the whole 36 feet in height. Round the pedeſtal of the edifice, theſe words, "IN UNION THE FABRIC STANDS FIRM."</p>
                        <p>THIS elegant edifice was begun and finiſhed in the ſhort ſpace of four days by Meſſrs. <hi>William Williams &amp; Co.</hi>

                        <p>ON the floor of the grand edifice were ten chairs for the accommodation of ten gentlemen, viz.

reſt of the human race, whom they marked with the degrading title of <hi>barbarians.</hi> But did they, in all their pomp and pride of liberty, ever furniſh to the aſtoniſhed world an exhibition ſimilar to that which we now contemplate? Were their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions framed by thoſe who were appointed for that purpoſe by the people? Were they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the conſideration of the people?

                     <p>THE far famed eſtabliſhment of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was introduced by deception and fraud.

                     <p>IT would be improper now to examine its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.

How ſeldom does the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wanderer chooſe for her permanent reſidence the habitations of men! In their ſyſtems, ſhe ſees too many arrangements, civil and eccleſiaſtical, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the calmneſs and benignity of her temper. In the old world, how many millions of men do we behold unprofitable to ſociety, burdenſome to induſtry, the props of eſtabliſhments that deſerve not to be ſupported, the cauſes of diſtruſt in times of peace, and the inſtruments of deſtruction in the times of war! Why are they not employed in cultivating uſeful arts, and in forwarding public im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements? Let us indulge the pleaſing expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that ſuch will be the <hi>operation</hi> of <hi>government</hi> in the United States. Why may we not hope, that, diſentangled from the intrigues and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of European politics, and unmoleſted with the alarm and ſolicitude to which thoſe intrigues and jealouſies give birth, our councils will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the encouragement, and our ſtrength be exerted in the cultivation, of <hi>all the arts of peace</hi>?</p>
                     <p>OF thoſe, the firſt is AGRICULTURE—this is true in all countries. In the United States, its truth is of peculiar importance. The ſubſiſtence of man, the materials of manufactures, the articles
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:024407_0786_0FC6F8FDDC379648"/>
of commerce; all ſpring originally from <hi>the ſoil.</hi> On <hi>agriculture,</hi> therefore, <hi>the wealth of nations</hi> is founded. Whether we conſult the obſervations that reaſon will ſuggeſt, or attend to the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hiſtory will give, we ſhall in each caſe be ſatisfied of the influence of government, good or bad, upon the ſtate of <hi>agriculture.</hi> In a government, whoſe maxims are thoſe of oppreſſion, property is inſecure: it is given, it is taken away by caprice. Where there is no ſecurity for property, there is no encouragement for induſtry. Without induſtry, the richer the ſoil, the more it abounds with weeds. The evidence of induſtry warrants the truth of theſe general remarks: attend to <hi>Greece;</hi> and compare her agriculture in <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern</hi> times. <hi>Then,</hi> ſmiling harveſt bore teſtimony to the bountiful boons of liberty: <hi>now,</hi> the very earth languiſhes under oppreſſion. View the <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> how melancholy the proſpect! Which ever way you turn your afflicted eyes, ſcenes of deſolation croud before them. Waſte and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs appear around you in all their hideous forms. What is the reaſon? With <hi>double tyranny</hi> the land is curſed.

When the deſcription was made, the force of liberty pervaded the ſoil.</p>
                     <p>BUT is <hi>agriculture</hi> the only art which feels the influence of government? Over <hi>manufactures</hi> and <hi>commerce</hi> its power is equally prevalent: there the ſame cauſes operate; and there they produce the ſame effects. The induſtrious village, the buſy city, the crouded port—all theſe are the gifts of <hi>liberty</hi>—and without a good government, liberty cannot exiſt.</p>
                     <p>THESE are advantages; but theſe are not <hi>all</hi> the advantages that reſult from a ſyſtem of good government. Agriculture, manufactures, and commerce will enſure to us plenty, convenience, and elegance. But is there not ſomething ſtill wanting to finiſh the man? Are <hi>internal</hi> virtues and accompliſhments leſs eſtimable or leſs attractive than <hi>external</hi> arts and ornaments? Is the operation of government leſs powerful upon the <hi>former</hi> than upon the <hi>latter?</hi> By no means: upon this, as upon a preceding topic, reaſon and hiſtory will concur in their information and advice. In a ſerene mind the <hi>ſciences</hi> and the <hi>virtues</hi> love to dwell. But can the mind of a man be ſerene, when the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, liberty, ſubſiſtence of himſelf, and of thoſe for whom he feels more than for himſelf, depend on a

tyrant's nod? If the diſpirited ſubject of oppreſſion can with difficulty exert his enfeebled faculties ſo far as to provide, on the inceſſant demands of nature, food, juſt enough to lengthen out his wretched exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, can it be expected that, in ſuch a ſtate, he will experience thoſe fine and vigorous movements of the ſoul, without the full and free exerciſe of which <hi>ſcience</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> will never flouriſh? Look around to the nations that now exiſt. View in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoric retroſpect nations that have hitherto exiſted; the collected reſult will be an entire conviction of theſe all intereſting truths:—<hi>Where TYRANNY reigns, there is the country of IGNORANCE and VICE. Where GOOD GOVERNMENT prevails, there is the country of SCIENCE and VIRTUE.</hi> Under a <hi>good government,</hi> therefore, we muſt look for <hi>the accompliſhed man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT ſhall we confine our views even here? While we wiſh to be accompliſhed <hi>men</hi> and <hi>citizens,</hi> ſhall we wiſh to be <hi>nothing more?</hi> While we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our duty, and promote our happineſs in <hi>this</hi> world, ſhall we beſtow no regard upon the <hi>next?</hi> Does no connection ſubſiſt between <hi>the two?</hi> From this connection flows the moſt important of all the bleſſings of good government. But here let us pauſe: <hi>unaſſiſted reaſon</hi> can guide us no farther: ſhe directs us to that <hi>heaven deſcended ſcience,</hi> by

which LIFE and IMMORTALITY <hi>have been brought to light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MAY we not now ſay that we have reaſon for our joy? But while we cheriſh the delightful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us remember thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to give it <hi>permanence</hi> and <hi>ſtability.</hi> Shall we lie ſupine, and look in liſtleſs langour for thoſe bleſſings and enjoyments to which <hi>exertion</hi> is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably attached? If we would be <hi>happy,</hi> we muſt be <hi>active.</hi> The <hi>conſtitution,</hi> and our <hi>manners,</hi> muſt mutually ſupport and be ſupported. Even on <hi>this</hi> feſtivity, it will not be diſagreeable or incongruous to review the virtues and manners that both <hi>juſtify</hi> and <hi>adorn</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FRUGALITY</hi> and <hi>temperance</hi> firſt attract our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Theſe ſimple, but powerful virtues, are the ſole foundation on which a good government can reſt with ſecurity: they were the virtues which nurſed and educated <hi>infant ROME,</hi> and prepared her for all her greatneſs. But in the giddy hour of her proſperity, ſhe ſpurned from her the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure inſtruments by which it was acquired; and in their place ſubſtituted <hi>luxury</hi> and <hi>diſſipation.</hi> The conſequence was ſuch as might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: ſhe preſerved, for ſome time, a gay and flouriſhing appearance; but the internal health
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:024407_0790_0FC6F74A38FE6C70"/>

The fate of Rome, both in her <hi>riſing</hi> and in her <hi>falling</hi> ſtate, will be the fate of every other nation that ſhall follow <hi>both</hi> parts of her example.</p>
                     <p>INDUSTRY appears next among the virtues of a good citizen. Idleneſs is the nurſe of villains. The induſtrious alone conſtitute a nation's ſtrength. I will not expatiate on this fruitful ſubject: let one animating reflection ſuffice. In a <hi>well conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted commonwealth,</hi> the induſtry of every citizen extends beyond himſelf. A common intereſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the ſociety. <hi>Each</hi> gains from ALL, and <hi>all</hi> gain from EACH. It has often been obſerved, that the <hi>ſciences</hi> flouriſh <hi>all together;</hi> the remark applies equally to the <hi>arts.</hi>

The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of liberty are artful and inſiduous. A <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit</hi> ſteals her <hi>dreſs,</hi> imitates her <hi>manners,</hi> forges

her <hi>ſignature,</hi> aſſumes her <hi>name:</hi> but the real name of the deceiver is LICENTIOUSNESS. Such is her effrontery, that ſhe will charge liberty to her face with impoſture; and ſhe will, with ſhameleſs front, inſiſt that herſelf alone is the <hi>genuine character,</hi> and that herſelf alone is entitled to the reſpect which the <hi>genuine character</hi> deſerves. With the giddy and undiſcerning, on whom a deeper impreſſion is made by dauntleſs impudence, than by modeſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, her pretenſions are often ſucceſsful. <hi>She</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receives the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though ſhe alone appear upon the ſtage, her motions are regulated by <hi>dark ambition,</hi> who ſtands concealed behind the curtain, and who knows that <hi>deſpotiſm,</hi> his other favourite, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow the ſucceſs of <hi>licentiouſneſs.</hi> Againſt theſe enemies of <hi>liberty,</hi> who act in concert, though they appear on oppoſite ſides, the patriot citizen will keep a watchful guard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A good conſtitution</hi> is the greateſt bleſſing which a ſociety can enjoy. Need I infer, that it is the duty of every citizen to uſe his beſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting endeavours for preſerving it pure, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and vigorous? For the accompliſhment of this
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:024407_0792_0FC6F74D23CB8748"/>
great purpoſe, the exertions of no one citizen are unimportant. Let no one, therefore, harbour for a moment the mean idea that he is, and can be of no value to his country. Let the contrary manly impreſſion animate his ſoul. Every one can, at <hi>many</hi> times, perform to the ſtate <hi>uſeful ſervices;</hi> and he who ſteadily purſues the road of patriotiſm has the moſt inviting proſpect, of being able, at <hi>ſome</hi> times, to perform <hi>eminent</hi> ones.</p>
                     <p>ALLOW me to direct your attention, in a very particular manner, to a momentous part, which, by this conſtitution, every citizen will frequently be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act. All thoſe, in places of power and truſt, will be elected, either immediately by the people, or in ſuch a manner that their appointment will depend ultimately on ſuch immediate election. All the <hi>derivative</hi> movements of government muſt ſpring from the <hi>original</hi> movement of the <hi>people at large.</hi> If, to <hi>this,</hi> they give a ſufficient force, and a juſt direction, all the others will be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its controlling power. To ſpeak without a metaphor; if the people, at their elections, take care to chooſe none but repreſentatives that are <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> their repreſentatives will take care, in their turn, to chooſe or appoint none but ſuch as are <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good</hi> alſo. The remark applies to every ſucceeding election and appointment. Thus
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:024407_0793_0FC6F74EA9A98318"/>
the characters proper for public officers will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed from the <hi>immediate elections</hi> of the people o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the remoteſt parts of adminiſtration. Of what immenſe conſequence is it, then, that this <hi>primary</hi> duty ſhould be faithfully and ſkilfully diſcharged? On the faithful diſcharge of it, the public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or infelicity under this, and every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, muſt, in a very great meaſure, depend. For, believe me, no government, even the beſt, can be happily adminiſtered by <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>vicious</hi> men. You will forgive me, I am ſure, for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to impreſs upon your minds, in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, the importance of this great duty. It is the firſt <hi>concoction</hi> in politics; and if an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is committed <hi>here,</hi> it can never be corrected in any ſubſequent <hi>proceſs,</hi> the certain conſequence muſt be <hi>diſeaſe.</hi> Let no one ſay, that he is but a <hi>ſingle</hi> citizen, and that his ticket will be but <hi>one</hi> in the box; that <hi>one</hi> ticket may <hi>turn</hi> the election. In battle, every ſoldier ſhould conſider the public ſafety as depending on his <hi>ſingle</hi> arm; at an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every citizen ſhould conſider the public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as depending on his <hi>ſingle</hi> vote.</p>

                        <hi>A progreſſive ſtate</hi> is neceſſary to the happineſs and perfection of man. Whatever attainments are already reached, attainments ſtill higher ſhould

be purſued. Let us therefore ſtrive with noble emulation. Let us ſuppoſe we have done nothing while any thing yet remains to be done. Let us, with fervent zeal, preſs forward, and make unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advances in every thing that can <hi>ſupport, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, refine,</hi> or <hi>embelliſh</hi> ſociety.</p>
                     <p>TO enter into particulars under each of theſe heads, and to dilate them according to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, would be improper at this time. A few remarks on the <hi>laſt</hi> of them will be congenial with the entertainments of this auſpicious day.</p>
                     <p>IF we give the ſlighteſt attention to <hi>nature,</hi> we ſhall diſcover, that with <hi>utility</hi> ſhe is curious to blend <hi>ornament.</hi> Can we imitate a better pattern?

The weather was remarkably fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable for the ſeaſon; cloudy without rain, and a briſk wind from the ſouth during the whole day. At night, the ſhip <hi>Riſing Sun</hi> was handſomely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in honour of this great feſtival.</p>
                     <p>SUCH is the account we have been enabled to give of this memorable exhibition. It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable there may be ſome omiſſions; if ſo, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee can only aſſure their fellow citizens, that no neglect or offence was intended to any individual or company whatever. The ſhortneſs of the time, and the complicated nature of the taſk, muſt be their apology.</p>
                     <p>AS the ſyſtem of government now fully ratified, has been the occaſion of much <hi>preſent</hi> joy; ſo,

                     <p>SUCH was the plan of the voyage; ſubjected, however, to the diſcretion of an agent at New York, who had power to alter it if he ſhould think proper.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the ſhip had delivered her cargo at New York, the agent ordered her to cruize on the American coaſt for four months, and ſhipped hands on board her for the purpoſe, as <hi>privateer's-men,</hi> which appeared by an endorſement on the ſhip's articles. She had alſo a let-paſs on board, ſigned by the ſenior naval officer at New York, ſtiling her a privateer.</p>
                     <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances the <hi>Pole</hi> ſailed from New York, and was captured by Tucker, in a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate belonging to the United States, and libelled againſt in the admiralty of Pennſylvania as prize: whereupon a claim was filed in behalf of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States for one half of the value, under an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of congreſs, paſſed October 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1776, which gives the whole of veſſels of war taken by the ſhips of the United States to the captors, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024407_0809_0FC72FB74B84B330"/>
Croix ſhe went to Tortola, a Britiſh iſland, where ſhe took in the remainder of her cargo, which, by the teſtimony, appeared to have been ſent after her in a droger from St. Croix. At Tortola, captain Aſhburner, who was part owner of the cargo, cleared out at the cuſtom-houſe there for New York, then in poſſeſſion of the Britiſh troops.</p>
                     <p>WITH theſe double clearances, ſhe arrived on the American coaſt, where captain Tucker diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, purſued, and boarded her under Britiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Aſhburner miſtaking Tucker for a Britiſh officer, exhibited his Tortola papers, and alledged that he was bound for New York, whereupon Tucker took the ſloop as prize, brought her to Philadelphia, and libelled againſt her in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty as prize; at the ſame time a claim was filed in behalf of Wallace and Aſhburner, the owners.</p>
                     <p>ON the trial, it was urged, in favour of the claimants, that this veſſel and cargo were wholly Daniſh property, and that, notwithſtanding the Tortola clearance, the ſloop was in fact bound for Philadelphia, which clearance was only intended as a cover from Britiſh capture. In proof of this, many letters were exhibited, found on board, to ſundry merchants of the United States.

                     <p>IT was further ſhewn, that from the courſe of the wind, and the direction in which ſhe was ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the time ſhe was diſcovered, the probability was, that ſhe intended for the Delaware.</p>

                     <p>THE parties were commanders of privateers duly commiſſioned. Taylor engaged, and took a prize, Rice being in ſight at the time of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whereupon Rice claimed a ſhare of booty under the maritime law.</p>
                     <p>ON the trial it appeared, that although Rice was in ſight at the time of the action, yet from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of his ſituation, it was impoſſible he ſhould have contributed to the capture by terrifying the enemy: and ſo the jury found a ſpecial verdict in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>THAT captain John Rice was in ſight, and at the diſtance of five or ſix miles at the time of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024407_0822_0FC72FE32D09CCE8"/>
the ſaid capture, mentioned, and ſo forth; but that he did not contribute to the ſaid capture, or influence her ſurrender to the ſaid captain Taylor. And if upon this finding, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE fact was, that Rice lay within a bar, cloſe upon the ſhore of New Jerſey, and ſaw Taylor engage a Britiſh veſſel, about five or ſix miles out at ſea. There were alſo two Britiſh veſſels of force between Rice and Taylor, at the time of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Rice, obſerving the battle, ſaw at laſt one of the veſſels ſtrike to the other, but could not clearly diſcern which had the victory: believing that Taylor had ſurrendered, he reported in Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey that poor Taylor was taken at laſt. But he found a few days afterwards, that Taylor had been ſucceſsful, and brought his prize ſafe into port. Whereupon he claimed a ſhare of the booty under the general law reflecting veſſels in ſight of a capture.</p>
                     <p>IN the argument on the ſpecial verdict, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for Rice reſted his claim principally on Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy, Book 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> chap. 2. ſect. 20. urging that no teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony ſhould be admitted againſt a preſumption of law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:024407_0823_0FC72FE4CBF6CA38"/>BUT the judge obſerved, that the preſumption of law is founded on a material fact: to wit, that the veſſel in ſight be armed and <hi>prepared for battle,</hi> or at leaſt in a poſſible condition to join in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. When this is the caſe, the law will preſume that her preſence terrified the enemy and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the ſurrender; and therefore, although ſhe does not join in the engagement, allows her a ſhare of the prize in proportion to her men and guns. But if a veſſel in ſight is aground on aſhoal or bar, or is far to leeward, with diſabled maſts and rigging, or is ſo ſituated (as in the preſent caſe) that it is manifeſtly impoſſible for her to take any part in the battle, ſhe cannot be conſidered as to be ſo <hi>prepared for battle</hi> as to bring her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the preſumption of law.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Golden Roſe,</hi> belonging to ſubjects of the States of Holland, ſailed from Hamburgh with a cargo conſigned to Colloghan and Sons, merchants, in the iſland of Teneriff, an iſland belonging to the crown of Spain.</p>
                     <p>HOLLAND was at this time in a ſtate neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Britain had declared war againſt Spain, and neither of theſe nations were in alliance with the United States of America.</p>
                     <p>THE Golden Roſe was captured near the Iſland of Teneriff by a Britiſh privateer, and ordered for New York, then in poſſeſſion of the Britiſh army, and on her way to New York ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024407_0825_0FC72FECC740DB78"/>
by the libellant and brought into the port of Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>HASSENCLEVER filed a claim for the ſhip and cargo in behalf of the owners and merchants, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſtates of Holland, and</p>
                     <p>DON Juan de Miralles alſo filed a claim for the cargo only, in behalf of Colloghan and Sons, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the king of Spain.</p>
                     <p>IT was argued for the libellant, that although the ſhip and cargo did originally belong to the ſubjects of neutral powers with reſpect to America, yet the property had totally diveſted by the Britiſh capture, the veſſel having been more than than ſix weeks in their poſſeſſion: that if any injury was done to the neutral owners, it was done by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh captain who firſt took her, and not by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellant, who forced her from a declared enemy as he had a right to do: that the preſent caſe came within the reſolve of congreſs of November, 1775, declaring that all veſſels employed in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting proviſions, ſtores, and ſo forth, to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in New York, ſhould, if taken, be lawful prize. And laſtly, that if this veſſel ſhould not be condemned as prize, it would be eaſy for ſubjects of neutral nations to ſupply the Britiſh at New
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024407_0826_0FC72FEE049B5A10"/>
York with all things neceſſary for carrying on the war againſt us by colluſion.</p>
                     <p>ON the contrary, it was urged for the claimants, that this ſhip had committed no offence whatever, that her intended voyage was a lawful one, viz. from Hamburgh to Teneriff. And although the libellant took her in her way to New York, yet it was by compulſion that ſhe was found in that courſe. that the Britiſh privateer had violated the laws of nations in taking her, and therefore ſhe could not have been condemned in their courts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty; inferring, that as ſhe was not legal prize to the captors, the re-captors could have no better title: and that, ſuppoſing the cargo to be Spaniſh property, yet as it had not been condemned to the captors, the property had not been totally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, but that the <hi>jus poſtliminii</hi> took place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the ordinance of congreſs of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 5. 1775.</p>
                     <p>AFTER long argument, the judge inſtructed the jury, that as the facts were all acceded to in this cauſe, viz. That the ſhip was Dutch, and the cargo Spaniſh property, and that ſhe had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and retaken, as ſet forth in the libel, the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt depend upon points of law only, and therefore recommended their bringing in a ſpecial
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024407_0827_0FC72FEF464AAFF0"/>
verdict; adding, that he would not give his opinion on the law, without taking time to look into the authorities referred to, and reconſidering the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>THE jury, after a long receſs, brought in a <hi>general</hi> verdict, viz.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>THE jury find for the firſt claimant as to the ſhip, and they award freight according to charter-party.

                     <head>(1780.) MONTGOMERY veſus. WHARTON, AND OTHERS, OWNERS OF THE SHIP GENERAL GREENE.</head>
                     <p>WHARTON, and others, owners of the ſhip General Greene, had chartered her to certain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants for a particular voyage, and appointed Montgomery maſter for that voyage. The ſhip had cleared out at the naval office, and was on the point of ſailing, when a ſudden froſt filled the Delaware with ice, and fixed her in the port of Philadelphia. During the winter ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024407_0830_0FC72FFA7B519F88"/>
aroſe between the owners and maſter. The conſequence of which was that the owners by a letter of diſmiſſion, diſcharged Montgomery from their ſervice, and put another maſter on board. Whereupon Montgomery libelled againſt the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the admiralty to compell them to fulfil their contract with him.</p>
                     <p>THE queſtion was, whether owners could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the maſter they had appointed before the completion of the voyage, after he had ſigned bills of lading for the cargo, and ſhipped his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, without the owners ſhewing ſufficient cauſe for ſuch diſmiſſion.</p>
                     <p>AND it was contended, that the maſter, from the time of his appointment, has the ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſhip veſted in him, and cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed without committing ſome offence ſufficient to forfeit his rights and juſtify a diſmiſſion. That after ſigning bills of lading, he becomes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the freighters for the delivery of the cargo, and that the owners cannot by their act exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate him from this charge, whilſt the bills of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſigned with his hand, remain in the poſſeſſion of the freighters: that the libellant, conſidering himſelf as engaged for this voyage, had neglected to ſeek for any other appointment; and that the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024407_0831_0FC72FFE2ED54DB8"/>
owners diſcharging him at this time, was an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which the court ought in juſtice to redreſs by compelling them to reinſtate him in his office.</p>
                     <p>IN behalf of the reſpondents it was urged, that the owners of a ſhip have, and ought to have, a right to remove the maſter at pleaſure; becauſe their intereſts are ſo deeply concerned in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, that they are anſwerable not only for his imprudent conduct, but are bound by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts he may legally make on account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: that if, after their their choice or a maſter, his appointment ſhould be deemed irrevocable for the voyage, unleſs ſome groſs offence can be proved, the owners will be at the mercy of the maſter, who, by his weak or wicked conduct, may bring them to ruin. That if when the owners have diſmiſſed the maſter, the court ſhould undertake to reinſtate him, contrary to their judgment and inclination, and ſo force him upon them, the court and not the owners, ought to be anſwerable to the freigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for any conſequences that may enſue: that neither the charter-party, ſhipping articles, or bills of lading, prohibit a change of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as the contracts made with him are made in his official and not in his perſonal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: that the maſter is in fact the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the owners, and not himſelf perſonally
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024407_0832_0FC73000E35C6DE0"/>
bound, neither is he anſwerable for the conduct of his ſucceſſor: that in caſe an action ſhould be brought againſt him for a breach of contract on the bills of lading, he might plead his diſmiſſion by the owners, and it would be good in law: that the ſubordinate officers are appointed by the maſter of a ſhip, and if they ſhould miſbehave, or prove inſufficient or unſafe, the owners have no remedy but by the removal of the maſter: that if owners are bound by the appointment of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to continue him for the voyage, the maſter ought alſo to be bound to perform the voyage, even againſt his intereſt or inclination; but if, in caſe of the maſter's refuſal, the owners ſhould li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt him in the admiralty, the court could give no redreſs, becauſe the court cannot award damages, neither can it compel the maſter to a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific performance of his contract, from the nature of the ſervice: that the maſter's appointment is, and ought to be during pleaſure only: that the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which appoints can remove: that if a maſter ſuffers injury by an unreaſonable diſmiſſion, he may have his remedy at common law, where ample recompence in damages will be made to him: and finally, that whatever inconveniences may ariſe to maſters being ſubjected to the caprice of owners
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024407_0833_0FC73002097A6440"/>
of veſſels, much greater would ariſe to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhould they be compelled to retain in their ſervice maſters once appointed, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their judgment or intereſt; and that no inſtance can be produced of a maſter being thus forced upon the owners of a ſhip by any court whatever.</p>
                     <p>TO which, council for the libellant replied— That this cauſe came properly before the court of admiralty: that where a court hath the right to take cognizance of an injury, it follows neceſſarily that it can give redreſs: that if the court cannot award damages, it can order a ſpecific performance of the contract: that the court can compel the maſter to ſuch performance; and if he refuſes, can attach his perſon, and oblige him to give ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the completion of his contract; and, therefore, the juriſdiction is competent: that it would be unjuſt to ſend the maſter to common law for redreſs, on the owner's breach of contract, as the owners may fail and be unable to pay dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and therefore the ſhip ought to be his certain and proper ſecurity: that all contracts ought to be ſacred and mutual, being founded on reciprocity; and it would be abſurd to alledge, that the maſter is bound on his part, and the owners not bound on theirs: that a maſter engaged for a voyage, is
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024407_0834_0FC73004A5420E30"/>
like a ſervant indented for a certain time; and that the engagement or indenture cannot be diſſolved, during the terms, but by mutual conſent: that this veſſel was chartered to the freighter, who acquired by the charter-party a temporary property in her, and the owners had nothing to do with her for the time, the ſhip being under the ſame circumſtances with a houſe leaſed for a term: that after the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-party is ſigned, and the goods laden on board, the owners cannot diſcharge the maſter at their pleaſure; as his good character and abilities might have been the inducement which led the freighter to make choice of that ſhip in preference: and, laſtly, that if no inſtance can be found of a maſter's being forced upon the owners of a ſhip, neither can any authority be produced, giving the owners the arbitrary power of diſmiſſing the maſter at pleaſure, and without aſſigning ſufficient cauſe.</p>
                     <div type="judgment">
                        <head>JUDGMENT.</head>
                        <p>AFTER having carefully conſidered the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments advanced, and the authorities cited in this cauſe, it appears to me unneceſſary to purſue the whole tract of argument that hath been taken on this occaſion. The deciſion of the cauſe reſts ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the nature of the contract between the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024407_0835_0FC73005D80E37E8"/>
of a ſhip and the captain they employ. And the terms or ſubſtance of ſuch a contract is, in my opinion this, viz. If the maſter well and faithfully performs the duties of his ſtation, the owners, on on their part, are bound to pay the ſtipulated wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and allow him all the cuſtomary privileges of his office. But it does not ſeem to be any part of the contract, that a maſter once engaged, ſhall be maſter for the voyage at all events. This might be extremely injurious to owners, on account of the very extenſive powers a maſter hath over their property. And however hard it may appear that that the maſter ſhould be ſubject to the caprice of his owners in this reſpect, he muſt conſider it as one of the unavoidable inconveniences of his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and in caſes of real injury apply to the laws of his country for redreſs. Much greater would the danger be to owners of veſſels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to commerce in general, if the appointment of a maſter ſhould be irrevocable for the voyage. Whatever good opinion an owner may have of the maſter, at the time of his appointment, he may find ſufficient reaſon afterwards to change his mind, and yet not be able to produce legal proof of his defection or inability. Fidelity or infidelity before a ſervice performed, is a matter of opinion only, and it would be an unreaſonable hardſhip to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024407_0836_0FC7300E57466790"/>
an owner to continue what was originally a voluntary truſt, in the hands of a perſon of whom he may have found ſubſequent reaſons to believe that he may prove either unfaithful or unſkilful, although he may not be able to charge him with any poſitive offence: but I cannot ſee how this court can interfere to any effect. If the court ſhould decree that the owners ſhall receive the libellant on board, as maſter for the voyage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for; have not the owners a power to ſell their ſhip, to lay her up, or totally change the voyage, and ſo evade the decree? Or, if a maſter ſhould refuſe to go the voyage for which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, can this court compel a ſpecific performance of the duties of his office? The remedy in both caſes muſt be in damages for a breach of contract, to which the common law is moſt competent. Let the bill be diſmiſſed.</p>
                        <p>THE libellant appealed from this judgment, and the cauſe was again fully argued before the judges of the high court of errors and appeals; but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel was finally diſmiſſed.</p>

                     <p>IT appeared in teſtimony that the Brig Nymph (formerly called the Neptune), had been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the claimants, and was captured by the Britiſh ſhip <hi>Iris</hi> on the 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> or 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of April 1780: that on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, and 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> of the ſame month, three other veſſels were alſo taken by the ſame ſhip, all which prizes were ſent into New York: that on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame month the captains of theſe four prizes were all taken before the judge of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty there, and examined, preparatory to the trial and condemnation of their veſſels: that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a fortnight after, one of the ſaid four cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024407_0840_0FC7301AA2FB8160"/>
was told by ſome of the officers of the Iris, and alſo by ſome of the crew, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their ſhares of the four prizes aforeſaid. It was alſo in proof, that the ſaid four veſſels had been advertiſed for ſale at the coffee-houſe in New York; and one of them, viz. the <hi>Hetty,</hi> was particularly remembered to have been advertiſed, <hi>as a condemned prize:</hi> that the Neptune had been purchaſed by merchants in New York; and that on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May following ſhe was commiſſioned as a privateer, by the name of the <hi>Nymph,</hi> to cruiſe againſt the veſſels of the United States of America. Laſtly, it appeared this brig ſailed from New York on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> and was captured by the libellant on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May.</p>
                     <p>AGAINST the libel of the captors there was a claim filed, by Thomas Irwin and others, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer owners, founded on the ordinance of congreſs of the 5th of December 1775, upon a ſuggeſtion that this veſſel could not have been condemned in the court of admiralty at New York previous to the re-capture: and in ſupport of this ſuggeſtion, a Britiſh act of parliament was exhibited, wherein is ſet forth at large the mode in which the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels captured from the United States of America ſhall be proceeded againſt in their courts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty. Which act directs, that for the more
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024407_0841_0FC7301C45FC7C68"/>
more ſpeedy condemnation of ſuch veſſels, the whole proceſs ſhall be completed in 28 days from the firſt application made to the judge by the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and the claimants alledged that this brig not only ſailed from New York, but was re-cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by the libellant before the 28 days were accompliſhed; and therefore inferred, that ſhe could could not have been condemned under this act: that all the evidence produced by the libellant to proved a condemnation was merely hearſay, and ought to have no weight, eſpecially as there was no mention made of any ſuch condemnation amongſt the papers found on board, as is uſual. And laſtly, that her having been ſold, commiſſioned, and ſailing, and the money paid for purchaſing her, being diſtributed amongſt the firſt captors (if true) is ſtill no proof, or even preſumption, of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; becauſe it is cuſtomary for the judge to permit prizes to be ſold before trial, the parties giving ſecurity; and inſiſted, that before the property can totally diveſt, the condemnation muſt be directly proved, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of December 5th 1775.</p>
                     <p>WHEREUPON the judge obſerved,</p>
                     <p>THAT the manifeſt ſpirit of the ordinance of congreſs of December 5th is truly complied with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024407_0842_0FC7301DBB5C3678"/>
when the property is fully and fairly diveſted: that the moſt direct and deciſive way of aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch diveſture is by legal condemnation in the enemy's court of admiralty; and therefore the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance makes that the criterion; but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs could not expect that full and direct proof of ſuch condemnation could in all caſes be produced, as the documents neceſſary to ſuch proof cannot always be in power of the parties; ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption muſt therefore often ſupply the place of abſolute proof: that this brig having been captured, taken into the enemy's port, ſold by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the judge, commiſſioned under a new name, fitted out and ſent by new owners on a cruize, muſt found a violent preſumption that ſhe had been legally condemned as lawful prize to the firſt captors: that whether ſhe had been formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned or not, theſe circumſtances were fully ſufficient to a total diveſture of the property from the former owners: that the act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment referred to, is profeſſedly deſigned to ſhorten the proceſs of the courts of admiralty, and directs that it ſhall be completed within 28 days; but does not prohibit its being done in a ſhorter time: that as proofs have been given that ſome veſſels have been condemned in a ſhorter time, it is poſſible, and even probable, that this brig might alſo have
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024407_0843_0FC73022ABFB8198"/>
been ſo condemned, and that ſuch a preſumption is juſtifiable by all the circumſtances of the caſe.</p>

                     <p>THE Sloop Sarah, being Bermudian property, ſailed with a cargo of onions, ſugar, ſalt, gin, flour and oil, from from Bermudas for Charleſtown in South Carolina, the owners knowing at the time of her ſailing that Charleſtown was then in
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024407_0844_0FC730255C4653B8"/>
the poſſeſſion of the Britiſh troops. The libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants diſcovered and captured her on Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town bar, at the entrance of the harbour, brought her into the port of Philadelphia, and libelled againſt her as prize.</p>
                     <p>WHEREUPON a claim was filed in behalf of Stiles, and others, the former owners.</p>
                     <p>AND it was urged in ſupport of the claim, that by an ordinance of congreſs of the 24th of July 1776, the property of Bermudians was exempted from confiſcation: that under the ſanction of this ordinance the Bermudians had traded with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States during the war, and frequently ſupplied their neceſſities at a very great hazard: and that Stiles the claimant in particular had been twice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner by the Britiſh for trading with the ſubjects of the United States: that the preſent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go was not ſent as ſupplies to the enemy: that the flour on board was too inconſiderable a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to anſwer any ſuch purpoſe; and that ſalt could be imported into Charleſtown much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently and cheaper from Turks Iſland than from Bermudas. That the truth is, this cargo was deſigned in part to diſcharge a debt due from the claimants to a certain Mr Loyd a known
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024407_0845_0FC73027DC0372A0"/>
friend to the American cauſe, and now a priſoner in Charleſtown, and in part to purchaſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the inhabitants of Bermudas: that the ordinance of congreſs prohibiting any veſſels from carrying ſupplies, &amp;c. to any part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States in the poſſeſſion of the enemy, cannot be ſuppoſed to extend to veſſels carrying proviſions to relieve the wants of the ſubjects of thoſe ſtates who are priſoners and in diſtreſs, for that ſuch an extenſion would be contrary to reaſon, humanity, and good policy. Teſtimony was alſo produced to prove, that there was really a debt due from the claimants to Mr Loyd at Charleſtown; and that the owners, or ſome of them, had declared before the veſſel ſailed from Bermudas, that part of the cargo was to diſcharge the debt due to Mr. Loyd, and the remainder to purchaſe proviſions.</p>
                     <p>THE arguments being cloſed, the judge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</p>
                     <p>THAT the ordinance of congreſs in favour of the inhabitants of Bermudas, a people under the ſovereignty and allegiance of Great Britain, could never be intended to put them on a better foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with reſpect to the war, than the citizens of America, or the citizens of neutral powers; and that there could be but little doubt, but that an
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024407_0846_0FC7302937B91360"/>
American veſſel, taken in the ſituation of the brig Sarah, would have been confiſcated: that the plea, that ſhe was carrying ſupplies to a priſoner, ought to have been ſupported by full and direct teſtimony, to counteract the violent preſumption to the contrary; but here was no direct teſtimony to that point, and even ſuppoſing the ſuggeſtion to be true, as to the good intentions of the claimants, they had not conducted the buſineſs according to the known rules of war; for leave ſhould have been firſt obtained from the Britiſh commander at Charleſtown, even for Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to ſend in ſupplies to his priſoners. It is indeed in proof, that there is a debt due from the claimants to Mr. Loyd, a priſoner in Charleſtown; and that one of the owners was heard to ſay, that part of this cargo was to diſcharge that debt, and the remainder to purchaſe proviſions: but it no where appears, what was the amount of this debt, a very neceſſary circumſtance, if all other objections were out of the way; otherwiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cover of ſmall and trifling debts due to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, large and important ſupplies might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to the enemy; and at any rate, the plea of paying a debt due could extend no further than the amount of that debt. But in oppoſition to theſe appearances of good intentions, it is in proof, that the owners originally deſigned this veſſel and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024407_0847_0FC7302B92A3AAE0"/>
cargo for the Weſt India Iſlands, but changed the voyage as ſoon as it was known that Charleſtown had ſurrendered to the enemy.</p>
                     <p>I adjudge that this veſſel and cargo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as prize to the libellants, and that the claim be diſmiſſed</p>

                     <head>WALKER verſus THE ALBION.</head>
                     <p>THIS ſhip was taken on her way from Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool to Archangel, having on board a cargo of ſalt and a hogſhead of rum. The captors ſent in with the prize, the ſhip's gunner, and three lads, priſoners; alſo two cuſtom-houſe cockets, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect logbook or journal, ſaid to be all the papers
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024407_0848_0FC73030981519A0"/>
found on board at the time ſhe was taken. One of theſe cockets reſpected the ſalt on board, and the other, the rum. The prize-maſter ſwore that there were no other papers found in the ſhip; and the gunner depoſed, that the veſſel was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Ormſon and Son,</hi> merchants in Liverpool, but that the ſalt and rum were ſhipped by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul from the court of Ruſſia, at Liverpool, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the empreſs of Ruſſia.</p>
                     <p>ON this appearance of the cargo's being neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral property, the judge directed the attorney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to file and proſecute a claim for the ſaid cargo in behalf of the her majeſty Ruſſia.</p>
                     <p>THE cauſe being fully argued, the judge declared himſelf as follows:</p>
                     <p>IT is not eſſential to the preſent enquiry, whether it is probable or not, that there is at Liverpool ſuch a character as a conſul from the court of Ruſſia, or what the rights and privileges of a conſul are, by the law of nations; ſubjects which have perhaps been too largely diſcuſſed in the courſe of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The only queſtion ſeems to be, Is there ſufficient proof or not that this cargo was ſhipped on account of her majeſty of Ruſſia, by her fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024407_0849_0FC730337AC0D520"/>
or agent at Liverpool? or, in other words, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the cargo neutral property or not?</p>
                     <p>THE teſtimony, by which this queſtion is to be determined, ſtands thus: On the one ſide are the cuſtom-houſe cockets of Liverpool, certifying the ſalt to have been ſhipped by Meſſrs. <hi>Gilbert and company,</hi> merchants, of Liverpool, and the rum to have been ſhipped by a Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> of the ſame place. On the other ſide we have the depoſition of the gunner of the ſhip, who belonged to her, as he ſays, at the time ſhe was taking in her lading at Liverpool; and expreſsly ſwears, that both the ſalt and rum were ſhipped by a Ruſſian conſul at Liverpool, on account of the empreſs; and gives ſeveral collateral circumſtances to ſupport the truth of his allegation.</p>
                     <p>IT has been ſuggeſted on the part of the claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that cuſtom-houſe papers are often fallacious, and not concluſive evidence: that, for various mercantile reaſons, borrowed names are often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the names of the real ſhippers: that the depoſition of the gunner is direct and abſolute; and that from the ſeeming mutilation of the log-book, and the papers forwarded being ſo few, there is reaſon to ſuſpect a ſuppreſſion of evidence on the part of the captors, in order to conceal
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024407_0850_0FC7303500DF05C0"/>
from the court the real proprietor of this cargo; and that this ſuſpicion is further countenanced by the captors not ſending forward the captain or mate of the prize, as by his inſtructions he ought to have done.</p>
                     <p>HAVING conſidered, as well theſe, as the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adduced in behalf of the libellants, I am of opinion, That the teſtimony of the gunner, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on report only, concerning a matter in which he cannot be ſuppoſed to have any certain or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate knowledge, however honeſtly or impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, ought not to outweigh the certified de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of regular, official papers, unleſs ſome probable proof can be given, or circumſtances ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſhew, that theſe papers are, or may be, fallacious. There does not, in the preſent caſe, appear any reaſon, why a Ruſſian factor or agent ſhould make uſe of the names of Liverpool mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to cover his neutral property, which would have been ſecure from confiſcation without any ſuch artifice: that a Britiſh merchant ſhould, in the preſent war, ſtrive to conceal his property un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neutral name is a very natural ſuggeſtion; but common ſenſe will not allow the ſuppoſition, that a neutral owner, already ſecure, would riſk pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty under the borrowed names of perſons, whoſe names alone would endanger confiſcation in caſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024407_0851_0FC7303A304613F8"/>
of capture. The condition of the papers, and the not ſending forward the captain or mate of the prize, induce a cenſure of negligence on the part of the captors; but a wilful ſuppreſſion of evidence for the evaſion of juſtice, is a crime of ſo heinous a nature, that it ought not to be preſumed of any one, unleſs very powerful circumſtances ſhall juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the preſumption.</p>
                     <p>I adjuge, that the ſhip Albion and her cargo, be condemned as lawful prize to the libellants.</p>

                     <p>JOB Pray and Aaron Stockholm engaged and took as prize, the brig <hi>Recovery,</hi> a veſſel belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the enemy; the ſchooner Livingſton, a veſſel belonging to Robert Morris, the claimant, being in ſight at the time of the capture.

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024407_0853_0FC7303D605AE5E0"/>
to cruize as privateers againſt the enemy; but Kelly, the maſter of the Livingſton, had no ſuch commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>THE council for the claimant urged, that it was a principle of law—that <hi>prizes taken by veſſels not commiſſioned, inured to the ſovereign power,</hi> and exhibited a transfer from congreſs, of all their title to any ſhare in this prize to Robert Morris; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering him to proſecute a claim, in the name of the United States, but for his own benefit. And the authorities cited in ſupport of this doctrine, were <hi>Carthew</hi> 474, and 12th <hi>Modern</hi> 134.</p>
                     <p>BUT neither of theſe authorities apply ſtrictly to the preſent caſe. In the one, the prize was a wreck, ſtranded on the ſhore, and great part of the booty was taken on ſhore by the crews of veſſels not commiſſioned: in the other, a veſſel without a commiſſion, took a prize, and carried her into a foreign port, where the captor ſold her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IN both caſes, the booty was taken by perſons not commiſſioned to take; no veſſels duly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned aſſiſting in, or being preſent at the time of the capture. But in the preſent caſe, the prize was in fact taken by veſſels regularly authorized
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024407_0854_0FC7303EBB4CE880"/>
for the purpoſe, and the non-commiſſioned veſſel only in ſight at the time of the battle. In the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cited, no perſons were preſent or aſſiſting to whom the booty could be legally adjudged. Here the libellants, the real captors, were duly commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to take, and empowered by their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the reſolve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of congreſs, to poſſeſs and enjoy the property ſo legally taken.</p>
                     <p>A veſſel not commiſſioned muſt be conſidered as a mere merchantman; and according to <hi>Lee,</hi> 237, if a merchant veſſel meets an enemy in the courſe of the voyage, and takes her, the prize ſhall belong to the captor: but if ſhe goes out of her courſe to ſeek plunder, ſhe may be deemed a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Now, it is not pretended that the Livingſton. took the prize in queſtion, on the contrary, it is in teſtimony, that ſhe was running away whilſt the libellants were engaged with the enemy; and now claims a ſhare of the prize, as having been in ſight at the time of the capture.</p>
                     <p>THE right under which a veſſel in ſight may claim a ſhare of a prize taken, is founded in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of law, which ſuppoſes a veſſel ſo in ſight, and armed, and prepared for battle, to have indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſurrender. A preſumption of law is a legal indulgence, and ought to be ſtrictly confined within
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024407_0855_0FC73041038DBE88"/>
the reaſon of the preſumption. But no authority has been adduced to ſhew that this indulgence has been extended to a veſſel not commiſſioned to take, unarmed, and flying from the ſcene of action.</p>
                     <p>THE Livingſton cannot claim under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of law, not being within the deſcription; nor the United States under the general doctrine; becauſe the prize was in fact taken by veſſels duly authoriſed to take, which the Livingſton was not.

ſuppoſed leak, the captain dexterouſly left the fleet in the night, and ran up the Delaware, where his ſloop was taken by the libellants.</p>
                     <p>IT has been admitted on the part of the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, that this ſloop did really intend for ſome port in the United States not in the poſſeſſion of of the enemy, and that the goods were <hi>bona fide</hi> ſhipped as ſet forth in the exhibits; and for the purpoſes alledged. But it is urged, that the ſafe conduct of congreſs ought to be ſtrictly conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—that dry goods are not the <hi>produce</hi> of a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica eſtate, and therefore not covered by the paſſport: that <hi>Fitz</hi> and <hi>Tyler</hi> are Britiſh ſubjects; and the property of the goods ſhipped by them not altered by the bills of lading, becauſe thoſe bills do not declare the uſe, the appropriation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only deſignated in private inſtructions, which, the parties might have revoked at pleaſure; and that under theſe circumſtances, being truly Britiſh property, they ought to be condemned as prize to the captor.</p>
                     <p>ON examiming the complexion of this cauſe, I find that the peculiar circumſtances of the caſe, require that it ſhould be viewed in the liberal light of equity, rather than ſquared by the ſtricteſt rules
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024407_0858_0FC7304D02B80B80"/>
of law. The intention of congreſs in granting the paſſport appears to have been to permit Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Penny to import the produce of his eſtate in Jamaica, for the benefit of himſelf and family; and it is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they meant this ſhould be done in the moſt beneficial manner. Had it been otherwiſe, congreſs would not have veſted an important reſtriction on a ſingle word of equivocal conſtruction; but would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a prohibitory clauſe in the paſſport. As to the law reſpecting bills of lading, it ſeems not to apply fully to the preſent caſe, becauſe the whole arrangement of this buſineſs was framed with a view to cover the property from ſeizure by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh captors, and not according to the cuſtom of merchants in open commerce. Theſe bills of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and inſtructions were altogether confidential.</p>
                     <p>IT muſt be allowed, that Fitch and Tyler, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Jamaica, and being profeſſedly Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, had no right to ſhip goods for the United States; and as their part of the cargo is not cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the paſſport, they ran great riſk of confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation into whatever hands they might fall. If it could be made appear, that theſe goods were to have been ſold for their perſonal benefit, they would doubtleſs be prize to the captors. But as it is manifeſt from the teſtimony, and admitted
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024407_0859_0FC730537153EE00"/>
by counſel for the libellants, that the goods ſhipped by Fitch were for the ſupport of his aged mother and his ſon at Boſton, ſubjects of the United States, and that thoſe ſhipped by Tyler were for uſe of his ſon, under the care of his friend Alden Baſs, alſo American ſubjects, or to diſcharge debts already contracted on their accounts, it ſeems to be one of thoſe caſes to which the ſtrictneſs of law ought not to be rigorouſly applied—more eſpecially as there is little reaſon to apprehend that lenity here may form a dangerous precedent for hereafter, becauſe a like caſe will probably never occur again—paſſports of this kind being very rare.</p>
                     <p>LET the libel be diſmiſſed; and the ſloop and her cargo be delivered to the claimants. But as there was ſuch probable cauſe of capture, I adjudge that the claimants pay the coſts and charges.</p>
                     <p>N. B. From this decree the libellants appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the court of appeals confirmed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

                     <p>THE Brig Gloceſter had been captured by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Kean in the privateer Holker, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as prize to the captors. The marſhal being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make diſtribution of the booty amongſt the crew, according to the liſt handed in by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Kean, was notified to ſtay in his hands 25 ſhares of the ſaid prize, claimed by Patrick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoon, and others, as being a part of the crew belonging to, and concerned in the ſaid privateer Holker. Notwithſtanding that their names were not to be found in the captain's return; the libel, now before the court is for theſe 25 ſhares.</p>
                     <p>THE circumſtances of this caſe appear, by the teſtimony exhibited, to be as follows.</p>
                     <p>THE printed articles of the privateer Holker were ſet up at a common houſe of rendezvous for
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024407_0861_0FC73056BAEAD708"/>
the enliſtment of privateer's men, according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. The libellants, in common with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſigned theſe articles, and made the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary preparations for the cruiſe. When the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker was ready to ſail, the libellants, with the reſt of the crew, repaired on board by order of the captain, and the veſſel ſet ſail. When they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Cheſter on the Delaware (15 miles below Philadelphia) captain Kean muſtered his crew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deck, called over their names as ſubſcribed to the articles, and then, without giving any reaſon for his conduct, ſelected Patrick Mahoon and 24 others, and ordered them on ſhore; refuſing to let them proceed on the cruiſe, and when they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſolicited to be continued on board he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly drove them away, and the captain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on his voyage, leaving the libellants behind.</p>
                     <p>A few days after Kean again called his crew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and produced to them another printed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of articles, which he urged them to ſign. Some objected, obſerving that they had already ſigned, and did not underſtand ſigning two ſets of articles for the ſame cruiſe; but the captain enforced them with threats and even blows, to ſign the new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; declaring at the ſame time, that his view
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024407_0862_0FC730594D137538"/>
was to exclude thoſe men whom he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind from having any ſhare of the prizes they might take. The Brig Gloceſter was captured during this cruiſe.</p>
                     <p>THE reſpondents have reſted their cauſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally on a plea to the juriſdiction of this court; alledging that the injury, if any, was excluſively of common law cognizance; becauſe the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants claim was founded in articles executed on ſhore, within the body of a country: that although the admiralty could determine the queſtion of prize or no prize; yet it could not determine to whoſe uſe, having no juriſdiction in diſputes between owner and owner, owner and captain, or captain and mariner, except only in the caſe of a mariner's wages, which is allowed out of ſpecial favour, and not of right, further than as <hi>communis error f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cit jus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE facts being fully aſcertained, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, no difficulty ariſes from that quarter. It is in proof that captain Kean forced the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants on ſhore after the voyage was begun, and compelled the remainder of the crew to ſign the new articles, with a veiw to exclude the libellants from any advantage they might claim under the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024407_0863_0FC7305D43E8CF08"/>
former; and it is contended that this court cannot redreſs the injury, becauſe the ſuit reſpects <hi>damages,</hi> which the common law alone can aſcertain. The truth however is, that the parties do not ſue for redreſs or an injury; but for their ſhares of a prize legally condemned to the uſe <hi>of the owners, officers, and crew, and of all perſons belonging to, or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the privateer Holker:</hi> of which crew, they ſay, they are a part. The articles of enliſtment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on ſhore, is no bar to the juriſdiction of the admiralty. Mariners are generally engaged on ſhore, and always ſue for their wages in this court. In the one caſe the mariners are paid by monthly wages, or by the run, in the other by a ſhare of the booty taken. There is the ſame reaſon in both caſes. But I am of opinion that the articles are not the true foundation of a ſeaman's claim. If one or more mariners ſhould enter on board a veſſel, with the knowledge and conſent of the maſter, ſhould receive his orders and perform the duties of the ſtaion, they would be entitled to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary wages, or a proportion of the booty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in common with the reſt of the crew, although they had ſigned no articles at all, the right is not founded in the articles, but in the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>IT has been ſaid, that this court can only deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the queſtion <hi>prize or no prize,</hi> but cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024407_0864_0FC7305E76C9A280"/>
                        <hi>to whoſe uſe. Broom's</hi> caſe in Carth. 399 and 475, is expreſs in point to the contrary. The admiralty not only decreed <hi>lawful prize,</hi> but alſo to whoſe uſe, viz. <hi>to the King's;</hi> and Broom having converted the property to his own uſe, was ſued in the admiralty by the king's proctor for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Broom applied for a prohibition, which was denied; becauſe the court of admiralty, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the property to be prize <hi>to the king,</hi> this ſecond ſuit was deemed to be only a continuation of the original proceſs.</p>
                     <p>MOREOVER, it cannot be ſuppoſed but that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the many maritime wars in which England hath been engaged, conteſts about the rights of ſeamen to ſhares of prizes muſt have frequently occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If then ſuch claims were only triable at common law, they would doubtleſs appear in ſome of the books of reports. But no actions of this kind can be found in thoſe books, nor even prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions prayed for in ſuch caſes. The inference is, that ſuch ſuits were allowed to be excluſively of admiralty juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>IF Captain Kean had any reaſonable objections againſt the libellants, he ſhould have made thoſe objections before he received them on board, or at
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024407_0865_0FC7306132613398"/>
leaſt before the veſſel had weighed anchor and commenced her voyage.</p>
                     <p>AS the libellants were in fact forced from the ſervice, I do not ſee why this wrong, on the part of the captain, ſhould deprive them of the right they had obtained in this cruiſe by the enliſtment, and by the captain's confirmation of that enliſtment when he received them into his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>I adjudge that the libellants have and receive their reſpective ſhares of the prize Brig Gloceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and her cargo, in common with the reſt of the Holker's crew.</p>
                     <p>N. B. The reſpondents appealed from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; but the court of appeals confirmed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Claim by Charles Phile.</head>
                     <p>THE Brig Elizabeth arrived with a cargo of dry goods on the 26th of February 1781 at Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, in the river Delaware, from Cork in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: being the property of merchants of Cork, ſubjects of the king of great Britain when there was war between Great Britain and America.</p>
                     <p>CHARLES PHILE, the claimant hearing of this arrival, procured a deputation from the naval offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the port of Philadelphia, dated the 27th of February; and on the ſame day went down to Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and ſeized the veſſel under authority of his deputation, and by virtue of an act of aſſembly of this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:024407_0867_0FC73069C4F85AA8"/>IN this manner Phile poſſeſſed himſelf of the veſſel, and afterwards had her brought up to the city, ſecured her at the wharf, and placed a guard on board.</p>
                     <p>AFTER this, viz. on the 2d of March the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants entered on board this veſſel, and by virtue of an ordinance of congreſs of the 26th of December 1776, authoriſing
<q>the people of the country, or detachments from the army, to make prize of the veſſels and goods of the enemy that may happen to be taken near the ſhore,</q>—ſeized the brig and her cargo as <hi>lawful prize,</hi> and on the ſame day made report to the judge of admiralty, that they had ſo done. On the 6th they filed their libel in the regiſter's office; and on the ſame day a writ of attachment iſſued, and the marſhal of the court took poſſeſſion of her in behalf of the libellants.</p>
                     <p>AFTERWARDS, viz. on the 10th of March, Charles Phile entered his claim in this court for the veſſel and cargo, as a captor alſo, under the ſame ordinance of congreſs.</p>
                     <p>THESE tranſactions, as to the manner and time of the performance, ſtand uncontroverted by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Of the remaining teſtimony exhibited in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024407_0868_0FC7306AFB179428"/>
this cauſe, there is but one circumſtance of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, viz. when Phile made the ſeizure on the 27th of February, he was aſked by the captain of the brig, by what authority he did it? and if it was for congreſs? To which he anſwered NO, <hi>it was for the naval officer.</hi> Then ſhewing the captain his deputation, he ſaid, <hi>that was his authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>SUCH are the materials upon which this cauſe has been argued, and it is urged in behalf of the claimant, that notwithſtanding the prior date of Mr. Pringle's libel, Phile was in fact the firſt and real captor, and was in the actual poſſeſſion of the prize at the time of the ſeizure made by the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants: that although the claimant made his ſeizure by virtue of the deputation of the naval officer, and under the act of aſſembly, in which indeed he was miſtaken in point of law, becauſe the act does not touch the veſſel, but the cargo only; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo poſſeſſed, he acquired a right which could not be injured by his error in judgment, and was good againſt any fellow-ſubject: that this right is founded on two principles, viz. <hi>occupancy,</hi> in the civil, and the doctrine of <hi>remitter,</hi> in the common law.</p>
                     <p>UNDER the firſt, it is ſaid, that goods belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an enemy, being out of the protection of the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024407_0869_0FC73071F05828E0"/>
law, may be conſidered as <hi>bona vacantia,</hi> and he who can firſt get poſſeſſion acquires a right in them by <hi>occupancy;</hi> and that this doctrine is the only foundation on which the right of capture is built: and, under the ſecond, that, where a perſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains peaceable poſſeſſion of property by an inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient title, having a more ancient and better title, the law will <hi>remit</hi> him to his better title, and conſider him as holding under that in prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Both which doctrines are ſaid to apply in favour of the claimant in the preſent caſe, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he had poſſeſſion of the veſſel before the ſeizure made by the libellants and held her by <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy;</hi> and that having a good right under the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of congreſs to make prize of goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the enemy, and taken near the ſhore, although in fact he ſeized the ſame by virtue of his deputation from the naval officer, yet being ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, the law will not remit him to his better title.</p>
                     <p>ON the contrary it has been urged—That when the claimant firſt went on board this veſſel, he ſtood in a two fold capacity, as a militia man of the country, and as the deputy of the naval officer, and that the rights and powers of theſe characters are as perfectly diſtinct in law as if they exiſted in two different perſons: that when he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in which capacity he meant to act, he expreſsly declared that he made the ſeizure in behalf of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024407_0870_0FC7307406DDACD8"/>
naval officer: that when an agent ſo ſituate hath made his election, and afterwards finds himſelf in the wrong, he cannot have recourſe to his better power to confirm an act done by an inſufficient one: that Charles Phile, the preſent naval officer, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the veſſel, but Charles Phile, the militia man, who muſt, in the eye of the law, be conſidered as a different perſon, did not exerciſe the power given him by the ordinance of congreſs, and made no capture in that capacity, and therefore the veſſel remained liable to capture by any militia man who ſhould think fit to make uſe of the right veſted in him by the ordinance, notwithſtanding he might find her in the poſſeſſion of the naval officer, or of his deputy, who, as ſuch, had no power to hold her under the act of aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>THAT Phile cannot claim by <hi>occupancy</hi> more than the two men who rowed him down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and went on board with him; and that the doctrine of <hi>remitter</hi> does not apply, becauſe the ancient and better right alluded to, was not a right peculiar to the claimant, but which every militia man in the country held in as full force as himſelf, by virtue of the ordinance of congreſs. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that be that ancient right what it may, the claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant diſavowed and rejected it by his voluntary elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which throws the whole doctrine of remitter
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024407_0871_0FC730758064EBF0"/>
out of the queſtion, which is ſo purely an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of law under particular circumſtances, that the interference of the party is fatal to its effect.</p>
                     <p>THE queſtion which firſt preſents in this cauſe is—Whether the ſeizure made by the claimant, as deputy naval officer, operated as a capture of the <hi>veſſel</hi> under the ordinance of congreſs or not? It is certain, that when Phile entered on board this brig, he was poſſeſſed of two diſtinct powers. By the one, derived from the act of aſſembly, he might have made a ſeizure of the cargo only; by the other, founded in the ordinance of congreſs, he might have taken as prize, both the veſſel and cargo. In this ſituation the claimant explicitly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed and rejected his right under the ordinance, not only by words, but by unequivocal actions; and the law will not now force upon him a right ſo deliberately diſclaimed, to the excluſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther claiming under the ſame right, formally and expreſsly exerciſed.</p>
                     <p>IT is ſaid, that no advantage ought to be taken of the ignorance of the claimant on a ſudden emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. But, beſides that his procuring a deputation from the naval officer, and going four miles down the river to execute his purpoſe, cannot be called a ſudden act, his ſubſequent conduct fully evinces
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024407_0872_0FC73077011B0520"/>
a deliberate determination of the right on which he meant to depend. He made the ſeizure in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the naval officer, under the act of aſſembly, on the 27th of February, and held the property by that title, to the 10th of March following, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time no libel or information was filed by him in the admiralty office, no ſhip's papers produced, nor the veſſel put by him into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's poſſeſſion, as a prize taken from the enemy. Theſe circumſtances operate ſtrongly againſt the claimant's being conſidered as a captor under the ordinance of congreſs.</p>
                     <p>BUT further, even ſuppoſing him to have been the firſt and real captor of this veſſel and her cargo under the ordinance, there yet remains a legal obſtacle to his enjoying the prize; ſince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever right he might have acquired as a captor, he forfeited it by his ſubſequent conduct. In the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty law of this ſtate (p. 314) it is enacted,
<q>If any perſon who ſhall have charge of, or bring a prize into this port, ſhall neglect or refuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the ſame to the marſhal of the court of admiralty, and libel her within three days after her arrival, ſuch perſon ſhall forfeit all his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the ſaid prize to the uſe of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and be ſubjected to the penalties of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.
It is evident, therefore, that

                     <p>AS to the doctrines of <hi>occupancy</hi> and <hi>remitter,</hi> if they operated at all it muſt have been at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the claimant firſt entered on board this veſſel; and if ſo, why does he not libel for the cargo as well as the veſſel? But I am of opinion that no force can warp thoſe doctrines to fit the preſent caſe.</p>

                     <p>THE ſhip <hi>Reſolution,</hi> belonging to Brandlight and Sons, merchants in Amſterdam, ſailed from the Texel on the 9th of January, 1780, bound for the iſland of St. Euſtatius. This voyage was interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtreſs of weather, which obliged her to put into Liſbon, where ſhe remained ſome months to refit, but afterwards arrived at St. Euſtatius. From St. Euſtatius ſhe ſailed for the iſland of Dominica, where ſhe arrived on the 1ſt of October, 1780. In March, 1781, ſhe ſailed from Dominica for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, with a valuable cargo of ſugar and coffee,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024407_0876_0FC73083BAC9C630"/>
ſhipped by ſundry perſons, certified to be <hi>capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants in the iſland of Dominica;</hi> which cargo was conſigned to Meſſrs. Brandlight and Sons, of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, the owners of the veſſel. Soon after the commencement of her voyage from Dominica, ſhe. was captured by a Britiſh armed veſſel, and taken as prize into <hi>Nevis,</hi> where admiral Rodney exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her papers, and thereupon diſmiſſed her. She again proceeded on her voyage, but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards captured by another Britiſh veſſel, from whom ſhe was re-captured by an American priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer; from this privateer ſhe was again taken by a Britiſh ſhip, and finally retaken from her by Peter Miller, the libellant in this cauſe, and ſent into the port of Philadelphia. It is not contended but that in each and every of the captures and re-captures, ſhe remained more than 24 hours in the poſſeſſion of the conqueror. Being thus found in the hands of the enemy, and taken from them by force of arms, the libellants pray that both ſhip and cargo may be condemned as lawful prize and booty of war.</p>

                        <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                        <p>BUT it has been contended in behalf of the claimants—That it appears in teſtimony that the iſland of Dominica did on the 7th of September, 1778, ſurrender by capitulation to the marquis <hi>de
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024407_0877_0FC7308C37202AD8"/>
Bouillé,</hi> general of the French forces in the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Iſlands—that by the terms of this capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the property and eſtates in Dominica, with their produce were ſecured to the inhabitants, and protected from confiſcation; particularly by the 17th article, in theſe words—<q>The merchants of the iſland may receive veſſels to their addreſs. from all parts of the world (Engliſh veſſels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) without their being confiſcated; and they may ſell their merchandize, and may carry on their trade, and the port ſhall be entirely free for them for that purpoſe, paying the cuſtomary duties paid in the French iſlands.</q>
And it is alledged, that this privilege and protection was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to abſent perſons having property or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in the iſland, by virtue of the 9th article of the ſame capitulation in theſe words—<q>The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inhabitants, and ſuch as are in the ſervice of his Britannic majeſty, ſhall be maintained in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of their eſtates, which ſhall be managed for them by their attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</q>
That theſe United States being in ſtrict alliance with the court of France, are bound by the terms of every capitulation, convention, or treaty, which the court of France, or any perſon or perſons under that authority, ſhall make in the courſe of the war, the war being a common cauſe, and both allies principals in the conduct of it:—
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024407_0878_0FC7308E492C2500"/>
that it was alſo in proof, that the king of England, by his proclamation, dated in December; 1780, extended the effects of the capitulation of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, to Dutch veſſels for four months, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, by the capture of St. Euſtatius: and, that this ſhip, under the ſanction of the ſaid capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation which ſecured her and her cargo from capture by the French or Americans, and under the ſaid proclamation, which protected her from Britiſh capture, ſailed from Dominica, with the property of capitulants on board; and that the paſſport of monſieur <hi>Duchilleau,</hi> the French go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Dominica, endorſed on the manifeſto of the cargo, ought to protect this property from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made prize of by the friends and allies of France.</p>
                        <p>IT has been further inſiſted—That a re-captor acquires no other right than what the captor had; inferring that as the Britiſh captor could not have procured a condemnation (as appears by the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of admiral Rodney) neither can an American re-captor make this veſſel legal prize—that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh captain ſhould be conſidered as a pirate, and that the law is, that goods taken by pirates, and again retaken from them, ſhall be reſtored to the former owner—that if it ſhould be objected, that moſt of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024407_0879_0FC7308FC116ABD8"/>
the real conſignees of this cargo are not inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Dominica, and therefore not within the capitulation; it is anſwered, that article the 9th extends the operation of this capitulation to abſent inhabitants, even ſuch as are in the ſervice of the king of Great Britain having property in the iſland, whoſe buſineſs may be tranſacted by attornies; and that if the attorney is an inhabitant, and ſigned the capitulation, it is the ſame thing in effect as if the principal had done it. And, laſtly, that although no expreſs authority can be produced to prove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly that allies in war are bound by the capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conventions, and treaties of each other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally; yet a ſtriking analogy may be found in the caſe of <hi>ranſom.</hi> That it cannot be denied, but that if a French veſſel takes a prize, and <hi>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms</hi> her for a limited time, the ranſom bill would protect the property from capture and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Americans. If, therefore, the act of an individual captain of a French privateer can ſcreen the property of an enemy from an ally, much more ſhould the ſolemn capitulation of a French general with the whole inhabitants of a captured iſland bind the ſame ally.</p>
                        <p>TO this it has been replied; that the ſhip <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> and her cargo were found in the poſſeſſion of the enemy, who held the ſame by force as
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024407_0880_0FC7309660927488"/>
their property for more than 24 hours which brings the caſe ſtrictly within the ordinance of congreſs of February laſt, which excludes any claims of former owners after a poſſeſſion of 24 hours by the enemy: that we have no buſineſs to enquire by what right the enemy became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: it is ſufficient for us that we found it there: that the doctrine reſpecting pirates does not apply, becauſe the Britiſh as a ſovereign nation has an undoubted right to wage war, and to take prizes, which pirates have not: that if any ſubject of a ſovereign power takes unlawfully, let him or his prince anſwer the wrong, the re-captors at war with them being altogether blameleſs, whoſe right to take from an enemy cannot be doubted: that it appears evidently by the letters and other exhibits in this cauſe, that this cargo is in fact Britiſh property, and not the property of the inhabitants of Dominica; and although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to merchants in Amſterdam, the nett pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds were to be remitted to merchants in London, and other parts of the Britiſh dominion: that it is abſurd and untrue to ſuppoſe that the benefits of the capitulation were deſigned to extend to London merchants who had never been inhabitants of the iſland of Dominica, and who are and will remain Britiſh ſubjects, aiding, by their
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024407_0881_0FC7309802D44DE0"/>
wealth and influence, in the war againſt France and her allies: that the captulation included on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly real inhabitants, either preſent on the iſland, or abſent on buſineſs at the time, and placed them in a ſtate of perfect neutrality with reſpect to the war; a character which can by no means be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the real conſignees of this cargo: that if the effects of this capitulation were to be thus extended, France would have obtained a conqueſt which can produce nothing but expence, trouble, and loſs to her, but will tend to ſtrengthen and enrich the enemy; and that it would be for the preſent, the intereſt of Great Britain to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all her Weſt-India iſlands upon the ſame terms.</p>
                        <p>IT has been further urged by the counſel for the libellants, that allies are not mutually bound by every <hi>ex parte</hi> treaty or convention: that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is neceſſary to include one in the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by the other; as for inſtance, in a truce or ceſſation of hoſtilities: that France does not deem herſelf ſo bound, is evident from her conduct with reſpect to Bermuda and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hama iſlands, whoſe property congreſs have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from capture and condemnation by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans; yet their veſſels are confiſcated in the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:024407_0882_0FC730997B953838"/>
French courts of admiralty: and that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, granted by congreſs to Bermudians, runs ſtrictly parallel with the terms granted by the French general to the people of Dominica, ſo far as allies in war were to be affected by ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>THAT the law reſpecting <hi>ranſoms</hi> cannot apply to the preſent caſe, becauſe, if, after our ally has made a capture, and diſcharged the prize on a, promiſed ranſom, we ſhould violate the ranſom bill, we ſhould in fact plunder our friend of his actually acquired property; and it is for this reaſon that allies are bound by ranſom bills: that this caſe coming preciſely within the ordinance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs reſpecting 24 hours poſſeſſion by the enemy, this court is bound to decree according to that ordinance, and hath no power to judge how far its operation may, or may not, under particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances, affect the terms of our ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with France, the true limits of which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be aſcertained by the ſovereignty of the ſtates, and are not ſubmitted to the determination this court.</p>
                        <p>THAT, as to the paſſport ſubſcribed by mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Du Challeau,</hi> he did it as a matter of courſe in
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024407_0883_0FC7309B01294D60"/>
conſequence of the depoſitions annexed to the bills of lading, which were taken by the Britiſh judge of the iſland, and who might probably be in the intereſt of the parties; or, at leaſt, that it was done with the official negligence too uſual in paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuſtom-houſe papers. It was further ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the manifeſt variance between the bills of lading, with their depoſitions annexed, and the private letters of advice found on board; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect fraud manifeſt in ſome of thoſe letters, and the myſterious complexion of others, are alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify a condemnation of this property; double papers and fraudulent clearances being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal cauſe of confiſcation.</p>
                        <p>IN ſhort, that this whole buſineſs appears to be a mercantile ſcheme concerted between Britiſh merchants and Brandlight and Sons, of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, in conjunction with the ſhippers at Dominica, to impoſe on the French governor, and to derive an unfair advantage from the liberal terms of the capitulation: that, if this property is to be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>neutral,</hi> the true doctrine is, if a neutral volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily puts his property on board an enemy's ſhip, he does it at his own riſk; but if an enemy unjuſtly takes neutral property, and the ſame is retaken, the remedy is againſt the enemy who did the wrong, and not againſt the recaptor who only did
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024407_0884_0FC730A36AEEA960"/>
his duty: that it is true, that the paſſport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Duchalleau,</hi> recommends this veſſel to paſs unmoleſted by the friends of France, but does not ſay ſhe ſhall not be taken from the enemy in caſe ſhe ſhould fall into their hands: that if the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Dominica, in their preſent ſituation, be conſidered either as French or as Britiſh ſubjects, ſtill the recapture is good; if French, then the property (ſuppoſing it to belong to the ſhippers) having been more than twenty four hours in the poſſeſſion of the enemy, is prize to the recaptor by the marine ordinances of France and America; if Britiſh, it belonged to the enemy, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prize. And laſtly, that this capitulation ſhould not be conſtrued to extend further than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of property upon the iſland, and within its ports and harbours, but cannot reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to inſure ſafety on the high ſeas in the midſt of a raging war.</p>

                        <p>THIS cauſe, ſo far as it reſpects the cargo of the ſhip <hi>Reſolution,</hi> reſts principally on one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, viz. whether the United States by their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with France, are, or are not to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as parties in the capitulation made by the Marquis De Bouillé with the inhabitants of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica.

                           </gap>lies are mutually bound in all caſes. It is manifeſt, that it is not generally ſo underſtood; becauſe it is uſual in forming treaties of alliance to inſert ſpecial clauſes ſpecifying thoſe caſes, wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and engagements of the one ſhall bind the other: for it would be a very dangerous doctrine that ſhould bind ſovereign powers in engagements to which they had neither expreſsly or implicitly given conſent, or that one ally ſhould neceſſarily become a party in the conventions which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and officers of the other may, under particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtraits and circumſtances, make with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, unleſs the ally be mentioned in the convention, and the terms thereof be afterwards acceded to by him. Thus, in the caſe of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, had governor Stuart, when he ſurrendered the iſland to the marquis de Bouillé expected that the United States ſhould be bound by the terms of the capitulation, he would have made this one of the articles, and not entruſted ſo important a point to a ſpeculative queſtion, how far one ally may or may not be virtually bound by the engagements of the other. This, however, he has not done, either becauſe it would imply an acknowledgment of the ſovereignty of the United States, or becauſe he deemed the objects of the capitulation to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024407_0886_0FC730A680196018"/>
to property within the iſland. Be this as it may, the Britiſh could not reaſonably complain that the French had violated the articles of the capitulation ſhould the Americans take the goods of the inhabitants of Dominica found upon the high ſeas, becauſe ſuch an aſſurance made no part of the ſtipulation.
<q>If he who can and ought to have explained himſelf clearly and plainly, has not done it, it is the worſe for him; he cannot be allowed to introduce ſubſequent reſtrictions which he has not expreſſed.</q>
Vattel, B. 2. ch. 17. ſec. 174.</p>
                        <p>BUT whatever doubts there may be of the right of Americans to take the property of the people of Dominica under the preſent circumſtances, there can be none of taking Britiſh property, wherever found, without any danger of impairing the friendſhip of our good ally. And from a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the papers found on board this veſſel, there is ſtrong reaſon to believe that this cargo, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver artificially covered, is, in fact, Britiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                        <p>AS to the general doctrine reſpecting allies, the caſe of Bermudas is, I think, ſtrong in point. The veſſels of that iſland were by congreſs exempted from capture by Americans, and yet the French
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024407_0887_0FC730AC82DBE730"/>
made prize of them whenever they could; nor was it ever ſuggeſted, that they had thereby violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the faith of the alliance. Had the Britiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or France deſired, that the United States ſhould be parties in the capitulation of Dominica, it cannot be doubted, but that this would have been made one of the terms of that capitulation, or tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> France would, e'er this, have ſignified her deſire to congreſs, and that congreſs would have inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the maſters of privateers as to this matter.</p>
                        <p>HAVING made no national agreement to ſpare the property of the people of Dominica, when found on the high ſeas, much leſs are we bound to reſcue it from the hands of an enemy at our riſk and expence, in order to reſtore it, ſalvage free, to their uſe. This would be to put them on a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter footing than our own merchants, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, after 24 hours poſſeſſion by the enemy, would be confiſcated to the re-captor, whereas it is contended that no confiſcation whatever ſhould paſs on the property of the people of Dominica.</p>
                        <p>BEING fully ſatisfied as to this general point, it renders a minute diſplay of the ſtriking contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the bills of lading and letters of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and other papers found on board this veſſel, the leſs neceſſary. Many of them are manifeſtly
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024407_0888_0FC730AE6FE94DF8"/>
fraudulent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and although the property is carefully wrapped in neutral covers, the nett proceeds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be finally intended for ſubjects of Great Britain, reſiding at London or elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>WITH reſpect to the king of England's procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I conceive that it is founded on partial, not on general grounds. Were it not that this, with four or five other Dutch veſſels were at this time to ſail from Dominica, freighted with the property of Britiſh merchants, it is more than probable that this proclamation had never been publiſhed.</p>
                        <p>I adjudge that the cargo of the ſhip Reſolution be condemned as lawful prize to the libellants; and that the ſhip Reſolution, with her tackle, apparel and furniture be reſtored to Brandlight and Sons, merchants of Amſterdam.</p>
                        <p>N. B. The claimants appealed from this decree; and, after long argument, the judges of appeal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the decree, ſo far as the ſame reſpected the condemnation of the cargo, which they fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, upon the ſhippers paying freight to the owners of the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>THERE was afterwards a re-hearing of this cauſe before the court of appeal, on a ſuggeſtion
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:024407_0889_0FC730B174C1DC00"/>
of new teſtimony having been found amongſt ſome papers taken in a ſhip (the Erſten) bound from Oſtend to Dominica: but the court adhered to their judgment; except only as to ſome part of the cargo, which was condemned on account of irregularities in the bills of lading, and letters of advice, reſpecting thoſe particular articles.</p>

Both veſſels belonged to the ſame owners (one perſon excepted, who had a ſhare in the ſloop, but was not concerned in the ſhip.) The ſhip was bound on a cruiſe, as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer, and the ſloop on a trading voyage. Whilſt
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:024407_0890_0FC730B2406A3B50"/>
theſe veſſels were yet in company, they diſcovered the brig <hi>Triſtram Shandy,</hi> a veſſel belonging to the enemy, and got to windward of her. The ſhip then bore down upon, and took the prize; but the ſloop, without changing her courſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on her voyage.

                     <p>AGAINST this claim it has been urged, that the ſloop ought to have no ſhare in this prize, becauſe it is in teſtimony, that ſhe not only did nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the capture, but, in fact, avoided it, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering her courſe, or manifeſting the leaſt intention to be conſidered as a joint captor; inſiſting, that an intention to poſſeſs is requiſite to the acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of property—that although by the rule of law, it is not neceſſary to enquire how far a veſſel in ſight, did or did not contribute to the capture of a prize, yet ſome attempt, ſome inclination, to take, ought to appear, otherwiſe the law will not force property on thoſe who voluntarily abandon it; and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024407_0891_0FC730B3BA260450"/>
the caſe of <hi>Rice</hi> verſus <hi>Taylor</hi> was particularly referred to, and relied upon. (Vide p. 16.)</p>
                     <p>ARBITRARY rules and preſumptions of law are eſtabliſhed in profound wiſdom, and are the reſult of much experience. Paſſing by the uncertain equity of certain caſes, they look only to general juſtice. All that is neceſſary in the application of them is to aſcertain whether the caſe comes within the rule or not. If it does, the rule ought not to be violated, nor ſhould any evidence be admitted to defeat its operation; becauſe the law, delighting in certainty, will not ſuffer an inveſtigation which can occaſion contradictory teſtimony, perjury, and endleſs litigation.</p>
                     <p>IN the caſe of <hi>Rice</hi> verſus <hi>Taylor,</hi> the <hi>jury found</hi> that the claimant's veſſel did not, by her preſence, contribute to the ſurrender of the prize; her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation rendering it in fact impoſſible; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the claim was diſmiſſed, the caſe not coming within the verge of the legal preſumption. But no ſuch impoſſibility appears in the preſent caſe. Had the enemy been a match for the ſhip, or made an obſtinate reſiſtance, the ſloop was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently near, and in a capacity to join her force. But as the prize was not able to maintain a conteſt with the ſhip, it is to be preſumed that the ſloop's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024407_0892_0FC730BC74D26660"/>
her courſe, was not an abandonment of any ſhare or concern in the prize, but becauſe that ſhe ſaw that her aſſiſtance was altogether unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>THE ſuppoſed want of an intention to take, is not ſufficient to exclude the claimants from a ſhare of the prize. The claim filed in this cauſe is proof of at leaſt an intention to poſſeſs whatever the law may award. And although it has been ſuggeſted, that this ſuit is in fact brought by one of the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the name of the captain and crew of the ſloop Jane, who are abſent, and had no intention of making ſuch claim, yet the court will not allow the diſtinction, but conſider captain Young and his mariners as proſecuting their ſuit by their proctor.</p>
                     <p>NEITHER is there any reaſon why the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſloop's being under the convoy of the ſhip, ſhould affect the right of the claimants. The aſſiſtance which one veſſel may give another in battle is the reaſon of the law, and this reaſon is as applicable to veſſels under convoy as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whenever two veſſels of the ſame nation are in company, they are under reciprocal protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mutually bound to aſſiſt each other: but when a veſſel of ſuperior force ſails out of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended courſe, or is purpoſely ſent for the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, the owners of the latter ſhould make
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024407_0893_0FC730BD7B291C70"/>
recompence for the ſervice; but this will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the protected veſſel from thoſe rights which her force, ſmall as it may be, may entitle her to, and which the general rule of law aſſigns without diſtinction.</p>

                     <p>HAVING entered as a landſman on board the privateer <hi>Riſing Sun,</hi> and ſigned articles for a cruiſe of four months: the privateer was ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and the libellant was ſent in with one of her prizes, and ſoon afterwards fell ſick. During the cruiſe the <hi>Riſing Sun</hi> came into port to refit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Philadelphia, a great part of the crew left
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024407_0895_0FC730C08093D3C0"/>
her; whereupon the captain (or owners) publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an advertiſement, calling upon the officers, ſeamen, and mariners, belonging to the <hi>Riſing Sun,</hi> to repair on board by a certain day, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to complete the cruiſe. One third of the crew, however, neglecting to appear, the owners and officers agreed to break up the cruiſe, opened a new rendezvous, and enliſted a crew under a new ſet of articles. The ſhip ſailed on this ſecond cruiſe, the four months of the firſt having not yet expired. Soon after her laſt ſailing ſhe captured the Triſtiam Shandy, and the Dimſdale, both which were condemned as prize. It appeared in teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, that the Triſtiam Shandy was taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expiration of the firſt cruiſe, and the Dimſdale ſome days after. The libellant did not appear on the day advertiſed, neither did he ſign the ſecond ſet of articles, being ſick at the time.</p>
                     <p>AS this cauſe touches a general doctrine, viz. how far owners are juſtifiable in breaking up a cruiſe, without the conſent of all concerned, it wears a face of conſiderable importance. I have attended to it in this view, and am of opinion, that ſhipping articles form a contract between the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on the one part, and the officers and crew on the other, and are for the period ſpecified, in
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024407_0896_0FC730C8EA15ED00"/>
full force with reſpect to the contracting parties. And this contract is not made with the officers and crew as an aggregate body, but with each mariner individually. Upon this ground, I think the contract cannot be totally diſſolved (as hath been contended) by the will of any majority on either ſide, however great. If a ſingle mariner withholds his conſent, and the cruiſe is broke up by the reſt of the concerned, and a new cruiſe commenced, as in the preſent caſe, this muſt be done, ſubject to the legal claim of the unconſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mariner, of wages or prize money that may accrue during the term of the firſt cruiſe for which he contracted. If it were otherwiſe, if owners could for their own convenience, or from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent or real neceſſity, break up a cruiſe, thoſe of the crew who may be languiſhing in captivity, or may be confined on ſhore by wounds or ſickneſs incurred in the ſervice of the ſhip, or otherwiſe, might be excluded from the advantages of a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of time for which they had engaged to run all hazards, and of which they may as yet have only experienced the misfortunes.</p>

                     <p>JACOB Miller, and others, had formed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact to purchaſe a veſſel, load her with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, naval ſtores, &amp;c. and then clear her out from the port of Philadelphia, as for ſome legal voyage; but, in fact, to take her into New York, for the ſupply of the enemy. The Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was purchaſed for this purpoſe. But, before the ſcheme was ripe for execution, one Hollingſhead, who was to have been ſailing maſter for the voyage, divulged the ſecret. In conſequence of which the libellant ſeized the veſſel at the wharf where ſhe had lain previous to the time when Miller purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her for the purpoſe aforeſaid. One Riggens, who was alſo privy to the plan, confirmed the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Hollingſhead, as to the general ſcheme.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:024407_0898_0FC730CBC3D20ED0"/>
At the time of the ſeizure, the brig had taken in only twenty barrels of Tar, and had not yet ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her mariners.</p>
                     <p>THE teſtimony in this cauſe amounts to no more than a treaſonable intent. Had this veſſel received her cargo on board, ſhipped her mariners, and hawled off from the warf, the intent would then have been ſo far carried into execution, as that the veſſel and cargo might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, and the parties puniſhed under the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of congreſs. As the caſe ſtands, the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might have changed their minds as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſign, or they might have thought ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veſſel more ſuitable to the purpoſe. To bring the matter properly before this court, the identical veſſel employed in an illegal deſign muſt be taken in the fact, for the admiralty cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate one veſſel for the fault of another although belonging to the ſame owners. A veſſel cannot be ſaid to be taken in purſuit of an illegal voyage whilſt ſhe remains faſt at a wharf, without a cargo on board, and without mariners.</p>

                     <p>THE brig <hi>Suſannah,</hi> belonging to George Gibbs, cleared out from the naval office in the port of Rhode Iſland, and ſailed with a cargo on board, as for Hiſpaniola, but in fact for Turk's Iſlands. Being on her voyage ſhe was diſcovered, purſued, and captured by Joſiah Crane, maſter of the brigantine <hi>Two Friends,</hi> belonging to ſubjects of the United Netherlands, and furniſhed with letters of marque and repriſal againſt the ſubjects of the king of Great Britain. Holland had not at this time entered into any treaty with, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the independence of, the United States of America. Captain Crane took out part of the crew of the Savannah, and put a prize maſter on board, and ordered her for Philadelphia; but the Suſannah was again captured during her voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:024407_0901_0FC72CC0C73C8230"/>
to Philadelphia by a Britiſh privateer, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to New York, and there condemned. The <hi>Two Friends</hi> arrived at Philadelphia, where Gibbs the owner of the Suſannah libelled againſt her, and againſt captain Crane for reparation of the loſs and damage ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>IN conſidering this caſe, two obvious points preſent, viz.</p>
                     <p>FIRST. Hath the brig Suſannah ſo offended by her intended voyage to Turk's Iſlands as to afford probable cauſe of capture and confiſcation?</p>
                     <p>SECONDLY. If not, who ought to ſatisfy the owner for the loſs of his veſſel and cargo?</p>
                     <p>ON the firſt point the queſtion occurs, whether Turk's Iſlands, may, or may not, be conſidered as property under the dominion of Great Britain? Whatever might have been the ſituation of theſe iſlands in the years 1778 and 1779, it is evident that at preſent they are abandoned by every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there having been no officer who hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed civil or military powers there under the authority of any government whatever for at leaſt theſe two years paſt. If the Britiſh ever had legal dominion over theſe iſlands, they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024407_0902_0FC72CCAA9DF5088"/>
their right, and releaſed the inhabitants from all allegiance by withdrawing all protection. So that thoſe people may truly be ſaid to be in a ſtate of nature, unleſs they have formed ſome government of their own. What offence then can ariſe from trading with thoſe iſlands? It is plain, from the clearances and entries in our own naval offices, that this trade hath not been deemed unlawful: and it is alſo in evidence, that American, French, and Spaniſh veſſels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly go to theſe iſlands for ſalt, and no body hath heretofore queſtioned the legality of this commerce.</p>
                     <p>BUT is ſaid, that the variance between the office clearance and an invoice found on board, marking the real deſtination of the voyage, affords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cauſe of capture, and even a ſufficient ground for confiſcation. I find, however, that it is not an unuſual practice for merchants to clear out as for one legal port, but with a deſign of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome other legal port, in order to conceal the real voyage, for mercantile purpoſes. Nor hath this practice ever been deemed an offence, or the papers found on board a veſſel under ſuch circumſtances been conſidered as double pape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb facs="unknown:024407_0903_0FC72CCC07181210"/>THE next queſtion is, Who ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the injury done? the captain, or his owners, or both?</p>
                     <p>THE relation between the owners and maſter of a veſſel hath, to many purpoſes, been conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as that of maſter and ſervant; and the law is clear, that the maſter is bound by whatever the ſervant doth by his order, under his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or in the proſecution of his ſervice.

It has been contended, however, that captain Crane was not in the proſecution of his owners ſervice when he made this capture, the object of the voyage being merely mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and not to take prizes. But as this veſſel was duly commiſſioned to take prizes, and the owners and captain would have ſhared the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of a legal capture, this diſtinction cannot be admitted, but the owners and captain muſt be conſidered as jointly anſwerable.</p>

                     <p>A Plea to the juriſdiction of the court was filed in this cauſe: and the queſtion was, Whether a <hi>Ship-Wright</hi> might ſue in the admiralty for his contract wages for building a ſhip or veſſel deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for navigation on the high ſeas?</p>
                     <p>AFTER long argument, the judge gave his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as follows.</p>
                     <p>THE authorities which the libellants have ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in favour of the juriſdiction of this court, in the preſent caſe, are Cro. Ch. 296. and 1ſt Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le 533. All the other authorities adduced having reference to thoſe, except one in 1 Stra. 707.</p>
                     <p>IN the firſt edition of Cro. cha. page 296, we find reſolutions upon caſes of admiralty juriſdiction
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024407_0905_0FC72CCF4B380A30"/>
ſubſcribed by all the judges of both benches, in April, 1632. Wherein, amongſt other things, it is reſolved, that a ſhip-wright may ſue in the admiralty, provided his ſuit be againſt the ſhip. <hi>Rolle,</hi> as a faithful abridger, gives the law as it then ſtood under the authority of theſe reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In article 19, he mentions the doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſhip-wrights, and cites the cafe of <hi>Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and <hi>Gale.</hi> And in article 21, he gives the law reſpecting charter parties, adding theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable words:
<q>As it was declared by the court to have been lately reſolved by all the judges of England.</q>
So that thoſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeem to be the only foundation upon which theſe doctrines reſt. And it is very obſervable, that although <hi>Croke</hi> records the reſolutions as they were ſubſcribed in Hillary term, the eighth of Charles, yet he does not report the caſe of <hi>Taſker</hi> verſus <hi>Gale,</hi> although adjudged (according to <hi>Rolle</hi>) in the ninth of Charles, which muſt have been but a few months after. Neither hath any other reporter of that period noticed this caſe. From which it ſeems probable, that thoſe reſolutions, and the judgment in the caſe of Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker verſus Gale, were not admitted as good law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="unknown:024407_0906_0FC72CD9623F6520"/>BUT it is further obſervable, that when <hi>Sir Harbottle Grimeſtone</hi> publiſhed Croke's reports in the year 1657, he prefixed, even to this firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a declaration under the title <hi>Mantiſſa,</hi> that the reſolutions of the judges in Feb. 1632, were not of authority: and for this reaſon (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Comyns) thoſe reſolutions were totally omitted in the ſubſequent editions of that work. Since that time no inſtance can be found in the books, where either theſe reſolutions, or the caſe of Taſker verſus Gale adjudged thereupon, have been referred to either by the court, or in the pleadings in any adjudged caſe, except in the caſe of Wooward verſus Bonithan, Sir. T. Raymond. p. 3: and there the court declared, that thoſe reſolutions had been denied by ſeveral judges, and renounced by even ſome of thoſe who had ſubſcribed them. And of this, <hi>Danvers</hi> alſo takes particular notice, p. 271. Therefore the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe reſolutions ſeems to have been aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by general conſent.</p>
                     <p>BUT another caſe has been referred to as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in point, viz. 1ſt Stra. 707. The report is very ſhort, and in theſe words:
<q>On a motion for a prohibition, it was held, that a <hi>carpenter</hi> may ſue for wages in the admiralty.</q>
This report, however, is too ſlight and ſolitary to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024407_0907_0FC72CDC021B4A98"/>
a deciſion contrary to general eſtabliſhed rules. The word <hi>carpenter</hi> doth not preciſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a ſhip-wright, but may be applicable to a mariner on board a veſſel; and as the caſes refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to in the margin of this report, reſpecting the officers of a ſhip who ſued in the admiralty as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, the probability is, that this alſo was an officer called the <hi>ſhip's-carpenter</hi>: A doubt having ariſen whether the ſubordinate officers of a ſhip, as well as the maſter, were not prohibited from ſuing in the admiralty for wages.</p>
                     <p>IF the reſolutions of the judges in 1632, and the deciſion in the caſe of Taſker verſus Gale, were admitted as law, and if the carpenter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in 1ſt Stra. 707, was the ſhip-wright or builder, how is it poſſible that the judges ſo lately as the 1765, ſhould declare in court, that no inſtance could be found where both the contract and ſervice were to be done on land, within the body of a country, that the common law courts ever permitted the admiralty to have juriſdiction?

                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:024407_0908_0FC72CE477BB3E10"/>THERE are ſeveral exceptions to the general rules of law reſpecting admiralty juriſdiction, as aſcertained by the ſtatutes: ſuch as ſuits for mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wages, and on hypothecations made by the maſter in foreign parts, &amp;c. &amp;c. which have been ſo often conteſted, and ſo often allowed, for good and weighty reaſons, that they have become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed law, and it would be in vain now to oppoſe the general rule to the general practice. But this does not appear to the caſe with reſpect to ſhip-wrights; neither are the ſame reaſons appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to them. Their contract is made with perſons whom they know, or ought to know; their ſervices are all executed within the body of the county, and moſtly on dry land above high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water mark; their wages have no reference to a voyage performed, or to be performed; the ſhip-wrights have no intereſt or concern what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the veſſel after ſhe is on float, and the merchant hath paid for her; and laſtly, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of former times doth not juſtify the admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's taking cognizance of their ſuits.</p>

She was taken in Cheſapeak bay by ſome of the enemy's boats, called refugee boats, and ſent under the command of a prize-maſter to New York. In her way to New York, ſhe was re-captured by the libellant, and ſent into this port, having been ſeveral days in the poſſeſſion of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>ON the trial, one of the owners of the cargo appeared, and urged the tenor of an ordinance of congreſs, paſſed the 26th of February, 1782, in his favour, reſpecting the veſſels and cargoes of ſubjects of the United States, going from one port to another, and taken within any arm of the ſea, &amp;c. laden with the produce of the country, and afterwards retaken by a fellow ſubject: ordaining, that the ſame ſhall be reſtored to the firſt owner, on payment of reaſonable ſalvage, not exceeding one fourth of the value, without any regard to the time of poſſeſſion by the enemy.

plea. (Vide p. 55.) In the caſe of the <hi>Gloceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the council for the reſpondent did not minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveſtigate the facts: but admitting the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as produced on the part of the libellants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the force uſed, reſted the defence ſolely on points of law. The facts were now more ſtrictly ſcrutinized, and new teſtimony adduced, amongſt which the reſpondent preſented the depoſition of Silas Foſter, one of the Holker's crew: but it was objected, that Foſter was an intereſted wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that his teſtimony ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. After full argument thereupon, the judge decided this point, as follows:</p>
                     <p>THE queſtion under conſideration, reſpects the competency of a witneſs produced by the reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this cauſe. On the one ſide, a general principle of law hath been urged, viz. that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intereſted in the event of a cauſe, ſhall not be allowed to give teſtimony in that cauſe: and, on the other, an exception to this general rule, viz. that if no further or better evidence can be had, an intereſted party may and ought to be heard, from the neceſſity of the caſe, his intereſt only affecting his credibility, not his competency. And the danger of an unhappy precedent in the rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or admiſſion of the witneſs now offered, hath been ſufficiently enlarged upon on both ſides. But
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024407_0913_0FC72CF56C5238D0"/>
I cannot ſee the danger apprehended, ſince the determination in the preſent caſe, can be no rule for any other, unleſs the circumſtances of both ſhould be preciſely ſimilar; becauſe, the court will always take into conſideration the degree and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the intereſt, that ſhould exclude a witneſs under the general rule, and the reality of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to admit him under the exception, and alſo judge of the credibility, according to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. To this purpoſe I refer to laws of <hi>niſi prius,</hi> p. 286.
<q>Scroggs, ch. juſ. ſaid, that it ought not to be a general rule, that members of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhall be admitted or denied to be witneſſes, in caſes for or againſt their corporations: but every caſe ſtands upon its own particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, viz. whether the intereſt be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as by preſumption to produce partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or not. And this exception has of late years been much extended. In the caſe of the <hi>King</hi> verſus <hi>Bray,</hi> lord chief juſtice Hardwicke <note n="*" place="bottom">Hardwicke, p. 360.</note> ſaid, that unleſs the objections appeared to him to carry a ſtrong danger of perjury, and ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent advantage might accrue to the witneſs, he was inclined to let it go to his credit only, in order to let in a proper light to the caſe, which would otherwiſe be ſhut out.</q>

                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:024407_0914_0FC72CFD7ADC11C8"/>IN order, therefore, to decide on the competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the preſent witneſs, it will be neceſſary to take a view of the circumſtances of the caſe, ſo far as they reſpect him, or his intereſt, in the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>THE ſhip Lady Margaret, was, by a decree of this court, condemned as prize to the captors. The marſhal, after making ſale of the property, advertiſed as uſual for all perſons who had any claim thereupon, to appear in perſon, or by agent, and receive their reſpective ſhares. <hi>Foſter's</hi> agent accordingly appeared, and received his ſhare, which was afterwards paid over to him, as appears by his receipt to the ſaid agent. The preſent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellants iſſued no prohibition to the marſhal, to ſtay his proceedings, nor intimated any deſign of claiming ſhares in this prize. The marſhal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, went on and completed his buſineſs, with reſpect to this veſſel and her cargo, and filed his accounts and returns, dated Feb. 1781, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter's office; by which accounts it appears, that full diſtribution had been made. The preſent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellants having recovered in the caſe of the brig Gloceſter, a prize taken by the ſame privateer, and in the ſame cruiſe in which the Lady Margaret was captured, now claim ſhares in the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet alſo, upon the principles of the former deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their favour. The captain of the privateer
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024407_0915_0FC72D020259F590"/>
hath filed his anſwer in oppoſition to this claim, and offers <hi>Foſter</hi> as witneſs in his behalf: but it is alledged that <hi>Foſter</hi> may have an intereſt in the event of this cauſe, upon a ſuggeſtion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the marſhal hath in his returns, fully ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced his accounts reſpecting the Lady Margaret, yet he hath done it wrongfully, by charging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and illegal commiſſions, as appears upon the very face of his returns. So that there is in fact a part of that prize yet in his hands, a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhare of which <hi>Foſter</hi> will be entitled to, if the libellants ſhould fail in their ſuit, he being one of the captors of that prize.</p>
                     <p>IT ſeems then, that <hi>Foſter</hi>'s intereſt depends upon two contingencies —Firſt, that the libellants ſhall fail in their preſent claim: and, ſecondly, that the marſhal ſhall not be able to juſtify the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions he hath charged.</p>
                     <p>IF this intereſt depended upon the firſt contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency only, it might be deemed too cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the event of this cauſe, to admit him as a witneſs of full credibility: but when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſecond contingency is conſidered, viz. that it is now full two years ſince the marſhal made his returns, and that neither Foſter, nor any of the concerned, have objected to the commiſſions charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024407_0916_0FC72D02C916B0D0"/>
or manifeſted any expectations of receiving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantages from the Lady Margaret, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, if any, ſeems to be ſo very remote, as not to <hi>found any reaſonable preſumption that it will produce partiality, or to carry a ſtrong danger of perjury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE uſe of teſtimony, is to aſcertain truth, that juſtice may be adminiſtered. Therefore, witneſſes ought not to be rejected on ſlight grounds of diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or on mere ſuggeſtion of a diſtant intereſt, eſpecially in maritime ſuits, where from the ſcene of tranſaction, a totally diſintereſted teſtimony can ſeldom be procured. But the court will always make allowance in the credit, according to the circumſtances.</p>

                        <p>IN order to determine this cauſe to my own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I find i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> neceſſary to ſtate and conſider three points, which will, I apprehend, include all the principles that can affect this controverſy.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>firſt</hi> queſtion is, Whether thoſe who ſign-the <hi>Holker's</hi> articles, after notice given that her
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024407_0917_0FC72D0444DAA530"/>
compliment of men was full, and that no more could be received on board, and who did not go the cruiſe, although their not going ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a forcible rejection, ought to draw ſhares of all, or any of the prizes taken in that cruiſe?</p>
                        <p>It appears by the depoſition of Henry Martin, the keeper of the houſe of rendezvous, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Fletcher, one of the Holker's officers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed many who applied that they could not be admitted, becauſe the privateer's compliment of men was complete, and that they would be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſhore if they came on board, yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to ſign the articles, and even took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the officer's turning his back to ſign thoſe articles without his knowledge, ſaying, they would run their chance. If any of the libellants ſhould be found in this predicament, I ſhall not heſitate to diſmiſs their claim. Becauſe no man ought to have an engagement forced upon him: mutual conſent, expreſſed or implied, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to every contract.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> queſtion is, Whether thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly ſigned the articles, or were duly enliſted by parole-agreement before the veſſel's crew was complete, and againſt whom no breach of duty is
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024407_0918_0FC72D0ADFFE3750"/>
alledged, but were turned on ſhore againſt their will, and did not go the cruiſe, ſhould have ſhares of the prize taken in that cruiſe.</p>
                        <p>BUT this point hath been ſo fully eſtabliſhed in favour of the libellants, in this court and in the court of appeals, that it cannot be controverted now. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide page 55.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE <hi>third</hi> queſtion is, Whether parties under the circumſtances laſt mentioned, being preſent, and ſuffering the marſhal to ſell and diſtribute af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter public notice given, any prize or prizes in which they might have claimed an intereſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out filing their claim, or giving any notice to the marſhal that they intend ſo to do, ought not to be deemed ſuch a wilful neglect, either againſt the marſhal, for not having reſerved their ſhares, or againſt the captain, for omitting their names in the return of his crew?</p>
                        <p>IN clearing up this point, it may be allowed, that ſo long as property remains in the marſhal's hands, ſubject to the diſpoſal of the court, no length of time ſhould bar a legal claimant from recovering his right.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="114" facs="unknown:024407_0919_0FC72D0E68066A08"/>THE practice is, for the marſhal, after he has made ſale of a prize, to advertiſe in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic papers for all perſons having any claim there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to appear by a certain day and receive their diſtributive ſhares. If, after that day, he ſhould find any perſon's names in the liſt of the crew han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him who have not appeared in perſon, or by agent, he makes report thereof to the judge, who, by virtue of a law of this ſtate, will appoint an agent for ſuch abſent perſons. After which diſtribution is made and the accounts cloſed, and lodged in the regiſter's office.</p>
                        <p>NOW, if any ſhould think themſelves injured by the return of the crew, inaſmuch as their names have been omitted, and yet ſhall ſtand by and ſee the whole of the property diſtributed, without applying to the court or marſhal for their ſhares, or giving any legal notice of their intention to make ſuch a claim, it ſeems to be a reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that they have voluntarily abandoned their right. In the preſent caſe it is remarkable, that theſe very libellants brought their ſuit two years ago for ſhares in the Gloceſter, and recovered, and yet from that time to the preſent they inſtituted no claim for ſhares in the Lady Margaret, although this prize was, with reſpect to them, in the ſame predicament with the Gloceſter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="115" facs="unknown:024407_0920_0FC72D0FAEC18350"/>IT is very true there is no ſtatute of limitations in the admiralty, but all things muſt be limited by right reaſon. A ſtrong argument <hi>ab inconvenienti</hi> may ſupply the place and have the force of a ſtatute. For, if there are indeed no limits, how long ſhall the marſhal wait for claimants to come in before he ſhall proceed to diſtribution? Or if, after thoſe who are legally entitled have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their reſpective ſhares, they are to be for ever liable to be called upon to refund, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of future latent claims, when ſhall they preſume that what they have got is really their own? But no reaſonable apology can be made for thoſe who have knowingly ſuffered diſtribution to be made without making their claim.</p>
                        <p>BUT it hath been ſuggeſted, and is indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the view of the court, that ſome part of the monies ariſing from the ſales of the Lady Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret and her cargo, may yet be in the hands of the late marſhal. If ſo, I have no doubt but that ſuch of the libellants, as fall within the deſcription of the <hi>ſecond</hi> point or queſtion above ſtated, are entitled to their reſpective diſtributive ſhares thereof.</p>
                        <p>BY theſe principles I have examined the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the libellants reſpectively, which I have
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024407_0921_0FC72D1286336ED0"/>
carefully aſcertained by the articles of enliſtment, and the depoſitions exhibited. And I find, that Charles Marmet, Thomas Aſhton, Patrick Kean, James Hamilton, Patrick M'Daniel, John Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, James Galloway, Patrick Mahoon, Peter Sherkes, William Cole, Edward Geiner, Enas M'Comer, Edward Crow, George Brand, James Murray, Benjamin Lewis, Philip Jordan, John Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Felix Hughes, are juſtly entitled. And thereupon I adjudge and decree, that they have and receive a landſman's ſhare each from Matthew Clarkſon, late marſhal, of the monies that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his hands, from the ſales of the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet and her cargo, or proportionable dividends thereof, in caſe there ſhould not be ſufficient to ſatisfy the whole.</p>
                        <p>AND further I adjudge, that the bill in this cauſe, ſo far as hath reſpect to the claims of James Barney, George Stanton Richard Fair, Charles Keaſley, Joſeph Ditz, and Daniel M'Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, be diſmiſſed.</p>
                        <p>AND laſtly, I adjudge that the libellants pay the coſts of this ſuit.</p>

The ſhip was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long at Bourdeaux and whilſt ſhe was there, peace took place. The libellant performed the voyage, but was refuſed the wages on account of the peace, on a ſuggeſtion that the riſk, which was the occaſion of the high wages being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the libellant ought to have only cuſtomary peace wages from Bourdeaux to Philadelphia.</p>

                     <p>THE libellants entered on board the <hi>Nancy</hi> in January, 1783, and ſigned articles, acccording to cuſtom, for a certain voyage to L'Orient, and back again to the port of Philadelphia. <hi>Brice</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſerve in the capacity of firſt lieutenant, and <hi>Woodroff,</hi> as ſurgeon, to the ſhip, which was an armed letter of marque. By theſe articles Brice was to receive £. 18 and Woodroff £ 17. per month. At this time it was war between Great Britain and the United States of America. The ſhip fell down the river in order to commence her voyage, but from various cauſes of delay, did not clear the Capes, ſo as to enter on the high ſeas, before the 20th of March following. In the mean time, viz. on the 3d of March, peace had taken place, and hoſtilities ceaſed between the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligerent powers.</p>
                     <p>WHEREUPON, it has been alledged in behalf of the reſpondents, that £. 5 per month are the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:024407_0924_0FC72D22C710DA68"/>
cuſtomary wages in time of peace, and a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for ſervices for navigating a ſhip; that all above that ſum is allowed in conſideration of the riſk and dangers of war. That the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration failing, and no riſk being incurred, as peace had taken place before the ſhip had entered on the field of danger, the extraordinary wages ought to abate, and that the libellants ought to be content with peace wages for ſervices done in time of peace.</p>
                     <p>ON the contrary, it has been urged, that the contract was duly and regularly made: that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts are ſacred things, and ought to be taken entire, and ſtrictly conſtrued: that contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould not be admitted to explain their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions afterwards, or recede from the terms, of their bargain, on account of future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, provided there was no fraud in the caſe: that the performance of the voyage, and doing the duty on board, are the true conſideration of the wages: that whether theſe wages are high or low is a matter that ſhould have been conſidered when the contract was made: that as it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that if the danger had been greatly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the arrival from an enemy's fleet on the coaſt, or from any other circumſtance, the owners would have allowed encreaſed wages, neither

ought they to diminiſh the wages, becauſe the danger happened to be leſſened by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace. And laſtly, that the voyage was actually commenced when the ſhip left the port, although ſhe remained long after in the river.</p>
                     <div type="judgment">

                        <p>THE advanced wages above what is cuſtomary in time of peace is in conſideration of the riſk and dangers incident to war: in the preſent caſe it is clear that both parties, when they made the contract, had war in view, as is evident from the ſtations the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants were to fill, viz. the one, that of firſt lieutenant, and the other, that of ſurgeon of the ſhip, offices unknown on board of merchantmen in time of peace. Whether it would indeed be peace or war, was a circumſtance out of the reach of the parties to command. Peace, however, did take place, ſeventeen days before any riſk whatever was incurred on account of the war.</p>
                        <p>THE caſe of inſurance cited from 3d Burrow's, p. 1237, is a leading caſe in point. The contract there was regularly made between parties, more competent to be ſtrictly bound than common mariners, viz. the owners of a ſhip and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024407_0926_0FC72D278A697760"/>
writers, and yet it was determimed by all the judges, that this contract ought to be liberally conſtrued; and that the inſurance premium ſhould be returned for ſuch part of the voyage as had ran no riſk.</p>
                        <p>THE cauſe lately decided in this court, M'Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch verſus Lethe, has been quoted; but there is a manifeſt and eſſential difference between that caſe and the preſent. In the former, the libellant had actually incurred the riſk, had ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be killed in battle, or taken priſoner, which was the real conſideration of the war wages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; in the preſent caſe no riſk from war was at all incurred: for, although much pains hath been taken to ſhew, that the captain and crew of the Nancy, not having heard of the peace, had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to think that it was war when they ſailed, and conducted themſelves accordingly; yet the queſtion is not, what might have been their apprehenſions, but what was the reality of the danger, or whether it was indeed war or peace at the time?</p>
                        <p>HAD this veſſel advanced into the ſcene of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, though but for twenty-four hours before peace had taken effect, I ſhould have no doubt in allowing the libellants their full wages, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024407_0927_0FC72D2904D9AB30"/>
to the articles, upon the ſame principles on which wages were decreed to M'Culloch.</p>
                        <p>THAT the common law doctrines reſpecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts do not apply in all their ſtrictneſs to caſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime is evident from the conſtant practice of this court. The enliſtment of mariners have neither the complexion nor the formalities required by the rules of common law; and it would be hard to bind men ſo ignorant as common mariners generally are, to the legal conſtruction of terms, nor would it be for the intereſt of mariners, that articles ſhould be ſo ſtrictly conſtrued, as the operation would probably be frequently much againſt them.</p>
                        <p>IT appears, that when the libellants entered on board the Nancy, it was actual war, and that they held themſelves in readineſs to do the ſervices, and encounter the dangers for which the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wages had been promiſed. It was not their fault that the veſſel did not forthwith proceed on her voyage. I ſee therefore no reaſon againſt their being allowed full wages for that period, and the common uſage is to allow mariners their wages from the time of ſigning the articles, let the veſſel ſail when ſhe may.</p>
                        <p>I adjudge that the libellants have and receive
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024407_0928_0FC72D33F3EE24C8"/>
their full wages, according to contract, from the time of ſigning the articles, to the 3d of March laſt; and that they receive cuſtomary peace-wages from the ſaid 3d of March, to the completion of the voyage.</p>

                     <p>THOMAS Shaw, the libellant, entered on board the ſhip <hi>Lethe,</hi> as ſurgeon, and contracted to ſerve in that capacity from Philadelphia to Bourdeaux, and back again, for the wages of £. 15 per month. It was then war, and ſo continued till the veſſel arrived at Bourdeaux: whilſt ſhe was there in port peace took place. The libellant continued on board, and returned with the veſſel to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and now demands the ſtipulated wages of £. 15 per month, notwithſtanding the peace.</p>
                     <p>MUCH has been ſaid reſpecting the entirety of contracts on the one hand, and the diviſibility
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024407_0929_0FC72D35D1510F48"/>
of contracts, particularly thoſe of inſurance and mercantile agreements, on the other.</p>
                     <p>IT has been urged for the libellant, that the voyage to Bourdeaux and back again, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one entire voyage; and that if this veſſel had been inſured, or chartered, there could have been no apportionment of the premium or hire on account of the peace.</p>
                     <p>AGAINST this doctrine, the caſe of <hi>Stephenſon</hi> verſus <hi>Snow,</hi> 3d Bur. 1237, has been cited, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered. The caſe was—a ſhip was inſured for a certain premium, to ſail from London to Halifax; the inſured warranting that ſhe ſhould ſail with convoy from Portſmouth. She arrived at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, but the convoy was gone. Whereupon a return of premium was demanded, deducting only the cuſtomary inſurance from London to Portſmouth. The entirety of contracts was here urged againſt the inſurers, but over-ruled by the whole court, who conſidered the contract as diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and having reference to two diſtinct voyages, viz. from London to Portſmouth, and from thence to Halifax; and determined that as the riſk of the ſecond voyage had never been begun, the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um for that had never inured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="unknown:024407_0930_0FC72D37744783B0"/>THIS caſe appeared at firſt view to apply cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the preſent; but, on a nearer inſpection, I find that the warrantee to ſail with convoy was the ground of that deciſion. It was that alone which rendered the voyage diviſible, becauſe it was of the eſſence of the contract. Had the ſhip ſailed without, and been loſt, the inſurers would not have been anſwerable. Had ſhe been inſured from London to Halifax, without any condition annexed, and had ſtopped in her way at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, and proceeded no further, the voyage would not, I apprehend, have been deemed divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible on that account, nor the premium appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; ſo that the warrantee to ſail with convey was the foundation of the contract, which fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the contract failed, ſo far as the ſame had reſpect thereto. The voyage from London to Portſmouth ſeems to be no more than a neceſſary paſſage to the place where the ſubſtantial part of the contract was to take effect; where the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um was to be earned by the commencement of the riſk under the condition ſpecified.</p>
                     <p>BUT I find nothing parallel with this in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the ſhip Lethe: no contingency mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but only a ſimple contract for a voyage to Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux and back again, in conſideration of certain
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024407_0931_0FC72D42846D3D60"/>
ſervices to be performed on the one part, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wages to be paid on the other. If there is any ſimilarity in the two caſes, it conſiſts in this: that, as in the one, the ſailing with convoy was the ground of the <hi>quantum</hi> of the premium; ſo in the other, the war was the ground of the <hi>quantum</hi> of wages. In the caſe referred to, the contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was fully recognized in the contract: the ſhip was warranted to ſail with convoy, but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies are provided for in the Lethe's articles. If the inſured veſſel had ſailed with the convoy, though but for one day, and returned, it cannot be ſuppoſed that any part of the premium would have been reſtored.</p>
                     <p>THAT the mere arrival of a veſſel at a port or ports cannot be conſtrued as a diviſion of the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age delineated by the articles, is manifeſt from a current of law and practice: ſo it was determined in the caſe of Bernon <hi>verſus</hi> Woodbridge, Douglas, 753, and numberleſs charter parties, inſurances, and articles for mariner's wages have reference to circuitous voyages. Nor was it underſtood, that a fortuitous increaſe or diminution of the riſk, or any alteration of circumſtances between one port of deſtination and another, would affect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, unleſs provided for by the terms of the agreement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="unknown:024407_0932_0FC72D47DB883F90"/>BUT it hath been ſtrongly urged, that the high wages promiſed, and the nature of the ſervice to be performed, have reference to war only; and that as peace took place whilſt the veſſel was ſafe in port, the voyage, from the manifeſt object of the contract, became diviſible: and that it would be very hard to bind the maſter or owners to the moſt ſevere conſtruction of the articles, and make them pay for ſervices, which, from an unforeſeen change of affairs, were rendered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.</p>
                     <p>ALTHOUGH there is an equitable force in this argument, yet, under the circumſtances of the caſe, there ſeems to have been an obvious duty on the part of the maſter to have entitled him to an equitable relief from the binding force of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. He ſhould have propoſed to pay off the crew at Bourdeaux, and tendered a new contract on peace eſtabliſhment, proteſting againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer articles. Nor is this a mere ceremony, but what ſubſtantial juſtice ſeems to require. The mariners, under the articles, could not leave the ſhip without incurring a penalty. If then they are detained on board without any explanation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great change of circumſtances, they had ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that they were continued in the ſervice upon the terms of
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024407_0933_0FC72D494E41D378"/>
the ſubſiſting contract: and this reaſoning will well apply if the caſe be reverſed. Suppoſe the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had engaged in time of peace, and war had broke out during the voyage, and he had made no declaration that he was diſſatisfied with the terms of his contract, or expected war wages in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the riſk he was to run, I believe there are few maſters of veſſels who would not urge his ſilence as an acquieſcence in the continuation of the contract, and bind him down to the terms of the original contract.</p>
                     <p>IT is ſo natural to expect ſome declaration of the will of contracting parties, when circumſtances out of the reach of either have occurred, which totally alters the principles upon which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was formed, that an omiſſion of ſuch decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can have no other interpretation, but that of wilful neglect or deep deſign, neither of which is the law diſpoſed to countenance. Hence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, aroſe the cuſtom of proteſts, in caſes of wreck, illegal capture, fire, and other unforeſeen and unavoidable accidents.</p>
                     <p>ONE other argument hath been urged for the reſpondents, viz. that freight is the mother of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; inferring, that as this veſſel received only
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024407_0934_0FC72D4B04955AE8"/>
peace freight from Bourdeaux to Philadelphia, no more than peace wages ought to be allowed for that part of the voyage.</p>
                     <p>IT does not appear in teſtimony what freight this veſſel received: but if it did, I ſee no force in the argument. There is, in fact, no connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween freight and the quantum of wages; nor are the mariners ever privy to the terms on which a cargo hath been ſhipped. It is only a law of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy which arbitrarily makes the payment (not the rate per month) of the wages to depend on the ſafe conduct of the cargo, in order to induce the mariners to exert themſelves in caſe of wreck, to ſave as much as poſſible, knowing, that if the whole be loſt, they muſt loſe the whole of their wages. If the freight is thus called the mother, the ſervice performed may well be deemed the father, of the mariner's wages, that being the real and legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. There is no doubt but the mariner ſhall have his wages, in caſes where no freight at all is received; as in veſſels ſailing with ballaſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which often happens. The truth is, the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's lien is on the ſhip, and not on the cargo. Nor, was it ever known, that freight could be attached in the merchant's hands to anſwer for mariner's
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024407_0935_0FC72D53544AA420"/>
wages, but the ſhip is liable uoder all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>I have not noticed the ſhip's going to Teneriffe from Bourdeaux before ſhe came to Philadelphia, as this circumſtance, if it has any operation at all, muſt be againſt the maſter, who ought not to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by his own deviation from the articles.</p>
                     <p>AFTER mature conſideration, I cannot find ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to give a different deciſion now, from what was lately given in the caſe of M'Culloch, againſt the ſame ſhip. The continuation of the libellant on board, after it was known that peace had taken place, without any declaration of the maſter, that he expected the terms of the contract ſhould be changed, is too ſtrong a circumſtance to be got over.</p>
                     <p>BUT, as I think it a hard caſe, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend an appeal; that the law and arguments may be again conſidered by another court.</p>

                     <head>SILAS TALBOT verſus THE OWNERS OF THE BRIGS ACHILLES, PATTY, AND HIBERNIA.</head>
                     <p>IN September, 1779, Silas Talbot, being on a cruiſe in the ſloop Argo, diſcovered, and purſued the brig Betſey, a Britiſh letter of marque, about 200 tons burthen, armed with 8 ſix pounders, and laden with 214 puncheons of rum, and one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſk, and bound from Montſerrat or St. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher's, to New York, then in the poſſeſſion of the enemy. After an engagement of two hours, Talbot captured the Betſey; put one Weſt on board, as prize maſter, together with eleven of his crew, with written orders to the prize maſter to take her into the port of New London, then not far diſtant, for condemnation.</p>
                     <p>THE next day after the capture, the three brigs, Achilles, Patty, and Hibernia, belonging to the reſpondents in this cauſe, came up with the Betſey,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024407_0938_0FC72D5AA3343500"/>
under Britiſh colours. Captain Talbot taking them for enemies, was obliged to leave his prize, and fly: whereupon one of the three brigs chaſed the Argo, whilſt the Patty fired upon, boarded, and captured the Betſey.</p>
                     <p>WEST, the prize maſter, finding them to be Americans, declared that the Betſey was a prize of captain Talbot, in the Argo, then in ſight, and ſhewed Talbot's written orders to him: but for fear of their claiming ſhares of the prize, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been in ſight when ſhe was captured, aſſerted, that ſhe had been taken three days before. The perſons who boarded the Betſey having ſeen a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the day before, between a brig and a ſloop, which they believed to be the ſame; and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the number of men on board, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the number regiſtered in her Britiſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, concluded that no credit ſhould be given to Weſt's declaration. Whereupon, a conſultation was held by the three captains,<note n="*" place="bottom">According to W— D—'s depoſition.</note> who finally made prize of the Betſey, took out all the Argo's men, except one negro, and putting their own people on board, ordered her for Philadelphia. But ſhe was ſoon after captured by a Britiſh cruiſer,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:024407_0939_0FC72D6292777290"/>
and carried into New York—and ſo loſt to all parties. The three brigs purſued their reſpective voyages; taking the Argo's men with them, whom they left in Spain, and other remote parts.</p>
                     <p>THE reſpondents have reſted their defence on two grounds of argument: <hi>Firſt,</hi> they alledge, that they have produced ſufficient teſtimony to prove that the brigs Achilles, Patty, and Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, were within ſight, when the Argo engaged and captured the Betſey, and acquired thereby a property in the prize, according to the maritime law: inferring, that as their intereſt in the booty was much greater than that of the Argo, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three to one, they had a right to order the prize where they judged beſt for their ſecurity and benefit; more eſpecially as they had reaſon to doubt the fidelity of Weſt, in whoſe poſſeſſion they found her, on account of the falſhood he had told them: concluding, that if any injury was done to the libellant, it only amounted to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſhare of the booty, for which alone they ought to be anſwerable. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuſpicious circumſtances on board the Betſey— ſuch as the Britiſh papers, the number of men on board agreeing therewith, and the declaration of Weſt, that ſhe had been captured three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024407_0940_0FC72D670D1BA2F8"/>
contrary to their own obſervation, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to induce them to conclude that the whole was an artifice; and, therefore, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> were juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in taking her as original prize, and to conſider themſelves as the firſt captors.</p>
                     <p>THESE two poſitions of defence are ſupported by the teſtimony of W— D—, a paſſenger on board the Patty. This depoſition, on which alone the reſpondents have relied, labours for the eſtabliſhment of two facts which are altogether incompatible with each other, viz. firſt, that the three brigs ſaw the Argo engage and capture the Betſy; and, ſecondly, that the Betſy had not been captured at all, or, at leaſt, that the captains of the three brigs had good reaſon to think ſo, and were juſtifiable in taking her as ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal prize. One only of theſe poſitions can be true: therefore, a teſtimony which labours to eſtabliſh both, may, at leaſt, be ſaid to prove too much.</p>
                     <p>THE fact beſt ſupported by the circumſtances ſeems to be, that the three brigs were in ſight of the battle between the Argo and Betſy. What then was their conduct in this point of view? The next day after the engagement, of which
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:024407_0941_0FC72D6804A57400"/>
they had been diſtant ſpectators, they come up under Britiſh colours; they find the Betſy in the poſſeſſion, and under the protection of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, her captor; they chaſe away the Argo, and fire on the prize under Britiſh colours; they board her; take out all the people placed on board by captain Talbot; man her with part of their own crews; give her in charge to their own prize-maſter, and order her for Philadelphia. Could their having been in ſight, the day before, of the engagement between the Argo and the Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, juſtify ſuch a procedure? Surely it could not. Beſides, it is manifeſt, that the rule of law reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels in ſight of a capture does not refer to what may have been ſeen by the claimants, but by people on board the prize: for the rule is founded on a preſumption, that the crew of the captured veſſel, ſeeing others coming up armed and prepared for battle, were thereby induced to ſurrender.</p>
                     <p>FURTHER, I can on no account admit the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, now for the firſt time advanced, and unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by any authority whatever, that captains, claiming a ſhare in the prize they may have ſeen captured, have a right to order the booty where they pleaſe, by virtue of a majority of votes, or
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:024407_0942_0FC72D6986D5AA10"/>
of their ſuperior intereſt in the captured property. Their claim muſt follow, and depend upon the ſucceſs of the real captor. Beſides, in the preſent caſe, the libellant who fought for, and alone took the brig Betſey, had at leaſt ſome right in the prize: the captains of the three brigs the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT is alledged in ſupport of the plea, that this is a <hi>new</hi> action between the owners of a veſſel and their captain, and hath no neceſſary connexion with the ſuit brought by Silas Talbot: that it is enough, if the reſpondent ſhews that the decree paſt againſt the libellants, not as principals in the wrongful capture, but ſolely on account of the maritime law, which makes owners anſwerable for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct of the captains they employ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their connexion with Angus, as captain of the Hibernia, muſt be conſidered as the true cauſe of the damage they ſay they have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſource from which the preſent ſuit originates. And ſo infer, that as this connexion is grounded on a contract expreſs or implied, made upon land, the original cauſe of action muſt, from its nature and locality, be <hi>excluſively</hi> of common law juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>THE two criterions of excluſive juriſdiction are, the <hi>ſubject matter,</hi> and the <hi>locality</hi> of the tranſaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="unknown:024407_0947_0FC72D801AE19B68"/>IT is not doubted, but that the queſtion, <hi>prize or no prize?</hi> when it is the foundation of a ſuit, is <hi>excluſively</hi> of admiralty cognizance from the <hi>ſubject matter.</hi> The authorities to this point are too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to admit of doubt. But ſome of theſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities go further; and ſay, that the mere taking <hi>as prize,</hi> and all matters dependant thereupon, are alſo peculiarly of admiralty juriſdiction. Ld. Ch. Jus. Lee's opinion, in the caſe of Rous verſus Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard, as cited by Lord Mansfield, and again cited by juſtice Willis, in the caſe of Le. Caux verſus Eden. Douglaſs, 581, is full to this purpoſe.
<q>The great queſtion was, Whether an action for treſpaſs would lie for taking a ſhip as a prize? Lord chief juſtice <hi>Lee,</hi> having called in two civilians to his aſſiſtance, delivered the opinion of the court. That though, for taking a ſhip on the ſeas, treſſpaſs would lie at common law, yet when it was taken <hi>as prize,</hi> though ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wrongfully, though it were acquitted, and though <hi>there was no colour for</hi> the taking, the judge of the admiralty was judge of the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and coſts, as well as of the principal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and he laid it down as law, that, if ſuch an action was brought in England, and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>not guilty,</hi> the plaintiff could not recover.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:024407_0948_0FC72D81912BA528"/>IT is clear by this authority, that in order to fix the admiralty juriſdiction, it is not neceſſary that the queſtion before the court ſhould preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, <hi>prize or no prize?</hi> but that a ſuit for coſts and damages may and muſt be brought in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty for a taking <hi>as prize,</hi> though wrongfully done, and even without any colour for ſuch ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and, as it ſhould ſeem from the caſe, even though the property ſo taken ſhould not be in the poſſeſſion of the court.</p>
                     <p>SO alſo, in the caſe of Lindo verſus <hi>Rodney</hi> and <hi>Vaughan</hi> (Douglaſs, 592.) Lord Mansfield, in giving the opinion of the court, ſays:
<q>A thing being done upon the high ſeas, does not exclude the juriſdiction of the common law; for ſeizing, ſtopping, or taking a ſhip upon the high ſeas, <hi>not as prize,</hi> an action will lie, but for taking <hi>as prize,</hi> no action will lie. The nature of the queſtion excludes not the locality.</q>
And a little further on—

                     <p>HOW it came to paſs that the caſe of Silas Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot was, by the court of errors and appeals, and ſtill is, by conceſſion of council in the preſent
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:024407_0949_0FC72D8A2F06F4A8"/>
cauſe, conſidered to be <hi>not</hi> of admirality juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on account of the <hi>ſubject matter,</hi> I am at a loſs to conceive; eſpecially when I look at the two only points of defence taken in that cauſe, viz. firſt, that from the papers found on board the captured veſſel, and from other concomitant circumſtances, there was a reaſonable colour for <hi>taking as original prize.</hi> And, ſecondly, that if the Betſy was indeed prize to Silas Talbot, the three brigs were in ſight at the time of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by the maritime law, acquired thereby an intereſt in the property. I ſay, theſe pleas, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the current of the teſtimony then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and the time of the tranſaction, being time of war, all united in fixing that cauſe within the admiralty juriſdiction, from the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the very nature of the caſe.</p>
                     <p>IT is in obedience to ſtrong conviction that I thus venture to differ in opinion from the judgment of the honourable court of errors and appeals: a judgment which I am inclined to believe would not have taken place, but for the peculiar ſituation of Talbot's cauſe. The court of appeals for the United States, in prize-cauſes, had rejected the appeal, becauſe the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:024407_0950_0FC72D8C0923AD08"/>
queſtion was not ſtrictly, <hi>prize or no prize?</hi> but an action for damages between citizen and citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. That court, as I have underſtood, looked at that cauſe in no other point of view, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſed to take cognizance of it, and ſoon after was diſſolved. The appeal was then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the high court of errors and appeals for this commonwealth. Here the proctors had made a previous agreement, not to conteſt the point of juriſdiction; and ſo the cauſe came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judges on the merits only, and the court proceeded to ſentence without ſuſpecting their juriſdiction. After ſentence, however, ſome of the judges began to entertain ſcruples reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juriſdiction of the court; and, on enquiry, found that the juriſdiction had only been ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by conſent. The court well knew that conſent could not give legal juriſdiction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon retracted or ſuſpended the ſentence until an argument ſhould be held on that point: and the queſtion of juriſdiction was again agitated. In the mean time, that is between the rejection of the cauſe by the court of appeals for the United States, and its introduction into the court of the commonwealth, the caſe of Le Caux verſus Eden, as reported by Douglaſs, with Lord Mansfield's diſſertion on admiralty juriſdiction ſubjoined, made
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:024407_0951_0FC72D8D8AF29CC0"/>
their firſt appearance amongſt us, and furniſhed new ideas reſpecting the court of admiralty. Then, for the firſt time, did the diſtinction occur, between the <hi>prize</hi>-court and the <hi>inſtance</hi>-court of admiralty. Poſſeſſed of this idea, the judges of appeal for the ſtate, looked at the proceedings which the court of admiralty had adopted in the caſe before them, and found they had been <hi>in perſonam,</hi> by attachment, to anſwer for damages ariſing from a tort committed at ſea. This, it was obſerved, was never the practice in the <hi>prize</hi>-court, which always proceeded <hi>in rem,</hi> by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and monition, whether the property be in fact in the poſſeſſion of the court or not: and ſo it was in the caſe of the king verſus Broom, <hi>Carth.</hi> 398. by proclamation at the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, although the prize taken had been previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſold at Barbadoes. And for this error of form in the admiralty, <hi>Talbot's</hi> caſe was conſidered as belonging to the <hi>inſtance</hi>-court. The judges of apppeal conſidered themſelves as an <hi>inſtance</hi>-court of appeal, and ſo proceded to the definitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
                     <p>HAD the court of admiralty, when Talbot's cauſe firſt made its appearance there, been poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the light which hath been ſince thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024407_0952_0FC72D98DCFBD878"/>
this ſubject, it is very probable that the proceſs would have been conducted otherwiſe than it was. It ſhould be obſerved, however, that an <hi>excluſive</hi> juriſdiction cannot be ſubverted by an erroneous proceſs.</p>
                     <p>HOW far the conſideration, that if the court of appeals for the commonwealth ſhould reject Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's cauſe (as the court for the United States had done) the appellants would have had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, and ſo have been deprived of the benefit of an appeal altogether, might have operated to induce the judges to take that within their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance as an <hi>inſtance</hi>-court, I will not preſume to ſay; but the peculiar circumſtances of the caſe ought to be remembered: and I have mentioned them on this occaſion from a ſenſe of the duty I owe to the juriſdiction entruſted to my care.</p>
                     <p>I come now to conſider the origin of the cauſe now before me, and whether it is, or is not, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily dependant upon, and conſequential to, the caſe of Silas Talbot.</p>
                     <p>IT has been ſaid, that this ſuit is derived from three circumſtances, viz. the contract by which Angus was made captain of the Hibernia, the wrongful taking at ſea, and the damages the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellants
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024407_0953_0FC72D9B33718E40"/>
have been obliged to pay in conſequence of this contract and wrongful taking. And it has been urged, that as two of theſe circumſtances viz. the contract and the payment of damages, happened on the land, the common law, by the ſecond general rule, hath the excluſive juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>IT appears to me, however, that owners are anſwerable for torts done by the captains they employ, under a general principle of law, and not by virtue of any ſpecial contract whatever. No ſuch reſponſibility can be deduced from any articles, or failing orders given to captains of veſſels. The contract may be the ground of an action of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages for a breach of orders, reſpecting the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſts of the owners; but in caſes of tort the owners are anſwerable by a general law. The libellants have been obliged to pay the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Talbot's caſe, not becauſe they employed captain Angus, but becauſe they were owners of the brigs.</p>
                     <p>NEITHER can I conſider the payment of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, according to the decree in favour of Silas Talbot, as the origin of the preſent ſuit. We ſhould not ſtop ſhort in the train of cauſes. In ſuch a train, every circumſtance is the effect of the preceding and the cauſe of the ſubſequent link. No decree

would have paſt, no damages have been paid, nor would the preſent ſuit have been inſtituted, but for the original wrong done at ſea. To this wrong, therefore, we muſt have recourſe for the ſource of the preſent action.</p>
                     <p>SOME pains have been taken to apply the caſe of ranſom bills, charter parties, and policies of inſurance, all ſueable at common law, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuit. A ranſom bill ſuppoſes a diveſture of property by the rights of war, and the bill is a promiſſory note for a certain ſum, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the victor's relinquiſhing his right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and reſtoring the property. In a ſuit, therefore, on a ranſom bill, the queſtion of <hi>prize or no prize</hi> can only come in incidentally, to ſhew whether there was value received or not. For if the taking was wrongful, the property never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, and of courſe the promiſſory bill was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without conſideration. Charter parties, and policies of inſurance, are written contracts, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on land, reſpecting certain ſpecific contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: it is immaterial where theſe contingencies ſhall happen. The ſuit is founded on the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force of the contract, and the contingencies are only incidental circumſtances, ſhewing that the force of the contract is to take place and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But theſe are not parallel with the caſe
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:024407_0955_0FC72DA20CCBAA50"/>
before the court, wherein the libellants complain of damages they have ſuſtained in conſequence of a tort committed at ſea by the captain they had employed.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the caſe of Silas Talbot came firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this court, the libel was filed in the name of Silas Talbot, <hi>qui tam,</hi> againſt the brigs Achilles, Patty, and Hibernia, and againſt certain perſons in the ſaid libel named, as owners and captains of the ſaid brigs. All theſe perſons (except two, if I rightly remember) appeared either in perſon or by proxy, and entered into ſtipulations, according to the practice of the court. In this form the ſuit commenced, and proceeded through the admiralty, and through the court of appeals. The queſtion was general in both courts, viz. Whether there had been a wrong done? and if ſo, whether the parties who appeared as reſpondents to the libel, were anſwerable for the damage, and to what amount? And, finally, the decree was alſo general—That the appellants ſhould pay to the appellee certain monies in recompence of the injury ſuſtained. But how far any particular captain, or the owners of any particular veſſel might have juſtified themſelves by a ſeparate defence, was never the ſubject of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. No ſuch ſpecific juſtification having been proffered in either court. And whether it is, or is
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:024407_0956_0FC72DAD5B923E28"/>
not now too late, to make diſcrimination, may be the ſubject of future diſcuſſion: but I mention this to ſhew, that the preſent libel riſes out of Talbot's caſe, and that its purſuit will unavoidably force us up to the wrongful taking <hi>as prize</hi> for the origin of the preſent ſuit. Since then, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the caſe of Silas Talbot, as properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>prize</hi>-court of admiralty, and that the preſent ſuit originates from, and is a ſupplementary part of that tranſaction, I cannot (according to the firſt principle ſtated) but over-rule the preſent plea to the juriſdiction of this court.</p>
                     <p>I conclude with this obſervation—That in all pleas of this kind, where the law is doubtful, the leaning of the court will be in favour of its own juriſdiction—not from a deſire of extending the admiralty cognizance, but for this conſideration— That if the deciſion in favour of the juriſdiction ſhould be erroneous, the doors of the common law are open for redreſs, and a prohibition may be obtained. But there is no remedy for the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous excluſion of parties who apply for the proceſs of the admiralty, the benefit of the laws by which it is governed, and the ſummary juſtice it affords.</p>

                     <p>THE bill filed in this caſe ſtates, "That John Angus, being commander of the brig Hibernia, belonging to Joſeph Dean and others, did, on a certain day, without any licence, order, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from his owners, and without any probable cauſe of capture, with a view to his own private intereſt and emolument, combine and confederate with certain malefactors, and did purſue and take the brigantine Betſey, then in the poſſeſſion of Silas Talbot, commander of the ſloop Argo, as lawful prize and booty of war.

                     <p>I have found it neceſſary to the determination of
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024407_0959_0FC72DB606442428"/>
the preſent queſtion, to conſider it under the three following points of view, viz.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> How far the cauſe now before the court may be conſidered as connected with, or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the decree in the caſe of Silas Talbot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second,</hi> UNDER what circumſtances owners of veſſels ought to recover againſt the captains they employ for damages ſuffered in conſequence of their miſconduct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Third,</hi> THE ſpecific circumſtances of the preſent caſe, as they ſtand on the teſtimony, or what is called the merits of the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>AS to the firſt point—I can ſee no connection between this cauſe, and the caſe of Silas Talbot, further than this; that as it originates in the ſame tranſaction, viz. <hi>a taking as prize on the high ſeas,</hi> the juriſdiction is thereby determined. In all other reſpects the two cauſes proceed on different prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples—The points in view in Talbot's caſe were —how far owners of veſſels were anſwerable for torts committed by the captains they employ? and whether the <hi>taking</hi> in queſtion was in fact ſuch a tort as they ought to be anſwerable for? The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the preſent caſe are—Under what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024407_0960_0FC72DC34897F380"/>
owners may recover againſt their captains, and whether captain Angus was, or was not, <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps criminis</hi> with the wrong doers in Talbot's caſe.</p>
                     <p>THE complexion of the two cauſes being thus manifeſtly different, it cannot, with any reaſon, be admitted, that the teſtimony or decree, founded thereupon in the former, ſhould be concluſive in the preſent caſe. The decree, in Talbot's caſe, was againſt certain perſons, who by ſtipulations, had made themſelves reſponſible for the iſſue of that ſuit on general principles. It is not inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the record of that decree, for captain Angus, who was not one of thoſe ſtipulants, and who was no party in that ſuit, to come in now and make his defence, when perſonally called upon to anſwer, and to ſhew that he was not one of the wrong doers, <hi>againſt whom</hi> that decree was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>ON the ſecond point, viz.—Under what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances owners of veſſels ought to recover againſt the captains they employ, for damages ſuffered in conſequence of their miſconduct? It is conſonant with reaſon and authority, that captains are not anſwerable for loſſes ariſing from unavoidable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:024407_0961_0FC72DC50AA6A770"/>
mere errors of judgment, or failure of ſucceſs, after having exerciſed all reaſonable dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and diſcretion. It would be very difficult, and at preſent unneceſſary to delineate the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances and kinds of miſconduct, which ſhould render a captain reſponſible to his owners. Every caſe that occurs muſt be judged of, by its own peculiar circumſtances. The preſent libel ſtates, "That John Angus did, without any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from his owners, combine with certain malefactors, and without probable cauſe of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, take the brig Betſey, then in the poſſeſſion of Silas Talbot, as prize and booty of war: and that he did this, not ignorantly, but well knowing the circumſtances, and with a view to injure the ſaid Silas Talbot, and alſo his owners, as much as in him lay." If theſe charges are ſupported by teſtimony now before the court, there can be no doubt, but that he ought to be anſwerable to his owners for whatever they have ſuffered by his miſconduct.</p>
                     <p>AND this leads to the third point, viz.—The conſideration of the ſpecific circumſtances of the caſe, as exhibited by the teſtimony, or the merits of the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:024407_0962_0FC72DC6AC4D4F00"/>THE facts, ſo far as they reſpect captain Angus, appear to be in ſubſtance theſe:</p>
                     <p>ANGUS ſailed on a trading voyage from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to Teneriffe, in the armed letter of marque brig, <hi>Hibernia,</hi> in company with the brigs <hi>Patty</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> alſo letters of marque, and bound to ſome ports in Europe, under the commands of captains <hi>Prole</hi> and <hi>Thompſon.</hi> Angus had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed written inſtructions from his owners (the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent libellants) to keep company with the two brigs as long as he ſhould think it prudent, and had their approbation to cruiſe with them on the coaſt for two or three weeks, if they ſhould ſo agree. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Reedy Iſland, in the Delaware, a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was held between the three captains, and Prole was appointed commodore of this little ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. Soon after they had got out to ſea, they diſcovered a brig and a ſloop at a diſtance. Prole, as commodore, gave orders to chaſe, which was done. Prole and Thompſon, under Britiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, came up with, and took the brig, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t the Hibernia, being a dull ſailor, was left four or five miles aſtern. When ſhe came up, captain Angus enquired what the captured veſſel was, and was informed by Prole, or Thompſon, that ſhe was a good prize, bound from Montſerat to New York. To which Angus replied, that if the brig was prize, the ſloop (then in ſight) muſt be
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:024407_0963_0FC72DD459DFD338"/>
ſo too: and aſked why one of their faſt ſailing brigs did not purſue her? To which it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they did not chooſe to leave the prize till ſhe was well manned; but ordered him to chaſe the ſloop, which he accordingly did, for two or three leagues; but finding he could not come up with her, he hawled his wind, and beat up again for the other brigs, but did not reach them till dark. Prole then ſent a boat to Angus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding two of his hands to man the prize, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, at the ſame time, a paper for Angus to ſign, which appears to have been orders drawn up by Prole, and ſigned by him and Thompſon, for the prize-maſter, to whoſe charge they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the captured brig. Angus haſtily ſigned this paper on the binnacle, and ſent the two men required. The wind then blowing freſh, the ſea running high, and night coming on, the four brigs ſeparated and ſaw each other no more.</p>
                     <p>FROM this detail, it is manifeſt, that Angus had no opportunity of acquiring information of thoſe circumſtances which were the ground of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the reſpondents in the ſuit of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Talbot. The aſſurance of Prole, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, that the Betſey was good prize, was, in the then ſituation of affairs, ſufficient to convince Angus that there was at leaſt probable cauſe of capture. And if the enterprize had been a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:024407_0964_0FC72DD6B615B018"/>
one, which he had no reaſon to doubt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus would not have been juſtifiable in neglecting any thing on his part to ſecure to his owners a ſhare of the Betſey taken, or to add thereto, by endeavouring to take the ſloop alſo.</p>
                     <p>THE only circumſtance which hath a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to criminate captain Angus, is his ſigning the orders to the prize-maſter put on board the Betſey, directing to "keep to the ſouthward, for fear of falling in with the Argo:" There are two ways in which this may very naturally be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, neither of which are in the leaſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the teſtimony, viz, that in the hurry of the tranſaction, the boat waiting along ſide, the ſea rough, and night coming on, he ſigned theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without reading them, having confidence in thoſe who had drawn them up and ſigned before him; or, according to his laſt concluſion, "if the brig was prize, the ſloop muſt be ſo too," he ſtill conceived the Argo to be an enemy, and therefore to be avoided by the prize-maſter.</p>
                     <p>BUT, without having recourſe to ſurmiſes, I am clearly of opinion that the libel is not ſupported by the teſtimony; that is, there is not ſufficient proof that the reſpondent "did wilfully and knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without probable cauſe of capture, join
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:024407_0965_0FC72DDB543A3518"/>
with others, in taking from Silas Talbot his prize and booty of war."</p>
                     <p>IT is manifeſt, indeed, from the records of the court of appeals, that the libellants have ſuffered conſiderable damage in conſequence of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action at ſea. But, as they had embarked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſuit with real wrong-doers, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgment to go againſt them on general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, without attempting any ſeparate defence, this is no reaſon why Angus ſhould not bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch ſpecific teſtimony with regard to his own conduct as may exculpate him from the charges laid in the preſent libel.</p>
                     <p>SOME ſtreſs has been laid on a paſſage in the depoſition of W— D—, exhibited in Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's cauſe, tending to prove that Angus was not ſo ignorant of the circumſtances reſpecting the Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey and Argo, as he pretends. The paſſage is in theſe words: "Afterwards, captains Prole, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and Thompſon, in the preſence of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, conſulted what they ſhould do with the brig Betſey, and being of opinion," &amp;c. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weight this depoſition might have had in Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's cauſe, it is inadmiſſible in the preſent; but I would obſerve that this circumſtance is not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by any other teſtimony on the records of
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:024407_0966_0FC72DDC46D509E8"/>
this court: on the contrary, from the general hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the tranſaction, there ſeems to have been no period of time in which Angus could have left his veſſel, or the other captains have been on board the Hibernia to hold this conſultation; W— D— muſt therefore have been miſtaken. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is not the only circumſtance in which he is ſingular. For juſt before, he ſays, "The brigs Achilles and Hibernia endeavoured to ſpeak her (meaning the Argo) but could not come up with her. And, upon the ſaid Churche's ſaying, that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Talbot was not a man that would run from <hi>one</hi> of them if they would not both chaſe, the brig Achilles then chaſed alone."</p>
                     <p>NOW, the whole current of teſtimony agrees in this, that it was the Hibernia and not the Achilles that chaſed the Argo. And as I remember, in ſome ſtage of Talbot's ſuit, it was urged as an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumſtance againſt the owners of the Hibernia, that their captain was employed in driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Argo, whilſt her confederates were plundering her prize.</p>
                     <p>THESE obſervations on W— D—'s depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition cannot directly affect the preſent queſtion, becauſe that depoſition is not an exhibit in this cauſe; but I mention them, becauſe if I could find
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:024407_0967_0FC72DE6788694C0"/>
any ſubſtantial ground that Angus was indeed <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeps criminis</hi> with Prole and Thompſon, or that he knew, or had any opportunity of knowing, the circumſtances which ſhould have prohibited them from making that unfortunate capture, I ſhould not be ſo clear as I now am in adjudging</p>
                     <p>THAT the bill in this cauſe be diſmiſſed, and that the libellants pay the coſts of ſuit.</p>
                     <p>THE libellants; appealed and after long argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the court adjudged in June 1785, that John Angus ſhould pay to the appellants, £. 948:15:10, with intereſt thereon, from the 22d day of Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 1785.</p>

                     <p>THIS is a ſuit brought on a bottomry bond, given by John Walſh to the libellants at Oſtend, whereby he hypothecates the ſhip Emperor, of which he was then the captain, for 4500 florins, equal to £. 409:1:9 ſterling money of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, advanced for repairs of the ſaid ſhip. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon James Oellers, the owner of this ſhip, and others, his aſſignees, come in, and anſwer to the libel, alledging that this bottomry bond ought not to take effect <hi>as an hypothecation according to the maritime law.</hi>

                        <pb n="164" facs="unknown:024407_0969_0FC72DED6E175100"/>THERE are few rules of law more ſtrictly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined than this of hypothecation, and none in which the reaſon and intention of the law are more manifeſt: it is thus delineated.</p>
                     <p>"A maſter of a ſhip hath no power to take up money by bottomry, in places where his owner or owners dwell." "But when a maſter is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of theirs, nor of his own, and cannot find means to take up by exchange, or otherwiſe, and that for want of money the voyage might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded or overthrown, monies may be taken up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bottomry."—<hi>Molloy,</hi> book II. chap. ii. ſect. 11." —"And the money ſo taken up by the maſter, is done upon great extremity, and that for the completing of the voyage, when they are in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and want, in ſome foreign parts."—Sect. 12.</p>
                     <p>ALL the books agree in the ſpirit of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. The extreme neceſſity appears every where to be the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the law, and the <hi>intention</hi> to favour commerce. Let us now take a view of the preſent caſe. The leading facts appear from the teſtimony exhibited, to be theſe:</p>
                     <p>THE ſhip <hi>Emperor,</hi> John Walſh maſter, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to James Oellers, of Philadelphia, ſailed for
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:024407_0970_0FC72DEE50A99C18"/>
Oſtend, with a cargo of tobacco on board: the ſhip and cargo being conſigned by the owner to <hi>Bine, Overman</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> merchants at <hi>Oſtend.</hi> During the voyage the veſſel was ſo much damaged by a ſtorm at ſea, that the captain was obliged to put into Dover in England, in diſtreſs. From Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the captain ſent immediate notice of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the conſignees at Oſtend, and they ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed him with a credit on London, by which he raiſed money ſufficient to refit the ſhip. After this he ſailed from Dover, and arrived at Oſtend, where the conſignees took charge of the ſhip and cargo.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE the veſſel arrived at Oſtend, <hi>Bine, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verman,</hi> and <hi>Co.</hi> had accepted bills to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amount, drawn upon them by <hi>Oellers,</hi> on the credit of this conſignment. Upon cloſing all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, Bine, Overman, and Co. found that Oel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had not only drawn upon them to the full amount of the cargo and freight, ("the tobacco not ſelling ſo well as was expected") but that there remained a conſiderable ballance in their favour. To ſecure this ballance, they tell captain Walſh that he ſhall not leave the port, unleſs he will repay them the monies advanced at Dover for repairs, or hypothecate the ſhip. It was not in captain Walſh's power to do the one, that is, to repay

the money, and he declined the other propoſal for ſome time: but finding expences accumulating, and that he could not ſail without ſome accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he at laſt conſented to hypothecate the ſhip. Bine, Overman, and Co. then recommended him to <hi>Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn</hi> and <hi>Co.</hi> telling him that they would lend money on bottomry; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to their houſe, where he executed the bottomry bond now in queſtion. But no money was paid to Walſh; for the bills for repairs at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had been long ſince diſcharged by the produce of the credit on London.</p>
                     <p>AFTER this, Bine, Overman, and Co. permitted captain Walſh to ſail, and in due time he arrived at Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, Oellers had failed, and aſſigned this ſhip to his creditors; and the queſtion now is—Whether this bottomry bond ſhall operate to the excluſive ſecurity of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's at Oſtend, againſt all other creditors, as a genuine hypothecation would do, on the principles of the maritime law?</p>
                     <p>AFTER a careful conſideration of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the caſe, I cannot diſcover one real fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that rule of law which ſhould be the ground
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:024407_0972_0FC72DF9FA846860"/>
of the preſent ſuit. True it is, that the ſhip was in neceſſity, and ſo is evey ſhip that wants eſſential repairs. But the owner had credit within reach. The conſignees were not far diſtant. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was eaſy and certain, and the conſignees no ſooner heard of the diſaſter, but they furniſhed the means of relief. In fact, Bine, Overman, and Co. had the ſtrongeſt inducement to exert themſelves in getting the ſhip repaired at Dover, that ſhe might get round to Oſtend; for they had made themſelves anſwerable for Oellers's bills upon the credit of this cargo. It was, therefore, of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to them, that the cargo ſhould arrive ſafe to their hands. So that inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing money to a diſtreſſed ſtranger, they were only taking care of their own ſecurity. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is manifeſt by their letter to Walſh at Dover; and ſtill further by their ſubſequent conduct: for after they had diſpoſed of the cargo, and found a ballance due from Oellers to them, they inſiſt that Walſh ſhall not ſail, unleſs he will hypothecate the ſhip to Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn, and Co. which from all appearances ſeems to be the ſame thing as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecating her to themſelves: for the captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no money from Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn, and Co. who were not at all intereſted in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and whoſe names were only made uſe of to
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:024407_0973_0FC72DFE74536A90"/>
ſave appearances. For Bine, Overman, and Co. well knew, that being conſignees, the captain had no power to hypothecate the veſſel to them. And, in order to give the bottomry bond the face of a genuine hypothecation, they ſelected from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral account, the monies ſpent for repairs at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and compelled the captain to hypothecate his ſhip, <hi>as for thoſe particular charges,</hi> to the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, who had not advanced one ſhilling towards that expence.</p>
                     <p>FURTHER, if we look into the accounts, we ſhall find, that, although this voyage was not a very ſucceſsful one, yet the ſhip cleared all charges accrued after ſhe ſailed from Philadelphia, even including the repairs at Dover. But Oellers had drawn upon Bine, Overman, and Co. on the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the future voyage, long before the ſhip ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Philadelphia, to raiſe money to fit her out; and it is theſe drafts brought into account which make a ballance due to the conſignees. So that, inſtead of an hypothecation made to enable a ſhip to complete her voyage, it was, in fact, made to enable her owners to begin one; which was never the object of the maritime law in caſes of hypothecation. Neither was this law ever deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give partial advantages in mercantile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, or ſecure the ballance of a running ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:024407_0974_0FC72DFF8BA8B208"/>
between owners and conſignees, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of other creditors.</p>
                     <p>THE importance of the preſent deciſion to the commercial character of our country, has been ſtrongly urged in favour of the libellants. But I am not apprehenſive on this account. The queſtion in view is not to be determined by any municipal law of the country, but by a general law, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received and underſtood. And I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that our national character would be much more likely to ſuffer by an adjudged precedent, which might open a door for dangerous colluſions, by putting it in the power of captains of veſſels to ſaddle their owners with unneceſſary obligations, or to give an unfair advantage to foreign creditors, by a fraudulent uſe of that pre-eminent lien which the law lays on a ſhip and goods, properly hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecated.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to inſinuate that there has been any fraud or colluſion in the preſent caſe. It is enough, that I do not find the claim of the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants within the ſpirit or intention of the maritime law: and, therefore, I adjudge,</p>
                     <p>THAT the bill be diſmiſſed, and that the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants pay the coſts of ſuit.</p>

                     <p>THE bill in this cauſe is filed by certain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants againſt the ſhip Enterprize, for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of monies advanced by them to the captain of
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:024407_0977_0FC72E0F3B098680"/>
the ſaid ſhip in the port of Philadelphia, to fit her out for an intended voyage. The oſtenſible or real owners, or ſome of them, being at the time of ſuch advancements within the ſtate, and known to the libellants.</p>
                     <p>AND it has been urged in ſupport of the libel, that every contract of the captain for neceſſaries for a ſhip implied an hypothecation, and induces a lien on the ſhip in favour of the creditor, ſueable in the admiralty by the rules of civil law: and the caſe principally relied upon as authority for this doctrine, is cited from Cowper, p. 636.</p>
                     <p>THE caſe referred to, is a ſuit at common law, brought by a rope-maker againſt the owners of a ſhip, for ropes furniſhed to the captain. The plaintiff having charged <hi>Harwood</hi> (the captain) and the owners of the ſhip, for the ropes, without naming, or even knowing who the owners were.</p>
                     <p>THE fact was, that the owners, according to the cuſtom of the county of Eſſex, in England, where they probably reſided, had leaſed the ſhip to Harwood for a term of years on certain condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—and the queſtions were, Whether under theſe circumſtances, Harwood was not both cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and owner during the term? And whether the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:024407_0978_0FC72E1022D92480"/>
original owners ought to be reſponſible for debts contracted on account of the ſhip, whilſt in the poſſeſſion of Harwood under the leaſe?</p>
                     <p>LORD MANSFIELD was of opinion, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the leaſe, nor the ignorance of the creditor as to the names or perſons of the owners, could exonerate them. And to ſhew that the owners are bound, he ſays.—"Suppoſe the ſhip had been impounded in the admiralty, and <hi>that</hi> had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the end of the term, the owners could not have had their ſhip without paying the debt for which ſhe had been impounded."</p>
                     <p>BUT this caſe is brought into view chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Lord Mansfield in giving his opinion, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the creditor had three ſecurities for his debt, viz. the perſon of the captain with whom he contracted the <hi>ſpecific ſhip,</hi> and the owners.</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould be remembered, however, that this was a ſuit at common law; that the owners, the ſhip, the captain, the creditor, and the contract, were all within the realm. And there can be no doubt but that the creditor might have his action at law, either againſt the perſons of the contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or might attach their property, the ſhip, for his debt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:024407_0979_0FC72E118227FC98"/>BUT this caſe has no reference whatever to the the maritime or civil law. The doctrine of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecation is never once mentioned, nor is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the captain at all placed upon that ground. The principle object was to determine whether the leaſe of the ſhip did not exonerate the leſſors during the term.</p>
                     <p>SO in the caſe cited from Vezay. p. 154. This alſo was purely a common law proceſs; wherein the parties, and the whole tranſaction, appear to have been <hi>infra corpus comitatus.</hi> "Certainly, ſays the lord chancellor, by the maritime law, the maſter hath power to hypothecate the ſhip <hi>during the voyage, and from the neceſſity of the caſe;</hi> but it is different where the ſhip is infra corpus comitatus, and the contract made by the owners or maſters on land, and not ariſing from neceſſity, then the laws of the land muſt prevail." And this is conſonant with the whole current of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities reſpecting a maritime hypothecation, viz. that it muſt be made during the voyage, and from the neceſſity of the caſe.</p>
                     <p>WHEN money is borrowed on the ſhip before the voyage is begun, the ſhip is not anſwerable in the admiralty— 1ſt Raym. 578. So in 2d. Raym. 982. in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT appears then to be a ſettled doctrine, that a ſhip cannot be hypothecated, according to the maritime law, before the voyage is begun, or in places where the owners reſide, even for thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries without which the ſhip could not proceed to ſea. The law means to favour the completion, not the commencement of a voyage.</p>

                     <p>SINCE then, it appears that the advance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to fit out the ſhip Enterprize, was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commencement of her voyage, and not from neceſſity, and that the captain, the owners, or ſome of them, and the contractors were all within the ſtate at the time of the tranſaction; and

                     <p>EDWARD FORBES of Dublin, in Ireland, has libelled againſt the brig Hannah, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of certain bonds of bottomry, which Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Lewis, then captain and principal owner of the veſſel, gave as ſecurity for monies advanced by Forbes, in the port of Dublin, for neceſſaries, as it is ſaid, for the ſaid brig, and to enable her to complete her voyage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="unknown:024407_0982_0FC72E1F01D427A8"/>THE circumſtances of this caſe appear from the teſtimony to be theſe:</p>
                     <p>FRANCIS LEWIS, principal owner of the brig Hannah, had chartered her to one <hi>Varlo,</hi> for a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from ſome port in America to Dublin in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Varlo himſelf went paſſenger with his goods, and Lewis was captain for the voyage. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their arrival at Dublin, Lewis borrowed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Forbes, at three ſeveral times, for which he gave three bonds of bottomry on his brig, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting, with premium and charges, to £.214:0:8 ſterling money of Great Britain. Forbes then put a cargo on board the brig, in which it ſeems that Lewis was concerned, as he was to have one-half of the nett profits of the adventure, excluſive of freight, and to be anſwerable for one-half of the loſs, if any there ſhould be, on the ſales. Lewis left Dublin with his cargo, bound for Boſton in America. It does not appear whether ever he arrived at Boſton, or what he did with his cargo; but in April laſt he brought the brig into the port of Philadelphia, at which time ſome of his mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſued in this court for wages due, and the brig was attached and condemned for thoſe wages, a mounting to £.29, Lewis making no plea of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the libel. In conſequence of this libel and ſentence, a writ iſſued to the marſhal,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:024407_0983_0FC72E209786FEB8"/>
in the uſual form, directing him to ſell the brig Hannah, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, <hi>or ſuch parts thereof,</hi> as might be neceſſary, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the decree in favour of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ners, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the charges and coſts of ſuit. But Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is requeſted the marſhal to ſell <hi>the whole</hi> of the veſſel, with her tackle, &amp;c. under the decree, and even endorſed this requeſt on the writ of ſale. And to ſhew that he was the ſole owner of the brig at that time, he exhibited to, and lodged with the marſhal, an aſſignment or bill of ſale from one Simpſon, who had been a part owner, of all his intereſt in the brig, to Lewis.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ANDREW HODGE,</hi> reſpondent in this cauſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the veſſel at the marſhal's ſale, and paid down the full conſideration money, out of which the marſhal deducted the mariners wages, with charges and coſts of ſuit, and paid the balance to Lewis as ſole owner. After this, Lewis went off without ſaying any thing of the bottomry bonds he had given to Forbes in Dublin. And now theſe bonds have come over, and Forbes has attached the brig in the hands of Hodge the purchaſer.</p>
                     <p>ON theſe circumſtances, two queſtions have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen, viz.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> WHETHER theſe bottomry bonds have hypothecated the veſſel, according to the rules of maritime law, ſo as to bring the cauſe within ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty juriſdiction?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> SUPPOSING it to be ſo, whether the ſale and purchaſe, under the authority of this court, have not veſted the property in the reſpondent, exonerated of all prior engagements?</p>
                     <p>TO determine the firſt point, it will be neceſſary to conſider the characteriſtic marks which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh an hypothecation, according to the maritime law, from a common bottomry bond or mortgage, according to the cuſtom of merchants, cognizable by the common law.</p>
                     <p>BY the maritime law
<q>a maſter of a ſhip hath no power to take up money by bottomry in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where his owners dwell; but when he is out of the country, and where he hath no ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or any goods of theirs, or his own, and cannot find means to take up, by exchange or otherwiſe, and that for want of money, the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age might be retarded or overthrown, monies may be taken up on bottomry.</q>

Thus, in 3d. <hi>Mod.</hi> 244, "The reaſon of the civil law, which allows the pawning of a ſhip for neceſſaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high ſeas, ſeems to be plain, becauſe there may be an extraordinary and invincible neceſſity to which the admiralty juriſdiction is limited: for if the law ſhould be otherwiſe, the maſter might take as much money as he will." And ſo the court, in that caſe, ordered a trial on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                     <p>SO alſo, in <hi>Bridgeman's</hi> caſe—Hob. 12. a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was granted, becauſe the impawning was not ſhewn to be <hi>occaſioned by neceſſity.</hi>

have proofs given <hi>that there was a neceſſity</hi> for ſuch an advance, and that the money had actually been employed for the purpoſes alledged."</p>
                     <p>FURTHER, the impawning muſt be in foreign parts; that is, where neither the owner, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath any perſonal credit: for this conſtitutes an eſſential part of the neceſſity—"The maſter can have no credit abroad but by hypothecation." Salk. 35.—"Where a ſhip in diſtreſs is forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any port where her owners have no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to ſupply the maſter with the money neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to enable him to proſecute his voyage, he may take it on bottomry from thoſe will advance it on the eaſieſt terms." 1ſt. <hi>Mag.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>THE reaſon is, the maritime law requires, that the monies ſhould be lent ſolely on the credit of the ſhip, and that the ſecurity of the lender ſhould depend altogether on her ſafety: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if ſhe be well engaged, that is according to the principles ſtated, ſhe ſhall be for ever obliged till redemption—Molloy book II. ch. ii. ſec. 15. And therefore alſo, becauſe of the hazard, an unuſual intereſt is allowed on the monies advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="unknown:024407_0987_0FC72E35856D1960"/>SUCH are the principles which deſignate a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime hypothecation within admiralty juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>BUT bottomry bonds may be given by owners for ſecurity of mercantile or other debts; and theſe may be executed either in places where the owners dwell, or in foreign parts, by their order. They may be formed under a variety of circumſtances, and depend on many contingencies, according to the conditions or terms of the deed or contract.</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould ſeem by the <hi>neceſſity,</hi> ſo frequently urged as the ground of a maritime hypothecation, that the ſhip ſhould be driven by diſtreſs into ſome other port than that of her deſtination; or, at leaſt, that ſome extraordinary caſualty ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion an unforeſeen and inevitable expence in the port of her voyage. Becauſe it is hardly to be ſuppoſed, that an owner would ſend his ſhip, much leſs that he would take her himſelf, to a place where he could not command either money or credit for ordinary repairs and ſupplies.</p>
                     <p>IN the preſent caſe it does not appear, nor has it been ſuggeſted, that any extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances occaſioned an unforeſeen neceſſity. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (Lewis), who was alſo principal owner, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:024407_0988_0FC72E3F853C06E0"/>
after a proſperous voyage at the port of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination with his freighter on board. Here the voyage is completed, and it may be preſumed that he there received his freight. If ſo, he could not be without money ſufficient to refit his veſſel for a new voyage. And that he was not without perſonal credit is manifeſt, becauſe Forbes entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a new cargo, and agreed to allow him 35<hi>ſ</hi>0 Iriſh money per ton for freight on all the goods he ſhould deliver: and alſo one half of the nett profits ariſing from the ſale of the cargo, he to run one half of the riſk of loſs. This mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile connection ſhews at leaſt that Lewis was in ſome credit with Forbes.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES, if we look into the accounts, we ſhall find the firſt article charged is £. 32:5:6 ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling paid to Varlo, by Lewis's order, to take up and cancel a former bottomry bond. It ſeems ſtrange that Lewis, after navigating Varlo and his goods acroſs the ſea, ſhould fall in his debt. This circumſtance is not at all accounted for. But be it as it may, Forbes ſhould certainly have forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his former bottomry bond, with an account of the occaſion and expenditures for which it was given, that a judgment might have been formed whether it was a proper hypothecation or not:
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:024407_0989_0FC72E40C3C73578"/>
or have ſhewn that the brig was under condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the admiralty at Dublin on account of that bond; and that the £. 32:5:6 was paid for her redemption.</p>
                     <p>UPON a view of the circumſtances of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, I do not find them ſuch as the maritime law requires to conſtitute a genuine hypothecation within admiralty juriſdiction. This point being concluſive, it is unneceſſary to determine on the ſecond general queſtion.</p>
                     <p>I adjuge that the bill in this cauſe be diſſmiſſed; and that the libellants pay the coſts of ſuit.</p>

                     <head>MANUEL SAGAS DE CANIZARES verſus THE SANTISSIMA TRINIDAD. JUAN JOSEPH DE AGUIRE PEREZ, <hi>Reſpondent.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE libel in this cauſe ſtates two ſeparate claims of Canizares, the complainant, againſt the brigantine Santiſſima Trinidad: the one founded on an hypothecation of the ſaid veſſel, made by the then captain to Santiago Cupiſono at Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, for two hundred dollars advanced by the ſaid Cupiſono for neceſſaries for the ſaid brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, as it is ſaid, and to enable her to proſecute her voyage; which inſtrument of hypothecation is endorſed or aſſigned over by the lender to the preſent libellant: and the other, founded on a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contract between Nariſco Sanchez y Serna, then captain of the veſſel, and Canizares the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, reſpecting the wages he ſhould receive for ſerving as pilot and mariner on board the ſaid bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine in her voyage from Havannah to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. As theſe claims ariſe from different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:024407_0991_0FC72E49B024DFF8"/>
it is manifeſt that they muſt be ſeparately conſidered.</p>
                     <p>TO determine on the force of this inſtrument of bottomry, I ſhall firſt ſtate the circumſtances neceſſary to a genuine hypothecation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the maritime law; and then take a view of the hiſtory of this veſſel's voyage, and her ſituation at Havannah when Cupiſono advanced the money in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>AS to the firſt, I have had occaſion in three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſuits in this court, to ſtate the law of a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hypothecation, and have not ſince found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to alter my opinion of the principles on which thoſe cauſes were decided. The cauſes to which I refer were Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn and Co. againſt the ſhip Emperor, Turnbull againſt the ſhip En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and Forbes againſt the brig Hannah. I can only now repeat the ſubſtance of what was then obſerved.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Here the judge recapitulated the doctrines ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and the authorities cited, in the caſes referred to.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now ſtate the hiſtory of the voyage of this brigantine, as the ſame may be deduced from the teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="unknown:024407_0992_0FC72E4B4D7B5EC8"/>IT appears that this veſſel had been chartered on account of the king of Spain, and was to ſail from Philadelphia to Carthagena with a cargo of flour which was to be ſold there, and a cargo of dyewood purchaſed and brought back to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, or ſome port of the United States. Such was the deſignated voyage; but it ſeems the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, inſtead of returning to Philadelphia from Carthagena, went to Jamaica with an adventure of his own; to what amount does not appear: that at Jamaica he purchaſed dry goods fit for the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah market, and then took the brig to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, where he diſpoſed of the goods he had bought at Jamaica upon his own account: that at Havannah he borrowed two hundred dollars of Cupiſono, and executed the inſtrument called the hypothecation, to engage the veſſel and her freight for this ſum: that part of this money was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in paying wages to the mariners, and part in ſupplying them with freſh proviſions: that the veſſel was refitted at the king's arſenal, and at the expence of the intendant: and that ſhe ſailed for, and arrived at the port of Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>I agree with the council for the libellant, that the validity of an hypothecation ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the regularity of the captain's conduct with reſpect to his owners, previous to the time
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:024407_0993_0FC72E4CC5CF8C80"/>
of his arrival in a foreign port, and borrowing money for the relief of the ſhip's neceſſities; and will go further, and ſay, that neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought it to be affected by the captain's ſubſequent conduct; provided the lender was in no wiſe privy to, or knowingly aſſiſtant in his obliquities.</p>
                     <p>IT has been urged on the other ſide, that the law of hppothecation was deſigned ſolely for the benefit of the owners, and an inference drawn, that if it can be ſhewn, that the owners of a veſſel have not been benefited, but injured by the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains conduct, and conſequent hypothecation, it ought not to be allowed. But this law has for its object the good of commerce in general. And no ſtranger would lend money on hypothecation if his lien on the ſhip was to be invalidated by ſome future proof that the voyage was irregular, or that the captain had deviated from the orders of his owners, and injured their intereſt, either before or after the hypothecation made.</p>
                     <p>BUT where ſhall we find, in the preſent caſe, that <hi>neceſſity</hi> which ſhould juſtify the captains conduct, and be the ground of a genuine hypothecation? This veſſel was chartered for the uſe of the king of Spain by his agent: the cargo on board was on the king's account, and ſhe arrives in a lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>

and diſabled condition in one of his Majeſty's ports, where he had an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fficer ſtationed. This officer, the intendant, orders the veſſel to the public warehouſe to be diſcharged, and then round to the king's arſenal to be repaired; all which was done at the king's expence. In truth, I cannot conceive a caſe of leſs neceſſity, or one wherein a more certain and able relief could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon.</p>
                     <p>BUT it is ſaid, that there were conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays before the intendant interfered; and that the captain was obliged to ſend in five or ſix memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and in the mean time the mariners were in great want of wages and freſh proviſions; and that in this neceſſity the captain applied to Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſono for two hundred dollars, who refuſed to lend them unleſs the veſſel ſhould be hypothecated for his ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>IT is in teſtimony, however, that this money was lent by Cupiſono before the captain had made any application to the intendant, and therefore, the neglect of the intendant could not have occaſioned the neceſſity of borrowing from Cupiſono: that the captain of a veſſel in the king's ſervice, and in one of his majeſty's ports, ſhould not find credit for a few days proviſions until the proper officer
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:024407_0995_0FC72E57ACBF6220"/>
could be applied to, is too incredible to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly admitted: ſtill leſs can it be a legal ground for an hypothecation, that the mariners muſt have wages paid to them in a place where it does not appear that any wages were due; nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that any could be due, becauſe this was neither the concluſion of the voyage, nor even a port of delivery.</p>
                     <p>THE money ought to have been lent ſolely on the faith of the hypothecation and not on any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal credit: but here was a ſtrong and well founded credit; for it is in the proof that Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſono knew that this veſſel was chartered for the king's ſervice; and it is expreſsly ſaid, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was borrowed to pay wages and procure freſh proviſions—"<hi>until money could be had from the intendant.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>FURTHER, in the quotation from Molloy B. II. ch. xi. ſec. 11. it is ſaid—"When a maſter is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of theirs, <hi>nor of his own.</hi>"—Now it is confeſt that the captain had goods of his own, and, as it ſhould ſeem, to a conſiderable amount, ſince it was ſufficient to induce him to violate his duty to his employers, in taking the veſſel, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their orders, on a trading voyage to Jamaica
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:024407_0996_0FC72E59905388F0"/>
for his own benefit; that at Jamaica he bought goods ſuitable for the Havannah market, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſold them at the Havannah though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and that Cupiſono, the lender, was privy to theſe circumſtances. So that inſtead of the lender's having the veſſel alone to look to for his ſecurity, he had two ſubſtantial perſonal credits to depend upon, viz. the intendant, from whom he might reaſonably expect repayment of monies advanced for the uſe of a veſſel in the king's employ; and the captain, whoſe property he might have attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before he left the iſland, if ſatisfaction was not made. This circumſtance alone, that is to ſay, Cupiſono's knowledge that the captain had proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own on the ſpot, ſufficient to anſwer the preſent exigencies of the veſſel, would have invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated the bond as a maritime hypothecation, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it removes that <hi>neceſſity</hi> which the law requires.</p>
                     <p>THERE is a circumſtance in the preſent caſe, which although not in itſelf concluſive, forms too ſtriking a feature in the tranſaction to paſs unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. A ſingularity in a maritime hypothecation is, that the law allows an extraordinary premium or intereſt to the lender, to any extent, according to the riſk to be run<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe, if the ſhip ſhould be loſt, the money lent is loſt with her. But
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:024407_0997_0FC72E5B209DEE08"/>
here, a ſtranger lends two hundred dollars to a captain in diſtreſs without even ſtipulating for common legal intereſt for the uſe of his money: I ſay, this alone might not be concluſive againſt the hypothecation, becauſe a man may be as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous as he pleaſes; but in connection with the other circumſtances, it gives room for ſuſpicion, that the engagement of this veſſel to Cupiſono was not made within the rules or ſpirit of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime law.</p>
                     <p>FOR the above reaſons, I adjudge that the bill in this cauſe be diſmiſſed, ſo far as the ſame hath reſpect to a claim of two hundred dollars, ſaid to have been lent on the credit of the brigantine Santiſſima Trinidad.</p>
                     <p>I am now to conſider the libellant's demand of wages for ſerving as pilot and mariner on board this veſſel from Havannah to Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>THIS claim for wages, amounting to £.87:5:0, is founded on a written contract made at the Havannah between Nariſco Sanchez y Serna,

                     <p>BUT it has been contended, that as this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in writing, and bears a ſeal, and is not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terms thereof, in the uſual way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing for mariners wages, it becomes a ſpecial contract, and is not properly of admiralty juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="unknown:024407_0999_0FC72A200BDF2388"/>ITS being in writing, however, is no more than a teſtimony or memorandum of the agreement made, and does not affect the juriſdiction of this court. What is called a ſeal appears to be nothing more than a printed ſtamp, for which a duty is paid to the crown: certainly it is not the ſeal of the parties, or of either of them. But, as to the terms of the contract, theſe are indeed out of the uſual courſe, and deſerve conſideration.</p>
                     <p>ONE of the reaſons for allowing mariners to ſue in the admiralty is, that the debt ariſes from ſervices performed, or to be peformed at ſea, and a lien on the ſhip given to them for their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe the contract they make is ſuppoſed to be on the credit of the ſhip.</p>
                     <p>NOW, although the wages of twenty dollars per month, promiſed in the preſent caſe, appear to be extravagant, yet, as the difficulty of getting a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon qualified to ſerve both as a ſkilful pilot and able mariner might have been great, I think the rate of wages per month ought to be allowed as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for. But I cannot, upon any principle, allow that a captain hath a power to bind his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and their veſſel to the payment of a mariner's wages for three months after his diſcharge, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all ſervices at ſea and elſewhere have ceaſed.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:024407_1000_0FC72A2446F0A450"/>
If he could legally do this for three months, why not for ſix or twelve; or even ſaddle his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with an annuity for life to a mariner for a few weeks actual ſervice? How far the common law might conſider this contract as binding on the captain perſonally, it is not my buſineſs to ſay; but as judge of admiralty, I ſhall be far from doing my part towards eſtabliſhing a precedent by which captains, in addition to the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they neceſſarily have over the property of their employers, may have that of obliging them to the payment of unlimited ſums for an unlimited time. The captain might have engaged for his owners to pay wages per month during the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or a ſpecific ſum for the run to any amount juſtifiable by the circumſtances and neceſſities of the caſe; but to bind the owner to periodical payments to a mariner after a total diſcharge from the ſervice, is what I believe no captain of a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ever before attempted. For whether this was to be paid all at once, or at three ſeveral times, it matters not; the contract is for <hi>three months wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after diſcharge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THERE is another claim under this contract for ſixty dollars to take the libellant back to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah on being diſcharged here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="unknown:024407_1001_0FC72A254A51CCC8"/>THE maritime cuſtom is, that if a maſter or owner diſcharges a mariner in a foreign port, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the completion of the voyage for which he engaged, ſome reaſonable allowance ſhall be made, over and above the wages due, to enable him to return to his own country, or go to the port, which by the articles, ſhould have completed the voyage; and this allowance is uſually the amount of one month's wages: and it is a reaſonable cuſtom, where the mariner is willing to perform articles and finiſh the voyage, but the maſter or owner thinks fit to diſcharge him ſooner for their own convenience, and without juſt cauſe of complaint againſt the mariner. Therefore this part of the contract before us is conſiſtent with maritime cuſtom, but certainly unreaſonable as to the ſum promiſed.</p>
                     <p>WHATEVER power a captain may have by law to bind his owners by contracts made abroad for the ſervices of the ſhip, yet he cannot oblige them beyond what is uſual and cuſtomary, without ſhewing that the unuſual charge, aroſe from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the caſe. The preſent charge is expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for conveying the libellant back to the Havannah: I have therefore enquired what is the uſual charge for a paſſage from the port to the
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:024407_1002_0FC72A26D2F6B898"/>
Havannah, and find that forty dollars is an ample and generous allowance.</p>
                     <p>FRAUD and colluſion between the captain and Canizares the libellant, have been ſuggeſted, but not proved: yet if I had not found that this cauſe might and ought to be determined on general principles, there are two circumſtances in the caſe which would have induced a more ſtrict enquiry into the captain's conduct. The one, which I have already noticed, is Cupiſono's lending money on hypothecation without ſecurity, or even aſking for common intereſt, which, though a poſſible, is not a uſual occurrence. The other is a contract between the captain and Canizares, which concludes with theſe remarkable words—"Each (that is the original and copy) <hi>having the ſame ſtrength as if they had been executed before a notary public at Havannah.</hi>" The queſtion naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, and why was not this contract executed before a notary public at Havannah? An honeſt captain, who is reduced to the neceſſity of binding his owners to hard and uſual terms, would at leaſt take care that nothing ſhould be wanting in point of form and public notoriety to juſtify his conduct. And, beſides, I ſuſpect that this contract, which bears? printed ſeal or ſtamp, could not be legally execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

laws and cuſtoms, but in the preſence of a notary or ſome public officer. But it was not neceſſary to clear up theſe appearances, as the cauſe may be decided on other grounds.</p>
                     <p>UPON the whole, I adjudge and decree, that Canizares, the libellant, have and receive from Juan Joſeph de Aguire Perez, the reſpondent, the ſum of 112 dollars and 60-90ths of a dollar, equal to £. 42:5, Pennſylvania currency: that is to ſay:

                     <p>THE caſe was—The libellants engaged in the year 1782, with James Forbes, then captain of the ſhip Dolphin, for a mercantile voyage from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia to the Havannah, and back again; for which they were to receive, not monthly wages, but a ſtipulated ſum, to be paid them at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah. Whilſt the ſhip was at Havannah, the Spaniſh governor of Cuba had projected a military expedition againſt the iſland of New Providence, and offered conſiderable emoluments to ſuch Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans in port as would enter their veſſels in the Spaniſh ſervice, for this expedition: viz. 10 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars per ton for their veſſels, and a gratuity of 700 dollars to each captain. Forbes, after paying his crew the ſtipulated ſum for the original voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, propoſed to them this new expedition: an expedition not known, or thought of, at the time of the firſt contract, and of a nature entirely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:024407_1006_0FC72A2D8BFCE8A0"/>
from the ſervice for which they ſtood engaged to the ſhip. The mariners declined this propoſal, unleſs informed what recompence they were to have for their time and hazard in this new ſervice. Whereupon Forbes aſſured them of at leaſt 20 dollars per month to each man, and hinted further emoluments from the Spaniſh government. Thus aſſured, the mariners entered on the ſervice, and afterwards ſailed with the Spaniſh fleet, and were preſent at, and aſſiſtant in, the ſiege of New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                     <p>THE only queſtion ſeems to be, whether a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract expreſsly made ſhall be fulfilled or not?</p>
                     <p>WHEN the Spaniſh governor agreed to give 10 dollars per ton for American veſſels, and a gratuity of 700 dollars to each captain, he certainly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſuch veſſels ſhould be properly manned, and fitted for the ſervice. Captain Forbes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, and knowing alſo that the propoſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice could not, by any conſtruction, be conſidered as a part of the original voyage for which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners had contracted, enters upon a new treaty with them. Suppoſe theſe mariners had rejected the propoſed expedition, the captain could not have compelled them to go, but muſt have engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other ſeamen for the purpoſe. And there
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:024407_1007_0FC72A3092727538"/>
could have been no doubt but that the crew ſhould be paid according to contract. The preſent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellants are preciſely in the ſituation the new crew would have been in, and are equally entitled.</p>
                     <p>AS it is in teſtimony, that the libellants were at leaſt two months in the Spaniſh ſervice, I adjudge, that they have and receive from the reſpondent, <hi>fifteen pounds</hi> each; and that the reſpondent pay the coſts of ſuit, except ſuch part of the ſaid coſts as may have accrued by the taking certain depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which were not admitted as evidence, which coſts the libellants are to pay.</p>

l'Heureux, at Nantz, in France, on the 23d day of October, 1786, under an engagement for a voyage from the ſaid port of Nantz to New Orleans, in the Miſſiſippi; from thence to go to Martinique, and from thence to return to France: that Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Baudoin, the captain, had totally altered this voyage by repeated deviations, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was broken, and thereupon the libellant prays a diſcharge, and the amount of wages due.</p>
                     <p>THE circumſtances of this caſe, appear by the teſtimony, to be theſe:</p>
                     <p>THAT this veſſel ſailed from Nantz, October 3d, 1786: that the marines underſtood, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that this voyage was to be from Nantz to New Orleans; thence to the Weſt Indies, and thence back to Nantz, or to ſome port in France; and that it would continue from 10 to 15 or 16 months: that under this expectation, the mariners were regiſtered at the proper office at Nantz, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of regiſtering ſeamen in France: that inſtead of purſuing this voyage, as deſignated to them, they were taken three times to New Orleans, twice to Martinique, once to Aux Cayes, once to Havannah, and were now brought to the port of Philadelphia: that in the courſe of theſe ſeveral voyages, the libellant and others of
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:024407_1009_0FC72A338742B420"/>
the crew, made frequent complaints of the prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of, and deviations from, the originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended voyage, and had applied to the intendants of ſome of the ports they were at, demanding to be diſcharged, or taken back to France: but were detained in the ſervice of the ſhip, by repeated aſſurances of the captain, that from the then next intended port they ſhould ſail for France: that in particular, when they were at Martinique the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, the whole crew complained and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their diſcharge; whereupon the captain threw the boatſwain and another ſailor into priſon: and that the boatſwain wrote to the commanding offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of a frigate there, who ſent for him out of priſon, and obliged the captain to pay him the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges due, and diſcharge him.</p>
                     <p>TO this libel and teſtimony, the reſpondent hath urged in reply:</p>
                     <p>THAT no contract or articles between the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the crew of this ſhip have been exhibited: that the libel itſelf is deficient in form; and that let the deviations from the original voyage be what they may, the libellant hath for his part juſtified the whole, by ſigning a verbal proceſs on board the ſhip, on the 30th of April laſt, certifying that the ſhip l'Heureux had ſuffered damage by ſtorm,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:024407_1010_0FC72A3759034260"/>
and agreeing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> the port of Philadelphia in diſtreſs, which verbal proceſs ſo ſigned, has been exhibited in this court.</p>
                     <p>AS there is no ordinance of the United States, or act of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania touching the preſent object, the claim of the libellant, who is a French ſubject, and was ſhipped in France, will be beſt determined by the marine ordinances of the country to which he belongs, and under which he engaged in the ſervice of this veſſel. Theſe ordinances ſtrictly prohibit any captain or maſter of a veſſel from receiving on board his ſhip any mariner, as ſuch, who is not entered in his rolle d'equipage made up in the commiſſary's office, or bureau de claſſes of the port where the veſſel ſhall be. See, Ord. de Mar. vol i. p. 422. and p. 715. Now as it has not been denied but that the libellant has ſerved on board this ſhip ever ſince ſhe ſailed from Nantz, it is in vain to call upon him for proof of the contract made at Nantz, ſince the rolle d'equipage, or a copy of it, is always in the captain's hands, and never in the mariner's. Had no ſuch contract taken place as mentioned in the libel, or ſhould the libellant demand larger wages than had been agreed upon, the captain would have ſhewn the rolle d'equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page againſt him. As he has not done this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:024407_1011_0FC72A38C5B5F9A0"/>
in his power, it follows that the allegation of the libellant muſt be admitted as true. Indeed it is in poſitive teſtimony, that the libellant entered on board at Nantz, and was to receive fifty livers per month wages, which is ſufficient proof of a contract.</p>
                     <p>THE next point is to conſider the repeated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from the original voyage, and how far this ſhould operate in releaſing the mariner from his contract. To lay it down as a general rule, that the leaſt deviation from a deſignated voyage ſhould invalidate the articles and diſcharge the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners from the ſhip's ſervice, would perhaps be conſtruing thoſe articles too ſtrictly, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be very injurious to commerce. Shipping articles ought not to be judged by the ſame rules with a policy of inſurance, or a common law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, their object and ground of reaſon being quite different. Yet groſs and unneceſſary devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall free a mariner from his engagement. But there is no preſent occaſion to fix a general rule. This cauſe muſt be determined by poſitive law: and there is an ordinance of France expreſs to the purpoſe Mar. Ord. vol. I. p. 548. art. 4.— "If at any time after the arrival and diſcharge of the veſſel at the port of her deſtination, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or maſter, inſtead of returning, ſhall freight
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:024407_1012_0FC72A3C8D0344B0"/>
or load his ſhip to go elſewhere, the mariner may leave her if he chooſes, unleſs it has been otherwiſe determined by his ſpecial agreement." And this rule is further inforced by Valin's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the article.</p>
                     <p>THERE appears to me a ſtrong preſumption that the the boatſwain, who was paid and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at Martinique by order of the commander of a frigate there, claimed the benefit of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. It is ſaid, indeeed, that his mother was dead, and that he had buſineſs in France; but this I think would hardly be admitted as a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon to diſcharge a mariner in the midſt of a voyage. It is plain that Baudoin did not deem it ſufficient, for he put the man in priſon for deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his wages and diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>THE objections to the libel in point of form are not ſufficient to invalidate the ſuit. It is not indeed ſo ſpecific as might be wiſhed, but the ſubſtance of the complaint is alledged, viz. an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a certain voyage, a total deviation from that voyage, and a citation prayed for, to ſhew cauſe why the wages accrued ſhould not be paid, and the libellant diſcharged.</p>

But this cannot have the operation expected. If the ſhip was really in diſtreſs, there is no doubt but that any mariner would ſign his conſent to put into a ſtrange port to avoid impending danger, and refit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I am clearly of opinion, that if this cauſe was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before a French court of juſtice, the libellant could not be refuſed the benefit of the mariners ordinance expreſsly in favour of his claim.</p>
                     <p>I adjudge that the libellant ſhall have his wages, at the rate of fifty livers per month, from October 23d 1786; and that the reſpondent pay the coſts of this ſuit.</p>

                     <head>JOHN THYBOUT verſus ALEXANDER BAUDOIN.</head>
                     <p>THYBOUT was a mariner belonging to the ſame ſhip and under the ſame circumſtances with Charles Moran, libellant in the foregoing cauſe, but did not join in the libel with Moran; becauſe, as it was ſaid, the captain kept him on board con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined till the determination of that ſuit ſhould be known. But he now filed his complaint, claiming his wages and diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>COUNCIL for the reſpondent, in addition to their arguments in the former cauſe, alledged that the laſt voyage from New Orleans, was authoriſed by government to procure ſupplies for that city, which had juſt then ſuffered by a terrible fire; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the libellant had made a new contract at New Orleans, and was entered accordingly on the rolle d'equipage there. In proof of theſe alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:024407_1015_0FC72A4A2FA8CE40"/>
copies and tranſlations of the ſhip's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were offered in teſtimony. But the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant's council objected to the admiſſion of theſe papers. Whereupon an argument was had on this previous queſtion. After conſideration, the judge gave his opinion as follows.</p>
                     <p>THE queſtion now before me is—Whether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain papers, preſented to the court as copies and tranſlations of the manifeſt, rolle d'equipage, &amp;c. of the ſhip L'Heureux, reſpecting her laſt voyage from New Orleans, ſhall be admitted as teſtimony in the cauſe now in agitation, or not? And it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the deſign in procuring theſe papers is to prove, firſt, an authoriſed and neceſſary devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from the original voyage contracted for at Nantz; and, 2dly, a new engagement made by the libellant at New Orleans.</p>
                     <p>THE correctneſs of theſe copies, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the originals, are ſuppoſed to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the depoſition of Mr. John Leamy; and the fidelity of the tranſlations are certified by the notarial ſeals of ſworn interpreters.</p>
                     <p>THE fidelity of the tranſlations is, I think, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſcertained, becauſe the tranſlator is offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially known to the court, being commiſſioned by,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:024407_1016_0FC72A4E17F4BC78"/>
and anſwerable to government for the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his truſt. But it is not ſo certain what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall be ſufficient to authenticate the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of officers of a foreign country, ſo as to give them the force of legal teſtimony in our courts. The authorities that have been cited all refer to caſes, where the originals, the copies, and the certifying officers, were all within the realm of England, and therefore do not come up to the point in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>MR. Leamy's depoſition as to the authenticity of theſe papers is founded on his belief only, and not on poſitive teſtimony, as appears on his croſs examination in theſe words:
<q>The ſaid deponent being croſs-examined, ſaith, that he does not perſonally know any of the perſons who have ſigned any of the original papers before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, nor did he ever ſee any of them write: and that he, the deponent, had no papers in his cuſtody with the hands and ſeals of the above mentioned perſons to them, to compare the ſaid papers with, except the ſignature of the preſent governor, with which he did not compare them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT, ſecondly, it is manifeſt, that theſe papers were copied and tranſlated in this city, pending
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:024407_1017_0FC72A5A36182500"/>
this ſuit, and within the cognizance of the court. Why then were not the originals exhibited, that the tranſlations might be made by the direction, and under the authority of the court, after having had the opportunity of inſpecting theſe originals, and judging of their authenticity? It has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſhew that this could not be done<note n="*" place="bottom">The captain ſailed from the port during the ſuit, and took the original papers with him.</note>. But as the court of admiralty is always open, and as theſe papers were in the city for at leaſt ſome days, there was time ſufficient to have them compared, copied, and tranſlated by authority. The court hath a right to the beſt teſtimony that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with any reaſonable convenience; and as the originals of theſe papers were in the hands of the reſpondent's council, and they have not thought fit to file them as exhibits in the cauſe, I ſhall not now admit the copies taken by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. I think ſuch a precedent might have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous future conſequences.</p>
                     <p>THE argument then proceeded on the merits, and nearly the ſame grounds were travelled over, which had been taken in Moran's caſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="unknown:024407_1018_0FC72A61100AC408"/>AFTER adviſement, judgment was given as follows:</p>
                     <p>JOHN Thybout, the preſent libellant, having ſhipped at the ſame time, and under the ſame contract, with Charles Moran, whoſe ſuit was lately decided in this court, the teſtimony exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Moran's caſe has been applied to this.</p>
                     <p>THERE are only three new exhibits in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cauſe: viz. a proteſt made by captain Baudoin and his officers, ſoon after his arrival at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, dated the 17th of May laſt, and two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; one of William Matthié, a paſſenger on board the l'Heureux, and the other, a ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Baſtian Gaudin, who had given teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the former cauſe. The purport of the proteſt is to ſhew, that this ſhip was driven by a N. N. E. ſtorm into the port of Philadelphia, in diſtreſs, and the tenor of the two depoſitions tends directly to contradict the aſſertion of the proteſt.</p>
                     <p>FROM all that appears in teſtimony, this veſſel was bound from New Orleans to the port of Nantz in France: and Matthié, the paſſenger, received a paſſport from the governor's ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary at New Orleans, to be admitted on board
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:024407_1019_0FC72A620D6A3C10"/>
as a paſſenger to Nantz. How then it could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly happen, that this, or any other veſſel, being in the latitude of 25° 3′ north, ſhould be driven by a violent N. N. E. wind, to the latitude of 35° 4′ north, where the verbal proceſs was made on board, is to me quite incomprehenſible. But as I do not think the libellant's claim does at all depend upon the validity of either the verbal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or the ſubſequent proteſt, I ſhall obſerve no further upon them.</p>
                     <p>IT is manifeſt to me, that the libellant hath been detained in the ſervice of this ſhip an unreaſonable length of time beyond the period of the voyage contracted for: that the original agreement made at Nantz, between the captain and his crew, has been violated and diſſolved by frequent unneceſſary deviations: that the promiſes of the captain, at every deviation, to return immediately to France, have been repeatedly broken: and that, if this cauſe was tried before a French court, under the marine ordinances of that country, there is no doubt but that the libellant would recover his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and obtain his diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>I ſee no reaſon for diſtinguiſhing this from Charles Mora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> caſe: and therefore, I adjudge, that the libellant ſhall have his wages, at the rate
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:024407_1020_0FC72A64EF337730"/>
of 30 livres per month, from the 23d of October, 1786, to the 30th of June laſt; deducting 180 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres, which he acknowledges to have received: and that the reſpondent pay the coſts of ſuit.</p>

                     <lg>
                        <l>AS I ſat by the fire, the newſpaper read,</l>
                        <l>And waited for breakfaſt, my wife being in bed;</l>
                        <l>It came in my mind that I could not do better</l>
                        <l>Than to call for ſome paper, and write you a letter.</l>
                        <l>'Tis true I have nothing material to ſay,</l>
                        <l>But will mention what incidents fell in my way;</l>
                        <l>Our leaving <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and how we got hither,</l>
                        <l>Half tir'd to death, thro' wind and foul weather.</l>
                        <l>I mounted at nine, and ſet off on my journey,</l>
                        <l>Along with my brother-in-law the attorney;</l>
                        <l>Who took with him papers, ſo many and bulkly,</l>
                        <l>He found it convenient to ride in his ſulky.</l>
                        <l>We travell'd, and chatted, and made ourſelves merry,</l>
                        <l>And who ſhould we meet a few miles from the ferry,</l>
                        <l>But the <hi>great little man:</hi> the juſtice I mean,</l>
                        <l>Rever'd and belov'd by the ſwains of <hi>Chriſteen.</hi>

                        <l>He likewiſe related his caſe to the lawyer</l>
                        <l>In ſuch agitation, he work'd like a ſawyer;</l>

                        <l>For his ſtory was tedious, and caus'd a demur:</l>

                        <l>Stept into the boat, and there told the remainder;</l>
                        <l>The lawyer aſſented, or ſeem'd to aſſent,</l>
                        <l>To all that was ſaid—then forward we went.</l>

                     <p>N. B. This ballad was occaſioned by a real incident. Certain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, in the form of kegs, charg'd with gun powder, were ſent down the river to annoy the Britiſh ſhipping then at Philadelphia. The danger of theſe machines being diſcovered, the Britiſh manned the wharfs and ſhipping, and diſcharged their ſmall arms and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons at every thing they ſaw floating in the river during the ebb tide.</p>
