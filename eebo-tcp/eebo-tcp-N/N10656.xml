            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS what was ſaid in public on the following ſubjects, was delivered. almoſt entirely extempore, the author finds it impoſſible to give an exact copy. Thoſe things however, on account of which, he apprehends, a copy was deſired, have been carefully preſerved. The particular expreſſions could not be recollected, but the ideas are not loſt. Several new thoughts on the ſubject are interſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>THE author's general deſign is to awaken in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, proper ſentiments and emotions, reſpecting both ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and ſpiritual liberty. The former, without the latter, is but a body without a ſoul.—As the copy is ſo ſuddenly called for, the firſt, rough draught, goes to the preſs; and the author doubts not, but many imperfections will be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtile and manner; which however he truſts are leſs evils, than a delay at a time when every means, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imperfect, is needful, that may inſpire a genuine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of true liberty. He feels that he wants thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which many others enjoy, for becoming entirely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the various branches of civil liberty.—The main ideas alone are attended to. The inquiſitive mind will be able to draw a number of important conſequences.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AT firſt glance, it is certain, this text refers to a ſtate of <hi>perſonal</hi> ſervitude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to every inſtance of the ſame kind. It is alſo as clear that the Apoſtle exhorts the ſervant to prefer liberty. This proves that the inſpired writer himſelf, prefered liberty to a ſtate of ſervitude; for he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort another to prefer what was not preferable in his own eſteem. Now, if Paul eſteemed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal liberty a valuable inheritance, he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed the liberty of a community a far richer inheritance; for if one man's enjoyment of it was a good, the enjoyment of two muſt be a greater good, and ſo on through the whole community. From the ſame manner of reaſoning, the ſlavery of a community ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013502_0005_0F90A3C4D1124128"/>
to be a proportionably greater evil, than the ſlavery of an individual. Hence, we may obſerve from the text, that CIVIL LIBERTY IS A GREAT GOOD.</p>
            <p>THIS is the propoſition to which I aſk your preſent hour's attention, and if it ſhould appear in the ſequel to contain an important truth, you will not eſteem it below the goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's duty to explain and ſupport it in public, eſpecially at ſuch a time as this, a time, at the very proſpect of which, our generous fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have wept in bitterneſs of ſoul. If civil liberty is a great good, it ought to be deemed one of the bleſſings of Heaven; theſe it is the preacher's duty to illuſtrate, that we may feel the obligations they bring us under —that we may enquire whether we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them for the glory of the giver, and that we may know how to conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for the future. Be pleaſed then to give your candid, cloſe, and ſerious attention, while I endeavour to explain the nature of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil liberty, and prove that it is a great good.</p>
            <p>AS it is much leſs difficult to point out the nature of true coin in general, than to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether any particular piece is genuine, or how far it differs from the perfect ſtandard: So it is much eaſier to point out the general nature of civil liberty, than to ſay what degree of it enters into any particular civil conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013502_0006_0F90A3C62DB73770"/>
It is therefore moſt natural to enquire, in the firſt place, concerning the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of liberty; and indeed it is as neceſſary as natural. For until we determine this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have no rule by which we may eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the quantity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> liberty in any particular conſtitution: But when once we have found the ſtandard, we ſhall be prepared to examine our own conſtitution, or any other, at pleaſure, and to determine what part of the conſtitution ſhould be ſupported, and what may be given up with ſafety. An enquiry into the nature of liberty in general, is alſo needful on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account. Without it we cannot ſee the force of any evidence that may be brought to evince the value of liberty itſelf.</p>
            <p>THAT the ſubject may be fairly elucidated, I will endeavour to remove ſome miſtakes by which it has been obſcured. In doing this, I obſerve, that liberty does not conſiſt in perſons thinking themſelves free. The Jews could ſay we were never in bondage to any man though they wore the Roman yoke at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame time. Again, though a certain conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be contended for and ſupported by a majority of voices; yet this would be no ſure evidence that it is free: Becauſe an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred may as truly tyrannize over one, as one over an hundred; or otherwiſe, the majority may be in favour of licentiouſneſs. What but a love of licentiouſneſs or tyranny, or both,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013502_0007_0F90A3C6A54AC4A8"/>
can induce the heathen nations to approve of their ſeveral ſyſtems of government? What but theſe, could induce Saul and the men of Iſrael to perſecute David and his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? What but one or both of theſe drew down the fury of Sodom on Lot—of the Jews on the prophets—on Jeſus Chriſt— on his Apoſtles and their followers. What but theſe ever raiſed any one of the many terrible perſecutions under which the peaceable diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt have fallen from time to time? In all theſe inſtances the majority have been unfriendly to liberty.</p>
            <p>CIVIL Liberty conſiſts, not in any inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the members of a community; but in the being and due adminiſtration of ſuch a ſyſtem of laws, as effectually tends to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt felicity of a ſtate. Herein conſiſts civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to live under ſuch a conſtitution, ſo adminiſtered, is to be the member of a free ſtate; and he who is free from the cenſure of thoſe laws, may fully enjoy all the pleaſures of civil liberty, unleſs he is prevented by ſome defect, not in the conſtitution, but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>IF liberty conſiſts in the being and adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of a civil conſtitution, different from ſuch an one as has been mentioned, I muſt confeſs, my inference from the Apoſtle's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is not juſt. For certain it is, that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013502_0008_0F90A3C769F5E5C8"/>
ſo far as a conſtitution doth not tend, in the higheſt degree, to the greateſt felicity of the ſtate, collectively conſidered; it is a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evil and not a good.</p>
            <p>WHERE there is no ſyſtem of laws, not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but anarchy, takes place. Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of liberty may, indeed, exiſt where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſtitution nor the adminiſtration of it is perfect. But in order to perfect freedom, the law muſt extend to every member of the community alike, both in its requiſitions and prohibitions. Every one muſt be required to do all he can that tends to the higheſt good of the ſtate For the whole of this is due to the ſtate, from the individuals of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Every thing, however trifling, that tends, even in the loweſt degree, to diſſerve the intereſt of the ſtate muſt alſo be forbidden.</p>
            <p>ORIGINALLY, there were no private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>THE great God is the original owner of all things. He has, originally, no partner in any thing; but has been graciouſly pleaſed to invite his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are capable of enjoyment, to a joint parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his poſſeſſions, according to their various capacities.

                     </gap>cedent to the creation of this world, whatever exiſted was a kind of common ſtock enjoyed by God and thoſe of his creatures that could enjoy ſuch a good. All were to exert themſelves to turn every thing to the beſt advantage, for the whole, and no one of all God's creatures, could call any thing his own, in diſtinction from others, except the pleaſure that reſulted to him from the common good. There were no private intereſts then. Afterwards, God made the world, and this became an addition to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtock. The world itſelf, and all the creatures in it were enjoyed by God and his holy Angels. At length, Adam was formed out of the duſt of the earth. He was a new addition to the common ſtock of wealth, and being made capable of enjoyment, was received as a member of the grand company, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intereſted in God, Angels, Heaven and Earth, and all things in them. This world, a particular por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common ſtock, was committed, in certain reſpects, to him and his poſterity to be managed by them for the grand company. I ſay, in certain reſpects, for there are certain other reſpects in which it was not committed to them; in certain reſpects, God takes the care of it, in certain other reſpects, the Angels have the management of the world and all things in it. Each one has his particular department aſſigned to him, Adam and his poſterity are to be conſidered both as a part of the common intereſt, and as overſeers. They have nothing that they can call their own, to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the right, either of God or his Angels. Nor was there ever any thing in the world that any one could call his own, to the excluſion of his fellow men, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a ſtate of nature. Antecedent to compact, any one of all the individuals, had as good a right to lay claim to the ſame inheritance as another. Nay, any one had as good a right to exclude the reſt from the enjoyment of every part of the whole, as from any, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the leaſt part. Any one individual might mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize the whole earth by the ſame rule of juſtice, by which he could monopolize a ſingle acre, or inch. So that antecedent to compact, there could not poſſibly be any private intereſt whatever, and every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of private intereſt was the effect of violent ſeizure, and tenure, and not of juſt diſtribution. No man has a right to enter on any common intereſt without the order of the proprietors.</p>
                  <p>THERE are two modes in which earthly ſtates were originally formed. The one is, by the over grown influence of an individual, which put it into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to exerciſe an arbitrary government. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is by a compact formed with a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſecure and advance the private intereſts of thoſe by whom the compact was made. Both of theſe had their riſe in uſurpation. As to the firſt there is no diſpute. As to the ſecond it may be ſaid, that there were no private intereſts antecedent to compact, but ſuch as had been taken by uſurpation. It is true, that ſuch uſurpers may have appropriated ſuch intereſts as they called their own, without any reſiſtance; but this no more frees them from the charge of uſurpation, than it would a tyrant, for him to ſay that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſtate of abſolute monarchy gradually, and without reſiſtance. Stratagem, and the length of the ſword are the only ſtandards of right in either of theſe caſes. The abſolute monarch juſtifies himſelf, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had a majority of ſtrength in his favour, and the member of ſuch an aſſociation, as has been named, reſolved to enter on a combination, for the ſake of uſing his ſword in the beſt manner he could for the defence of what little he had, and conſented that his neighbours ſhould hold what they had appropriated, and determined not to attempt to diveſt them of the public intereſt they have ſeized, leaſt in the ſcuffle he ſhould loſe what he had as unjuſtly monopolized. This is the maxim on which pirates and gangs of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers live in a kind of unity. If we go on this maxim, if we ſuppoſe that is a well founded government which has its foundation in private intereſt, we can by no means blame the tyrant for holding abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without condemning ourſelves; nor can the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant blame his ſubjects for their rebellion, whenever they apprehend rebellion will be their greateſt emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     </gap> expected, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure will ſtand, when the foundation is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It matters not whether men who build their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of government on ſelf-intereſt, call themſelves whigs or tories, friends to prerogative, or to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people. Their ſcheme of government is the ſame for ſubſtance. They cannot blame their neighbour for commencing tory when it will be moſt conducive to his private intereſt. Indeed, on this ſcheme it is unreaſonable to withſtand a mob or a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or to make war on the pirates themſelves, for, according to this doctrine they are none of them doing any thing but what is right. Yes, ſay you, they infringe on my rights. I aſk, what rights? None but ſuch as you have pillaged from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity—Rights in which theſe very perſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted as members of the community.</p>
                  <p>THE world and its inhabitants, are a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty that belongs to the whole intellectual ſyſtem. They are committed to mankind to be managed for the whole. It is therefore the buſineſs of mankind collectively, to regulate and diſpoſe of the inheritance for the emolument of the whole company. In order to this, government in its various parts is neceſſary; and the ſeveral offices in the government become ſo many parts of the common good, or ſtock. Theſe, as well as the other parts of the common inheritance, are to be committed to individuals by the body of ſtewards, to be improved for the company of proprietors. Every individual is to have his part aſſigned him, and ſo long as he fills his place well, he is to be rewarded for his ſervices by the community, that is, he is to have the enjoyment of ſuch conveniences, in ſuch a degree as ſhall be a ſufficient recompence for his labour and care; but he is not to have any ſeparate intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him, for this would tend to detach him from the community. Juſt ſo far as his affection is turned on private intereſt, he will become regardleſs of the common good, and when he is detached from the community in heart, his ſervices will be very precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at beſt, and thoſe will not be expected at all which imply ſelf denial. He is only to enjoy it at the will of the commuity, which is to be regulated by the intereſt of the whole.</p>
                  <p>SOME are to be rewarded for their ſervices to the community by an exchange of commodities. Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſuch as merchants are, are to have a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the commodities they carry. Others are to be rewarded by a general collection from the whole. Thus each individual is to take care of the community, and the community in its turn, is to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the individuals.—Theſe obſervations afford us a clue to the relation that kingdoms and ſtates, and the internal part of individual ſtates, bear to each other. The whole world is properly, no more than a ſmall colony of the univerſe. But ſmall as it is it is too unweildy to be managed as one ſtate, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the feebleneſs of human powers. There is therefore a propriety in its being ſubdivided into ſtill ſmaller portions called kingdoms. It is the buſineſs of theſe ſtill to regard the good of the world, in ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the good of the univerſe. Neighbouring ſtates have no more right to riſe up againſt each other, than neighbouring individuals. Different ſtates are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in the welfare of each other and ought to ſeek the good of each other. One has no right to deviſe ſchemes to enrich itſelf by impoveriſhing another. The caſe is the ſame with reſpect to different parts of the ſame kingdom.</p>
                  <p>THIS is a ſcheme of government perfectly conſiſtent with the divine government, and true reaſon. And on this ſcheme we may conſiſtently exert ourſelves in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of liberty, and puniſh tyrants according to their juſt deſerts.</p>
                  <p>THERE is much ſaid about the prerogative of crowns. Crowned heads have indeed a prerogative of doing good, but no prerogative for any private emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The true honour of a King conſiſts in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good; but if he becomes an obſtacle in the way of public good, he is to be removed like other common nuiſances.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſcheme ſhews us, likewiſe, on what principles we are to ſtand ready to lay down our lives in the cauſe of liberty, or, which is the ſame thing, in vindication of good government. We, and all we have, belong to the communitity. Whenever therefore the common cauſe requires it, we ſhould, like Paul, be ready to lay down our lives for the brethren. It is but what we owe to the community.</p>
                  <p>OUR worthy forefathers, however they might great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err in ſome particular inſtances, ſeem to have been inſpired by this generous ſcheme of liberty. This was what led them to this new world, and I would hope that we their poſterity have too much of that ſpirit which led them to riſque their lives, to ſuffer ourſelves to be enſlaved by an India herb, or Engliſh manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               </note>. The world and all things in it, were the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013502_0009_0F90A3C8DE714238"/>
common intereſts of all the inhabitants, under God the great owner. Nothing is to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013502_0010_0F90A3C90807B5B8"/>
an intereſt any farther than it tends to good, or is capable of being turned to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the poſſeſſor. But whatever has this
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013502_0011_0F90A3C99FA53DF8"/>
tendency, or may be thus uſed, is properly termed an intereſt. According to this eſtimate, the term <hi>intereſt</hi> includes all thoſe various offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013502_0012_0F90A3CA61DD1528"/>
and employments that are capable of being improved for the good of the community. Theſe intereſts, being ſuch as cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013502_0013_0F90A3CB54EE8540"/>
by the whole body collectively, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed among the individuals according as they appear in the eyes of the body politic, to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013502_0014_0F90A3CD65231C50"/>
be qualified to uſe them for the good of the whole. In this way every member becomes a ſervant to the ſtate, and is a good or bad ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant according to the manner in which he diſcharges the truſt repoſed in him. This is equally true of the King on the throne and the peaſant in the field. The laws of a free ſtate require each individual to uſe the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts depoſited in his hands, in every inſtance
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013502_0015_0F90A3CEDFF5C340"/>
in that very manner that ſhall contribute moſt to the good of the community, without any particular reference to Governor or ſubject, rich or poor, high or low. While the laws require ſuch a continual courſe of conduct in every member of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they as critically forbid every one to take from another that part of the public property which is committed to him; or to impede him in making the beſt uſe of it for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, unleſs when the community ſee it beſt to deprive an individual of his place, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe another to do it in their name. In this manner the laws of a free ſtate provide ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the particular properties of each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual member, or rather for the public intereſt depoſited in the hands of individuals, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſuch penalties on every offender as are exactly adequate to his offence. There muſt be an exact proportion between the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and the penalty. Where there is no ſuch proportion, or equality, liberty is infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the law is partial, as it will injure, either the public, by not giving it its due, or the offender, by inflicting a greater evil than he deſerves. In this caſe there muſt be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, made by the law, between perſons of different characters and ſtations, only as thoſe different characters and ſtations may give the ſame criminal action different degrees of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. A criminal action is more criminal in a perſon who fills an elevated place, than in one
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013502_0016_0F90A3D055CB8B48"/>
of a more humble condition; becauſe it has a more detrimental aſpect on the ſtate. For this reaſon, the offences of the great ſhould be puniſhed with greater indignity and ſeverity, than the crimes of perſons in low life. In a perfectly free ſtate, friendſhip to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will be as carefully noticed as an offence. Puniſhment will not be more exactly alloted to the tranſgreſſor, than adequate rewards to the faithful ſubject. The farmer, the ſeaman, the mechanic, the merchant, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of ſuch of the learned profeſſions as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſtate, are directed by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in effect, to reward each other by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of labour, or commodities. While thoſe ſervants of the ſtate, who are employed in manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reins of government, are rewarded by a collection from the whole, an equality to which, is returned in the happy effects of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and executive juſtice. At the ſame time that the laws make due provſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution of rewards among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants of the ſtate, both of higher and lower rank, they make as full proviſion for the infliction of penalties on every claſs alike. They render it as eaſy to bring a royal offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to trial,—to procure an impartial ſentence againſt him, and to inflict deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the caſe of the meaneſt ſubject.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a ſtate, the laws extend to all the members of the ſociety alike, by making in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013502_0017_0F90A3D069E53C28"/>
impartial eſtimate of every offence, but as it is beſt in all communities, that ſome offenders ſhould be pardoned, for ſpecial reaſons, and that others ſhould be puniſhed; thoſe ſame laws will lodge a power of determining the alternative with ſome one, whoſe capacity and integrity are equal to ſuch a truſt, that ſo the community may ſuffer no harm.</p>
            <p>A GOOD foundation for liberty is laid in ſuch a conſtitution, but its whole worth lies in due adminiſtration. Perfect liberty takes place where ſuch a conſtitution is fully adminiſtred: But where the adminiſtration is imperfect, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is likewiſe imperfect. In a perfectly free ſtate, both the conſtitution, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it, are full of propriety, equality, and equilibrium.</p>
            <p>THESE I take to be the out lines of genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine liberty, which, by a proper application, may aſſiſt us in our enquiries after the degree of liberty enjoyed by any particular ſtate.</p>
            <p>INDEED, the circumſtances and occurrences, that attend human ſtates are ſo numerous, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenſive, and uncertain, that no one man, or body of men, can foreſee and improve them all to the greateſt advantage. Hence, it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that we cannot aſcertain the degree of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty enjoyed by a community, by comparing the particular parts of a conſtitution, or the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it, with the abſtract notion of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013502_0018_0F90A3D1EA7B4650"/>
for we ſee but a ſmall part of the whole ſyſtem. Our views are very partial. This is the caſe not only of individual ſubjects, but the body of government, itſelf, cannot, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, comprehend the whole. Some degree of partial oppreſſion is, therefore, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in every human ſtate, even, under the wiſeſt adminiſtration. We may, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, in ſome inſtances, whether liberty is unneceſſarily infringed or not. When we ſee the body of a community plundered for the ſake of indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ging individuals in pride, luxury, idle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſs and debauchery,—when we ſee thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands rewarded with penſions, for having ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deviſed, or attempted to execute ſome ſcheme for plundering a nation, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpotiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, we cannot be in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome horrid attack is not made on liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>WE may reaſon thus in a few particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but, in general, we muſt form our judgments by conſidering the various diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mankind, and by noticing their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious operations and effects, in various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. We muſt turn our attention to the facts that have already taken place; and may reaſonably conclude, that the ſame cauſes will always produce the ſame effects, unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpecial prevents. One general inference from the whole will be, that liberty is much rather to be expected in a ſtate where a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, firſt, inſtitutes, and then varies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013502_0019_0F90A3D36061D350"/>
according as they apprehend circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances require, than in any other.</p>
            <p>OTHER things being equal, a majority has a more general and diſtinct knowledge of the circumſtances, and exigencies of a ſtate than a minority; and, of conſequence, is more able to judge of what is beſt to be done. Add to this, that private intereſt is the great idol of the human mind; and, therefore, when a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority unite in any meaſures, it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they are ſuch meaſures as are beſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to ſecure the particular intereſts of the members of that majority; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the general intereſts of the body are more effectually provided for, in this way, than by the ſecurity of the private intereſts of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority whatever. And if the maxims adopted by the majority are general, both in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and extent, it is to be ſuppoſed, they will prove as ſalutary to the members of the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to thoſe of the majority, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to the whole body Hence, though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is not neceſſarily, nor invariably connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the voice of a majority; yet, it is much more likely to be found in connection with ſuch a voice, than with that of a minority. Indeed, there is in general, no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect liberty where a majority is counteracted, and, on the contrary, we may hope for ſome good degree of it, where a majority governs.</p>
            <p>IT is only on theſe maxims, that the preſent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013502_0020_0F90A3D42AD41C80"/>
Britiſh monarch can be exculpated from the ſeveral charges of rebellion, treachery, and uſurpation, and on theſe, the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in favour of the houſe of Hanover is perfectly juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>LET us now attend a little, to a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that may ſerve to excite in us ſome more adequate ideas of the worth of civil liberty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, none but an omniſcient mind can fully comprehend, and exactly eſtimate the true worth of this bleſſing, in its various conſequences, effects, and inſeparable concomitants, as they take place on various occaſions. Our views of this ſubject may, however, be greatly enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rendered much more diſtinct than they generally are.</p>
            <p>THAT civil liberty is of great worth, may be infered from the conduct of God towards the Jewiſh nation. He promiſed them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the oppreſſion of their enemies as a teſtimony of his favour in caſe of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and as a chaſtiſement for their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he threatned them with a ſtate of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. From this it is certain that the omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God himſelf, eſteems liberty a great bleſſing. The Iſraelites were taught by him to ſet their hearts much on liberty, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſlavery with great caution, conſtancy and vigour.</p>
            <p>IT was obſerved that liberty has its riſe in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013502_0021_0F90A3D4E0F1AB88"/>
ſuch a conſtitution as tends to the higheſt good of a community, and that the due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of ſuch a conſtitution affords a ſtate of freedom. Hence, the bare idea of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty diſcovers it to be an ineſtimable good, for whatever tends to the higheſt good of great numbers, muſt, undoubtedly, be an invaluable treaſure. In this view liberty is an inexhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fountain, which, under God, ſends forth an endleſs variety of ſuch ſtreams, as are both pleaſant and ſalutary. I will inſtance in a few particulars. When we enjoy liberty, and are ſure of its continuance, we feel that our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and properties are ſafely guarded by her watchful eye, her impartial diſpoſition and her powerful arm. This excites to induſtry, which tends to a competency of wealth. The vaſſal, on the other hand, having no ſecurity of his preſent poſſeſſions, or for thoſe he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, concludes ſo uncertain a prize is not worth the ſeeking, and therefore will do no more than barely ſerves to ſilence the clamours of neceſſity from day to day.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a ſituation, every bias of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind tends to idleneſs and poverty. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven generoſity itſelf will ſinks into inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and indolence; becauſe it loaths a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between tyranny and wealth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſes will do nothing that might eſtabliſh ſuch a connection, by ſtrengthening a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtate. Liberty not only removes every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013502_0022_0F90A3D5A56F2528"/>
out of the way of induſtry, frugality and wealth, but rouſes even indolence to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gives honeſt, laborious induſtry a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, ſprightly, cheerful air; but in a ſtate of ſlavery, ſloth hangs heavily on the heels of dumb, ſullen, moroſs melancholy. Induſtry and frugality ſpring from the ſame ſource, and are ſpontaneouſly productive of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The former moderates the appetites, while the latter forbids unneceſſary expence. This triple alliance is the natural parent of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent converſation and courteous behaviour. They calm the paſſions and urge even pride and avarice to mimic humanity, and every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſentiment. By theſe and ſuch means, they, both enable and diſpoſe us to fulfill our contracts<note n="*" place="bottom">CONTRACTS are ſacred things. The man that doth not feel himſelf bound by them, is totally incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated for political intercourſe with mankind. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the depravity of human nature, we all deteſt the man who breaks his faith wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h us. One great end of civil government, in this apoſtate world, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to fulfill their contracts. Should the laws of a realm allow the ſubjects to break over their contracts at pleaſure, the very conſtitution would contain the ſpirit of anarchy: And when thoſe in the ſeat of government become regardleſs of their contracts, and break through them, in ſo doing, they throw the ſtate, directly, into the depths of anarchy, and force becomes the only law: For a default of one party in covenant ſets the other at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When Kings, therefore, infringe on chartered rights they diſſolve all manner of union between themſelves and their ſubjects. The obligation is mutual, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party can fail to fulfill the conditions on his part, without ſeting the other free. Both parts of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are equally ſacred, for a King, therefore, to break that which ſubſiſts between him and his people, is as criminal as for the people to renounce their allegiance to him. If this be ſo, it ought to be made a capital offence, for any ſubject to endeavour to inſpire his ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign with the notion that he is at liberty to break his faith with his ſubjects. It ought to be deemed the moſt aggravated kind of high treaſon; becauſe he at once dethrones the King, and ſubverts the conſtitution of nature itſelf. In the Britiſh nation, every right is held by charter. When, therefore Britiſh legiſlators begin to talk ſeriouſly of the right of an Engliſh King to diſannul his royal charters, is it not high time for the whole nation to awake? If a ſingle charter is broken in upon, who can depend on the ſecurity of any enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Awake, Britons awake! nor ſuffer your King to be dethroned. Let <hi>truce breakers</hi> and <hi>traitors</hi> turn to the third chapter of the ſecond epiſtle to Timothy, if they know where to find it, and read the four firſt verſes and obſerve with whom they are ranked by their Maker.</note> with exactneſs, and ſo give us cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with our neighbours, and lay a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013502_0023_0F90A3D6791EC5B0"/>
for public confidence. In this manner li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty renders political virtue faſhionable, and tends to diffuſe public ſpirit. It diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances diſorder, and every narrow diſpoſition. Thus the mind is fortified on all ſides, and rendered calm, reſolute, and ſtable. Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and temperance give health to the body, and render it fit for the reſidence and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013502_0024_0F90A3D738949E80"/>
of ſuch a ſoul. In a nation raiſed to ſuch a pitch of vigor, firmneſs, health and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, all the natural means of defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are collected, and to ſuch the arts of war will be an eaſy acquiſition. Theſe united, will prove a bulwark againſt every aſſault of lawleſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether foreign or domeſtic. In ſuch a ſtate, a free people will enjoy compoſure of ſoul and their taſte will become refined. The ſtudy of the fine arts will follow of conſequence, and, after theſe, a long train of ſcience. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, frugality, and a curious turn naturally invent and perfect the uſeful arts. What is more than all, liberty ſecures the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by protecting every member of the ſtate in the free exerciſe of his religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſuch a religion as is inconſiſtent with the good of the ſtate. The firſt effects of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, on the human mind, are calmneſs, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and pleaſing hope; and all the various fruits of liberty produce the ſame happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Thus liberty, firſt divides itſelf, as it were, into various ſtreams; which, at length, all meet together again in ſoothing ſenſations and ſweet emotion of ſoul. The pleaſure that ſprings from liberty is the life of every other enjoyment, and the importance of it in a ſingle inſtance is vaſtly great, too great to be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, unleſs on a ſudden tranſition from a ſtate of refined freedom, to that of the moſt abject ſlavery. How great then muſt be the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive happineſs that a community drives from
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013502_0025_0F90A3DA0D8CFE80"/>
a ſtate of perfect freedom? I confeſs liberty never has been enjoyed in perfection by any of the nations of the earth; but this by no means affects the foregoing eſtimate. For, from the ſmall degree of liberty, with which we are acquainted, the conſequences of perfect liberty may be juſtly inferred. Nor is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of liberty, as it hath taken place in the world, any diſcouragment to the purſuit of it. The more we can obtain, the greater will be our enjoyment. Each degree of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a precious pearl.</p>
            <p>WHEN we would learn how much any thing tends to happineſs, we muſt view it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the taſte of the perſon in whom the happineſs is ſuppoſed to take place. So, the happy tendency of liberty cannot be ſeen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be viewed as terminating on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſpoſition in him by whom it is enjoyed. Liberty is ſo illy calculated to give pleaſure to either a tyrannical, or, licentious ſpirit, that it proves a galling curb to both. A free ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,—a ſpirit that is conſonant to a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;—a ſpirit that ſeeks the higheſt good of a community, in its proper place,—this, and this only, can extract and taſte all the ſweets of liberty. If we would learn how great a tendency liberty has to produce hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, we muſt conſider it in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as give it an opportunity to do good.</p>
            <p>LET us then, for once, imagine a ſtate whoſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013502_0026_0F90A3DA211B20D0"/>
members are all of a free ſpirit; and then attend to the glory and pleaſures of liberty. The individuals are all of one mind. They unite in the ſame grand purſuit, the higheſt good of the whole. Only ſuppoſe all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuch a ſtate to be acquainted with the beſt means of promoting their general end; and we ſhall ſee them all moving in perfect concert. The good of the body will be their firſt aim. And in ſubſerviency to this, they will impartially regard the particular intereſts of individuals. You and I ſhall perfectly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in our regard for your intereſt and for mine. Your intereſt will not be the more dear to you, nor the leſs ſo to me, becauſe it is yours. In theſe circumſtances, there would be no room for the emotions of any of the angry painful paſſions; but, on the contrary, every ſoft and pleaſing affection of every ſoul, would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth into vigorous and harmonious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Every individual would chooſe to move in his proper ſphere, and that all others ſhould move in theirs. This would at once conſtitute pure felicity, and exalted beauty. How <hi>good</hi> and how <hi>pleaſant</hi> it is for brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unity: Such a ſtate of things, in the little community of a ſingle family, muſt be productive of great good. But ſhould it take place throughout a nation, each family would enjoy the ſame good from its own domeſtic circumſtances, beſide the far greater pleaſure which would accrue to each individual from a conſideration of the ſame happy condition of the whole.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:013502_0027_0F90A3DADE3B70E0"/>SHOULD it be ſaid, that ſuch a ſcheme as has been mentioned is merely chimerical and roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ic; becauſe there never has been, nor ever will be ſuch a general ſtate of mind on earth; I would ſay, the ſame objection is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſtrong againſt the worth of a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs. Such a ſtate has never taken place, in perfection, in this world, nor will it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but muſt we therefore ſuppoſe that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is of no worth? The reaſon why we do not experience all the pleaſures of liberty, that have been mentioned, is, not any defect in liberty, but the perverſeneſs of our ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh hearts, which prevents our purſuit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the delights of perfect liberty. Liberty ſtill remains a bleſſing too great to be compared with any other earthly good.</p>
            <p>THE thoughts that have been ſuggeſted in this diſcourſe, open to us the nature of good government in its ſeveral branches. A legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature is denominated good, from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its laws, or, from the tendency of the laws made by it to produce the higheſt good of the community. In exact proportion to this tendency of the laws, is the legiſlature to be eſteemed good:—The goodneſs of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive government, conſiſts in its due adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the laws already made. It is for the good of the community alone, that laws are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be made or executed. So that,</p>
            <p>GOOD government is not inconſiſtent with
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013502_0028_0F90A3DC943D2700"/>
liberty. Perfect liberty and perfect govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are perfectly harmonious, while tyranny and licentiouſneſs are inconſiſtent with both. Yea farther,</p>
            <p>GOOD government is eſſential to the very being of liberty. Remove good government, and you remove liberty. Abridge the former and you abridge the latter. Let good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment encreaſe and you encreaſe liberty. Theſe can never be ſeparated in any degree. Their riſe and fall is exactly uniform. Hence,</p>
            <p>THE impropriety of ſaying of a perſon, that he is a friend to government, but not to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of another, that he is a friend to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not to government, appears to be very groſs. Indeed one man may be a friend to tyranny and not to liberty, but then he is as truly an enemy to government. Another may be a friend to licentiouſneſs and not to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but then he is as truly an enemy to liberty; and both, for this plain reaſon, that good government in a ſtate, and the liberty of that ſtate, are one and the ſame thing. This ſuggeſts another idea, which is, that</p>
            <p>HE who infringes on liberty rebels againſt good government, and ought to be treated as a rebel. It matters not what ſtation he fills; he is a traitor; his treachery is, however, more or leſs aggravated in proportion to his ſtate and condition. He that fills an elevated ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013502_0029_0F90A3DDEDAB0A40"/>
is proportionably more criminal in the ſame rebellion, than thoſe in a lower ſtate; and where a man proves falſe to confidence repoſed in him, his treachery is ſtill more baſe and deteſtable. Becauſe his exaltat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on puts it into his power to do greater injury to the ſtate than could poſſibly be done by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior.</p>
            <p>IT is equally true, that every kind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of oppoſition made againſt good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an ebullition of licentiouſneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">The true ſpirit of a mob conſiſts in unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal violence, done with a deſign to bring about ſome private end, and therfore the term is alike applicable to armies, or navies, or a mixed multitude of madmen, minors and ſlaves when they are engaged in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional violence, and they are dangerous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their elevation, influence, diſcernment and malice. All of them are evils and ought to be avoided.</note> The man that riſes up againſt good government is an enemy to liberty, a tyrant in heart, and they who are diſcontented and fretful under it are of the ſame caſt.</p>
            <p>IF liberty is ſuch a thing, and ſo great a bleſſing as it has been repreſented, it is, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, a rich tallent that Heaven has been pleaſed to entruſt with every man, and it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly becomes all to be conſtantly, and thoroughly awake to a ſenſe of their duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it. We are too ready to fancy, that when once we have appoined legiſlators, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013502_0030_0F90A3DEA6CA7B20"/>
given them charge of this ineſtimable treaſure, we need give ourſelves no farther concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. But this is not our whole duty. We are all ſtewards, to whom the God of nature has committed this talent. The deſign of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a few individuals to government, is not to free the reſt from their obligations but to aſſiſt them in the diſcharge of their duty, in the ſame manner that miniſters of the goſpel are to aſſiſt their hearers in thoſe duties that reſpect the care of their ſouls. Communities ought therefore to keep an impartial and watchful eye on government. They are urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo, by a conſideration of the avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and aſpiring diſpoſitions of mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the peculiar opportunities and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that Governors have to indulge them. In theſe latter ages of the world, after it has been found by ſeveral thouſands years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that ſuch as have been made the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of liberty, have in almoſt every inſtance, where it was thought practicable, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make themſelves maſters, inſtead of continuing ſtewards of the community; in theſe days, I ſay, we are more diſtinctly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and frequently called on to watch the conduct of government. Liberty is not an abſolute right of our own, if it were, we might ſupport, and guard, or neglect it at pleaſure. It is a loan of heaven, for which we muſt account with the great God. It is therefore, as unreaſonable for us to place an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013502_0031_0F90A3DF66878298"/>
confidence in any earthly ruler, as to place ſuch a confidence in our ſpiritual miniſters and depend wholly on them to ſettle our final account with the holy judge of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>I DO not mean that we ſhould, as individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, undertake to dictate to our rulers, or oppoſe them by force whenever we judge they act a wrong part. This would be utterly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, for ſurely we have at beſt, no better right to uſurpation than they. What I mean is, that we ſhould all endeavour to turn the attention of our fellow members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity on the conduct of our rulers. We ſhould notice and compare it with the ſtandard of right and wrong ourſelves; and excite others to do ſo like wiſe. We ſhould endeavour on every alarming occaſion, to collect the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body, and vigorouſly purſue thoſe meaſures that are thought the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary for the whole.</p>
            <p>IT becomes us, with united hearts, to make a firm ſtand againſt every attempt to wreſt the jewel from us, either by force or fraud:— The preſent ſtate of things is very alarming. In the view of the moſt ſimple common ſenſe, we are now called on—men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are called on to ſtruggle for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe rights of mankind which are inexpreſſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall we renounce the authority of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſovereign? Shall we take up arms againſt his troops? What ſhall we do?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, By no means. Do not ſuffer the thought of renouncing our king's authority, ſo much as to turn in your min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Never let us think of entering on a civil war, unleſs the Pretender, or ſome other uſurper ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to dethrone the Britiſh parent of his people. But ſhould this be the caſe, then let the world ſee that their king is dearer to the Americans than their blood.</p>
            <p>THOUGH the time has been, when our countrymen, but an handful, were obliged to defend themſelves againſt thouſands of the native ſavages; by dint of arms; yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, a cloud, in ſome reſpects, much heavier than that, low<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nothing more than piety and oeconomy are neceſſary, and in theſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age and character may unite. The pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſupplications of the ſtammering child will as effectually reach the ear of our God, and be as acceptable to him, as the moſt elegant addreſs.

He ſaw, he had deſerved ſo illy at God's hand, that it was no wonder, he had brought ſuch a puniſhment on him. He, therefore, accepted it willingly at the hand of God; while he was not inſenſible to the wickedneſs of Shimei. It becomes us, likewiſe, to notice the hand of God, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it in our minds, that evil ſprings not out of the ground,—that there's no evil in the city which the Lord hath not done. Under ſuch views, let us all, like Daniel of old, piouſly pour out our hearts before God, acknowledging our own ſins, and thoſe of our people. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, let us encourage no practice, in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, that tends to enſlave our coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try. Let us learn to live in the plain manner of our fore-fathers. It is high time for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. We have had a rich inheritance and waſted it in riotous living.

Such is our ſtate, that each individual has a proportion of influence on ſome neighbour at leaſt; he, on another, and ſo on; as in a river, the following drop urges that which is before, and every one through the whole length of the ſtream has the like influence. We know not, what indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals may do. We are not at liberty to lie dormant until we can, at once, influence the whole. We muſt begin with the weight we have.

            <p>THE general nature of liberty is the ſame in all ſocieties, though different circumſtances give it different appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance The ſame general principles that are the foundation of good government in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily are as truly ſo in the government of a nation. Theſe maxims are applicable not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to earthly ſocieties, but are equally ſo to the eternal kingdom of the great God. That government and that liberty which takes place in earthly communities is called domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic or civil, according to their extent. When theſe are ſpoken of as belonging to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, they are termed divine or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. The propriety of the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made uſe of in our text, depends on the truth of theſe obſervations. In the thirty firſt verſe of the context, we are told, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to thoſe Jews which

believed on him, If ye continue in my words ye are my diſciples indeed; and ye ſhall know the truth and the truth ſhall make you free. It ſeems as though they did not apprehend he was ſpeaking of ſpiritual liberty but of civil, and therefore anſwer, We be Abraham's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE principal thought in the text, and what I propoſe to dwell on at preſent is, that,</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of liberty into which Jeſus Chriſt introduces his diſciples is far preferable to any ſtate of earthly liberty.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject to which we attended in the forenoon, is vaſtly important; but this is as much more important, as ſpiritual enjoyments are preferable to thoſe that are temporal; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity to time; and as all the final hoſt of Heaven, which will be compoſed of God, Chriſt, Angels and Saints, are preferable to the handful of duſt and aſhes that compoſe an earthly empire. It is a ſubject much more intereſting to us, as well as more important in itſelf. Let me then beg your moſt diligent, conſcientious and unbiaſed attention, while I endeavour to illuſtrate and improve the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation juſt now deduced from the text.</p>
            <p>IT was ſaid in the former diſcourſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013502_0041_0F90A3E9ED69ABE0"/>
conſiſts in the being and due adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of ſuch a ſet of laws, as tend to the higheſt good of the ſociety. If this be ſo, it follows that liberty in a ſtate is greater or leſs in exact proportion to the greater or leſs ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the conſtitution and its adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the higheſt good of the community collectively conſidered. If therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, on examination, that the conſtitution of Chriſt's kingdom and the adminiſtration of that conſtitution have a ſtronger tendency to the good of that kingdom, than the conſtitution of any earthly kingdom, and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that conſtitution, have to the higheſt good of that earthly kingdom; the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is illuſtrated and proved.</p>
            <p>IN a perfectly free ſtate the laws forbid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very crime againſt the community. Every action that would be in the leaſt degree inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the ſtate is forbidden. In order to this, the legiſlature muſt have a perfect view of all the various circumſtances and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that may take place with reſpect to each individual of which the ſtate is compoſed, at all the various periods of its exiſtence. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſeem to us too minute to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have their conſequences, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vaſtly important and intereſting to the ſtate.

            <p>IT is impoſſible for any finite mind or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of minds, to aſcertain every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar word and geſture that may be detrimental in its tendency to the ſtate, and therefore, there cannot poſſibly be a ſyſtem of human laws in which every political evil ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
            <p>THE liberty of the moſt refined kingdoms of this world, is but like the lean, ſcanty glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the vintage, while the liberty of the kingdom of Chriſt is like the full grown cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the firſt ripe fruits that load the generous vine. Such is the weakneſs of the human mind, and the perple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed ſtate of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, that neither any community nor its wiſeſt delegates, could make ſufficient provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt all political inconveniencies, even though they were quite free from every ſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſign, unleſs they were under the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al influence of miraculous inſpiration from God. In order to ſuch an effectual precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they muſt foreſee all the various mental ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of every member of the community; and be able to judge, at the trial of every ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed offender, what the real motives of his conduct have been; becauſe men are blame worthy or not, according to the meaning of their hearts. But we cannot obtain any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               </gap> appears that no political conſtitution on earth can extend its authority any further than to a few of the many external expreſſions either of friendſhip, or diſaffection to the ſtate. For this reaſon, the moſt compleat ſyſtem of earthly government imaginable, falls immenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of a finiſhed ſcheme. This however is nothing, in compariſon with another incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that ariſes from the depravity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, which leads every man, in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſs degree, to look on his own things and not on the things of another; to ſeek their own private intereſt, without regarding the intereſts either of their fellow men, the angels, or the deity, any farther than they may ſeem ſubſervient to private intereſt. We have, indeed, reaſon to hope, that a few are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſeſſed of ſome ſmall degree of a different ſpirit;—a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſintereſted benevolent ſpirit: But there is reaſon to believe, that by far the greater part of theſe are to be found among the lower claſſes of mankind, and that a very ſmall proportion of them are among the great. From theſe conſiderations we may conclude, that, though it is the duty of Kings and all
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013502_0044_0F90A3ED37F8C028"/>
other rulers to ſeek the beſt good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, yet they too often act a part directly opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſite. Inſtead of improving their power and intereſts for the good of the community, they make uſe of the common intereſts as means of aggrandizing themſelves and their families. This ſentiment is confirmed by the hiſtory of Kings, and other rulers in every age of the world. We muſt therefore conclude that the higheſt degree of liberty that can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected in earthly ſtates is very low. At beſt, there are only ſome ſpices of liberty ſcattered in earthly ſtates, and yet theſe are more precious than we can conceive. But,</p>
            <p>IN the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, there is no reaſon to app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ehend any ſuch inconveniency or imperfection. For the conſtitution of his kingdom, and the adminiſtration of it, are the effects of the pleaſure of him who ſearcheth the hearts, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yeth the reins of all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and is at all times perfectly acquainted with every deſign of all his rational creatures. It was, therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, perfectly eaſy for him to form a conſtitution, which ſhould never need the leaſt alteration in order to the beſt good of the univerſe. He is as powerful as wiſe, and therefore, can adminiſter this conſtitution with the utmoſt preciſion in every inſtance. Both his wiſdom and power are all-ſufficient. This being granted, nothing can be wanting in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring about the higheſt good of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, except it be a diſpoſition in Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013502_0045_0F90A3ED9E3615C8"/>
to employ his knowledge and power for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urpoſe. If he has ſuch knowledge and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and a full, invariable, eternal inclination to employ his knowledge and power in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the higheſt good of the univerſe, the deſign cannot poſſibly be fruſtrated. The united exertion of ſufficient ſkill, power and inclination will forever obtain its end. Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſkill and power will in every inſtance, without exception, carry all ones deſigns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. Now, that Jeſus Chriſt has ſuch a diſpoſition is evident from his being no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons.</p>
            <p>FOR, we ſee, he has in fact done very many things, which, beyond all diſpute, are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of deſign, and not of inadvertency. Now, if thoſe things are done by deſign, and yet not from any partial reſpect to any perſon, what, but a regard to the whole, could be the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe? And, if regard to the whole be the moving cauſe of all that Chriſt has done, is doing, and will do, muſt we not conclude, the higheſt good of the whole is his higheſt, and only ultimate end? We cannot ſuppoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, without believing, that Chriſt is a being of mixed and jaring affections, which would imply great imperfection indeed. The diviſion of one's affections between two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent objects, always creates a painful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in ſuch a caſe, the paſſions of the mind are in a confeſſed ſtate of oppoſition, which is ever productive of painful ſenſations of ſoul —
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013502_0046_0F90A3EFDA43B588"/>
We muſt, therefore, believe that Jeſus Chriſt aims, with the utmoſt ſtrength and uniformity of deſign, at the higheſt good of the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or elſe, that he is an inconſiſtant, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a miſerable being.</p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST has in his mediatorial work, given the higheſt poſſible evidence of the moſt diſintereſted attention to the higheſt good — Since he is an omnipotent being, what reaſon can be given why he did not call down the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable hoſts of mighty angels from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to deſtroy his perſecutors, or why he did ſpeak them unto hell; unleſs it be, that he is infinitely benevolent. Such was his regard for the higheſt good, that he held not his own life dear, and what is far more, he delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the hands of his moſt unrighteous, invete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate, malicious and deteſtable enemies, to be treated according to the dictates of their accurſed pride and malice. He clearly ſaw how much their haughtineſs, and revenge would be gratified in his meek ſubmiſſion to the croſs, and his bitter agonies on the tree. And yet, ſuch was his regard to the general good, that he chearfully gave them an opportunity to gratify their perverſe inclination, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in exiſtence while they did it.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations are enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that there is as much, and as pure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the kingdom of Chriſt, as unlimited wiſdom, power and goodneſs can poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013502_0047_0F90A3F14F07B3B8"/>
and how inconceiveably greater, and more excellent muſt this be, than any thing of the kind that can take place under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ignorant, impotent ſelfiſh men. The Lord of hoſts hath propoſed his kingdom to ſtain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.</p>
            <p>WHILE the members of Chriſt's kingdom are paſſing through this world; they reſemble the children of Iſrael, in their paſſage from their ſlavery in Egypt, along the wilderneſs, and their various enterprizes until they were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſettled in the land of Promiſe. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble an enſlaved people, who having heard of a land of liberty, reſolve to puſh their way through many barbarous nations until they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the happy region on which they have fixed their eye. The prince has ſent them a leader with ſuch a guard as ſhall finally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them ſafely to the land of reſt; but not wholly prevent the incurſions of their enemies, on their paſſage. They muſt never lay down their arms, nor quit a poſture of defence. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are called to a ſteady warfare, a conſtant ſkirmiſh all along through the wilderneſs of this world. Their adverſaries who oppoſe their paſſage through it, are artful, vigilant, active, experienced, powerful and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſevering. They are principalities and powers. This renders the happineſs of Chriſt's ſubjects in this world, very imperfect. They do not fully enjoy the liberty of his kingdom until they come liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013502_0048_0F90A3F163BBE360"/>
unto Mount Sion, the holy city of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to the innumerable company of angels, to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born that are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant. But when once they have entered into heaven, they ſhall have the full enjoyment of this liberty, in its full extent. Then their hearts will be wholly conformed to the free conſtitution of Chriſt's kingdom, ſo that it will be a delightful employment for them to ſtudy his glorious ſcheme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—to range through its vaſt extent, and to collect the honey of paradiſe from the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flowers with which it abounds It will give them ſuch ſatisfaction to attend to the almoſt innumerable inſtances of the divine adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, as never entered into the thought of man They will ſee, with conſummate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how that adminiſtration has terminated in the higheſt good in every inſtance. They will ſee, how every inſtance has afforded an additional illuſtration of the divine glory, while they have all without exception, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to repreſent all unfriendlineſs to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe in its own deteſtable colours. In this manner, they will enjoy all the liberty that has taken place in heaven before their entrance into that world. While their hearts are pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the advancement of the higheſt good of the univerſe, which conſiſts in the fulleſt,

and cleareſt diſplay of the divine perfections, thoſe glorious perfections will be exhibited before their eyes, as fully as their minds are capable of conceiving, and as their capacities expand, the diſplays will encreaſe before them. They will ſee God in every thing, and all things will ſenſibly be working together for the good of all ſuch as love God, whether ſaints or angels. This will afford unmixed pleaſure to the holy ſubjects of this heavenly kingdom, whoſe hearts will be full of a free ſpirit, a ſpirit that will long for the higheſt good, and greateſt perfection of the univerſe, and earneſtly deſire that all beings, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be diſpoſed of in that very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ſhall moſt contribute to this end. In ſuch a ſtate the various ſprings of joy will be numberleſs and inexhauſtable. There will be nothing in God or any of his loyal ſubjects, or in any thing done by them, that can give the leaſt uneaſineſs. But on the contrary the ſoul will enjoy a ſweet acquieſcence in all the works, and ways of God, and be carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt reſpecting the tender friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of angels to the glorious God, to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and to itſelf.

He has, in fact, laid down his life for them, and they are freely willing to lay down their's for him, on the firſt intimation of his pleaſure that they ſhould do ſo. Of this many have given an example at their death, and the reſt are of the ſame diſpoſition. The ſaint in Heaven ſees the univerſal, pure and unlimited benevolence of Jeſus Chriſt in all his form r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>conduct, and in his preſent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration he diſcovers the ſame thing. All the ſaints and angels will moſt evidently, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame ſpirit according to the utmoſt ſtretch of their ſeveral capacities. From the paſt and preſent the ſaint will infer the future. He ſees how the wiſdom of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign has reduced the utmoſt confuſion to perfect order, and that it has proved all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without exception, and that in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of inſtances where the moſt laboured, and promiſing efforts of the old ſerpent's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have been baffled with the utmoſt eaſe and by the moſt unlikely means: How he has with infinite facility, overthrown the united force of earth and hell, and confined all his enemies by the word of his power, in the bottomleſs pit. That his friendſhip to liberty is ſuch, as that, to eſtabliſh and perfect it, he of his own free will, laid down his life in oppoſition to the moſt alluring proſpects Theſe things give the ſaint an unlimited confidence, that his Lord
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013502_0052_0F90A3F520F1EDF0"/>
will perſevere in the ſame deſign, and forever riſe ſuperior to every difficulty. From a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the conſtant ſucceſſion of ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorious events that have been brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by the Lord Jehovah, the ſaint continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expects to meet with many things, that at preſent, he entirely out of ſight, which, when they appear will, if poſſible, be ſtill more ſurpriſing and glorious. And though he may not ſee how it is poſſible for the univerſe to be rendered more perfect, yet he will expect to ſee it riſing in perfection forever and ever: Nor will theſe expectations be fruſtrated; for new worlds of wonder and joy will be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually riſing to view. His ſurpriſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light will, in every new inſtance, exceed all he ever experienced before. In ſuch a ſtate as this, the ſoul will eternally ſoar—and ſoar, up the immenſe tracts of knowledge, holineſs, honour and joy, with the utmoſt rapidity and eaſe. There will not be a ſingle object, or thought, to excite terror or pain; but all things will conſpire to fill the ſoul with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite delight, and to awaken ſentiments full of generoſity, tenderneſs and grandeur.</p>
            <p>THE ſaint will never be required to do any thing irkſome or diſagreeable, becauſe his heart will ſpontaneouſly chooſe to do, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his ſovereign will chooſe to command. Thus while the laws of Chriſt will be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtandard of the thoughts and exerciſes of all, every one will be a law to himſelf. They
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013502_0053_0F90A3F5DFB0EE28"/>
will need to do nothing more than comply with their own inclination, in order to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect compliance with the will of Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame mind will be in them, that is alſo in Chriſt. Though there may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs different ranks and ſtations in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly world, yet no one will complain that he is not exalted according to his worth; but on the contrary, all will wonder that their king has raiſed them to their preſent pitch of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Every one will eſteem the reſt better than himſelf. While they all, chearfully give themſelves and one another, to their Lord, to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure, envy and the ten thouſand ills that follow it, will find no place in all the holy kingdom of God.— Here, therefore, liberty reigns in perfection, and is perfectly enjoyed. But, alas! how vaſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is the happieſt earthly ſtate? It is at moſt but a ſmall degree of liberty that is enjoyed on earth, and that is ſeldom arrived at, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept through blood and carnage. And after it is bought at ſo dear a rate, the ſweets of it are conſtantly daſhed with many a bitter. It is at beſt, a very precarious enjoyment, and as ſhort as precarious. There is an infinite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe two.</p>
            <p>HOW abſurd then is it for us to neglect the former, while we are anxiouſly concerned to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the latter?</p>
            <p>HOW ſtrangly inconſiſtent are we in treating
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013502_0054_0F90A3F810DB1FE0"/>
that liberty, which is of infinite worth, with neglect and contempt, when it is moſt freely offered us, while, at the ſame time we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſacrifice, not only our fortunes, but our very lives and friends to purchaſe and defend that which at beſt is but imperfect, uncertain and temporal? To ſtruggle for the latter is laudable, but to neglect the former, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely criminal. Surely none but a madman would neglect millions which he might have at pleaſure, and yet barter his life for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain penny. In the affair of civil liberty, the moſt ſpirited efforts may prove ineffectual; but that which is ſpiritual will certainly be the conſequence of a ſingle genuine deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it. What makes the inconſiſtency ſtill the more glaring is, that while human nature ſhrinks at the thought of the partial oppreſſion of an earthly tyrant, we quietly remain in a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery to the worſt of tyrants, the devil himſelf. To ſhake off the former, has coſt many their lives, and put them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the capacity of enjoying the liberty, they have purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. When we need but deteſt the chains of ſin to riſe up to Kings and enſure liberty in its higheſt perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our conduct proves that we prize time above eternity, the liberties of an earthly ſtate, above the glorious liberty of the ſons of God; the enjoyments of earth above thoſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſin above holineſs, the ſervice of Satan more than that of God,—yea, that we prefer the Devil himſelf, the implacable enemy of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013502_0055_0F90A3F98AA2B3B8"/>
our ſouls to the Lord Jehovah, our gracious benefactor—one who would drag us down to eternal torments, to him who offers to ſave us from them, and fill our ſouls with everlaſting, unmixed, ever-encreaſing joys, and calls for nothing in return but our hearty acceptance, though it coſt him the blood of his ſon. Should we accept the liberty of heaven, it will prepare us to reliſh the ſweets of civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in a manner wholly incompa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible with a ſelfiſh ſpirit We ſhould then delight in the kindly aſpect that civil liberty bears even on our enemies. But if we refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſpiritual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that of the civil kind, will be no otherwiſe agreeable than as it tends to advance our own private intereſts, or to gratify our revenge. In the one caſe we ſhall enjoy it in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on all the members of the whole ſtate; in the other we can enjoy no more of it, than ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in the private good of an individual. This thought gives our conduct a ſtill more inconſiſtent appearance, by ſhewing us that while we contend for civil liberty, we refuſe the means of enjoying it to the beſt advantage, in its higheſt reſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ment and greateſt extent. But our inconſiſtency will be ſeen in a ſtill ſtronger point of light, if we conſider, that without ſpiritual liberty, the other will finally prove worſe than nothing It is in itſelf a great bleſſing, but by abuſing it, we may, and ſhall be rendered much more miſerable at laſt, than if we had never poſſeſſed it. So long as we refuſe to accept of the liberty of the goſpel
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013502_0056_0F90A3FB1C5EF850"/>
inſtead of uſing, we abuſe every earthly good. Such an abuſe of civil liberty, renders us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely criminal in the ſight of our judge, and will finally kindle his diſpleaſure into an hotter flame that will more dreadfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us. In this way it is, that the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the fool ſhall deſtroy him according to the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hecy of Solomon. Thus, by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to embrace the goſpel, we convert ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil liberty, which is in itſelf, a delicious kind of food, into a ſlow poiſon which will render our death vaſtly more terrible than otherwiſe it would have been. It had been better for us not to have been born, or, to have been born ſlaves, and doomed with Lazarus to beg our bread at the doors of our rich oppreſſors, than to be found guilty at laſt of having abuſed the bleſſed privilege of liberty. In what point of view ſoever we look at our conduct in the light of this ſubject, we ſhall ſee new inconſiſtencies opening upon us. We boaſt of liberty, and value ourſelves much on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free, when at the ſame time we are taken captive by ſatan at his pleaſure. This is a much more ſhocking abſurdity, than it would be for a man confined in a dungeon, to boaſt that he is at liberty, becauſe he is not called on, in providence, to go into the field and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Should we hear one in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſlavery vaunting, and boaſting that he lives in a land of liberty, who would not laugh at his folly, and pity his weakneſs; and yet, HE might have good reaſon to rejoice in
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013502_0057_0F90A3FB337E5B98"/>
ſeeing others free though he himſelf were in ſlavery. To dread and oppoſe a human ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and yet bow voluntarily to ſatan, ſinks us beneath the brutes. Another of our incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies is this; notwithſtanding all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to the contrary, our refuſal of ſpiritual liberty, proves us to be regardleſs of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſtate. While we refuſe the one and yet profeſs to purſue the other we only play the hypocrite. For who will believe a man loves money, merely becauſe he exerts himſelf to obtain a penny, when at the ſame time he will not accept millions that are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him gratis? In this caſe, it would be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
