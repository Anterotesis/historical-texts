            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. ON BAPTISM.</head>
                     <p>JOHN the Baptiſt was ſent as a voice crying in the wilderneſs, to proclaim the approach of the Meſſiah; to point him out, upon his perſonal appearance, to the people; to preach the neceſſity of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins; and to baptize with water, as prefiguring the ſpiritual adminiſtration of the Saviour under the diſpenſation of the goſpel, in baptizing with the Holy Ghoſt, to the purification of ſouls, and fitting them for an eternal inheritance with the ſaints in light.</p>
                     <p>John came not to inſtitute, but to precede and prepare the way for, this glorious diſpenſation; he therefore repreſented the new covenant of the Prince of life and peace, under the title of <hi>the kingdom of heaven,</hi> which he declared to be <hi>at hand,</hi> or near to take place.</p>
                     <p>This goſpel-eſtabliſhment the prophet Jeremiah had foretold, ſhould<note n="a" place="bottom">Jer. xxi. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>not be according to the old covenant</hi> of ſymbolical forms and ſhadows, which the inſpired author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019924_0003_0FE1A344B5A21658"/>obſerved,<note n="b" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 9, 10.</note> 
                        <q>could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience;</q> becauſe it <q>ſtood only in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and carnal ordinances, impoſed on them until the time of reformation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>John's baptiſm, being of the ſame exterior nature with the rituals of the law, could no more add towards the purification of the heart, and the perfection of a good conſcience, than they: like them, it was <hi>a figure for the time then preſent,</hi> to ſhadow forth the internal effect of the Lord's bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but no further requiſite thereunto. John knowing this, when Jeſus came to partake of his baptiſm, as he likewiſe did of the ordinances of the law (not that he might give a ſanction to their continuance, but that he might <hi>fulfil</hi> them, as having been primarily of divine authority, and not yet diſannulled) appeared ſurprized that he whom he knew to be the inward and effectual baptizer, ſhould apply to him for his outward baptiſm, ſaying,<note n="c" place="bottom">Mat. iii. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <q>I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</q> but upon our Lord's anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering, "Suffer it to be ſo <hi>now,</hi>" (which intimated his own ſpiritual baptiſm was not yet to commence, ſo as to put a final period to that of John) he admitted it; and ſoon after directed his hearers to him, ſaying,<note n="d" place="bottom">John i. 29.</note> 
                        <q>Behold the Lamb of God, Which <hi>taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this gracious end, the Son of God reſigned himſelf up to become<note n="e" place="bottom">I Tim. ii. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>a ranſom for all mankind, to be teſtified,</hi> or outwardly verified, <hi>in due time,</hi> by which he ſhewed the love of God to fallen man, and his willingneſs to pardon ſinners upon their repentance; in order to which, he <q>
                           <note n="f" place="bottom">Pſalm lxviii. 18.</note> received gifts for men; yea for the rebellious alſo, that the

                        <q>the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to <hi>every man,</hi> to proſit withal;</q> that on their embracing it, in faith and obedience, the might, by its baptizing power and virtue, be delivered from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation due for ſins committed, and be cleanſed from all unrighteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>To this import are the following expreſſions of John;<note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. iii. 11, 12.</note> 
                        <q>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me (or whoſe miniſtration ſhall ſucceed mine) is mightier than I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire; whoſe fan is in his Hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</q> John here ſhews the true diſtinction betwixt his own baptiſm, and that of our Saviour: the firſt with water; the laſt with the Holy Ghoſt; and alſo metaphorically inculcates, that the baptiſm of Chriſt ſhould winnow the ſoul of its chaffy, or ſinful nature, and operate as fire, to the perfect conſumption of all its defilement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="i" place="bottom">John iii. 30.</note> 
                        <q>He muſt increaſe, ſaid John, but I muſt decreaſe.</q> This indicates, that as the ſpiritual miniſtration of Chriſt ſhould advance, John's watery one ſhould recede; not be joined with it. Neither was the regenerating baptiſm of the ſpirit conſequent upon it when adminiſtered; for the<note n="k" place="bottom">Acts viii.</note> Samaritans received the Holy Ghoſt ſome time <hi>after</hi> their water baptiſm;<note n="l" place="bottom">Acts x. 47.</note> Cornelius and his friends received it <hi>

                           </gap>;</hi> and<note n="m" place="bottom">Acts viii.</note> Simon the ſorcerer received it <hi>not at all,</hi> though he was baptized with water.</p>
                     <p>Spirit-baptiſm, therefore, is not connected with water-baptiſm, nor at all dependant upon it. The
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019924_0005_0FE1A357710940D0"/>baptiſm of the Saviour is complete in itſelf, without exterior form and ſhadow. By its renewed impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the believing and attentive ſoul, the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth of the ſpirit is brought forth therein, and in proportion to its growth and increaſe, the old man, with his corrupt deeds, becomes crucified, and the ſoul delivered, and raiſed up into newneſs of life.</p>
                     <p>This is the baptiſm which is eſſential to ſalvation, as our Lord gave Nicodemus to underſtand, when he ſaid,<note n="n" place="bottom">John iii.</note> 
                        <q>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</q> And again, <q>Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</q> The word <hi>water</hi> here, like that of <hi>fire,</hi> Mat. iii. 12. is uſed to ſignify the purifying virtue of the ſpirit in the regeneration of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="o" place="bottom">Liberty of Propheſying, page 231.</note> Biſhop Taylor ſaith, <q>The water and the ſpirit in this place ſignify the ſame thing; and by water is meant the effect of the ſpirit cleanſing and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſoul, as appears in its parallel of Chriſt baptizing with the ſpirit and fire.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That our Lord meant it of the ſpirit only, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears from his own explanatory expreſſion, verſe 6. <q>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe who advocate the continuance of water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, plead our Saviour's commiſſion, Mathew xxviii. 19. but he there makes no mention of water, nor do his words imply it; for his expreſſions are ſuch as ſuit only with his own ſpiritual baptiſm. Neither did his Diſciples from thence begin the practice of water-baptiſin. They had taken it up ſome time before, moſt probably from John's exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom they juſtly venerated as a meſſenger ſent from God, and in great eſtimation with their Lord
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019924_0006_0FE1A43E7417C120"/>and maſter; for they adminiſtered it after the ſame manner he did, and ſo continued to do, when they uſed it after our Lord's aſcenſion, as well as before. Whereas, if they had underſtood his command to intend water-baptiſm, they would certainly have altered their terms, and have adminiſtered it in the very words of his commiſſion, which we do not find in holy writ they ever did. It was therefore ſtill John's baptiſm in nature, and far below the effectual baptiſm of the great Meſſiah; who, notwithſtanding he bore ſuch honourable teſtimony concering John, as a burning and ſhining light, and one of the greateſt prophets born of woman, as being his immediate forerunner, yet, at the ſame time he ſaid,<note n="p" place="bottom">Luke vii. 23.</note> 
                        <q>He that is leaſt in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</q> This implies that the loweſt attainment in the ſpiritual diſpenſation of Chriſt, is ſuperior in nature to the higheſt in John's miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this being but the temporary ſign, and that the ſubſtantial and permanent reality ſignified by it.</p>
                     <p>Let us now conſider what the commiſſion was, and to whom it was given. It appears to have been merely verbal; for we find it was not immediately attended with the authority requiſite to its execution. The qualification ſtill neceſſary was the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, which the diſciples were to receive afterwards; without which they were not to enter upon the work of the miniſtry, but to wait in patience for its illuminating and powerful virtue, to put them forth, and to abilitate them for the ſervice.<note n="q" place="bottom">Luke xxiv. 49.</note> "Behold," ſaid the great Miniſter of the ſanctuary, <q>I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jeruſalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. <note n="r" place="bottom">Acts i. 5.</note> John truly baptized with water; but ye ſhall be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019924_0007_0FE1A43FF8C95E68"/>baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many days hence."—<note n="s" place="bottom">Ibid v. 8.</note> "Ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the earth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus was the ſpiritual baptiſm of Chriſt, which had been predicted by John, to commence, and thoſe who miniſtered, were to <hi>teach baptizing</hi> into the ſame ſpirit themſelves were baptized with. Unleſs the miniſters were baptized with the ſpirit, they could not baptize their believing hearers with it; nor could their hearers without faith receive it.</p>
                     <p>This appears to be the baptiſm intended in the commiſſion; for it relates not to the baptiſm of John, but to that of Chriſt, and holds forth <hi>the preaching of the goſpel in the ſpirit and power of God.</hi> Therefore the commiſſion was given to thoſe in the primitive age, who were divinely inſpired for that purpoſe, and it unqueſtionably reaches to all influenced by THE SAME SPIRIT, and to ſuch only, to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>The words of the commiſſion are,<note n="t" place="bottom">Mat. xxviii. 19.</note>

Yet this cruel notion, the production of error and bigotry, hath been zealouſly eſpouſed and propagated.</p>

                        <hi>Fidus,</hi> an <hi>African</hi> biſhop in the third century, adviſed the baptiſm of infants for the purgation of original ſin, alledging that the Jews circumciſed theirs. This at firſt ſeemed new and ſtrange to <hi>Cyprian;</hi> but he afterwards fell in with a collection of 66 biſhops and preſbyters, who enjoined it. The practice became preached up afterwards by divers <hi>as neceſſary;</hi> and the <hi>Milevitan</hi> and <hi>Carthagenian</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, in the fore part of the fifth century, went ſo far as to fix an <hi>anathema</hi> upon all who held that young children might be ſaved without water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; which was ratified by ſeveral ſucceeding popes. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> carried the matter ſtill further, teaching that even embryos, if they had been quickened in the mother's womb, and there died unbaptized, were damned, as guilty of original ſin. This put the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the prieſthood upon contriving a remedy: ſome they took up out of their graves, and <hi>chriſtened,</hi> as they ſuperſtitiouſly called it, the dead body: others they baptized by <hi>proxy,</hi> in imitation of thoſe early miſled profeſſors among the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who alſo doubted of the reſurrection; in proof of which, the apoſtle doubly argued with them;

                        <q>What ſhall they do," ſaid he, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</q> The manner of this baptiſm was thus; one of them placed himſelf under the bed of the deceaſed, who being aſked if he would be baptized; the party under his bed anſwered for him in the affirmative, and then was baptized in his ſtead; which <hi>Godwin,</hi> properly enough, compares to the acting of a play upon the ſtage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The apoſtle reaſons from his own exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and that of his concerned brethren; <q>Why ſtand we in jeopardy every hour?</q> The import of which ſeems to be, why are we continually bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in affliction, ſuffering, and danger, for the ſake of thoſe who are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, that they may be quickened by the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, if none are to be ſo quickened, and if there ſhall be no reſurrection hereafter?</p>
                     <p>As the followers of Jacobus Cyrus took the word <hi>water,</hi> John iii. 5. in the literal ſenſe, ſo they did the word <hi>fire,</hi> Mat. iii. 11. and thence branded their children, either in the face, or upon the arm, with a heated iron in the form of a croſs.

                     <p>It is well known by the experience of many, that this baptiſm is gradually effected by ſpiritual immerſions of the ſoul, according to the meaſure of corruption it hath imbibed, and to the ſtrictneſs or
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019924_0017_0FE1A46436C2C898"/>laxity of its attention to the great Baptizer. A ſenſe of its ſinful condition, with the diſtance it ſtands at from the God of perfect purity, is firſt given it, whereby it is brought into ſelf-abaſement, contrition, and, at length, into humble reſignation of all to him. Thus it becomes baptized into the ſimilitude of the death of Chriſt, which is a death unto all that is of a carnal and ſenſual nature. Through baptiſm it alſo riſeth with him into newneſs of life, which enableth it to bring ſorth the fruits of the ſpirit to his praiſe.

                     <p>True Chriſtian baptiſm is a great and important work; the work of Chriſt himſelf whereby the ſoul is meaſurably baptized into his ſpirit, and endowed with its virtues. This is quite another thing than a ceremonious formalization under his name. The latter is eaſy to the fleſh, but the former crucifies it.<note n="b" place="bottom">Gal. v. 24.</note>

                     <p>It is improper to imagine, that the ſign of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, given to Abraham and his deſcendants, was a type of water-baptiſm, which was only an outward and typical ſign itſelf. Ceremony and ſubſtance are type and antitype; not ceremony and ceremony. What the circumciſion of the foreſkin pointed to, was the inward circumciſion of the fleſhly heart, called for by Moſes, Deut. x. 16. and promiſed, chap. xxx. 6.

                     <p>Miſapprehenſion at firſt, and tradition afterwards, having inculcated water-baptiſm as a permanent inſtitution of our Lord's, and an indiſpenſable part of the goſpel-miniſtration, ſome of its advocates have weakly argued for it as ſuch, from his waſhing<note n="i" place="bottom">John xiii.</note> the feet of his diſciples, and directing it as their duty to do the like to each other. But this inſtance had no relation to that ceremony; for our Lord was not then inſtructing his followers how to initiate new converts, but figuratively ſhewing them what their own conduct ſhould be amongſt themſelves, by ſetting them a pattern of humility, condeſcenſion, and brotherly kindneſs one to another. This un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doubtedly was his intent; not the eſtabliſhment of the exterior act of pedal ablution.</p>
                     <p>Water-baptiſm being an eſſential part of John's commiſſion, he properly admitted his diſciples by it; which the great Adminiſtrator of ſpiritual baptiſm <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

As it was then, ſo it remains to be; thoſe who are obedient to his call are his followers, whether they are water-baptized, or not. On the contrary, thoſe who obey not the internal manifeſtations of his ſpirit, are none of his, whoever baptizeth them with water. Formality may render any man a nominal Chriſtian; but the effectual baptiſm of the ſpirit only can make a real one.</p>
                     <p>The practice of ſprinkling infants under the name of baptiſm, hath neither precept nor precedent in the New Teſtament. For want of real inſtances, <hi>mere ſuppoſitions</hi> are offered in ſupport of it. Becauſe it is ſaid in the caſe of <hi>Lydia,</hi>

The intention of our Lord in admitting the children to him, appears to have been, that he might exhibit them as examples of innocence and fitneſs to thoſe actual ſinners about
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019924_0021_0FE1A46F9157E930"/>him; to whom he ſaid, <q>Verily I ſay unto you whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein.</q> Had he meant to adopt and eſtabliſh paedo-baptiſm as a ſtanding ordinance, a fairer opportunity could hardly offer, either to baptize the children himſelf, or command his diſciples to do it; neither of which he did; but graciouſly ſhewed his acceptance of them without it, for <q>he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We never find either the Lord Jeſus, or his apoſtles, preaching up water-baptiſm as <hi>his,</hi> nor telling the people they cannot be his followers without it. His conditions of diſcipleſhip are not ſo eaſy to the carnal mind.<note n="m" place="bottom">Luke ix. 27.</note>

                        </q> Hence it is clear, that it is not water-baptiſm, nor any kind of rituals whatſoever, which renders any man a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in our Saviour's account; but obedience to the operation of his Holy Spirit, which humbleth the heart, purifieth the ſoul, and baptizeth it meaſurably into the divine nature. But mortification of ſelf being irkſome, and highly diſagreeable to the fleſh too many are rather willing to content themſelves with aſſuming the name Chriſtian under the outward ſign, than to endure the pain of croſſing their carnal propenſities, in order <hi>to put on Chriſt,</hi> and become Chriſtians indeed.

                     <p>The command, <q>Go teach all nations, baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</q> &amp;c. ſhews that the baptiſm therein meant, ſhould be as general as the preaching there intended, both among Jews and Gentiles; which water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm evidently was not. For Paul, who was ſent chiefly to the Gentiles, was very ſparing in the uſe of it, and thanked God that he had baptized but two or three families with it, declaring that <hi>was not his commiſſion;</hi> yet he planted many churches, which contained numbers who received the ſpirit, and walked in the faith and fellowſhip of the goſpel, and who were <hi>as real Chriſtians</hi> without water-baptiſm, as others were with it. This ſhews, that it was neither made an eſſential, nor an integral part of Chriſtianity; and conſequently, that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it was but an occaſional condeſcenſion; for it having been an ancient cuſtom both among Jews and Gentiles, to initiate their proſelytes by it, and alſo adminiſtered by John under divine authority, and taken up from him by the diſciples of our Lord, it was become a ceremony of conſiderable account with the generality, who ſaw not ſufficiently into the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel: therefore it could not, even after the baptiſm of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt appeared, be every where laid aſide ſuddenly; neither was it required ſo to be, but, as John intimated, to <hi>decreaſe,</hi> or fall into diſuſe by degrees. In like manner the apoſtles alſo occaſionally complied with the rites of the Moſaic law in various particulars; as circumciſion, vows, ſhavings, exterior purifications, ſacrifices, anointings, &amp;c. all which were permitted for a ſeaſon; yet, had the profeſſors of Chriſtianity abode in the ſpirit of it, and ſincerely ſought a growth therein, ceremonials of all kinds
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019924_0023_0FE1A47341583148"/>would ſoon have been extinct in the church. But inſtead of growing in grace, and in the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a falling away began early to take place, and in proportion as the life of religion dwindled, forms and ſhadows were more and more faſtened upon, and gradually increaſed upon the declining ſtate of the church, as the ſpirit of antichriſt gained ground. But to return.</p>
                     <p>We read, Eph. v. 25, 26. <q>Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that <hi>he</hi> might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word; that he might preſent it to himſelf <hi>a glorious church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing;</hi> but that it ſhould be <hi>holy and without blemiſh.</hi>
                        </q> This is the work of Chriſt himſelf, and therefore is done by his own ſpiritual baptiſm. <hi>The water of the word</hi> ſignifies its cleanſing power, as<note n="p" place="bottom">1 Peter ii. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the milk of the word</hi> denotes its nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental virtue; and this ſanctifying <hi>word</hi> is the iſſuing forth of the ſpirit of Chriſt for great and gracious purpoſes, who is himſelf the emphatical and all powerful <hi>Word,</hi> through whom the Father effects his will, and communicates all things to his people. By him alone the church can be rendered <hi>holy, and preſented without blemiſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to apoſtolic doctrine, there is but <hi>one baptiſm</hi> now remaining in force:<note n="q" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 5.</note> 
                        <q>One Lord, one faith, one baptiſm.</q> And as the Chriſtian diſpenſation is that of Chriſt, the one baptiſm muſt be the baptiſm of Chriſt; which is not by water, but the Holy Ghoſt:<note n="r" place="bottom">1 Cor. xii. 13.</note> "For," ſaith Paul, <q>by one ſpirit are we all baptized into one body.</q> By receiving the ſame ſpirit, we become of the ſame ſpiritual body.

                     <p>The diſtinction betwixt our Saviour's baptiſm, and that of John, lies not in the ſame elementary miniſtration after a different mode, or under another form of words.<note n="s" place="bottom">

                        <q>I, (ſaith John) indeed have baptized you with water; but he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt.</q> This plainly ſhews, that the baptiſm of Chriſt, and that of John, were two ſeparate baptiſms, and that they are perfectly diſtinct, and different from each other, as type and antitype.</p>
                     <p>Some have argued, that <hi>as the ſoul is not properly a man without the body, nor the body without the ſoul, but both in conjunction make the man; ſo water-baptiſm and ſpirit-baptiſm are both requiſite to make up the one Chriſtian baptiſm.</hi> But though ſoul and body be the two conſtituent parts of a man, the two baptiſms have no ſuch conſtitutional connection. That of the ſpirit, being the effective reality, is complete in itſelf; but that of water was only a temporary figure, and no more a part of the baptiſm of Chriſt, than the circumciſion of the foreſkin was a part of the circumciſion of the heart.</p>
                     <p>The tranſaction of Philip with the Ethiopian eunuch, Acts viii. hath been treated as if meant to give a miraculous ſanction to water-baptiſm. But it is evident, this great and well-diſpoſed man had been at, Jeruſalem with a pious intention to worſhip the true God, who knowing the ſincerity of his heart, ſent Philip to inſtruct him, and to preach his Son Jeſus to him, as the Saviour of mankind. After he had ſo done, as they paſſed near a certain
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019924_0025_0FE1A47E9C4438A8"/>water, the eunuch judging, according to the cuſtom of both Jews and Gentiles, that he muſt be entered as a proſelyte by the uſual ceremony, made a motion to Philip that he might be there baptized. And, as the apoſtles, in this early time of the goſpel, ſaw fit occaſionally to condeſcend to this and various other rituals, Philip went into the water with him, and baptized him. But, if any miracle was wrought, the text affords no teſtimony that it was done to give a ſanction to water-baptiſm, nor that it is a perpetual inſtitution of our Lord. It doth not appear in the New Teſtament, that he ever inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, adopted, or once adminiſtered water-baptiſm himſelf. The evangeliſt declares, that<note n="t" place="bottom">John iv. 2.</note> 
                        <q>Jeſus himſelf baptized not:</q> that is, not with water; and undoubtedly for this reaſon, becauſe <hi>it was not his baptiſm,</hi> but John's, who was the only perſon we find divinely commiſſioned for it. Our Lord's ſubmitting himſelf to it, under John's miniſtration, was upon the ſame footing that he ſubmitted to the Jewiſh ceremonials. They had all been divinely commanded, and in acknowledgment of them as ſuch, he countenanced the practice of them, till the period of their obligation ſhould arrive, by the eſtabliſhment of his own ſpiritual diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>No one outwardly-connected body upon earth, hath a right to engroſs to itſelf the title of <hi>the true church,</hi> and thence to aſſert, there is no ſalvation but within its own peculiar pale; for all profeſſing churches are compoſed, more or leſs, of a promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous number of thoſe who love and fear God, and of thoſe who regard him not with that reverence and ſubjection all ought to do. Thoſe who walk moſt in the ſpirit, will undoubtedly be moſt in his favour; but without obedience thereunto, none can

                     <head>CHAP. II. ON CHRISTIAN COMMUNION.</head>
                     <p>AS the baptiſm of Chriſt is purely ſpiritual, ſo is that communion which is truly <hi>the Lord's Jupper.</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">Cor. xii. 13.</note> "For," ſaith holy writ, <q>by <hi>one ſpirit</hi> are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made <hi>to drink into one ſpirit.</hi>
                        </q> This indicates, that the communion of real inward Chriſtians, whereby they partake of divine ſtrength and conſolation, is <hi>in the one ſpirit</hi> they are all baptized by.</p>
                     <p>Undoubtedly, the ſign hath been piouſly uſed by many, and ſtill may be ſo by thoſe to whom the termination of it doth not yet appear; but ſeeing it is not in itſelf of the ſpiritual nature of the goſpel-diſpenſation, the neceſſary queſtion now is, <hi>Whether our Lord inſtituted it with a declared intention, that the obſervance of it ſhould be an univerſal eſtabliſhment throughout the Chriſtian churches to the end of time?</hi> If this be not aſcertained in the affirmative, it cannot, with propriety, be inſiſted on as an ordinance obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory upon us at this day. Dean <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> hath juſtly obſerved, <q>Whatſoever is binding upon Chriſtians, and ſo becomes an article either of faith or practice, <hi>as an univerſal ſtanding law, muſt be clearly revealed as ſuch,</hi> and laid down in ſcripture <hi>in ſuch evident terms,</hi> as that all who have their ſenſes exerciſed therein, may diſcern it to have been the will of Chriſt, that if ſhould perpetually oblige all believers to the end of the world.</q> Let us a little enquire, whether ſuch clear evidence of the <hi>perpetual obligation</hi> of this ceremonial appears
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019924_0029_0FE1A488E948AA20"/>in the texts that moſt immediately relate to the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour and his diſciples being engaged in the celebration of the Jewiſh paſſover, the ſame night he was betrayed, we read,<note n="b" place="bottom">Matt. xxvi. 26-30.</note> 
                        <q>As they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to his diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink <hi>ye all</hi> of it; for this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins. But I ſay unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</q> Luke adds the following expreſſion:<note n="c" place="bottom">Luke xxii. 19.</note> "This do in remembrance of me." But the apoſtle Paul delivers it in a fuller and more explanatory manner.<note n="d" place="bottom">1 Cor. xi. 25, 26.</note> 
                        <q>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me." Adding, For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing in theſe texts that enjoins the perpetuity of the ſymbols. The words, <hi>till he come,</hi> ſhews the obſervance of them to be no longer of obligation than <hi>till his ſecond coming.</hi> We do not read, You ſhall thus participate of the ſigns through all future generations; nor have we any ſpecific direction <hi>how often</hi> they ſhould be uſed in the interval, which indicates a liberty in that reſpect; but no authority for their extenſion beyond the time of the Lord's coming. When they were received, it was to be <hi>in remembrance of him,</hi> which muſt be during <hi>his abſence</hi> from them; for when preſent, he muſt be an object of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> not of <hi>remembrance;</hi> therefore the time intended for the reception of thoſe tokens
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019924_0030_0FE1A48A6C0BB9F0"/>of memorial, could only be till he ſhould <hi>come again,</hi> and afreſh communicate a ſenſe of his divine preſence to them.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>ſecond coming</hi> of our Lord he had repeatedly given them ſufficient ground to expect ſhould be after a ſpiritual manner.<note n="e" place="bottom">John xiv. 28.</note> "Ye have heard," ſaid he, <q>how I ſaid unto you, I go away, and <hi>come again to you.</hi>
                        </q> He had aſſured them of this, where he told them,<note n="f" place="bottom">Ibid xiv. 16, 17, 18.</note> 
                        <q>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever: even the ſpirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for <hi>he dwelleth with you,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be in you.</hi> I will not leave you comfortleſs: <hi>I will come to you.</hi>
                        </q> Here he firſt ſpeaks of himſelf in the third perſon under the name of the Comforter, the ſpirit of truth; and then aſſuming the firſt, inculcates, that he who was then a ſtrength and comfort to them, <hi>without them,</hi> by his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſhould, after his corporeal departure, <hi>come again in ſpirit,</hi> to be the ſtrength and comfort of his followers <hi>within them,</hi> and to abide with them for ever. He alſo ſhewed, that his ſpiritual advent, and indwelling, was not to be confined to his preſent diſciples; but ſhould alſo be manifeſted to all that love him, and keep his commandments.<note n="g" place="bottom">John v. 23.</note> 
                        <q>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and <hi>we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The apoſtle Paul likewiſe concurrently teſtified,<note n="h" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 28.</note> 
                        <q>Chriſt was offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that <hi>look for him,</hi> ſhall he appear the <hi>ſecond time</hi> without ſin unto ſalvation.</q> To thoſe who then looked for him in ſpirit he certainly did
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019924_0031_0FE1A48BEDEC9398"/>come, according to that teſtimony of John,<note n="i" place="bottom">1 John v. 20.</note> 
                        <q>We know that the Son of God <hi>is come,</hi> and hath <hi>given us an underſtanding,</hi> that we may <hi>know him</hi> that is true; and we are <hi>in him</hi> that is true; even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</q> This coming of Chriſt, by which they received an underſtanding that they were <hi>in him,</hi> muſt be after a ſpiritual manner, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his promiſe, John xiv. 20. <q>At that day, <hi>ye ſhall know,</hi> that I am in my Father, and <hi>you in me,</hi> and <hi>I in you.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus they experienced the knowledge of that great goſpel-myſtery, which had been hid from ages and generations in forms and ſhadows:<note n="k" place="bottom">Col. i. 26, 27.</note> "But now" ſaith the apoſtle, <q>is made manifeſt to his ſaints, to whom God would make known what is <hi>the riches</hi> of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles; which is <hi>Chriſt in you,</hi> the hope of glory.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The inward and true Chriſtian thus knows him to be come, by the illuminating and quickening life he receives from him; which all ought inwardly to ſeek after, and not ſtick in the outward and viſible ſign, with an expectation to find him in that from whence he is riſen. They who look only thus outwardly for him, in truth ſee him not.<note n="l" place="bottom">John xiv. 29.</note> 
                        <q>Yet a little while," ſaid he, "and the world ſeeth me no more; but ye ſee me, becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</q> The unregenerate world could diſcern no more of him than his corporeal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and when that was removed, they ſaw him no more; but thoſe who have been baptized <hi>into him,</hi> as a vital principle of divine life, ſtill ſpiritually ſee him, and becauſe he lives in them, they live alſo; and by the influence of his Holy Spirit are moſt effectually kept in mind of the ſhedding of his
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019924_0032_0FE1A493B2A024E0"/>precious blood without the gates of Jeruſalem,<note n="m" place="bottom">1 John ii. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>as a propitiation for their ſins, and not for theirs only, but for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Theſe ſtand not in need of ſigns and ſymbols to remind them of him. They cannot be forgetful of that inexpreſſible love and mercy, wherein he gave up his prepared body to die, that they might live; but are graciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in humble thankfulneſs, and deep admiration, that he ſhould ſo condeſcend to ſuffer for them, who muſt ever acknowledge themſelves moſt unworthy of ſuch aſtoniſhing goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>The outward and viſible ſign appears to have been recommended by our Lord, only for the interval between his perſonal departure and his ſpiritual return, the uſe of it being to commemorate his death till he came; conſequently, when he was come, the obſervance of it was no longer obligatory, but occaſionally permitted, like the waſhing of one another's feet, or the anointing of the ſick with oil, till they ſhould gradually drop away, as the reality wherein they terminated ſhould advance in the hearts of the believers. But the progreſs of theſe in ſpirituality being early obſtructed, by the diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of many towards the croſs; their love to truth, and zeal for it waxed cold, and a diſpoſition prevailed to reſt in ſymbolical religion, which they could eaſily practiſe, without parting with their inward corruptions, and walking in that ſelf-denial the goſpel requires. This became an exerciſe to the apoſtles, and occaſioned Paul to query,<note n="n" place="bottom">Gal. iv. 9.—iii. 3.</note> 
                        <q>How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye deſire again to be in bondage?— Are ye ſo fooliſh? Having begun in the ſpirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</q>

                        </q> This is the true ſupper of the Lord, which ſtands not in partaking of the outward elements one with another, but in the participation of his divine life, the true bread from heaven, and the new wine of the kingdom.

                     <p>The ſpiritually-minded under former diſpenſations were not excluded from this communion. The apoſtle ſhews, that the fathers of Iſrael<note n="r" place="bottom">1 Cor. x. 4.</note> 
                        <q>did all eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink; for <hi>they drank of that ſpiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt.</hi>

                        <note n="s" place="bottom">Ibid ver. 16, 17.</note> 
                        <q>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</q> As if he had ſaid, Is it but the outward ſhadow, and not the inward and ſpiritual reality? Certainly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019924_0034_0FE1A67BAAEE3C00"/>it is, for <q>we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.</q> This implies, that by the participation of the <hi>one ſpirit of life</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, they were, in their ſeveral meaſures, made partakers of the divine nature, and, through its cementing virtue, were inwardly united one unto another, as members of the ſame ſpiritual body, and all unto Chriſt the head;<note n="t" place="bottom">Col. ii. 19.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſpoken to ſuch as had experienced a degree of inward ſanctification, the apoſtle turns to thoſe intemperate carnal profeſſors, who had fallen into a ſhameful abuſe of the outward ſign.<note n="v" place="bottom">Cor. xi. 20.27, &amp;c.</note> Theſe he ſharply reproved, and intimated to them, that as often as they partook of the exterior elements, it ought to have been in a reverent remembrance of him who ſuffered for them. For whilſt they had no diſcerning, or inward ſenſe, of his ſpiritual body, and perſiſted in ſuch abuſe of the form, he let them know they ate and drank to their own condemnation; for ſuch as partake but of the ſign, under a pretence of divine communion, and do it ſo unworthily, are in the judgment of the apoſtle, guilty of vilifying the body and blood of the Lord; becauſe, whilſt they profeſs to honour him, they, by their evil conduct, may be ſaid, in ſome reſpect,<note n="w" place="bottom">Heb. vi. 6.</note>

                     <p>Though our Saviour was ſeen of his diſciples at times forty days after his reſurrection, he partook not with them of any outward ſpecies in the form of communion, as may be concluded from his own

                        <hi>cometh not with obſervation, or outward ſhew; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the kingdom of God is within you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this kingdom cometh not with outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is in vain to ſeek it by outward obſervations, and to pretend to ſupport it by them. If it be within us, it muſt be an inward and ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and it cannot come to us, but by the ſpirit. And if, as the apoſtle declares,<note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 17.</note> 
                        <q>the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</q> it is not bread and wine; which are meat and drink. As the kingdom is ſpiritual, its communion is ſpiritual, and its receivers are ſpiritually ſuch. Well therefore might the apoſtle ſay,<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid ii. 28, 29.</note> 
                        <q>He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumciſion is <hi>that of the heart in the ſpirit,</hi> and not in the letter.</q> Thus it is with the Chriſtian. He is not a real Chriſtian, who is only one by profeſſion and form; neither is that the baptiſm, nor the communion of the goſpel,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019924_0036_0FE1A67F8484D470"/>which is outward and ceremonial; but he is a Chriſtian who is one inwardly, and that is the true baptiſm, and the true communion, which is <hi>of the heart, in the ſpirit,</hi> and not in the letter, or outward form. With what ſound reaſon then can any inſiſt on the practice of outward and viſible ſigns, as if the very exiſtence of Chriſtianity depended upon them, and that perſons of the greateſt faith, piety, and probity, could have no claim to the name of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians without them?</p>
                     <p>Had the moſt eminent of the evangeliſts, <hi>John,</hi> eſteemed the continuance of the <hi>ſign</hi> to have been of eſſential moment, or laſting obligation, he would hardly have failed to mention it as ſuch. He is particularly expreſſive of the circumſtance of our Saviour's waſhing his diſciples feet, ſhewing that he both enjoined it with great preciſion, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it by his example; yet it is generally agreed to have been only figurative and temporary, and therefore diſuſed by Proteſtants, and very little practiſed by the Romaniſts; but John, in his relation of the tranſactions of that important evening, paſſeth the outward ſupper wholly without notice. His total omiſſion of it may reaſonably intimate, that when he wrote his hiſtory, which was long after the reſt of the evangeliſts, the ſeaſon for it was fully paſt; and that the uſe of it had been only meant as a figure, to weak converts for a time, and then to drop away, and give place to the reality.</p>
                     <p>Yet, notwithſtanding this apoſtolic hiſtorian hath omitted the ceremonial, he hath given a large account of our Lord's diſcourſe concerning the ſubſtance, in chap. 6. wherein, amongſt many other ſimilar expreſſions, he ſaith,<note n="c" place="bottom">John vi. 32, 51, 54.</note> 
                        <q>My Father giveth you the <hi>true bread</hi> from heaven—I am the <hi>living bread</hi>
                           <pb n="38" facs="unknown:019924_0037_0FE1A6819DBEDA58"/>which came down from heaven—Whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life.</q> This intimates, that thoſe who ſpiritually partake of the <hi>divine life in him,</hi> which is of an eternal nature, receive the <hi>living bread,</hi> and the <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> he here intended. Such feed not of that body which ſuffered on the croſs, but of his ſpiritual body, which is a myſtery to the carnal mind.</p>
                     <p>Knowing in himſelf, that by apprehending his metaphorical expreſſions in a literal ſenſe, many of his diſciples, as well as the Jews, took offence, he, for explanation, directly told them, verſe 63. <q>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth; the fleſh profiteth nothing.</q> From whence it appears, that could we eat the very fleſh, and drink the blood of the outward body of Chriſt, <hi>it would not profit us.</hi> How vain and uſeleſs therefore, as well as contrary to ſenſe and reaſon, is the Romiſh notion, that the bread conſecrated by a prieſt, is tranſubſtantiated into that body of fleſh and blood, which, if actually received, <hi>would profit nothing</hi> to the ſoul!</p>
                     <p>It is both carnal and abſurd to inſer, that upon our Saviour's bleſſing the bread, it inſtantly became <hi>that very body</hi> which brake it, handed it to the diſciples, and <hi>ate of it</hi> with them. But, that a new-made wafer, or a piece of bread of yeſterday, ſhould, upon the prieſt's imitative performance of a mere ceremony, be inſtantly rendered that very body of Chriſt, which exiſted many hundred years before it, and that it is to be worſhipped <hi>as God;</hi> and alſo that <hi>every one</hi> of the many thouſands of theſe conſecrated wafers is <hi>the whole</hi> of that ſame body; and all this, whilſt they remain as utterly unchanged, to every evidence of ſenſe and reaſon, as when they came out of the hands of the baker; that any people ſhould ſuffer theſe manifeſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities to be impoſed upon them as myſterious

                     <p>This irrational and idolatrous abuſe hath ariſen from the taking expreſſions, evidently figurative, in a literal ſenſe. Take the connecting verb <hi>is,</hi> in the phraſes, "This <hi>is</hi> my body, this <hi>is</hi> my blood," in like manner with many parallel expreſſions in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the myſtery is eaſily ſolved, without putting any unnatural force upon the text, or any impoſition upon the ſenſes, underſtandings, or conſciences of mankind. We read,<note n="d" place="bottom">Gen. xli. 26.</note>

                     <p>Whatever any thing feeds upon muſt be of a nature ſuitable to its own. The ſoul, being of a ſpiritual nature, is not to be fed with material fleſh and blood; the body prepared for Chriſt to appear in upon earth was ſuch; therefore it was not that body concerning which he ſaid,<note n="g" place="bottom">John vi. 54 to 58.</note>

As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</q> This fleſh and blood is, therefore, another kind of body than that material one, wherein he then appeared to the world. It is a ſpiritual body, ſuitable and alimentary to the ſoul; the true life of which is ſpiritual, and its feeding ſpiritual: <hi>The fleſh profits it nothing.</hi> It is both quickened and ſupported by that ſpiritual body of Chriſt (metaphorically called the<note n="h" place="bottom">1 Cor. x.</note>

The communion of the church triumphant in heaven, and that of the church militant upon earth, is in the ſame ſpirit.

                     <head>CHAP. III. ON WAITING UPON GOD, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THE apoſtle Paul ſhewed, that<note n="a" place="bottom">Tim. ii. 5.</note> 
                        <q>there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus;<note n="b" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 18.</note> through whom we have acceſs <hi>by one ſpirit</hi> unto the Father,<note n="c" place="bottom">Ibid. i. 6.</note> and <hi>in whom alone</hi> we are accepted.</q> We have no power to draw near unto God but by him.<note n="d" place="bottom">John xiv. 6.</note> 
                        <q>I am the way," ſaid he, "and the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</q> In order to worſhip aright, therefore, we muſt firſt wait for him, that we may feel the power of his ſpirit in our hearts, to illuminate, quicken, and enable us, inwardly to approach the throne of divine grace, in faith and reſignation; that our offerings may come up with acceptance on his holy altar.</p>
                     <p>The communication of his ſpirit being of his own free grace, it is not in the power of man to obtain it when he pleaſeth; therefore, it muſt be waited for. Activity, in exterior ordinances, is an employment very different from true waiting; which
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019924_0041_0FE1A68FDE2C0790"/>conſiſts in a ſolemn and ſteady inward retirement of ſoul to him, in humility, faith, and patience, that he may condeſcend to renew its ſtrength in him, and enable it to worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, according to his will.</p>
                     <p>In this practice, the people of God, in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſenſibly experienced the times of refreſhing from his preſence, and ability to withſtand tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to hold on their way amidſt the various aſſaults of the powers of evil, and occaſionally to ſtand firm in ſuffering for his glorious cauſe. Hence we find them, in holy writ, frequent in expreſſing the benefit of waiting upon God, and earneſt in their exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it. Let us attend to a few inſtances.</p>
                     <p>Pſalm xxvii. 14. <q>Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart. Wait, I ſay, on the Lord.</q> This contains encouragement, and repeated exhortation to waiting.</p>
                     <p>Hoſea xii. 6. <q>Turn thou to thy God; keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</q> This intimates the neceſſity of perſeverance in waiting, as well as in the practice of uprightneſs and charity.</p>
                     <p>Pſalm xxxiii. 20. <q>Our ſoul <hi>waiteth for</hi> the Lord; he is our help, and our ſhield.</q> This ſhews, their waiting upon him was in expectation of his divine aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Iſa. xl. 31. <q>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength. They ſhall <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> up with wings as eagles; they ſhall run, and not be weary; they ſhall walk, and not faint.</q> Herein are held forth gracious aſſurances of quickening ſtrength in the practice of waiting.</p>
                     <p>Micah vii. 7. <q>I will look unto the Lord; I will <hi>wait for</hi> the God of my ſalvation. My God will hear me.</q> This indicates the holy reſolution of the prophet, and his confidence in waiting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="unknown:019924_0042_0FE1A6958D2F9470"/>
Habak. ii. 1. <q>I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon the tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, or <hi>in me,</hi> and what I ſhall anſwer when I am reproved.</q> Watching here is ſynonymous with waiting, and this paſſage denotes the dependance of the prophet, in this inward and mental exerciſe, to have been upon the Lord for inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Pſal. xl. 1, 2. <q>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up alſo out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and ſet my feet upon a rock, and eſtabliſhed my goings.</q> This evinces the propriety of a continuance in waiting, and the happy ſucceſs attending it.</p>
                     <p>That this waiting was not only the practice of particulars, but alſo of the congregated bodies of God's people, appears from that reprehenſion of the ſpirit of prophecy in Ezekiel, againſt the inſincere amongſt the Iſraelites:<note n="e" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxiii. 31.</note> 
                        <q>They come unto thee <hi>as the people cometh,</hi> and <hi>they ſit before thee as my people,</hi> and they hear thy words; but they will not do them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We alſo find, that whilſt the elders of Judah ſate before the prophet, he was led through ſuch a variety of divine viſions concerning the ſtate of that people, as take up from chap. viii. 1. to chap. xi. 4. to relate. During the time he was thus inwardly engaged, the elders undoubtedly <hi>ſate in ſilence,</hi> as well as himſelf; for in concluſion, he ſaith, <q>The ſpirit of the Lord fell upon me, and ſaid unto me, Speak,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Pſalm xxxvii. 7. and lxii. 1. ſhew the waiting of the Lord's ſervants began, and continued for ſome time <hi>in ſilence;</hi> for, according to the Hebrew, theſe texts are, <q>
                           <hi>Be ſilent to the Lord,</hi> and wait patiently
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019924_0043_0FE1A6974F95D670"/>for him."—"Truly my ſoul <hi>is ſilent upon God</hi> (or ſilent in attention upon him) from him cometh my ſalvation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lam. iii. 25, 28. <q>The Lord is good unto them that <hi>wait for him,</hi> to the ſoul that ſeeketh him. It is good that a man ſhould both hope, and <hi>quietly wait</hi> for the ſalvation of the Lord. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. He ſitteth alone, and <hi>keepeth ſilence,</hi> becauſe he hath borne it upon him.</q> Here is great encouragement to the ſubmiſſive ſilent waiter.</p>
                     <p>The evangelical prophet is ſtill more expreſſive.</p>
                     <p>Iſa. lxiv. 4. <q>Since the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that <hi>waiteth</hi> for him.</q> This evidenceth, there is ſomething more excellent than is poſſible to the conceived by the natural, or unregenerate, man, to be enjoyed in devout and patient waiting. Hence ariſeth the fervency of zeal for thus waiting, and the great earneſtneſs therein of thoſe who experienced the benefit of it; which we find emphatically expreſſed in the following texts.</p>
                     <p>Pſalm cxxx. 6. <q>My ſoul waiteth for the Lord <hi>more</hi> than they that watch for the morning: I ſay, <hi>more</hi> than they that watch for the morning.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Iſa. xxvi. 9. <q>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pſalm xlii. 1, 2. <q>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God! My ſoul <hi>thirſteth</hi> for God, for the living God. When ſhall I come and appear before God?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the ſpiritually-minded, under paſt diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were ſenſible of their inability properly to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019924_0044_0FE1A698D16E76A0"/>diſcharge their reſpective duties, without the renewed aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, and therefore often waited upon him to receive it; ſo under this goſpel-diſpenſation, which eſſentially is the pure miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, it muſt neceſſarily be waited for. Our Lord therefore directed this diſpenſation to commence <hi>in ſolemn waiting.</hi> For, being aſſembled together with his diſciples,<note n="f" place="bottom">Acts i. 4.</note> he <q>commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Jeruſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the Father:</q>
                        <hi>the enduement of power from on high.</hi> Accordingly, whilſt the diſciples were congregated and ſitting together with <hi>one accord,</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="bottom">Ibid ii. 4.</note> 
                        <q>they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and <hi>began to ſpeak</hi> with other tongues, as the ſpirit gave them utterance.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus led into ſolemn waiting by their Lord and Maſter, and divinely favoured therein, the primitive Chriſtians had ſufficient ground to continue the practice; which it appears they did from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing texts: 1 Cor. i. 6, 7, 8. <q>The teſtimony of Chriſt was confirmed in you; ſo that ye come behind in no gift, <hi>waiting for the coming,</hi> or revelation, <hi>of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end.</q> This ſhews they received the gifts of the ſpirit, and the confirmation of it, through waiting."</p>
                     <p>1 Theſ. i. 9, 10. <q>Ye turned to God from idols, to ſerve the living and true God, and to <hi>wait for his Son from heaven.</hi>
                        </q> And, 2 Theſ. iii. 5. the apoſtle prays, <q>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and <hi>into the patient waiting for Chriſt.</hi>
                        </q> This patient waiting for the revelation of Chriſt from heaven, muſt have an immediate reſpect to their worſhip, as well as to their qualification for ſervice, and is to be underſtood
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019924_0045_0FE1A69AF93802A0"/>of his inward and ſpiritual appearance; which the apoſtle gives comfortable aſſurance of, Heb. ix. 28. <q>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and <hi>unto them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time, without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi>
                        </q> By this we underſtand, that as he once appeared after an outward and corporeal manner, and gave up the body prepared for him, as an expiation for the ſins of all who ſhould come to repentance; ſo to thoſe who ſhould <hi>look internally for him</hi> in faith, he ſhall <hi>again appear</hi> by the revelation of his ſpirit in their hearts, to effect the work of regeneration in them, in order to their eternal ſalvation. For, this <hi>ſecond appearance</hi> of Chriſt to thoſe who <hi>piouſly look,</hi> and <hi>patiently wait,</hi> for him, cannot intend his <hi>laſt advent;</hi> for then he ſhall alſo appear to thoſe that <hi>look not for him</hi> with deſire, to their final condemnation.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, it may ſufficiently appear, that waiting upon God in ſilence, faith, and patience, is not a modern peculiarity originated among the people called Quakers, nor the fruit of a deſpicable enthuſiaſm; but a neceſſary practice of ancient date and long continuance amongſt the Lord's people, as preparatory and requiſite to the reception of divine ability to<note n="h" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>pray with the ſpirit, and with a right underſtanding alſo.</hi>

                        <q>praying always with all prayer and ſupplication <hi>in the ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>watching thereunto</hi> with all perſeverance.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having experimentally received an inward ſenſe of the divine goodneſs in thus waiting, the living amongſt the people above-mentioned are engaged to ſit down in a watchful ſtillneſs, both in their public meetings and private retirements, before Him who made heaven and earth, the ſeas, and the fountains
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019924_0046_0FE1A6A12DE93450"/>of waters; and whoever have any clear ſenſe of the ſpirit, know it draws their minds into this ſtill waiting for it, ſo pathetically recommended in holy writ, and ſo beneficially practiſed by thoſe who have devoted their ſouls to the God of their life, and their never-failing helper in time of need. Let none, therefore, by rejecting and deriding what they have not experienced, loſe the precious opportunity now afforded them; but addreſs themſelves earneſtly to<note n="l" place="bottom">Iſa. lv. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near,</hi> that happily in<note n="m" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 27</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>If we ſuffer the low concerns of this mutable world, its earthly profits, or deceitful pleaſures, its friendſhips, faſhions, or any other of its corruptions, to attach our minds, and divert them from attending to the motions of the ſpirit of God in our hearts, till we fill up ſuch a meaſure of iniquity as ſhall occaſion him to forſake us, we may ſeek him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as Eſau did the bleſſing, in vain. For, he ſaith,<note n="n" place="bottom">Gen. vi. 3.</note> 
                        <q>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</q> Time ſufficient for repentance is afforded to all, and the will of God is our ſanctification. Why then, ſome may query, are we not ſanctified? Is Satan too ſtrong for Almighty power? By no means. Such queſtions are ſtarted from improper grounds. As the Lord, in wiſdom, hath made man a reaſonable creature, he deals with him according to reaſon, and not by abſolute force. He ſhews him good and evil, with their oppoſite conſequences, perſuades, intreats, and preſſeth him to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good, that he may reap the fruit of it; even eternal life. If the will of man be ſo perverſe, as to prefer a continuance in the gratifications of ſin, he ſows to the fleſh, and of the fleſh muſt reap corruption. If he wilfully reject
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:019924_0047_0FE1A6A4527B9CF8"/>the kind reproofs of the ſpirit in his own conſcience, to the full extent of divine ſufferance, as revolting Jeruſalem did, he ſins out the day of his merciful viſitation, grace is withdrawn from him, his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is loſt, and the way of peace is hid from his eyes. Knowing this, the good apoſtle thus earneſtly addreſſed the believers:<note n="o" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi. 1.</note> 
                        <q>We then as workers together with Him, beſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</q> For, though the grace of God that brings ſalvation hath appeared to all men, its appearance is rendered in vain to ſuch as by their diſobedience to it, and rejection of it, fruſtrate the accompliſhment of its gracious end and purpoſe towards them.</p>
                     <p>It is a weak argument, that we have now a complete canon of the ſcriptures, and therefore have leſs need of the ſpirit than the primitives; as if the letter could ſupply the place, and do the work of the ſpirit. As all men by a natural and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real birth enter into the kingdom of this world; ſo our Saviour himſelf ſhewed the Jewiſh ruler<note n="p" place="bottom">John iii.</note>, that unleſs we experience a ſpiritual and ſupernatural birth, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God. The holy ſcriptures, which ſo ſtrongly recommend us to be led by the ſpirit, to live in the ſpirit, and to walk in the ſpirit, could not be intended to ſuperſede and ſet aſide the ſpirit, and to render its internal operation unneceſſary.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:019924_0048_0FE1A6A5D428FED8"/>ſpirit; and therefore to be received by its own illumination. We may gather up theoretic notions concerning them from the declarations of thoſe who did receive them; but this will not convey the realities they expreſs to us. It will center far ſhort of creating us anew in Chriſt Jeſus, without which we may profeſs ourſelves Chriſtians; but<note n="r" place="bottom">Gal. v. 24.</note>

                     <p>But ſome, who allow that the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit is ſtill afforded to mankind, deny that any man now hath an internal ſenſe of it, ſo as to diſtinguiſh its motions in them from thoſe of their own minds. But, certainly, whoever feels any inward convictions for ſin conceived or committed, not under the cognizance of law, nor open to other mens knowledge, may eaſily diſtinguiſh the motions of the reproved which leads into ſin, from thoſe of the reprover who ſmites for it, to lead out of it; and if any ever become inſenſible of it, it is for want of obeying it. Such as continue to reject it, may occaſion it to become ſilent in them for a ſeaſon; but it always remains preſent with them, though they feel it not, and will revive upon them with inexpreſſible terror, at a time when they ſhall find no way to eſcape.</p>

                        <q>Thoſe that rebel againſt the light, they know not the ways thereof.</q> Abiding under the beclouding influence of prejudice, unbelief, or ſelf-confidence, they ſhut themſelves up againſt the light, and often decry and ridicule it; but thoſe who embrace it as from God, come to experience the new-birth of the ſpirit, and in the new-birth receive a new life, and in the new life a new ſenſe. The life and ſenſe of the firſt birth are carnal; the life and ſenſe of the ſecond are ſpiritual, which nothing but the ſpirit can communicate.</p>
                     <p>Peter told the regenerate formerly,<note n="v" place="bottom">I Pet. i. 22.</note> 
                        <q>Ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth through the ſpirit.</q> They had joined the truth, that is, the ſpirit of truth, in its operation to the purification of their ſouls, and certainly, not without a ſenſe of it. This ſpirit of truth is the ſpirit of Chriſt, which he promiſed ſhould come to<note n="w" place="bottom">John xvi. 8, 13</note> 
                        <hi>reprove, or convince, the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment, and to guide into all truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we ſee, the ſpirit cometh not only to rebuke, convince, and diſquiet mankind in evil to lead them out of it, but alſo to accompany them in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and guide them into all truth. For when they are brought to receive it, believe in it, and cleave to it, they become the ſheep of Chriſt; they<note n="x" place="bottom">John x. 3, 4, 14, 27.</note>

There can be no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation to any but thoſe who receive a ſenſe of it; for that cannot be manifeſted to me, which I have no diſtinct perception of.

And who ever experienced a reſurrection from this death, unto life in Chriſt, by the quickening power of his ſpirit, without a living ſenſe of it? Inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not a property of life, but of death; therefore the living members of the body or church of Chriſt, cannot be inſenſible of the life of Chriſt, by which their ſouls are quickened, or made alive in him.</p>
                     <p>The miniſtration of the ſpirit hath ever been the life of true religion. The faireſt form, and moſt plauſible profeſſion, are no more than a lifeleſs letter without it.<note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii. 6.</note> 
                        <q>The letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life;</q> and whoſoever receiveth the ſpirit, receiveth life, and thoſe who receive life, receive a ſenſe of that life; for life is not without ſenſe in proportion to its degree, and the higher degree of life any receive, the more ſenſible they are of its quickening virtue.</p>
                     <p>The expreſs terms of the new covenant, cited from the prophet, Heb. viii. 10, 11, are, <q>This is the convenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord; I will put my laws
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:019924_0051_0FE1A6B2270EB010"/>into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.

                     </p>
                     <p>This plainly ſhews, that under the goſpel-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, <hi>the Lord himſelf is the teacher of his people, and that individually;</hi> that he openeth his law in their hearts ſo clearly and indubitably, that none who duly attend to his immediate inſtructions, in their conſciences, need to remain under a neceſſity of being taught their duty to him by their brethren, or their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>From the gracious illumination of this Divine Teacher, ariſeth the ſtrongeſt internal evidence of the truth of Chriſtianity to thoſe who become ſubject to his inſtruction. Many, under various denominations, have acknowledged, that the truth and excellence of the Chriſtian diſpenſation hath been rendered more clear and certain to them by this inward principle, than by all other kinds of evidence whatſoever; and it is a great proof of the good will of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that he hath laid open to all, whether learned or void of literature, this ſhorteſt and ſureſt way to that evidence, which brings with it the moſt clear and cogent degree of convincement.</p>

                  <head>REASONS FOR THE NECESSITY OF SILENT WAITING, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>SOLOMON ſaith,<note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. 1.</note> "The preparations of the heart in man, and the anſwer of the tongue, are from the Lord." If the Lord alone can prepare the heart, ſtir it up, or incline it towards unfeigned holineſs, how can any man approach him acceptably till his heart be prepared by him? And how can he know this preparation, except he wait in ſilence to feel it?<note n="b" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 18.</note> It is by the ſpirit that believers have acceſs to the Father; and are not the impreſſions and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſpirit to be felt and diſtinguiſhed from the workings of our own carnal minds? If they are, ought not believers to wait patiently in ſilent ſubmiſſion of ſoul, in order to diſtinguiſh when the golden ſceptre is ſtretched out, which gives liberty to approach the Sacred Preſence? And muſt not the preparations of the heart by the ſpirit make us ſenſible of our real wants, before we can aſk aright; and alſo of our miſerable ſtate, before we can ſeek that relief which is proper for us? Muſt not the ſpirit likewiſe impart help and conſolation to us, before we can rejoice in its ſalvation, praiſe the Lord on the banks of deliverance, and make ſweet melody in our hearts unto him? Can we bow before him in true reverence and fear, in faith, till the ſpirit hath
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019924_0054_0FE1A6BD33DCD718"/>mercifully begot theſe ſenſations in the ſoul? Muſt not the carnal mind, which is at enmity with God, be ſilenced in us before theſe impreſſions prevail over all? If we preſume to approach him without the ſenſible drawings of his ſpirit, may we not ſpeak unadviſedly with our lips, and offer ſomewhat like the polluted ſacrifice of the wicked, which is an abomination to him, and therefore cannot be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from a diſciple of Chriſt? To ſuch the apoſtle ſaith,<note n="c" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 13.</note> "It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure." Muſt we not conſequently wait in ſilence till this will be raiſed in us, and power given us to perform a holy worſhip, and to offer an offering in righteouſneſs?</p>
                  <p>The influences of the ſpirit are not at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, circumſcribed in our time, or limitted by our wills, and therefore muſt be humbly waited for, ſeeing we can have no acceſs without it; and if that in which all our ſpiritual ability and ſtrength is, be not our own, nor at our command, but muſt be freely diſpenſed to us afreſh by the great Giver, muſt we not ſubmiſſively wait in ſilence for his qualifying power, by which alone we can move aright? Hence David, deeply ſenſible of his own inability, ſaith, Pſalm lxii. 1. "Truly my ſoul waiteth upon (or, as in the margin, is ſilent before) God; from him cometh my ſalvation;" and verſe 5. "my ſoul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him."</p>
                  <p>Do not theſe remarks clearly point out the neceſſity of our patiently waiting upon the Lord in ſilence, for renewed ſtrength, that by the inward and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operations of his Spirit, he may pluck the feet of our minds out of the mire and clay of corrupt thoughts and carnal inclinations, and alſo beget a ſuitable concern and travail of ſpirit in us, that from
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019924_0055_0FE1A6BF41D98E78"/>the ariſing of a true ſpiritual exerciſe, the mouth may ſpeak what the panting ſoul feels when it is athirſt for God; or, at leaſt, be humbly ſenſible of thoſe ſighs and groans begotten therein by the Spirit, which cannot be uttered in words? Is not this concern and exerciſe wherein the ſoul is deeply engaged, and the judgment clearly convinced, more acceptable to the all-ſeeing God, who calls for truth in the inward parts, than a multitude of fine unfelt expreſſions dropt from the lips, whilſt the heart is wandering without due reſtraint, far from a ſenſe of his preſence? Nay, will not five words ſpoke from a good underſtanding under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have more weight with the Almighty, than five thouſand uttered from a lukewarm, inſenſible, or careleſs mind? Can we ſuppoſe the infinitely wiſe Creator of all things is, like ſhort-ſighted man, either to be deceived or pleaſed with our much ſpeaking? Our Lord ſaith, "When ye pray, uſe not vain repetitions, as the Heathen do, for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye aſk him." Mat. vi. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>The inſpired prophet Iſaiah, in the laſt verſe of the fortieth chapter, ſaith, "They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength." In the firſt verſe of the next chapter immediately ſucceeding, he ſhews what is meant by waiting in theſe words, "Keep ſilence before me, O iſlands! and let the people renew their ſtrength." Certainly this ſilence imports the ſame thing as waiting in the former verſe, ſeeing the ſame effect is attributed to both; and is not the carnal mind and corrupt imagination here commanded to keep ſilence before God, that the ſoul may properly wait and watch unto prayer?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019924_0056_0FE1A6C0C5467E90"/>The prophet adds, "Let them come near, then let them ſpeak." This alſo appears to call the immortal ſoul into deep ſilence, that therein it may firſt receive divine help to draw near in ſpirit to the great Jehovah, and then ſpeak forth its humble petition, under a ſenſe of that holy, ſolemn, awful reverence, which is due from a dependent creature in its approaches towards its Almighty Creator.</p>
                  <p>A certain miniſter of the church of England,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Charles Wheatly, M. A. Vicar of Brent and Turner's Pelham, in Hertfordſhire.</note> writing on the Common-Prayer, and the ſentences placed at the beginning of the ſervice, obſerves, <q>That prayer requires ſo much attention and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind, that it can never be performed without ſome preceding preparation; for which reaſon, ſays he, according to Bingham's Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, vol. 5. book xiii. chap. 11, 12. when the Jews enter into their ſynagogues to pray, they remain ſilent for ſome time, and meditate before whom they ſtand.</q> Can we think ſuch a reverent practice amongſt Chriſtians would not be more ſuitable and acceptable to him, who need not be told what we are, than the too common cuſtom of haſtily approaching his Sacred Preſence, and preſuming to ſpeak to him without previous recollection, and due conſideration before whom they ſtand?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Ecclef. v. 1.</note> "Keep thy foot," ſaith Solomon, "when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the ſacrifice of fools; for they conſider not that they do evil." If caution and conſideration were requiſite under the law of Moſes, which made nothing perfect as pertaining to the conſcience, how much more is it ſo under the goſpel diſpenſation, which more directly requires,<note n="e" place="bottom">John iv. 23.</note> that the Lord be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth; not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019924_0057_0FE1A6C2EA0DAFA0"/>feignedly with the lip only, but with the whole heart ſpiritually exerciſed? What foot is this that muſt be kept in ſuch ſubjection? Is it only the foot of the body, and not rather the haſty forwardneſs of the carnal mind, that the attention of the ſoul may become fixed upon God, the fountain of all ſpiritual ſtrength and living mercies, who muſt teach our hearts to pray, if ever we pray effectually?</p>
                  <p>Iſaiah ſaith,<note n="f" place="bottom">Iſa. xxvi. 3.</note> "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee." Can any thing be more conſiſtent with a ſilent dependent waiting, than a mind ſtayed upon God, in a ſincere confidence and firm expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Divine Help; and if it behoves a Chriſtian to have his mind thus frequently ſtayed upon the Divine Power, how much more in ſolemn worſhip, and near approaches to the Sacred Preſence, who cannot poſſibly be deceived, or amuſed by the arts of compoſition, or the powers of human eloquence; and who has paſſed a ſentence of<note n="g" place="bottom">Ibid xxix. 13.</note> condemnation on the too common practice of drawing near to him with the mouth, and honouring him with the lips, whilſt the heart is far from him? How can the ſoul any way be more uninterruptedly ſtayed upon him, than in a ſilent waiting for Divine Help, and the renewings of ſpiritual power, under a ſolid attention to hear what he ſhall reveal unto it, as its preſent duty?</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaith,<note n="h" place="bottom">John x. 27.</note> "My ſheep hear my voice;" and he further declares,<note n="i" place="bottom">John iv. 5.</note> "they know his voice, and a ſtranger will they not follow." Now, what partakes more of the ſtranger's voice than ſelf-will and ſelf-ſufficiency in Divine ſervice?<note n="k" place="bottom">Ibid xv. 5.</note> "Without me, ſaith the Lord to his diſciples, ye can do nothing." That is, nothing really and ſubſtantially good, or
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019924_0058_0FE1A6C9E089AE70"/>acceptable to God; becauſe himſelf is the Lord from heaven, the ſecond Adam, the quickening ſpirit without whoſe influence all we offer is void of ſpirit or life. He is that inexhauſtible fountain of power and wiſdom, of vital holineſs, and ſaving health to the ſoul, which, like the ſap that ariſeth from the root of the vine, is the life and nouriſhment of every branch. Such is the ſenſible connection of Chriſt, the true head of the church, with the ſeveral members of his ſpiritual body: they are dependent upon him, as the branch is on the vine, both ſor life, and the daily ſupply of ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of that life which is hid with Chriſt in God; how therefore can they pray as they ought, in a ſpirit and manner ſuitable to their preſent wants, till he open their hearts, and teach them, by the wiſdom of his ſpirit, what to pray for? If left to themſelves, may they not aſk amiſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not receive? How can the miniſters of the everlaſting goſpel communicate the will of God, till they receive illumination and ability from his ſpirit, to ſpeak profitably to the preſent ſtates of the people? How can any come to the throne of Divine Grace without his immediate help and influence? What can raiſe the ſallen ſoul up to God-ward, and humble it in due proſtration before him, give it a deep ſenſe of its wants, and of the riches of his love and mercy, but the Holy Spirit itſelf? How neceſſary then, and reaſonable it is, that we ſhould patiently wait in ſubmiſſive ſilence, for the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings and quickenings of its heavenly power, to guide both heart and tongue in addreſſing the Holy One of Iſrael? David ſaith,<note n="l" place="bottom">Pſal. li. 17.</note> "The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God! thou wilt not deſpiſe." What but his heart-humbling ſpirit can prepare this ſacrifice
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019924_0059_0FE1A6CB63C5E1F8"/>in the ſoul? If no power but his can do this, muſt we not conſequently watch and wait in ſilence to receive its aſſiſtance, and have the impreſſions of the ſpirit before we can pray with the ſpirit, and with a right underſtanding alſo? And ſeeing the Lord is a God of knowledge, and that by him our actions are weighed, how careful ſhould we be to know what ſpirit governs and influenceth our ſouls in his ſolemn worſhip!</p>
                  <p>Solomon, under an awful ſenſe of the Divine Greatneſs and Majeſty, affords us this neceſſary caution, when we preſent ourſelves before him:<note n="m" place="bottom">Eccleſs. v. 2.</note> "Be not raſh with thy mouth." This every one certainly is, who preſumes to ſpeak to the Moſt High before he hath duly conſidered in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he is. He adds, "Le not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few." This plainly inculcates, how much it behoves us to have a reverent ſenſe of the majeſty and purity of the ſupreme ſearcher of hearts, and to be deeply humbled into a feeling of our inability and nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before we addreſs him with our lips.</p>
                  <p>If it is not in man's power duly to prepare his own heart, and yet it is his indiſpenſable duty deeply and reverently to worſhip the Author of his being in ſpirit and in truth, how neceſſary muſt an awful ſilence be, that he may know his ſoul prepared by the immediate hand of God to approach him acceptably! On the contrary, how inconſiderate, haſty, or preſumptuous is the practice of uttering words to him, which the heart doth not underſtand, or of confeſſing a ſtate it never ſenſibly experienced! Certainly, if we believe the Lord is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation, we muſt conclude, he is more jealous of his honour than to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019924_0060_0FE1A6CCE885EE90"/>accept of ſuch diſſimulation. Is not an humble, conſcientious, ſilent waiting in ſubmiſſion, to be influenced and led by him, abundantly preferable in his ſight? Then how much more the ſighs and expreſſions that proceed from a real heart-affecting ſenſe of his greatneſs and omnipreſence, and of the lowneſs and unworthineſs of the creature that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders itſelf as duſt and aſhes before him! Doth not ſuch a weighty ſenſe of our meanneſs and inability of ourſelves to offer any thing pleaſing to him, who is an infinite ſpirit ſuperlatively glorious, unleſs he firſt condeſcend graciouſly to help our infirmities, and teach us to pray as we ought, diſcover more true regard, and real concern of heart, to offer up a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſacrifice that may be acceptable, through Jeſus Chriſt the great Mediator, who never can intercede with the Father to accept an inſincere hypocritical offering, a barely drawing near to him with the tongue, and honouring him with the lips, whilſt the heart is inſenſible of his fear, and amuſed with other objects? Is it not more ſafe and rational to wait in ſilence upon the Lord, than thus to deceive our ſouls with ſparks of our own kindling, warming vain and fooliſh ſelf with a fire of its own lighting, inſtead of placing our expectation upon him, who alone can teach his people rightly to profit, and enable them to pray with the Spirit, and with a right underſtanding alſo?</p>
                  <p>There is an eſſential difference betwixt praying in reality as the ſpirit ſhall teach us, and praying in form as men and books adviſe us. Thoſe who pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, pray with additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal fervency, knowing their attention fixed on God alone, their underſtandings are opened into a true diſcerning of their ſpiritual wants, and their ſouls quickened to a lively, humble, ſincere worſhip; wherein their ſpirits are refreſhed, and gain ſtrength
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019924_0061_0FE1A6CE6ACCC1B0"/>in the Lord, and in the power of his might. On the other hand, men and books may furniſh with fair ſeemings, and plauſible expreſſions, but they cannot effect that brokenneſs of ſpirit, that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart, and ſenſibility of ſoul which the Spirit of God gives. They may teach to ſay, Lord! Lord! whilſt Satan rules in the will and affections, and carries the imaginations after divers vanities; for nothing leſs than the power of the ſpirit can ſubdue and chain down the carnal mind. How neceſſary then is an humble waiting in ſilence, truly to know what ſpirit we are of, before we offer any thing to the living God? Without this knowledge we muſt be liable to offer ſtrange fire, which the Lord never commanded, like the ſons of Aaron, who, through negligence having ſuffered the holy fire, divinely kindled, to go out, preſented a ſtrange fire of man's kindling, for which they ſuffered death. Ought not this expreſſive inſtance of divine diſpleaſure againſt the preſumptuous ſubſtitutions of men after their own wills, and in the place of God's appointment, to deter mankind from offering their own carnal conceptions and contrivances, inſtead of his inward and ſpiritual requirings? Ought not this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtrike every one with a deep and awful ſenſe, that ſomething more is due to the great Jehovah, than thoſe common, careleſs, unfelt modes of worſhip which too many are apt to ſatisfy themſelves with; and more eſpecially as he hath declared,<note n="n" place="bottom">Lev. x. 3.</note> "I will be ſanctified in them that come night me." How can he be ſanctified in us, but as his own pure Spirit awfully prevails in the ſoul, puts it forth in humility, and influenceth the will and affections by its holy quickening energy?</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt is indeed our Lord, why are not we more ſeriouſly concerned to honour him in our
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019924_0062_0FE1A6D408CAAFC8"/>hearts? If he is our maſter, why do we not ſo fear his diſpleaſure, as to endeavour, with all diligence, to walk circumſpectly, not as fools, inattentive to his leadings; but as wiſe, ſeeking to redeem the time, becauſe the days are evil?</p>
                  <p>The Spirit, by the mouth of Zechariah, ſaith,<note n="o" place="bottom">Zech. ii. 13.</note> "Be ſilent, O all fleſh! before the Lord; for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation." Is not a modeſt humble ſilence properly due to the preſence of the King of kings, and Lord of lords? Doth it not beſpeak more real and awful regard to his perfect holineſs, wiſdom and power, to wait for his Spirit to open our hearts and lips, before we attempt vocally to ſpeak forth his praiſe, than to be haſty in uttering words without true knowledge before our all-ſeeing Judge? Then how approveable is the practice of ſolemn ſilent waiting, till we receive illumination and ability properly to worſhip the Almighty! Would the potentates of the earth think themſelves treated with becoming reverence, ſhould their ſubjects and ſervants immediately approach them with a multitude of words, and continue them the whole time they ſtand in their preſence, inſtead of waiting ſilently to hear their pleaſure, and receive their commands? How much leſs ought we to expect ſuch behaviour is pleaſing, or acceptable from us, to him who ſearches all hearts, and knows us better than we know ourſelves; to whom we muſt be indebted for the true knowledge of every ſpiritual want, before we can have wiſdom to aſk aright according to his will!</p>
                  <p>When the prophet Iſaiah was admitted, in a viſion, to behold the glorious Majeſty of God, he could only cry,<note n="p" place="bottom">Iſa. vi.</note> "Woe is me!" till a live coal from the holy altar had touched his lips, and purged away his ſin. What a deep reverence of his Maker, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019924_0063_0FE1A6D844BF64A0"/>juſt abhorrence of ſelf filled his humbled mind, when he was favoured with this awful ſight of the ſupreme glory! How ſelf-abaſing were his ſenſations, and emphatical his expreſſions, when he cried, "Woe is me! for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips! and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts!" How different is this heart-felt acknowledgment, proceeding from the powerful convictions of the Holy Spirit, to thoſe dry, formal, unfelt words that come from the lips of bare nominal Chriſtians! Notwithſtanding every diſciple hath not ſo large a portion of the Holy Spirit, as this great prophet had, yet every one is graciouſly favoured with a meaſure ſufficient to render his offering ſpiritual and living.</p>
                  <p>We read, that after the aſcenſion of Chriſt, his diſciples<note n="q" place="bottom">Acts ii. 1, 4.</note> "were all with one accord in one place, when they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt." Tho' the text doth not expreſſly ſay, they were waiting in ſilence for the promiſe of the Father, yet it appears as probable they were, as that they were not; for there is no mention of any vocal exerciſe amongſt them at that time, before they were influenced thereunto by that peculiar communication and impulſe of the Holy Ghoſt, whence "they began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." The attention is certainly more likely to be fixed upon, and ſtayed in true watchfulneſs towards the Lord, and the mind more fitly prepared to receive the influence of his divine light and power, in ſilent waiting, than if agitated in a continual practice of running over a multitude of unfelt expreſſions.</p>

Is not the carnal mind of man included in this prohibition? What is more likely to ſcatter and divert his attention from the right object, than thoughts, imaginations, and propenſities of an earthly or ſenſual nature? What more diſhonourable to the Lord of perfection and purity, than the buſy forward actings of an unprepared and corrupt heart in ſpiritual things? What is more neceſſary to be ſilenced than that which is at enmity with God? What more becoming an humble dependent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſenſible of the depravity of its nature, of its inability to do any good, and of the honour due to the preſence of its Creator, than a deeply expreſſive ſolemn ſilence before him?</p>
                  <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt taught his diſciples to avoid the practice of hypocrites,<note n="t" place="bottom">Mat. vi. 5, 6, 7.</note> "Who love to pray ſtanding in the ſynagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeen of men." He alſo directed, "When ye pray, uſe not vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the Heathen do, for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking;" and indeed, what now makes a greater ſhew or figure in religion amongſt many, than to uſe long and frequent prayers, and much formal devotion, as if their eye was more towards the praiſe of men than acceptance with God, and as if they gloried in empty appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances? But what is the precept of Chriſt?<note n="v" place="bottom">Ibid vi. 6.</note> "When thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father, who ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly." Doth not this teach us, that before we approach the Fountain of all wiſdom, to ſhut out every thing that would amuſe or divert the attention from the reverence due to the great object
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019924_0065_0FE1A33999284EC0"/>of our adoration, the giver of every good and perfect gift? Can we be too ſolid, or feel our hearts, affections, and deſires, too much gathered out of tranſitory things, into a humbling ſenſe of the Divine Preſence, when we apply ourſelves to the ſolemn act of worſhipping the Majeſty on high?</p>
                  <p>Since waiting upon God in ſilence for renewed ſtrength and ſpiritual wiſdom, to lead our hearts, and direct our tongues in vocal prayer, or preaching, makes no oſtentatious ſhew, but rather appears contemptible to the buſy diſpoſition and wiſdom of vain man, it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that this ſelf-denying practice ſhould gain the approbation or praiſe of men; yet in muſt evidently tend to prevent that great and offenſive hypocriſy, of drawing near to the Lord with the tongue, and worſhipping him with the lips, whilſt the heart is far from him. Can there be any frame more fit or proper for the poor ſoul, wherein to hear the ſtill ſmall voice of the true internal Shepherd, than that of an attentive and ſubmiſſive ſilent waiting?</p>
                  <p>Waiting upon God is abundantly recommended in holy writ, and waiting in ſilence neceſſarily implied in order to hear his voice.<note n="w" place="bottom">John <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </note> "My ſheep, ſaith the great Shepherd, hear my voice." When is the ſoul ſo capable of hearing the quickening language of his ſpirit, as in a ſtate of ſilent watching for, and waiting to hear what he ſhall give it an underſtanding of, and engage it in, as its requiſite and reaſonable duty, by the illuminating virtue and enlivening power of his holy influence?</p>
                  <p>Our Lord forbids us to uſe vain repetitions; and what efficacy can thoſe prayers have, which are made in the will, and by the contrivance of man, or that are uttered either from books, invention, or memory, whilſt the heart neither feels the thing the mouth
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019924_0066_0FE1A6E0EE832678"/>ſpeaks, nor ever experienced what the tongue declares? What are theſe but vain repetitions and empty ſounds? Whilſt people remain inſenſible of the real condition of their ſouls, and of the true ſelf-abaſing fear of God, do they not ſeem to think they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking, if they content themſelves with the frequent repetition of long lifeleſs prayers, which they have not ſo much as weightily conſidered before they uttered them? Is this to worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth; the only worſhip inſtituted by Chriſt in this goſpel-day, and therefore the only worſhip acceptable to God, who is a Spirit? Can this ſpiritual worſhip be performed till the ſoul feels its operation awfully to humble, engage, and impower the mind to this ſolemn act? What but the Spirit of the Redeemer is able to awaken and ſtir up the immortal ſoul, and endue it with wiſdom and utterance, ſuitably to expreſs itſelf, according to and under a due ſenſe of its wants?</p>
                  <p>Chriſt in Spirit is the way, or leading power, to the Father; no man can come to the Father but by him. What is the reaſon why ſo many, who profeſs to be followers of Chriſt, complain of wandering thoughts, inattention, much coldneſs, deadneſs, and inſenſibility in prayer, and other duties and devotions? Is it not becauſe they are too little dependent on the dictates of the Spirit, and believe not its ſenſible influence neceſſary to every religious act, nor wait for it to cleanſe the thoughts of their hearts, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them to approach the Moſt High and Holy God in truth and righteouſneſs? Is it not becauſe ſuch lean too much to their own unſubjected wiſdom and underſtanding, to place their dependence on the Spirit, and to wait for its reſtraining heart-affecting power to lead them into all truth, and therefore are ſent empty away, and no more truly refreſhed or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019924_0067_0FE1A6E271A8CC90"/>benefited by their lifeleſs devotions, than he who dreams he eateth, but when he awakes, perceives he is yet empty? Thus they aſk and receive not, becauſe they aſk amiſs; not in a right frame, but in a lukewarm and unconcerned ſtate of mind. The enemy is too ſtrong for ſuch worſhippers, and carries their thoughts and imaginations after ſtrange objects, while their lips only approach the Almighty. One ſecret prayer, or deep ſigh from the wreſtling ſoul, produced by the Eternal Spirit, is of more real ſervice to it, iſſues from it with more fervour, prevails more effectually with the Father, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures it more refreſhment than ten thouſand vain repetitions; becauſe the virtue of the Spirit of the great Interceſſor being in theſe prayers and ſighs, they cannot but find acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the common complaint of wanderings in time of prayer, from thoſe who oppoſe ſilent waiting for the divine aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to ſpeak or pray according to the will of God, prove the neceſſity of ſuch a practice, in order to worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth?

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019924_0068_0FE1A6E3F2981A48"/>of the Holy Spirit, and that he held no former experiences, however good in themſelves, ſufficient qualifications for divine ſervice in the time preſent. He knew, that nothing ſhort of a freſh ſupply from the Fountain of living virtue could properly enable him to preach to others; and therefore prayed,<note n="z" place="bottom">Pſal. li. 15.</note> "Open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe."</p>
                  <p>The apoſtle Paul ſaith,<note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 26.</note> "The ſpirit alſo helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." By this juſt acknowledgment it appears, the exerciſe of a mind deeply affected is more than words can expreſs, therefore it ſpeaks to God in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable groans: a thing much deſpiſed and ſcoffed at by many profeſſors in this age. We ſee however, the apoſtle was not aſhamed to own it to be what himſelf and his brethren experienced to be true; which ſhews the ſenſe they had of their own natural inability and blindneſs, and alſo their firm depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the Holy Spirit, without which they knew not what to pray for as they ought; and therefore found a neceſſity to wait for its renewals upon them, before they could either pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or preach to others profitably, and with divine acceptance. How can we at this day preſume to know what to pray for as we ought without the ſenſible help of the Holy Spirit, if this great apoſtle and his brethren did not? Yet, is there not ground for ſuſpicion, from the common practice of profeſſing Chriſtians now, that they do not think themſelves at a loſs what to pray for acceptably; and therefore preſumptuouſly offer their invented ſupplications, without due fear and caution, to him who looketh at the heart, and remain inſenſible of the neceſſity
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019924_0069_0FE1A6E5A600F930"/>of feeling the Holy Spirit to diſengage them from roving thoughts, and concerns of a temporal nature, and to communicate of that diſcerning wiſdom and living power which is requiſite to direct their hearts and tongues aright.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding a previous waiting upon God is ſo much deſpiſed, the apoſtle intimates, that the groanings of the Spirit are effectual without vocal ſounds; which proves there is an inward addreſs deeper than the expreſſion of words, which is heard and accepted of God. Let me add, that Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf applied to the Father in this manner, when<note n="b" place="bottom">John xi. 33.38.41.</note> "He groaned in the Spirit twice," and afterwards lift up his eyes, and before he called Lazarus out of the grave, ſaid, "Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me." This ſhews his fervent groans were accepted, and his requeſt granted, without audible expreſſions; and doth not the compaſſionate Father ſtill regard the groans begotten by the Spirit of his Son in the hearts of his followers? Indeed there is much efficacy in groans that ariſe from this living principle.</p>
                  <p>The apoſtle Paul ſaith,<note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 9. 11.</note> "If any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.—If the Spirit of him who raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." When do Chriſtians more need theſe quickenings than in their aſſemblies for divine worſhip; and how muſt they diſtinguiſh them, except they wait in ſilence? Is it an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable preſumption, humbly to wait in expectation of the promiſed aſſiſtance, to enable us ſenſibly to worſhip freely, livingly, and powerfully, which cannot be, unleſs the Spirit of Chriſt is our helper? If theſe internal quickenings be the continued pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Chriſt's diſciples, and if it is to the virtue
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019924_0070_0FE1A6EE8D80D920"/>thereof that all our ſervices owe their efficacy and acceptance, can it be right or ſafe to run before, and without that which is the very life of true prayer and preaching? If not, there is an abſolute neceſſity for, and certainly great propriety in waiting patiently for it, in ſubmiſſive ſilence, that the ſacrifice may be of the Lord's preparing, and that it may be offered according to his will, under the immediate conduct of his own pure Spirit. Thus qualified, we pray with the Spirit, and with underſtanding alſo; which prayer muſt conſequently profit and refreſh the thirſty ſoul; and if a filent attention had neither any expreſs command, nor example in ſcripture, it is neceſſarily implied in many parts of it, as well as in the nature of true ſpiritual worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Is not the Almighty a moſt pure and perfectly glorious being, dwelling in the light, whom no man can approach unto, but by the Spirit of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator? And is not man abſolutely dependent on the merciful goodneſs and power of his Creator? and is it not reaſonable that ſuch a creature ſhould be made deeply ſenſible to whom he muſt be indebted for all ſpiritual ability, as well as temporal favours, before he can approach the Sacred Preſence with becoming reverence? And in what ſtate is he ſo likely to be made ſenſible of this, as under an abſtraction of mind from earthly cogitations and concerns, into a ſilent attention upon the omnipreſent Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Theſe things duly conſidered, is it juſt and reaſonable to cenſure and deſpiſe any people for conſcientiouſly waiting upon God in ſilence, and frequently falling into ſuch an heart-engaging exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſpirit in his fear, as cannot often be uttered in words, and conſequently muſt be experienced in ſilence?

And how can we attain this feeling, without patiently waiting in ſilence for its powerful aſſiſtance?</p>
                  <p>If the primitive Chriſtians were of themſelves ſo inſufficient to think any thing, or to point out to themſelves their own line of duty according to the divine will, they certainly could not of themſelves pray or preach to others conſiſtent therewith, and therefore were obliged to wait for the renewals of light and ability from the Holy Spirit wherein their

It certainly is not; for we are under the ſame diſpenſation, and altogether as inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of ourſelves as they could be. It is therefore now as requiſite for us, as it could then be for them, to wait for divine direction and help, to give us a true ſenſe both of our ſtate and duty, and to enable us to the performance of it; and how can we reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect to receive the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, but by humbly watching, and waiting in ſilence for its appearance and operation in our ſouls?</p>

If ſo, why ſhould an awful ſilent waiting upon him be treated, by any, as unprofitable and inconſiſtent with divine worſhip? Why ſhould any prefer the modes and forms their own hearts have deviſed, or ignorantly eſpouſed, to a ſolemn ſubmiſſive waiting in ſilence, to know the true ſtate of the ſoul, and to receive the bleſſed counſel of the Spirit, before they proceed vocally to addreſs the Dread of nations, or preſume to preach as in his name, and declare any thing as his will, whoſe all-ſeeing eye is continually upon them?</p>

                  <p>Beſides the many ſcriptures in favour of a patient dependence upon, and ſilent waiting for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening power of the Spirit, to give us a true ſenſe of our wants, and bring to our remembrance the great obligations we are under to the mercy and goodneſs of God, there is alſo a cloud of witneſſes, who have experimentally profited, and edified much more in ſilence than they ever did before they were in the practice of it, who, I believe, can ſay in truth and righteouſneſs, that when the juſt judgments of an offended God were heavy upon them for tranſgreſſion, and their tribulations were inexpreſſible, through ſtrong heart-breaking convictions of the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin, and they lay groaning under it daily in great wretchedneſs, without finding any help or deliverance from all their own workings, their many and long prayers, and ſelf-righteouſneſs; then it pleaſed the merciful Redeemer to open a way for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019924_0074_0FE1A6F9AF35A9B0"/>them gradually into humble ſtillneſs, and to reveal his Son in them, as the precious Lamb of God, who taketh away the Sin of the world. This bleſſed diſcovery raiſed them out of their diſtreſſes, and enabled them to ſay, "My ſoul doth magnify the Lord, and my ſpirit rejoiceth in God my Saviour; for he hath regarded the low eſtate of his ſervant." This inclined them to ſit willingly at his feet in ſilence, and gladly to receive his pouring forth of the wine and oil into their bleeding wounds, till he healed their backſlidings, and forgave their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. For,<note n="k" place="bottom">I John i. 9.</note> "If we confeſs our ſins (from a real abhorrence of ſin) he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs." Who can declare the ſweet conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſuch have felt, who believe in his name as ſufficient to purge the conſcience from dead works, and enable them to ſerve him in newneſs of life? Truly, they have experienced that teſtimony of David fulfilled in their own hearts,<note n="l" place="bottom">Pſal xl. 1, 2.</note> "I waited patiently, ſaith he, for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up alſo out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and ſet my feet upon a rock." Thus they were brought out of darkneſs into light, and came to know, that whereas they had been ſpiritually blind, now, by the grace of God, they had received their ſight, and by this power of diſcerning, learn not to truſt to themſelves, or their own works, but atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to watch, and ſilently to wait, both to hear what the Spirit ſaith to the churches, and what it requires of them in their own particulars, that by its heavenly power every thought might be brought into the obedience of Chriſt. Thus they have been taught, and do certainly know, that no man can come to the Father, but by him; nor that any can
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019924_0075_0FE1A6FB47CC6A08"/>ſufficiently ſee their own ſins, truly repent, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cry for deliverance, or rejoice in his ſalvation, but as his ſaving power is exerciſed in them, and their minds become ſubjected thereunto. This is the power they have learnt to wait for, and depend upon; in which dependent ſtate they meet with the Lord as a quickening Spirit, hear him inſtruct them with convincing clearneſs, and feel his preſence to impart freſh life and ſtrength to their ſouls; for he ſtill ſpeaks in his ſpiritual manifeſtation, as he did in his bodily appearance, with divine authority, and as never man ſpoke, and is the author of eternal ſalvation to all that obey him. Theſe can experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally ſay, that he is come to teach his people himſelf, and that he is made unto them wiſdom, to direct their ſteps in the way to the kingdom; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, to clothe their ſpirits; their ſanctification and complete redemption; as they are concerned not only to receive him in the beginning as their Lord and Saviour, but alſo to grow up and perſevere in the power of the Spirit, earneſtly deſiring to be rooted and built up in its divine nature, and eſtabliſhed in the true faith. The Lord alone can profitably apply the precious promiſes to the poor ſoul, as he leads it through the various progreſſive ſtates to which the promiſes belong; by whoſe guidance his faithful followers are brought to eſcape the corruptions that are in the world, and meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to become partakers of the divine nature.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt dwells in the hearts of theſe by faith, as the holy, powerful, appointed miniſter of the ſanctuary and true tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not man. He not only teacheth infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly and convincingly, but alſo raiſeth a hunger and thirſt after a cloſer union with himſelf, and a fuller poſſeſſion and enjoyment of his everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Thoſe who have attained this experience,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019924_0076_0FE1A6FCC9DF7F10"/>cannot but eſteem the time well ſpent in ſilently waiting for his inſtruction what to pray for, and that he may open their underſtandings to diſcern their preſent duty, and how to apply the ſacred writings to real profit, and alſo to commemorate what great things he has mercifully done for their needy ſouls, both without and within them. This frequently melts them into tears of unaffected contrition, and humble gratitude; in which ſtate they can adore his goodneſs, and put up their petitions without a prayer-book, and often without any vocal ſound; for he is then known to be in his temple, and the earthly part is in perfect ſilence before him. What ſober perſon, who conſiders how awful a thing it is to worſhip the great Jehovah in ſpirit and truth, can lightly cenſure or diſapprove of ſuch a ſilent depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on his power, to help the poor creature under its manifold infirmities?<note n="m" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxvii. 7, and xxvii. 14.</note> "Reſt in the Lord, ſaith David, or as in the margin, Be ſilent to the Lord, and wait patiently for him; wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart.

ROBERT BARCLAY, in his Apology for the true Chriſtian Divinity, as held forth by the people called Quakers, has wrote ſo clearly on the ſubject in his eleventh propoſition, that a few quotations from this author may ſerve to illuſtrate the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going reaſons, and confirm the teſtimonies of many experimental witneſſes on the ſubject, and profitableneſs of ſolemn ſilence.</p>
                  <p>IN his propoſition on worſhip, in ſect. 6. he has theſe remarks: <q>We judge it the duty of all to be diligent in the aſſembling of themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when aſſembled, the great work of one and all ought to be to wait upon God; and returning out of their own thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to feel the Lord's preſence, and know a gathering into his name indeed, where he is in the midſt, according to his promiſe. And as every one is thus gathered, and ſo met together inwardly in their ſpirits, as well as outwardly in their perſons, there the ſecret power and virtue of life is known to refreſh the ſoul, and the pure motions and breathings of God's ſpirit are felt to ariſe; from which, as words of declaration, prayers or praiſes ariſe, the acceptable worſhip is known, which edifies the church, and is well-pleaſing to God. And no man here limits the Spirit of God, nor bringeth forth his own conned and gathered ſtuff; but every one puts that forth which the Lord puts into their hearts: and it is uttered forth not in man's will and wiſdom, but in the evidence and demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power. Yea, though there be not a word ſpoken, yet is the true ſpiritual worſhip performed, and the body of Chriſt edified; yea, it may, and hath often fallen out among us, that divers meetings
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019924_0078_0FE1A7052A2BC6C0"/>have paſt without one word; and yet our ſouls have been greatly edified and refreſhed, and our hearts wonderfully overcome with the ſecret ſenſe of God's power and ſpirit, which, without words, hath been miniſtered from one veſſel to another. This is indeed ſtrange and incredible to the mere natural and carnally-minded man, who will be apt to judge all time loſt where there is not ſomething ſpoken that is obvious to the outward ſenſes; and therefore I ſhall inſiſt a little upon this ſubject, as one that can ſpeak from a certain experience, and not by mere hearſay, of this wonderful and glorious diſpenſation; which hath ſo much the more of the wiſdom and glory of God in it, as it is contrary to the nature of man's ſpirit, will, and wiſdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He alſo in ſect. 7. on ſilent waiting on God, expreſſes himſelf thus: <q>For many thus principled, meeting together in the pure fear of the Lord, did not apply themſelves preſently to ſpeak, pray, or ſing, &amp;c. being afraid to be found acting forwardly in their own wills, but each made it their work to retire inwardly to the meaſure of grace in themſelves, not being only ſilent as to words, but even abſtaining from all their own thoughts, imaginations, and deſires; ſo watching in a holy dependence upon the Lord, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together not only outwardly in one place, but thus inwardly in one Spirit, and in one name of Jeſus, which is his power and virtue, they come thereby to enjoy and feel the ariſings of this life, which, as it prevails in each particular, becomes as a flood of refreſhment, and overſpreads the whole meeting: for man, and man's part and wiſdom, being denied and chained down in every individual, and God exalted, and his grace in dominion in the heart; thus his name comes to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019924_0079_0FE1A706ADE5EC78"/>be one in all, and his glory breaks forth, and covers all; and there is ſuch a holy awe and reverence upon every ſoul, that if the natural part ſhould ariſe in any, or the wiſe part, or what is not one with the life, it would preſently be chained down and judged out. And when any are, through the breaking forth of this power, conſtrained to utter a ſentence of exhortation or praiſe, or to breathe to the Lord in prayer, then all are ſenſible of it;<note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. xxvii. 19.</note> for the life in them anſwers to it, as in water face anſwereth to face. This is that divine and ſpiritual worſhip, which the world neither knoweth nor underſtandeth, which the vulture's eye ſeeth not into. Yet many and great are the advantages which my ſoul, with many others, hath taſted of hereby, and which would be found of all ſuch as would ſeriouſly apply themſelves hereunto: for, when people are gathered thus together, not merely to hear men, nor depend upon them, but all are inwardly taught<note n="b" place="bottom">Iſai. x. 20, and xxvi. 3.</note> to ſtay their minds upon the Lord, and wait for his appearance in their hearts; thereby the forward working of the ſpirit of man is ſtayed and hindered from mixing itſelf with the worſhip of God.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſection 15. after having deſcribed the true worſhip in ſpirit eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, and clearly proved the neceſſity and advantage of it, he proceeds thus: <q>He hath alſo inſtituted an inward and ſpiritual worſhip: ſo that God now tieth not his people to the temple of Jeruſalem, nor yet unto outward ceremonies and obſervation; but taketh the heart of every Chriſtian for a temple to dwell in; and there immediately appeareth, and giveth him directions how to ſerve him in any outward
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019924_0080_0FE1A70830A50C78"/>acts. Since, as Chriſt argueth, God is a Spirit, he will now be worſhipped in the Spirit, where he reveals himſelf, and dwelleth with the contrite in heart. Now, ſince it is the heart of man that now is become the temple of God, in which he will be worſhipped, and no more in particular outward temples, ſince, as bleſſed Stephen ſaid, out of the prophet, to the profeſſing Jews of old, The Moſt High dwelleth not in temples made with hands. As before the glory of the Lord deſcended to fill the outward temple, it behoved to be purified and cleanſed, and all polluted ſtuff removed out of it; yea, and the place for the tabernacle was overlaid with gold, the moſt precious and cleaneſt of metals; ſo alſo before God be worſhipped in the inward temple of the heart, it muſt alſo be purged of its own filth, and all its own thoughts and imaginations, that ſo it may be fit to receive the Spirit of God, and to be actuated by it. And doth not this directly lead us to that inward ſilence, of which we have ſpoken, and exactly pointed out? And further, this worſhip muſt be in truth; intimating, that this ſpiritual worſhip, thus actuated, is only and properly a true worſhip,</q>—</p>
                  <p>"Franciſcus Lambertus," as quoted by Robert Barclay, in ſect. 18. ſpeaketh well, tract. 5. of "prophecy, chap. 3. ſaying, <q>Where are they now that glory in their inventions, who ſay, A fine invention! A fine invention! This they call invention, which themſelves have made up; but what have the faithful to do with ſuch kind of invention?

But, above all things, be careful thou follow not the manner of hypocrites, who have written almoſt word for word what they are to ſay, as if they were to repeat ſome verſes upon a theatre, having learned all their preaching as they do that act tragedies. And afterwards, when they are in the place of propheſying, pray the Lord to direct their tongue; but in the mean time, ſhutting up the way of the Holy Spirit, they determine to ſay nothing but what they have written.

Mark xiii. 33. and xiv. 38. Luke xxi. 36. from which it is evident, that this watching was to go before prayer. Now to what end is this watching, or what is it, but a waiting to feel God's Spirit to draw unto prayer, that ſo it may be done acceptably? For ſince we are to "<note n="c" place="bottom">Eph. vi. 18.</note> pray always in the ſpirit, and cannot pray of ourſelves without it, acceptably, this watching muſt be for this end recommended to us, as preceding prayer, that we may watch and wait for the ſeaſonable time to pray, which is when the Spirit moves thereunto.</q>
