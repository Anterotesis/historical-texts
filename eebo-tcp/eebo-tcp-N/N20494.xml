         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was in the borders of that nation they were travelling with a perſon who they had choſen for a guide to a certain town they propoſed to reach that night; which being a very long ſtage, and it raining very heavy, Jane Fearon growing very fatigued wiſhed to put up before they reached the town if a ſuitable place could be obtained, which their guide aſſured them could not, but being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wet and weary, and coming up to a good looking houſe enquired of them whether they could obtain a lodging and entertainment till the abatement of the ſtorm, and being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the affirmative, they determined to tarry there, notwithſtanding the perſuaſions of their director to purſue their journey (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the deſigns of the people of the houſe) he finding it was their determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to ſtop, bid them farewel, telling them they would have no further need of him, but did not like to explain himſelf in hearing of the people of the houſe, and left them with regret, <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026886_0003_0FD245D594FFA7F8"/>—On their alighting they were conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large room with a fire in it, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into the kitchen or common room, where the family kept; their horſes were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of and their wet things put to dry, &amp; apparently they were likely to be very well accommodated; a poſſet was made for them, and a cold meat pye brought for their ſupper; but at their ſetting down at the table they grear very uneaſy, however one not knowing how the other felt (each determined to keep to themſelves their feelings) till at length Jane ſaid, that her apprehenſions were ſo great, and her opinion of the family ſo bad, that ſhe fully believed that the pye which was on the table was made of human fleſh, which, however, Dickenſon ſcarcely believed was the caſe, ſaying he thought it nouriſhing at that time.</p>
            <p>As they were talking Jane obſerved three ill-looking men come in, and with a low voice told the landlady that they had good horſes; aye, anſwered ſhe, and good ſaddle bags too. Jane's uneaſineſs encreaſing, Dickenſon's mind became cloſely engaged to ſeek for the cauſe, and for divine counſel how to proceed, and under this exerciſe was favored to believe that if they kept cloſe to that, and ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026886_0004_0FD245D85DBDB560"/>to its pointings they ſhould be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and, way made for their eſcape, on which he enquired about their lodgings, telling them they had ſome writing to do and wanted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles for that purpoſe and propoſed to retire to their appartment, when they were ſhewn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chamber on the ſide of a yard with two beds in it, but without any bolts to the doors, and obſerving a form or bench in the room, tried therewith to faſten one of the doors and found it would anſwer the purpoſe by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of it againſt one of the beds; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Jane ſat down and manifeſted their diſtreſs by wringing her hands and ſaying ſhe believed they ſhould never get out of that houſe alive, on which Dickenſon ſat down by her, and adviſed her to be ſtill, telling her that he had been under equal diſtreſs of mind from their firſt ſetting down in the houſe, and that under that exerciſe, ſeeking for the beſt help, his mind had been favored by that which never deceived him, to believe that if they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully minded its pointings, they ſhould be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to eſcape, on which they ſat down in perfect ſilence for ſome conſiderable time, attentively waiting for beſt direction, when at length Dickenſon ſaid the time for them to flee was then, and having obſerved the door
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026886_0005_0FD245DBA644D830"/>oppoſite to the one they had already ſecured let out of the houſe by a pair of ſtone ſtairs into the road, believing that was the way for them to get off, he bid Jane put off her ſhoes as he did alſo, and ſoftly opening the door perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a light through a chink in the ſtairs to their terror, a woman ſharpening a large knife and making other preparations for their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as they ſuppoſed, and going ſoftly down the ſteps, kept on the road till out of hearing of the houſe, they then quickened their pace, and he taking Jane by the arm, they ran about half a mile, when they diſcovered a ſort of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or cott, and it ſtill raining exceſſive hard, they tried to take refuge there, whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves a little and ſhelter themſelves from the turbulence of the weather, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſtraw left there for the cattle, but found by the painful ſenſation renewed on their minds that they were not ſaſe there, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their exceſſive wearineſs, and Jane being ready to faint with diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) Dickenſon urged the neceſſity of their exerting themſelves, under the firm hope that they ſhould be preſerved, and they went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as faſt as they could till they came to the ſide of a water, the courſes of which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to a bridge, over which they attempted
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026886_0006_0FD22B0E577518B0"/>to paſs, but felt reſtrained when they got upon it, and James ſaid that was not their way, ſo turned about and followed the edge of the river about half a mile further, the water encreaſing in breadth; they there ſtopped, and Dickenſon ſaid they muſt croſs at that place, which exceedingly alarmed Jane, having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en way to ſo much diſcouragement that ſhe ſcarcely could hope that they ſhould not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſink under their preſent ſituation, and told Dickenſon that ſhe apprehended if they went into that water they ſhould be drowned, but he endeavored to cheer her, reminding her of the evidence he had of their preſervation if they kept a ſteady eye to beſt direction, which he believed had led them thus far, and that through the water was the only way for their retreat, and that he believed they ſhould get ſafe to the other ſide, whereupon with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his arm ſhe ventured and they got ſafe to the other ſide, and walking ſome diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they came to a ſand bank, here ſetting down they congratulated each other that they had ſo far eſcaped from theſe inhuman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but James was not yet eaſy in his mind, he ſaid they were not ſafe yet, and muſt go farther, to which Jane replied, "I muſt go by thy faith, for I know not what to do."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026886_0007_0FD245E84C1E8DE8"/>
They going a little farther, found another ſand bank wherein was a cavity where they ſet down. After they had been here a while, Dickenſon ſaid I am now quite eaſy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we are perfectly ſafe, and feel in my heart a ſong of Thankſgiving and Praiſe;— Jane replied I am ſo far from that, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as ſay <hi>Lord have mercy on us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had been here about half an hour they heard ſome people on the oppoſite ſide of the river, upon which James finding Jane was alarmed and fearing they ſhould be diſcovered, ſoftly told her their lives depended upon their ſilence. Then attentively harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what the people ſaid, heard them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly ſpeak to their dog, and ſay, <hi>Seek 'em Keeper!</hi> and ſuppoſed them to be the men they had ſeen at the houſe, accompanied with a dog, that the dog refuſing to go over the bridge, had followed the ſcent of their feet along the river ſide to the place where they croſſed, when ſtopping, the people again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>ſeek 'em Keeper!</hi> which they heard; and they ſaw the people with a lanthorn, they alſo heard them ſay they had there croſſed the river, to which the other replied <hi>that's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, unleſs the Devil took them over,</hi> for the river was brim full.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026886_0008_0FD245EC9CBC6A30"/>
After wearying themſelves a conſiderable time in their ſearch, they went away, and they ſaw them no more.</p>
            <p>When day light appeared, they ſaw a man on a high hill at a diſtance looking about him every way, they continued quiet in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat till ſome time after ſun riſe, when upon taking a view of their ſituation, they diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered that under the firſt ſand bank from whence they removed, they might have been ſeen from the oppoſite ſhore—which they had been inſenſible of, as they could not make the obſervation the night before, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what they ſhould do to recover their horſes, ſaddle bags, &amp;c. James ſaid, I incline to return to the houſe but Jane propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their going to a town in order to get aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to go with them, to which James obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the town was ten miles off, and that they were ſtrangers, and had nothing to do with—Jane ſtill heſitating, James ſaid, I ſtill incline to return to the houſe, fully believing our horſes, clothes &amp;c. will be ready for us, without aſking a queſtion; and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we ſaw laſt night, we ſhall ſee no more.— The other ſaid, friend I think I dare not go back again, James ſaid, thou mayeſt ſafely, for I have ſeen it in that, that never faileth me,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026886_0009_0FD245EE4B184560"/>upon which they returned to the houſe, and found their horſes ſtanding in the ſtable, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and their bags upon them, their clothes dryed and ready to put on, and ſaw no perſon but one old woman, in a corner on a rock by the fire-ſide, whom they did not remember of ſeeing the night before; they aſked her what they had to pay, diſcharging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on their journey. Sometime after, Dickenſon travelling the ſame way, in truths ſervice, paſſed the place where the above houſe ſtood, but found it was pulled down and totally deſtroyed; which coming to the inn at the town, they had thought to have gone too when they put up on account of the heavy rain, as before mentioned, he enquired what was become of the people, and the cauſe of the houſe being ſo in ruin. When he was told, that ſometime after he and Jane was there, ſome travellers who had been obſerved to go there were miſſing, and having been long under a very bad name, the people ſtrongly ſuſpecting they were murdered, roſe with one general conſent, and beſet the houſe, taking up the people, and on ſearching the houſe, and its environs, found the bodies of the above, and thoſe of many others, in different ſtates of decay, which had evidently been murdered;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026886_0010_0FD245F090638A98"/>and I think ſome part of the bodies wanting, with a great quantity of clothes ſuppoſed to have belonged to them, on which the people were tried, and I believe five of them were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and the houſe totally demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>Our friend <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi> brought the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove account in manuſcript with him on his return from his religious viſits, to the friends in Great Britain.</p>
            <p>James Dickenſon was one of the moſt emin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent miniſters in our religious ſociety, and viſited America three times. In the ſhort journal publiſhed of his life and travels, in the year 1694 he mentions his viſiting Scotland in company with another Friend, and notes their being delivered from the hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful men, but does not give further par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, for the omiſſion doubtleſs there was a cauſe.</p>
