            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is above Sixty years ſince Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature have been Erected in the Town of <hi>Ipſwich;</hi> yet was it never known in all that time any perſon Arraigned there for any Capital Offence. Which might juſtly be ſuppoſed to be the reaſon that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands were there gathered, as was ſcarcely ever heard of or ſeen upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in any part of <hi>New England.</hi> Which could not but put all ſerious and thoughtful Spirits in mind of the Great and General Aſſembly that will appear at the Great Day to receive their final Sentence: Which Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were gathered to behold the Tragical End of the perſon then Executed, which was attended with ſo many ſignals of Divine Grace and Favour, as the following pages will give a more perfect and diſtinct Account of, which not to have publiſhed, would have been a concealing of the Diſplays of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative Praiſe and Glory of God; and a damp to the Encouragement of Paenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to hope for Mercy at the laſt hour. Theſe following Subjects that were handled on thoſe
<pb facs="unknown:001020_0004_0FAEE8865AE7E0E0"/>
Lecture Weeks when the Criminal was Tryed, Condemned, and afterwards Executed, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be very ſuitable to the Occaſion. And the Diſcourſes which were raiſed from them being judged worthy of publication; not only to revive the memory of thoſe that were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in hearing of them; but that all others, who may providentially come to the view of them, may be ſtirred up to praiſe the Lord for his wonderful goodneſs, in making ſuch an heinous Sinner ſuch an Inſtance of Converting Grace and Mercy: Neither ſhall any need to queſtion the truth of the repentance of the perſon Condemned, &amp; after Executed, from the ſhortneſs of the time of her Experiences: The Thief that Commenced Converted on the Croſs (as was expreſſed by him that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that occaſion) is a proof of the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hereof; <hi>for with God all things are poſſible:</hi> Seeing we read not any thing of his Converſion before he was Nailed thereon, but God (whoſe gifts of Grace &amp; Mercy are free, and diſpoſes of them, to whom, and at what time he pleaſes, did bleſs the publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate means that were uſed, ſo as to bring about this marvellous Change in this poor Creature, for the Exalting of the Riches of his Grace to miſerable Sinners. So as that
<pb facs="unknown:001020_0005_0FAEE88783407D30"/>
ſhe may be counted worthy to be added to thoſe ſeveral memorable Instances of ſpecial Mercy recorded in Ancient Hiſtory, viz. that of Sir <hi>Jervace Ellowis, Jacobus Andreas,</hi> and others, which Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Hiſtory recites in the Life of the Reverend Mr. <hi>William Perkins.</hi> So as that upon conſideration of this late &amp; former Examples of like nature all that hear thereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Further alſo, It is not unworthy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, That this poor Creature lately Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when ſhe took her laſt leave of her Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Friend, (the night before her Execution) as ſhe ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Word of the Lord is in it ſelf always precious, yet beſt eſteemed where and when there are few or no open Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; therefore it is ſaid when <hi>Samuel</hi> began to Propheſy, <hi>the word of the Lord was precious in thoſe days,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3 1. For when there is a Famine of hearing the Word, <hi>then will men wander from Sea to Sea, and run to and fro, to ſeek the word of the Lord: and the fair Virgins and Young men will faint for thirſt, Amos</hi> 8.12, 13.

<pb facs="unknown:001020_0007_0FAEE888B43EC568"/>
woful paſs in <hi>New England,</hi> but that good Sermons and good Books find many good Friends. And we have the leſs reaſon to fear, the following Diſcourſes will want <hi>Readers,</hi> nay we cannot but hope for a general acceptance, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the weightineſs of the Subject, the worthineſs of the Author, and the awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Occaſion of their Preaching and Printing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The weightineſs of the Subject on which the Sermons treats.</hi> It is no leſs then <hi>LIFE</hi> and <hi>DEATH</hi> is to be ſet before you: which when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet before <hi>Iſrael, he call'd Heaven and Earth to Record, Deut.</hi> 30.19. Sirs, What is more bitter then the <hi>Death</hi> that Sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves? except the Sin that deſerves it: and what is more ſweet then the <hi>Life</hi> that God gives through Jeſus Chriſt? except God in Chriſt who gives it. Beſides, both the <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> treated on are ETERNAL, and they whoſe minds run on <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the things that are <hi>Eternal,</hi> will not account the time long or loſt, that is requiſite for the Reading a little <hi>Book</hi> Surely they that chooſe <hi>Life,</hi> will do more then this

to eſcape the Wages of Sin, and to attain the Gift of God: and what more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and proper, than to ſtir up Youth to cleanſe their ways, that ſo they may eſcape the threatned <hi>Death,</hi> and obtain the promiſed <hi>Life</hi>? and this the Reader will find effectually done in the Third Sermon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Worthineſs of the Author, will be no little motive to them that beſt know him: viz.</hi> The Church and Town of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> where he Exerciſes his Paſtoral Charge and Care, and the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood round about; and were he as well known in other parts, where this Book may come, we ſhould not have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned this argument; &amp; his known mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty forbids us however, to ſay much of it; yet we may not omit ſaying, that we eſteem him to be a pious, painful, Miniſter of the Goſpel; and that God hath Crowned his Miniſterial Labours with good ſucceſs, and hath owned and honoured his Miniſtry, (as well as that of his Aged, Reverend, and Worthy Colleague, Mr. <hi>William Hubbard</hi>) with the convincing, humbling, comforting, and (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We have nothing further to add, but to deſire of the Reader, a juſt candour toward the Reverend Author, and his holy endeavours; ſo as not to wring or wreſt any particular expreſſion beyond his intention, who had no inclination, much leſs deſign to appear in Print, but was averſe even to a fault, and very hardly perſwaded to ſuffer it to be done,

perhaps fearing, what was proper enough to profit a well-minded popular Auditory, might not be fully guarded againſt a cavelling adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for his province at that time was that of predicant, and not of a diſputant; &amp; his deſign was, to convince men, that ſin was odious, and that God was gracious, and to urge both to the uttermoſt He dealt with the Conſciences and affections of Sinners, to move them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that God might be Glorified, &amp; Sinners might be Saved. As it had a good effect in Preaching, ſo we hope and pray that it may in Printing. And if any ſhould think the worthy Author might have been more particular on this occaſion, in ſetting forth the danger and miſchief of the Sin of Fornication, for the warning of the Riſing Generation. Let the Reader know, that the Reverend Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi> did purpoſely and effectually do it in the ſame Pulpit, from thoſe words, in 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, &amp;c.</hi> Which made him more general, which his Text alſo led him to, for the wages of all and every Sin is death. Now that God may be Glorified, the Reader benefited, and the pious Author further encouraged and ſucceeded in his Miniſterial Labours; is the hearty deſire of your Friends and Servants for Chriſt's Sake.</p>

               <p>The ſence of evil in the Soul is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bondage, a ſubjection to the Powers of darkneſs, and all deadly enemies of the Soul. Man by Apoſtaſy brought himſelf into bonds; whence his Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is exemplified by a Redemption from bondage, <hi>Col</hi> 1.13. This is the bondage of the Devil and his inſtruments: ſo that man by ſin is a Servant of Servants, and a ſlave to the Devils Servants, the World and Sin.

               <p>This may ſuffice for Explanation of the Doctrine: <hi>How Death is ſaid to be the Wages of Sin</hi>; even all kinds and degrees of Death, Corporal and Spiritual, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal.

               <p>Firſt, for Scripture proof.</p>

though they know it not, yet it is for their life. This alſo is given as a reaſon of that Expoſtulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed, for the end of thoſe things is Death.</hi> Hence, <hi>He that Converteth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſaveth a Soul from Death.</hi> Then the Scripture is full of inſtances as well as Aſſertions to prove the deadly effects of Sin. Sin once brought a deſtructive deluge on the whole World: drew down Fire and Brimſtone on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> which conſumed them; and many other Examples of immediate Death inflicted on particular Perſons, for the puniſhment of their ſins.</p>

Sin with Death. Its Gods pleaſure that man ſhould thus ſuffer for his Sin; and this is a reaſon above all other reaſons: this were ſufficient if there were no other. The Supreme and higheſt Will, the Will of God it is the Creatures Law, and that is the Rule of Righteouſneſs. God is perfectly independent, has none above him, to limit or give him Rule; but his own Will is the Rule, therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err, if he does but pleaſe himſelf: he break<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have never a line to meaſure <hi>Eternity</hi> by. Our Thoughts that are moſt ſwift, and extenſive, they are not able to reach to the End of <hi>Eternity</hi>: It has no end. Our Souls cannot graſp it. <hi>EVER</hi> and for <hi>EVER,</hi> it is a word will poſe the ſtrongeſt Head. How can we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that which has no limits, ſee to the End of that which has no End?</p>
               <p>The leaſt particle of <hi>Time</hi> detracts from the greateſt Summ of Finite Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, let them be multiplied never ſo far, by parts, it will be worn out: But the further ye go in theſe Eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we are never the nearer to an End: Hell is as laſting as Heaven, and never

is waſted. Its the Hell of Hell that it is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> The never dying Worm is the Worm of Hell. This frets out all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all eaſe, all hope, that thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are perpetual.</p>
               <p>This is the happineſs of the Saints, the Heaven of Heaven, that thoſe joys are Eternal: and this is the greateſt miſery of Hell, that there is no End of miſery. This one circumſtance has more weight in it, than all Hell beſides. To paſs through the Fire is dreadful; what is it then to dwell with <hi>Everlaſting Burnings?</hi> Yet this muſt be the portion of all that live impenitently in their ſins.</p>
               <p>Who then can, (after this has been told them as moſt certain,) take any pleaſure in ſin? If there be any pleaſure in it, it is but for a moment, than vaniſhes away; but the pain that abides for ever.</p>
               <p>One ſerious Reflection on each of theſe, would bring men to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth of that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14 9. <hi>That they are fools who make a mock of ſin.</hi> None ſuch, fools as thoſe that laugh themſelves into miſery; and yet none more certainly do ſo, than they who make a mock of Sin.

into their own Deſtruction, and pleaſantly they goe down to Hell, where thoſe <hi>Eternal Flames</hi> become their firſt Awakeners: and then men begin to be wiſe, when it is too late. They that ſatisfy themſelves with the momentany pleaſures of this World, and deride thoſe Everlaſting Miſeries of the other, ſhall have leiſure enough to Repent their Folly, when their Repentance ſhall only increaſe their Sorrow, without hopes of any Eaſe or End.</p>

Friend than God. There is none that man has more reaſon to flee from, nor any that he has more reaſon to fly unto: <hi>Adam</hi> (and we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) having diſobeyed the Command of God, he is afraid of his Preſence; <hi>be hears the voice of the Lord walking in the midſt of the Garden,</hi> he betakes himſelf to a Thicket for Defence, to ſhrow'd himſelf from the ſight of God, whoſe voice he heard: Well might he dread to ſee the Face of ſuch a Terrible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty incenſed againſt him by his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: He could not but tremble to think of beholding a Conſuming Fire, as he could not think to ſee any thing in God but Fiery Indignation. The Voice of God to <hi>Adam,</hi> it was worſe than the roaring of a Lion; yea the dreadful Thunder of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> it was not half ſo dreadful as this voice of God in <hi>Eden. Adam</hi> could not bear to ſee the Lightning after it: therefore he ſeeks a skreen to hide himſelf, as not being able to behold the Face of God and live: <hi>Adam</hi> could expect no leſs than the full Execution of the Sentence of Death which he had ſubjected himſelf unto by
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001020_0053_0FAEEC429FE1D1C8"/>
his Diſobedience. He could expect no other ſight of his Maker, than of one armed with Fury and Vengeance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him. God had ſaid, <hi>In the day thou eatest, thou ſhalt ſurely d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>; Man has Eaten If then God be a God of Truth, what muſt his next word be, but a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Sentence of Death againſt the Offender; or rather the next word might be a blow, the inflicting of that Sentence of Death which was before threatned. How could <hi>Adam</hi> think, but that God who was his Law-giver, and had given him Law, would alſo be his Judge in inflicting the penalty due for the breach thereof, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy. No wonder then that <hi>Adam</hi> flees from the preſence of God. Yet conſider alſo, whom might he better go unto than that God, whom he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? whom might he more ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto than his Judge? who as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in his Juſtice, ſo he is no leſs infinite in his Mercy: and thus indeed <hi>Adam</hi> found it after his Examination and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: Notwithſtanding he is found guilty, and could dream of no better ſentence than to be immediately ſeized upon of

Death and Hell, and to be ſwallowed up by them; Then God opens the rich Treaſury of his Grace, he opens the Door, the Gate of Life to him, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals a Saviour; even he that gave the threatning, gives the Promiſe alſo. <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we read the former part of the Text, with <hi>Adam</hi> we may be ready to flee away from God, from his Preſence; we juſtly dread this voice of God, this word, <hi>THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH.</hi> But if we ſtay a little, and hear further what God the Lord will ſpeak, he ſpeaks <hi>Peace unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, be turns that Death into Life. THE GIFT OF GOD IS E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNAL LIFE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Verſe the Apoſtle gives as the ſumme both of the Law and the Goſpel. He is a Son of Thunder, and begins with Terror; it is a dreadful Sentence he praemiſes; <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> He is alſo a Son of Conſolation, and follows with another word as Gracious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That there is Life for Sinners: viz. Life Eternal.</hi> Under which general term is comprehended every good thing: All that is needful or deſirable, whatſoever makes to the well being or perfection of a man. Death is the ſumm and comprehenſe of all Evil, Life is alſo the comprehenſe of all Good. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the Life here ſpoken of is Eternal Life, and by it we may underſtand the Life of Grace and of Glory. Theſe are not diſtinct in kind, there is only a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and circumſtantial difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The truth of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may be ſeen both in general and particular. There is Life for Sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the voice of the Goſpel. The Law brings news of Death, the Goſpel

brings the glad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idings of life. The Law concludes all under Death, the Goſpel excludes none from Life; ſtretching forth its Arms to all that will receive it. The Law brings Condemnation, the Goſpel Salvation. The Law caſts all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, and as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dives, between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed, ſo that there is no paſſing from one to the other.</hi> Yet now we may truly ſay, that this Gulph is paſſible, or here is a paſſage from Hell to Heaven. The Gulph is exceeding great, Heaven and Hell are far aſunder, Death and Life, there is a vaſt diſtance between them; but yet there is a paſſage <hi>from Death to Life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. A Sinner may be brought out of the belly of Hell, as ſometimes <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the Whales Belly. Indeed the Law leaves us without hope or help, like <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, it caſts into the Pit, &amp; does not regard our crying: But the Goſpel lets down thoſe Cords by which we may be drawn out thence. The Pit indeed is deep, but there is an Infinite Arm of Grace that can fathom &amp; reach to the bottom of it, and bring us out of it. A Sinners Chains and Fetters may

be broken, and made to fall from him; The Priſon doors are ſet open for man to come out; yea, the door of Heaven is now open, the Gate of Life, wherein whoſoever will, may enter, and Live for ever.</p>
                  <p>Further to illuſtrate this, Conſider two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Life is tendered unto all.</hi> The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is univerſal in its offers: <hi>Whoſoever believeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is baptized ſhall be ſaved</hi>; according to our Saviours Commiſſion to the Preachers of it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Life is actually beſtowed and conferred upon many, even on all that embrace the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> There is Grace enough for all in the Goſpel, but all will not accept of it. There are thoſe that will not come unto Chriſt that they might have li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e; <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God</hi>; and Heirs of his Kingdom; Hei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of Life and Glory. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians, You hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Though Death has paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001020_0059_0FAEEC47140CFAF8"/>
all becauſe all have ſinned; yet many are already paſſed from Death to Life.</p>
                  <p>If any ask, <hi>What Life is</hi>?</p>
                  <p>They muſt tarry till they come to Heaven for a full Anſwer of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No man living can here tell what Life is. Angels know it, but can't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the knowledge of it to us.</p>
                  <p>It is all that Glory, begun in this World and perfected in Heaven, which the Saints ſhall enjoy to all Eternity. 'Tis the happineſs and perfection of the Reaſonable Creature in the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for ever. <hi>There is This Life for Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man though a Sinner may yet be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God. Tis moſt true, that God is a holy God, <hi>and of purer Eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity.</hi> He cannot approve Sin, yet he can love the Sinner: He hates Sin with a perfect hatred, infinitely; and yet he loves the Sinner with an infinite love. His heart loaths Sin; he is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to all Sin, and that irreconcileably; yet he can be reconciled to the Sinner, and become his Friend. They call'd our Saviour Chriſt a friend to <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi> God is a friend of Publicans
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001020_0060_0FAEEC4821645ED0"/>
and Sinners, and as it were Courts their Friendſhip. He is ſo far from being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable to his greateſt Enemies, that he is firſt in moving for Peace, and by his Ambaſſadors beſeeches them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
                  <p>Thus in general, There is Life for the Children of Death. More particularly, There is a removal of Death, and Life that is recovered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a removal of Death here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi>; or Death is taken away. That is, All evil of Sin, and Suffering. As to the evil of Sin.</p>

way, but one of theſe two; either Life or Death; if we Live not, we muſt dye: There is no middle between Life and Death; nothing between Heaven and Hell. It's true, now there is a kind of medium between theſe: But the time is coming when there will be no other places but theſe two; the only Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of all mankind.

Now God ſets Life and Death before us, and we have our choice: If we do not chooſe the one, we ſhall never be able to refuſe the other. We muſt needs get life then, becauſe the miſchiefs of the want of it are inſufferable. If there could be an Annihilation, if we might be reduced to our firſt principle of nothing again, if we might again not be, and ſo not be miſerable, the matter were leſs, tho' we were not the Subjects of this Life and Bleſſedneſs: Better never to have been born, than being ſo, to fall ſhort of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory: for then endleſs miſery will be our portion.</p>

            <p>The Pſalmiſt here applyes the power of Gods word to this ſpecial Age of man, Happily, Becauſe himſelf was now young, and becauſe young Perſons ought eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to look to their way and practice; and to intimate that the word is able to cleanſe their Way, which is moſt ſubject to Error, Obliquity, and Impurity. Yet, not excluding all other Ages and Sexes, for it behoves every Man, Woman and Child, particularly in their Youth to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001020_0097_0FAEEC6C106A06C0"/>
mind this. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, It denyes not, that any of riper years, or decrepid Age (if they have neglected ſo long) ſhould make haſt and cleanſe their ways: But, it requires and ſhews, that it is to be begun in Youth and continued even to old Age. That none are ever exempted from this Care; but muſt even from their Childhood or younger years look to this point, To cleanſe their ways from Sin, and have reſpect to the Word of God for this end, to Direct and Aſſiſt in a pure Way.</p>
            <p>In the Anſwer is ſet forth the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Gods Word, in the uſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular effect thereof; as it is both a Rule and Inſtrument of our cleanſing, together with the manner how it is to be applyed and made uſe of.</p>

            <head>THE Declaration &amp; Confeſſion OF Eſther Rodgers, Of <hi>Kittery</hi> in the Province of <hi>Main,</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> Single woman.</head>
            <p>I was born at <hi>Kittery</hi> ſometime in <hi>May,</hi> 1680. At the Age of Thirteen came to live as an Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Woodbridge</hi> of <hi>Newbury.</hi> Had little or no thoughts of God or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though Living in a Religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; was taught to Read, Learned Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Catechiſm, and had frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of going to Publick Meetings; but was a careleſs Obſerver of Sabbaths, and Hearer of Sermons; no Word that
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001020_0134_0FAEE99F94B8B3E8"/>
ever I heard or read making any Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon my Heart, (as I Remember) Neither did I at all give my ſelf to Secret Prayer, or any other Duty that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Salvation of my Soul. And becauſe I thus neglected God, refuſed his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, and would not walk in his Ways, therefore he juſtly gave me up to my own hearts Luſts, and ways of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>About the Age of Seventeen, I was left to fall into that foul Sin of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuffering my ſelf to be defiled by a <hi>Negro</hi> Lad living in the ſame Houſe. After I perceived that I was wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h Child, I meditated how to prevent coming to Publick Shame; Satan preſently ſetting in with his Temptation, I ſoon comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſolved to Murder the Child, if ever I ſhould have one born alive: and continued in my wicked purpoſe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, till I had the fatal Opportunity of putting it into Execution. Being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Living Child, I uſed means preſently to ſtop the breath of it, and kept it hid in an upper Room, till the Darkneſs of the Night following, gave advantage for a Private Burial in the Garden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:001020_0135_0FAEE9A0B4577D88"/>All this was done in Secret, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Afterwards reflecting on what I had done, was followed with ſome Awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, Frights and Convictions during my abode at Mr. <hi>Woodbridges,</hi> which was about half a year. Yet, never mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſerious Addreſs to God for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of theſe my great and hainous Sins. But thence I went to <hi>Piſcatequa,</hi> where I lived in a publick Houſe, and ſoon got over and rid of all my Fears, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all thoughts thereof, giving my ſelf up to other wicked Company and ways of Evil.</p>
            <p>About a year after, I returned to <hi>Newbury</hi> to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Woodbridges</hi> again, where my former Sins came freſh to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and troubled me a while; which together with other reaſons, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned my Removal to another place in the Town. But there alſo I took all Opportunities to follow my old Trade of running out a Nights, or entertaining my Sinful Companions in a back part
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001020_0136_0FAEE9A10FED4928"/>
of the Houſe. And there I fell into the like horrible Pit (as before) <hi>viz.</hi> of Carnal Pollution with the <hi>Negro</hi> man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Houſe. And being with Child again, I was in as great concern to know how to hide this as the former. Yet did not ſo ſoon reſolve the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, but was continually hurried in my thoughts, and undetermined till the laſt hour. I went forth to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Field, and dropping my Child by the ſide of a little Pond, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alive, or ſtill Born I cannot tell) I covered it over with Dirt and Snow, and ſpeedily returned home again.

till ſome time after I came into <hi>Ipſwich</hi> Priſon; when and where it pleaſed the Great and Gracious God to work upon my heart, as in the following Relation I have given account of.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="transcript">
            <head>A Relation of her Experience, both of ſome Conviction and Comfort received in the Priſon: Communicated to a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of the Town, with whom ſhe was very free, before and afterwards.</head>
            <head type="sub">Taken word for word from her own Mouth.</head>
            <p>THE firſt time Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> came to ſee me; after much other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he told me of the odiouſneſs of Sin; and that if ever I came to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, I ſhould loath it, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my own puniſhment procured thereby, but becauſe of the Diſhonour done to God. Then after he was gone, I began to think that I never loathed Sin ſo as yet, and was in a dreadful Caſe indeed; to think what a wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I had brought my ſelf into, and had diſhonoured God: inſomuch that I
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:001020_0138_0FAEE9A2C4967810"/>
could not Reſt, I was ſo dreadfully hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and Satan made me believe that it was impoſſible ſuch a Sinner, ſhould be Saved. And I could not Read, nor Sleep, nor have any Reſt night nor day. After a while God made me to think that it was Satans Temptation to keep me from Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But if I could Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I might find mercy, although I was ſuch a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And although I am ſuch a vile Sinner, I hope God has made me ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of my ſins, he has made me to loath my ſelf, and truly to Repent for Sin. God has made me to ſee that there is nothing that I can do can ſave me, but that there is a ſufficiency in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And I do throw my ſelf at his Feet for mercy, and have hope from his promiſes. <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him Return to the Lord, for he will have mercy on him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> And I do ſo far as I know my ſelf, Repent of my ſo great ſins againſt ſo good a God; for that which has been the delight of

            <p>During her Impriſonment (which was more than eight months) ſhe was frequently viſited by Miniſters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians of the Town and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, to whom ſhe gave little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for a conſiderable time, being very much reſerved, partly thro' natural temper, partly by power of Temptation as was judged; that ſhe could not open her mind or condition at all; nor make any other anſwer to Queſtions propounded, than yea or no: till after a while ſhe obtained more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpirit, and liberty of ſpeech.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:001020_0140_0FAEE9A42E0641D0"/>
Then would ſhe ſpeak of her ſins with aggravation, and expreſs ſorrow for them with great affection: related the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and almoſt deſpairing thoughts of her mind in the time that ſhe kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; as that God who had left her to fall ſo dreadfully into ſin, would now leave her to an hard and impenitent heart, that ſhe ſhould be damned; found a great averſeneſs at firſt, againſt going to the Publick Aſſembly on Sabbath and Lecture-Dayes, (for which ſhe had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty twice every week) leſt her hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t ſhould be more hardned, and her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation more heightned thereby. But it was not long before ſhe found a better fruit and effect of her attendance thereupon: She felt the power of the Word preached, inlightning, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, humbling and ſoftning of her heart. Alſo that the words ſpoken to her in private made deep and laſting impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on her Soul: that ſhe began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in hearing the Word publick or private; and ſet her ſelf to ſearch the Scriptures diligently, out of which ſhe collected many Texts, that encouraged her to hope for mercy and pardon, as
