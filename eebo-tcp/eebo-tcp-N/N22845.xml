            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>A DETAIL of the miſeries of a "frontier man," muſt excite the pity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who claims humanity. The gloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs of the rude foreſt, the diſtance from friends and competent defence, and the daily inroads and nocturnal yells of hoſtile

Indians, awaken thoſe keen apprehenſions and anxieties which conception only can picture. If the peaceful employment of huſbandry is purſued, the loaded muſket muſt ſtand by his ſide; if he viſits a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, or reſorts on ſundays to the ſacred houſe of prayer, the weapons of war muſt bear him company; at home, the diſtreſſes of a wife, and the fears of liſping children often unman the ſoul that real danger aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed in vain. Thoſe, who can recollect the war that exiſted between France and England fifty years ago, may figure to themſelves the unhappy ſituation of the inhabitants on the frontiers of Newhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; the malice of the French in Canada, and the exaſperated ſavages that dwelt in their vicinity, rendered the tedious days and frightful nights a ſeaſon of unequalled calamities. The daily reports of captured families and ſlaughtered friends, mingled grief with fear. Had there been an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030180_0005_0FE4C19A52EB71E0"/>
government, to ſtretch forth its protecting arm, in any caſe of danger, the miſery might have been in a degree allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. But the infancy of our country did not admit of this bleſſing. While Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Shirley of Maſſachuſetts, was peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning to England for a fleet and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Benning Wentworth the ſupine Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of Newhampſhire, obeyed implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the advice of his friend Shirley, and remained inactively ſecure at his ſeat at Portſmouth. At the commencement of the year ſeventeen hundred and forty five, the Quixotick expedition to Louiſburg was projected, the ſucceſs of which origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the mereſt accident, rather than from military valor or generalſhip; this drained the thinly inhabited ſtate of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampſhire of moſt of its effective men. From that period till the peace, which took place in the year ſeventeen hundred and forty nine, the viſionary ſchemes of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030180_0006_0FE4C19BE63B9130"/>
Shirley kept the beſt ſoldiers embodied in ſome remote place, as a force to execute ſome impolitick project. The conqueſt of Canada, and the attack upon Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, are recorded as ſpecimens of the wild projects which were to employ the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant forces of Newengland. During this time, the frontiers ſuſtained additional miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, by having the ſmall forces of the ſtate deducted for purpoſes which could be of no immediate ſervice to them. The ſavages committed frequent depredations on the defenceleſs inhabitants, and the eaſe with which they gained their prey, encouraged their boldneſs, and by ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſmall parties, they were able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the whole frontier of Newhampſhire, from fort Dummer on Connecticut River, to the loweſt ſettlement on Merrimack. During this war, which is known by the name of the Cape Breton war, the town of No. 4 could hardly be ſaid to be inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030180_0007_0FE4C19D6B2D6FB0"/>
ſome adventurers had made a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but few were conſidered as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the town. Capt. Stevens, whoſe valor is recorded as an inſtance of conſummate generalſhip, part of the time kept the fort, which afforded a ſhelter to the enterprizing ſettlers, in times of imminent danger. But even his vigilance did not ſave the town from numerous ſcenes of carnage. At the commencement of the peace, in ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and forty nine, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing ſpirit of Newengland roſe ſuperior to the dangers of the foreſt, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to venture innovation. The Indians, ſtill thirſty for plunder and rapine, and regardleſs of the peace which their maſters, the French, had concluded, kept up a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warfare, and committed ſeveral out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon lives and property; this kept the increaſing inhabitants in a ſtate of alarm, for three or four years; moſt of the time, they performed their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030180_0008_0FE4C1A001C24D58"/>
daily work without moleſtation, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to the fort at each returning night.</p>
               <p>OUR country has ſo long been expoſed to Indian wars, that recitals of exploits and ſufferings, of eſcapes and deliverances, have become both numerous and trite. The air of novelty will not be attempted in the following pages; ſimple facts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adorned, is what the reader muſt expect; pity for my ſufferings, and admiration at my ſafe return, is all that my hiſtory can excite. The aged man, while peruſing, will probably turn his attention to the period when the facts took place, his memory will be refreſhed with the ſad tidings of his country's ſufferings, which gave a daily wound to his feelings, between the years forty and ſixty; by contraſting thoſe days with the preſent, he may rejoice, that he witneſſes thoſe times, which many have "waited for, but died without a ſight." Thoſe "in early life," while they commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate

               <head>CHAP. I. Removal to <hi>No. 4,</hi> in the year ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and fifty, and ſituation till Auguſt the <hi>31</hi>ſt, the day after our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</head>
               <p>THE continuation of peace, began by degrees to appeaſe the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Indians, and they appeared to diſcover a wiſh for friendly intercourſe. The inhabitants in No. 4, and its vicinity, relaxed their watchfulneſs, and ventured more boldly into their fields. As proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects grew favorable, my huſband, Mr. James Johnſon, was induced, in the year 1750, to remove his family from Lunenburgh, in Maſſachuſetts, to his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in No. 4. Leſt ſavage caprice might offer ſome inſult, we reſided in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030180_0011_0FE4C1AB343CD168"/>
fort the two or three firſt years, but every appearance of hoſtility at length vaniſhed —the Indians expreſſed a wiſh to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, the inhabitants laid by their fears, and thought no more of tomahawks, nor ſcalpingknives. Mr. Johnſon now thought himſelf juſtified in removing to his farm, an hundred rods diſtant from the fort, which was then the uppermoſt ſettlement on Connecticut River, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his occupation of trade, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians made frequent viſits to traffick their furs for his merchandize. He frequently credited them for blankets and other nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſaries, and in moſt inſtances they were punctual in payment. During the year 1753, all was harmony and ſafety—ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements increaſed with tolerable rapidity, and the new country began to aſſume the appearance of cultivation.</p>
               <p>THE commencement of the year 1754 began to threaten another rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030180_0012_0FE4C1ACB7FED6C0"/>
the French and Engliſh, and as the dividing line between Canada and the Engliſh Colonies was the object of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was readily ſeen that the frontier towns would be in imminent danger. But as immediate war was not expected, Mr, Johnſon thought that he might riſk the ſafety of his family, while he made a tour to Connecticut, for trade. He ſat out the laſt of May, and his abſence of three months was a tedious and a bitter ſeaſon to me. Soon after his departure every body was "tremblingly alive" with fear. The Indians were reported to be on their march for our deſtruction, and our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from ſources of information gave full latitude for exaggeration of news, before it reached our ears. The fears of the night were horrible beyond deſcription, and even the light of day was far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling painful anxiety. While looking from the windows of my log houſe, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030180_0013_0FE4C1B2CA2AEBA8"/>
ſeeing my neighbors tread cautiouſly by each hedge and hillock, left ſome ſecreted ſavage might ſtart forth to take their ſcalp, my fears would baffle deſcription. Alarms grew louder and louder, till our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were too ſtrongly confirmed, by the news of the capture of Mr. Malony's fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, on Merrimack River; this reached us about the twentieth of Auguſt. Imagination now ſaw and heard a thouſand Indians; and I never went round my own houſe, without firſt looking with trembling cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by each corner, to ſee if a tomahawk was not raiſed for my deſtruction.</p>
               <p>ON the twenty fourth of Auguſt I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from all my fears by the arrival of my huſband. He brought intelligence from Connecticut that a war was expected the next ſpring, but that no immediate danger was contemplated. He had made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to remove to Northfield, as ſoon as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030180_0014_0FE4C1B48BE97428"/>
our ſtock of hay was conſumed, and our dozen of ſwine had demoliſhed our ample ſtores of grain, which would ſecure his family and property from the miſeries and ravages of war. Our eldeſt ſon, Sylvanus, who was ſix years old, was in the mean time to be put to ſchool at Springfield.— Mr. Johnſon brought home a large addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſtores, and the neighbors made frequent parties at our houſe, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their joy for his return, and time paſſed merrily off, by the aid of ſpirit and a ripe yard of melons. As I was in the laſt days of pregnancy, I could not join ſo heartily in their good cheer as I other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might. Yet in a new country, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure is often derived from ſources unknown to thoſe leſs accuſtomed to the woods. The return of my huſband, the relief from danger, and the crowds of happy friends, combined to render my ſituation peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable. I now boaſted with exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030180_0015_0FE4C1B613798CC8"/>
that I ſhould, with huſband, friends, and luxuries, live happy in ſpite of the fear of ſavages.</p>
               <p>ON the evening of the twenty ninth of Auguſt our houſe was viſited by a party of neighbors, who ſpent the time very cheerfully with watermelons and flip, till midnight; they all then retired in high ſpirits, except a ſpruce young ſpark, who tarried to keep company with my ſiſter. We then went to bed with feelings well tuned for ſleep, and reſted with fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, till midway between daybreak and ſunriſe, when we were rouſed by neighbor Labarree's knocking at the door, who had ſhouldered his ax to do a day's work for my huſband. Mr. Johnſon ſlipped on his jacket and trowſers, and ſtepped to the door to let him in. But by opening the door he opened a ſcene—terrible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe!! Indians! Indians were the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030180_0016_0FE4C1B8A1B41510"/>

But in an inſtant a crowd of ſavages, fixed horribly for war, ruſhed furiouſly in. I ſcreamed and begged my friends to aſk for quarter; by this time they were all over the houſe, ſome up ſtairs, ſome haling my ſiſter out of bed, another had hold of me, and one was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Mr. Johnſon, who ſtood in the middle of the floor to deliver himſelf up; but the Indian, ſuppoſing that he would make reſiſtance, and be more than his match, went to the door and brought three of his comrades, and the four bound him. I was led to the door, fainting and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; there ſtood my friend Labarree, bound; Ebenezer Farnſworth, whom they found up chamber, they were putting in the ſame ſituation, and to complete the ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſcene, my three little children were driven naked to the place where I ſtood. On viewing myſelf I found that I too was naked. An Indian had plundered three gowns, who, on ſeeing my ſituation, gave me the whole. I aſked another for a petticoat, but he refuſed it. After what little plunder their hurry would allow them to get, was confuſedly bundled up, we were ordered to march. After going about twenty rods we fell behind a riſing ground, where we halted to pack the things in a better manner; while there, a ſavage went back, as we ſuppoſed, to fire the buildings. Farnſworth propoſed to my huſband to go back with him, to get a quantity of pork from the cellar, to help us on our journey; but Mr. Johnſon prudently replied, that by that means, the Indians might find the rum, and in a fit of intoxication kill us all. The Indian preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently returned with marks of fear in his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030180_0018_0FE4C1C11B15E238"/>
countenance,<note n="*" place="bottom">This, as we afterwards found, was occaſioned by his meeting Mr. Oſmer at the door of the houſe, who lodged in the chamber, and had ſecreted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf behind a box, and was then making his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. He run directly to the fort, and the alarm guns were fired. My father, Mr. James Willard, was then ſecond in command. Captain Stevens was for ſallying out with a party for our relief; but my father begged him to deſiſt, as the Indians made it an invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practice to kill their priſoners when attacked.</note> and we were hurried on with all violence. Two ſavages laid hold of each of my arms, and hurried me through thorny thickets in a moſt unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful manner. I loſt a ſhoe and ſuffered exceedingly. We heard the alarm guns from the fort. This added new ſpeed to the flight of the ſavages.—They were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that ſoldiers might be ſent for our relief. When we had got a mile and a half, my faintneſs obliged me to ſit. This being obſerved by an Indian, he drew his knife, as I ſuppoſed, to put an end to my
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030180_0019_0FE4C1C29EC618F8"/>
exiſtence. But he only cut ſome bands, with which my gown was tied, and then puſhed me on. My little children were crying, my huſband and the other two men were bound, and my ſiſter and myſelf were obliged to make the beſt of our way, with all our might. The loſs of my ſhoe rendered travelling extremely painful. At the diſtance of three miles there was a general halt; the ſavages, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that we, as well as themſelves, might have an appetite for breakfaſt, gave us a loaf of bread, ſome raiſins and apples, which they had taken from the houſe. While we were forcing down our ſcanty breakfaſt, a horſe came in ſight, known to us all by the name of Scoggin, belonging to Phineas Stevens, Eſquire. One of the Indians attempted to ſhoot him, but was prevented by Mr. Johnſon. They then expreſſed a wiſh to catch him, ſaying, by pointing to me, for ſquaw to ride; my
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030180_0020_0FE3FA2C94A50CA8"/>
huſband had previouſly been unbound to aſſiſt the children, he, with two Indians, caught the horſe on the banks of the river. By this time my legs and feet were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood, which being noticed by Mr. Labarree, he, with that humanity which never forſook him, took his own ſtockings and preſented them to me, and the Indians gave me a pair of moggaſons. Bags and blankets were thrown over Scoggin, and I mounted on the top of them, and on we jogged about ſeven miles, to the upper end of Wilcott's Iſland. We there halted, and prepared to croſs the river; rafts were made of dry timber—two Indians and Farnſworth croſſed firſt, Labarree, by ſigns, got permiſſion to ſwim the horſe, and Mr. Johnſon was allowed to ſwim by the raft that I was on, to puſh it along. We all arrived ſafe on the other ſide of the river, about four o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; a fire was kindled and ſome of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030180_0021_0FE4C1C9E5E67038"/>
their ſtolen kettles were hung over it, and filled with porridge. The ſavages took delight in viewing their ſpoil, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to forty or fifty pounds in value. They then, with a true ſavage yell, gave the war whoop, and bid defiance to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. As our tarry in this place laſted an hour, I had time to reflect on our miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation.—Captives, in the power of unmerciful ſavages, without proviſion, and almoſt without clothes, in a wilderneſs where we muſt ſojourn as long as the children of Iſrael did, for ought we knew, and what added to our diſtreſs, not one of our ſavage maſters could underſtand a word of Engliſh. Here, after being hurried from home with ſuch rapidity, I have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to inform the reader, reſpecting our Indian maſters. They were eleven<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Labarree is very poſitive, and I think Mr. Johnſon was of the ſame opinion, that ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Indians attacked the houſe; the other ſix might have been a ſcouting party, that watched till we were out of danger, and then took another rout.</note> in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030180_0022_0FE4C1CB6B7DBE48"/>
number, men of middle age, except one, a youth of ſixteen, who in our journey, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a very miſchievous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſpoſition. According to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional practice, he who firſt laid hands on a priſoner conſidered him as his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. My maſter, who was the one that took my hand when I ſat on the bed, was as clever an Indian as ever I ſaw, he even evinced, at numerous times, a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that ſhewed he was by no means void of compaſſion. The four, who took my huſband, claimed him as their property, and my ſiſter, three children, Labarree and Farnſworth, had each a maſter. When the time came for us to prepare to march, I almoſt expired at the thought. To leave my aged parents, brothers, ſiſters
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030180_0023_0FE4C1CCF04EA360"/>
and friends, and travel with ſavages, through a diſmal foreſt to unknown re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, in the alarming ſituation I then was in, with three ſmall children, the eldeſt, Sylvanus, who was but ſix years old. My eldeſt daughter, Suſanna, was four, and Polly, the other, two. My ſiſter Miriam was fourteen. My huſband was barefoot, and otherwiſe thinly clothed, his maſter had taken his jacket, and nothing but his ſhirt and trowſers remained. My two daughters had nothing but their ſhifts, and I only the gown that was handed me by the ſavages. In addition to the ſufferings which aroſe from my own deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I could not but feel for my friend Labarree; he had left a wife and four ſmall children behind, to lament his loſs, and to render his ſituation extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. With all theſe miſfortunes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavily upon me, the reader can imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine my ſituation.—The Indians pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the dreadful word "munch," march, and on we muſt go. I was put on the horſe, Mr. Johnſon took one daughter, and Mr. Labarree, being unbound, took the other; we went ſix or eight miles, and ſtopped for the night. The men were made ſecure, by having their legs put in ſplit ſticks, ſomewhat like ſtocks, and tied with cords, which were tied to the limbs of trees too high to be reached. My ſiſter, much to her mortification, muſt lie between two Indians, with a cord thrown over her, and paſſing under each of them; the little children had blankets, and I was allowed one for my uſe. Thus we took lodging for the night, with the ſky for a covering, and the ground for a pillow. The fatigues of the preceding day obliged me to ſleep ſeveral hours, in ſpite of the horrors which ſurrounded me. The Indians obſerved great ſilence, and never ſpoke but when really neceſſary, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030180_0025_0FE4C1D62234F928"/>
all the priſoners were diſpoſed to ſay but little; my children were much more peaceable, than could be imagined, gloomy fear impoſed a dead ſilence.</p>

               <p>IN the morning we were rouſed before ſunriſe, the Indians ſtruck up a fire, hung on their ſtolen kettles, and made us ſome water gruel for breakfaſt. After a few ſips of this meagre fare, I was again put on the horſe, with my huſband by my ſide, to hold me on. My two fellow priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners took the little girls, and we marched ſorrowfully on for an hour or two, when a keener diſtreſs was added to my multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied afflictions;—I was taken with the pangs of childbirth. The Indians ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us that we muſt go on to a brook. When we got there, they ſhewed ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030180_0027_0FE4C1DA31C30768"/>
by making a booth for me. Here the compaſſionate reader will drop a freſh tear, for my inexpreſſible diſtreſs; fifteen or twenty miles from the abode of any civilized being, in the open wilderneſs, rendered cold by a rainy day—in one of the moſt perilous hours, and unſupplied with the leaſt neceſſary, that could yield convenience in the hazardous moment. My children were crying at a diſtance, where they were held by their maſters, and only my huſband and ſiſter to attend me; none but mothers can figure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves my unhappy fortune. The Indians kept aloof the whole time. About ten o'clock a daughter was born. They then brought me ſome articles of clothing for the child, which they had taken from the houſe. My maſter looked into the booth, and clapped his hands with joy, crying two monies for me, two monies for me. I was permitted to reſt the remainder of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030180_0028_0FE4C1DBB6CA2B38"/>
the day. The Indians were employed in making a bier for the priſoners to carry me on, and another booth for my lodging during night. They brought a needle and two pins, and ſome bark to tie the child's clothes, which they gave my ſiſter, and a large wooden ſpoon to feed it with; at duſk they made ſome porridge, and brought a cup to ſteep ſome roots in, which Mr. Labarree had provided. In the evening I was removed to the new booth. For ſupper, they made more porridge and ſome Johnny cakes. My portion was brought me in a little bark. I ſlept that night far beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>IN the morning we were ſummoned for the journey, after the uſual breakfaſt, of meal and water. I, with my infant in my arms, was laid on the litter, which was ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alternately by Mr. Johnſon, Labarree and Farnſworth. My ſiſter and ſon were
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030180_0029_0FE4C1E1B135A800"/>
put upon Scoggin, and the two little girls rode on their maſters' backs. Thus we proceeded two miles, when my carriers grew too faint to proceed any further. This being obſerved by our ſable maſters, a general halt was called, and they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied themſelves for council. My maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoon made ſigns to Mr. Johnſon, that if I could ride on the horſe I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, otherwiſe I muſt be left behind. Here I obſerved marks of pity in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but this might ariſe from the fear of looſing his two monies. I preferred an attempt to ride on the horſe, rather than to periſh miſerably alone. Mr. Lab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arree took the infant, and every ſtep of the horſe almoſt deprived me of life. My weak and helpleſs condition rendered me, in a degree, inſenſible to every thing; my poor child could have no ſuſtenance from my breaſt, and was ſupported entirely by water gruel. My other little children,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030180_0030_0FE4C1E3359A7150"/>
rendered peeviſh by an uneaſy mode of riding, often burſt into cries, but a ſurly check from their maſters ſoon ſilenced them.—We proceeded on with a ſlow, mournful pace. My weakneſs was too ſevere to allow me to ſit on the horſe, long at a time; every hour I was taken off, and laid on the ground to reſt. This preſerved my life, during the third day. At night we found ourſelves at the head of Black River Pond. Here we prepared to ſpend the night, our ſupper conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of gruel and the broth of a hawk, they had killed the preceding day. The priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were ſecured, as uſual, a booth was made for me, and all went to reſt. After encampment, we entered into a ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. My ſiſter obſerved, that if I could have been left behind, our trouble would have been ſeemingly nothing. My huſband hoped, by the aſſiſtance of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we ſhould all be preſerved. Mr.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030180_0031_0FE4C1E4BA88A650"/>
Labarree pitied his poor family—and Farnſworth, ſummed the whole of his wiſhes, by ſaying, that if he could have got a layer of pork, from the cellar, we ſhould not be in fear of ſtarvation. The night was uncommonly dark, and paſſed tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly off.</p>
               <p>IN the morning, half chilled with a cold fog, we were ordered from our places of reſt, were offered the lean fare of meal and water, and then prepared for the journey; every thing reſembled a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proceſſion. The ſavages preſerved their gloomy ſadneſs—the priſoners, bowed down with grief and fatigue, felt little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to talk; and the unevenneſs of the country, ſometimes lying in miry plains, at others riſing into ſteep and broken hills, rendered our paſſage hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painful. Mr. Labarree kept the infant in his arms, and preſerved its life.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030180_0032_0FE4C1E748DCE7D8"/>
The fifth day's journey was an unvaried ſcene of fatigue. The Indians ſent out too or three hunting parties, who returned without game. As we had in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſumed the laſt morſel of our meal, every one now began to be ſeriouſly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and hunger, with all its horrors, looked us earneſtly in the face. At night, we found the waters that run into Lake Champlain, which was over the height of land; before dark we halted, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, by the help of their punk, which they carried in horns, made a fire. They ſoon adopted a plan to relieve their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The horſe was ſhot, and his fleſh was in a few moments broiling on embers, and they, with native gluttony, ſatiated their craving appetites. To uſe the term politeneſs, in the management of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, may be thought a burleſque, yet their offering the priſoners the beſt parts of the horſe, certainly bordered on <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030180_0033_0FE4C1ED5DC523B8"/>
an epicure could not have cartered nicer ſlices, nor in that ſituation, ſerved them up with more neatneſs. Appetite is ſaid to be the beſt ſauce, yet our abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it did not render ſavory this nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſteak. My children, however, eat too much, which made them very unwell for a number of days. Broth was made for me and my child, which was rendered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a luxury by the ſeaſoning of roots. After ſupper, countenances began to brighten, thoſe who had reliſhed the meal, exhibited new ſtrength, and thoſe who had only ſnuffed its effluvia, confeſſed themſelves regaled; the evening was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in drying and ſmoking what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, for future uſe. The night was a ſcene of diſtreſſing fears to me, and my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakneſs had affected my mind to ſuch a degree, that every difficulty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared doubly terrible. By the aſſiſtance of Scoggin, I had been brought ſo far, yet
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030180_0034_0FE4C1EF20CFB050"/>
ſo great was my debility, that every hour I was taken off, and laid on the ground, to keep me from expiring. But now alas! this conveyance was no more. To walk was impoſſible. Inevitable death, in the midſt of woods, one hundred miles wide, appeared my only portion.</p>

               <p>IN the morning of the ſixth day, the Indians exerted themſelves to prepare one of their greateſt dainties. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bones of old Scoggin were pounded for a ſoup, and every root, both ſweet and bitter, that the woods afforded, was thrown in to give it a flavor. Each one partook of as much as his feelings would allow. The war whoop then reſounded, with an infernal yell, and we began to fix for a march. My fate was unknown, till my maſter brought ſome bark, and tied my petticoats, as high as he ſuppoſed would be convenient for walking, and ordered me to "munch." With ſcarce ſtrength
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030180_0036_0FE4C1F332EFD350"/>
to ſtand alone, I went on half a mile, with my little ſon and three Indians. The reſt were advanced. My power to move then failed, the world grew dark, and I drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped down. I had ſight enough to ſee an Indian lift his hatchet over my head, while my little ſon ſcreamed, "Ma'am do go, for they will kill you." As I fainted, my laſt thought was, that I ſhould preſently be in the world of ſpirits.—When I awoke, my maſter was talking angrily with the ſavage, who had threatened my life. By his geſtures I could learn, that he charged him with not acting the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of a warrior, by an attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the prize of a brother. A whoop was given, for a halt. My maſter help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to the reſt of the company—where a council was held, the reſult of which was, that my huſband ſhould walk by my ſide, and help me along. This he did for ſome hours, but faintneſs then overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030180_0037_0FE4C1F7E27B4D10"/>
me, and Mr. Johnſon's tenderneſs and ſolicitude, was unequal to the taſk, of aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me further; another council was held —while in debate, as I lay on the ground, gaſping for breath, my maſter ſprang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, with his hatchet. My huſband and fellow priſoners grew pale at the ſight, ſuſpecting that he, by a ſingle blow, would rid themſelves of ſo great a burthen, as myſelf. But he had yet too much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for his "two monies." His ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to get bark from a tree, to make a pack ſaddle, for my conveyance on the back of my huſband. He took me up, and we marched in that form the reſt of the day. Mr. Labarree ſtill kept my infant, Farnſworth carried one of the little girls, and the other rode with her maſter; they were extremely ſick and weak, owing to the large portion of the horſe, which they eat; but if they uttered a murmuring word, a menacing frown
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030180_0038_0FE4C1FA765CCB38"/>
from the ſavages, ſoon impoſed ſilence. None of the Indians were diſpoſed to ſhew inſults of any nature, except the youngeſt, which I have before mentioned. He often delighted himſelf, by torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſiſter, by pulling her hair, treading on her gown, and numerous other boyiſh pranks, which were provoking and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. We moved on, faint and wearily, till night; the Indians, then yelled their war whoop, built a fire, and hung over their horſe broth. After ſupper, my booth was built, as uſual, and I repoſed much better than I had the preceding nights.</p>
               <p>IN the morning, I found myſelf great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored. Without the aid of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, or phyſick, nature had began the cure of that weakneſs, to which ſhe had reduced me, but a few days before. The reader will be tired of the repetition of the ſame materials, for our meals; but if my
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030180_0039_0FE4C1FC00E1FF78"/>
feelings can be realized, no one will turn with diſguſt from a breakfaſt of ſteaks, which were cut from the thigh of a horſe. After which, Mr. Johnſon was ordered to take the infant, and go forward with part of the company. I "munched" in the rear till we came to a beaver pond, which was formed in a branch of Otter Creek. Here I was obliged to wade; when half way over, up to the middle in cold water, my little ſtrength failed, and my power to ſpeak or ſee left me. While motionleſs and ſtiffened, in the middle of the pond, I was perceived from the other ſide, by Mr. Johnſon, who laid down the infant, and came to my aſſiſtance; he took me in his arms, and when the oppoſite ſide was gained, life itſelf had apparently forſaken me. The whole company ſtopped, and the Indians, with more humanity than I ſuppoſed them poſſeſſed of, buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in making a fire, to warm me into
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030180_0040_0FE4C1FE8CDC6F48"/>
life. The warm influence of the fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored my exhauſted ſtrength, by degrees; and in two hours I was told to munch. The reſt of the day I was carried by my huſband. In the middle of the afternoon, we arrived on the banks of one of the great branches of Otter Creek. Here we halted, and two ſavages, who had been on a hunting ſcout, returned with a duck; a fire was made, which was thrice grateful to my cold ſhivering limbs. Six days had now almoſt elapſed, ſince the fatal morn, in which we were taken, and by the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Providence, whoſe ſmiles give life to creation, we were ſtill in exiſtence. My wearied huſband, naked children, and helpleſs infant, formed a ſcene, that conveyed ſeverer pangs to my heart, than all the ſufferings I endured myſelf. The Indians were ſullen and ſilent, the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſwollen with gloomy grief, and I was half the time expiring. After my
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030180_0041_0FE4C204514C8B08"/>
feelings were a little quickened by warmth, my ſad portion was brought in a bark, conſiſting of the Duck's head, and a gill of broth. As I lifted the unſavory mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, with a trembling hand, to my mouth, I caſt my thoughts back a few days, to a time, when, from a board plentifully ſpread, in my own houſe, I eat my food with a merry heart. The wooden ſpoon dropped from my feeble hand. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt was too affecting. Seated on a rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged rock, beneath a hemlock, as I then was. Emaciated by ſickneſs, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by my weeping and diſtreſſed family, who were helpleſs priſoners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair would have robbed me of life, had I not put my whole confidence in that Being, who has power to ſave. Our maſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare to ford the ſtream. I ſwallowed moſt of my broth, and was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up by my huſband. The river was very rapid, and paſſing dangerous. Mr.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030180_0042_0FE4C2072838F770"/>
Labarree, when half over with my child, was tripped up by its rapidity, and loſt the babe in the water; little did I expect to ſee the poor thing again, but he fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reached a corner of its blanket, and ſaved its life. The reſt got ſafe to the other ſhore—another fire was built, and my ſiſter dried the infant, and its clothes. Here we found a proof of Indian ſagacity, which might juſtly be ſuppeſed not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a band of rambling barbarians. In their journey over to Connecticut Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they had, in this place, killed a Bear. The entrails were cleanſed, and filled with the fat of the animal, and ſuſpended from the limb of a tree; by it was depoſited a bag of flour, and ſome tobacco, all which was deſigned for future ſtores, when trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling that way. Nothing could have been offered more acceptable, than theſe tokens of Indian economy and prudence. The flour was made into pudding, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030180_0043_0FE4C208AEE3BD08"/>
the bear greaſe ſauce was not unreliſhing. Broth was made, and well ſeaſoned with ſnakeroot, and thoſe who were fond of tobacco, had each their ſhare. The whole, formed quite a ſumptuous entertainment. But theſe ſavage dainties, made no ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble addition to our quota of happineſs. My weakneſs increaſed, my children were very unwell, and Mr. Johnſon's ſituation was truly diſtreſſing. By travelling bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, over ſuch a length of foreſt, and ſupporting me on his ſhoulders, his feet were rendered ſore, beyond deſcription. I cannot expreſs too much gratitude, for Mr. Labarree's goodneſs. My infant was his ſole charge, and he ſupported it, by pieces of the horſe fleſh, which he kept for its uſe, which by being firſt chewed in his own mouth, and then put into the child's, afforded it the neceſſary nutriment. After ſupper, my booth was made, the evening yell was ſounded, and we encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030180_0044_0FE4C20B3B659100"/>
for the night. By this time the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, had relaxed part of their watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and began to be careleſs of our eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Labarree and Farnſworth were ſlightly bound, and my huſband had all his liberty. My ſiſter could ſleep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her two Indian companions, and the whole company appeared leſs like priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>IN the morning of the eighth day, we were rouſed at ſunriſe. Although the early part of September is generally bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſerene ſky, and a warm ſun, yet we ſuffered exceedingly, by the cold. The mornings were damp and foggy, and the lofty trees, and numerous mountains, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en excluded the ſun till noon. Our ſnake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root broth, enriched with flour, made a rare breakfaſt, and gave a little ſtrength to our exhauſted limbs. Orders came to "munch." My poor huſband took me
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030180_0045_0FE4C2128AE5DB20"/>
upon the pack ſaddle, and we reaſſumed our march. Long before night, deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had ſtrikingly pictured every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. My little ſon, who had performed the whole journey on foot, was almoſt lifeleſs. Mr. Johnſon was emaciated, and almoſt exhauſted; often he laid me on the ground to ſave his own life, and mine; for my weakneſs was too great to ride far, without requiring reſt. While proſtrate upon the earth, and able to ſpeak, I oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en begged him to leave me there, to end a life, which could laſt but a ſhort time, and would take his with it, if he continued his exertions to ſave me; but the idea was too ſhocking, we continued our journey, in a ſlow ſorrowful mood, till night. Often did I meaſure a ſmall diſtance for the ſun to run, before I muſt bid it an eternal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu. But the ſame Providence who had brought us ſo far, and inclined our ſavage maſters to mercy, continued my protector.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030180_0046_0FE4C214101EA1F8"/>
Farnſworth carried me a ſmall diſtance, and at laſt darkneſs put an end to our painful day's journey. After the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary refreſhment, we went to reſt. The night was terrible; the firſt part was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian darkneſs, then thunder, and lightning, and rain. On the cold earth, without a cover, our ſituation may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, but not deſcribed. The Indians gave me an additional blanket for my uſe, and ſhewed ſome concern for my welfare; but it will ever ſtand firſt among modern miracles, that my life was ſpared.</p>
               <p>THE morning came, and a bright ſun reanimated our drowned ſpirits. The whole company now reſembled a group of ghoſts, more than bodily forms. Little did I expect that the light of another day, would witneſs my exiſtence; ſenſible, that if my own ſad diſeaſes did not finiſh my exiſtence, that my huſband would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030180_0047_0FE4C21595BB7618"/>
to the woful alternative, of either periſhing with me, or leaving me in the woods to preſerve his own life. The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid yell was given, which was a ſignal for preparation. Melancholy ſat heavily on every countenance, and the tear of woe moiſtened the ſickened cheek of every priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. In addition to famine and fatigue, ſo long a journey, without a ſhoe, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, had lacerated and mangled every foot, to a ſhocking degree; travelling was keenly painful.—The ſcanty breakfaſt was ſerved up; as I was lifting my gill of broth to my cold lips, my maſter, with a raſh hand, pulled it from me, and gave it to my huſband, obſerving, by ſigns, that he required all the ſuſtenance, to enable him to carry me. I yielded, on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it was a matter of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, whether any thing was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that body which muſt ſoon mingle with its original clay. With ſorrow and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030180_0048_0FE4C2182E64B580"/>
anguiſh, we began the ninth day's journey. Before we proceeded far, the Indians ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to us, that we ſhould arrive, before night, at Eaſt Bay, on Lake Champlain. This was a cordial to our drooping ſpirits, and cauſed an immediate tranſition from deſpair to joy; the idea of arriving at a place of water carriage, tranſlated us to new life. Thoſe who languiſhed with ſickneſs, fatigue or deſpair, now marched forward, with nervous alacrity. Two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were ſent on a hunting ſcout, who were to meet us at the Bay, with canoes. This ſeaſonable and agreeable intelligence, had every poſſible effect that was good, we walked with greater ſpeed, felt leſs of the journey, and thought little of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes. About the middle of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the waters of the Lake were ſeen, from a neighboring eminence; we ſoon gained the bank, where we found the two Indians, with four canoes, and a ground
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030180_0049_0FE4C21DE63330A8"/>
ſquirrel; a fire was built, and ſome food put in preparation. Here my feelings, which had not been exhilirated, ſo much as the reſt of my fellow priſoners, were buoyed above deſpair, and, for a ſhort time, the pangs of diſtreſs loſt their influence. The life, which nine days painful ſuffering in the wilderneſs, had brought to its laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of duration, now ſtarted into new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and rendered the hour I ſat on the ſhore of Lake Champlain, the happieſt I ever experienced. Here we were to take paſſage, in boats, and find relief from the thorny hills and miry ſwamps of the damp-deſart. My huſband could now be relieved, from the burden, which had brought him as nigh eternity, as myſelf. My little children would ſoon find cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all my fellow ſufferers would be in a condition to attain ſome of life's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; Twelve hours ſailing would waft us to the ſettlements of civilized
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030180_0050_0FE4C220D19115E8"/>
Frenchmen. Conſidering how much we had endured, few will deem it leſs than a miracle, that we were ſtill among the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. My ſon, of ſix years old, had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed barefoot the whole journey. Farnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth was ſhoeleſs, and carried my eldeſt daughter. Labarree had to carry, and preſerve the life of my infant. My ſiſter, owing to her youth and health, had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the leaſt. My two little daughters, with only their ſhifts, and part of one of the three gowns, which the ſavage gave me, were ſubject to all the damps of morn and night; and Mr. Johnſon's ſituation was pitiably painful; the fatigue of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me on the wearying pack ſaddle, had rendered his emaciated body almoſt a corpſe, and his ſore feet made him a crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Indians had been ſurpriſingly patient, and often diſcovered tokens of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. At every meal, we all ſhared e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with them, whether a horſe or a duck
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030180_0051_0FE4C222552FB4C0"/>
compoſed the bill of fare, and more than once, they gave me a blanket, to ſhelter me from a thunder ſtorm.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Croſſing the Lake to Crown Point, from thence to St. Johns—Chamblee—and to St. Francis's Village.</head>
               <p>I WILL only detain the reader a few moments longer in this place, while I eat the leg of a woodchuck, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt him to take a night's ſailing in the canoe with me acroſs the Lake. Though I ſincerely wiſh him a better paſſage than I had. No ſooner was our repaſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the party were divided into four equal parties, for paſſage. In my boat were two ſavages, beſides my ſon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. I was ordered to lie flat on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the canoe, and when pain obliged me to move for relief, I had a rap from a paddle. At day break, we arrived at a
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030180_0053_0FE4C22C487EFCE0"/>
great rock, on the weſt ſide of the Lake, where we ſtopped and built a fire. The Indians went to a French houſe, not far diſtant, and got ſome meat, bread, and green corn. Although we were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to taſte the meat, yet, by the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effluvia of the broiling ſteak, we were finely regaled, and the bread and roaſt corn, were a luxury. Here the ſavages, for the firſt time, gave loud tokens of joy, by hallooing and yelling in a tremendous manner. The priſoners were now intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a new ſchool. Little did we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the accompliſhment of dancing, would ever be taught us, by the ſavages. But the war dance muſt now be held; and every priſone that could move, muſt take its awkward ſteps. The figure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of circular motion, round the fire; each ſang his own muſick, and the beſt dancer was the one moſt violent in motion. The priſoners were taught each a ſong,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030180_0054_0FE4C22DE763EC60"/>
mine was, danna witchee natchepung; my ſon's was narwiſcumptom. The reſt I cannot recollect. Whether this talk was impoſed on us for their diverſion, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremonial, I cannot ſay, but it was very painful and offenſive. In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, ſeven Indians came to us, who were received with great joy, by our maſters, who took great pleaſure in introducing their priſoners. The war dance was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain held; we were obliged to join, and ſing our ſongs, while the Indians rent the air with infernal yelling. We then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked and arrived at Crown Point about noon. Each priſoner was then led by their maſters, to the reſidence of the French Commander. The Indians kept up their infernal yelling the whole time. We were ordered to his apartment, and uſed with that hoſpitality, which characterizes the beſt part of the nation. We had brandy in profuſion, a good dinner, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030180_0055_0FE4C22F6D569528"/>
a change of linen. This was luxury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, after what we had ſuffered, for the want of theſe things. None but ourſelves could prize their value. We, after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were paraded before Mr. Commander, and underwent examination, after which we were ſhewn a convenient apartment, where we reſided four days, not ſubject to the juriſdiction of our ſavage maſters. Here we received great civilities, and many preſents. I had a nurſe, who in a great meaſure, reſtored my exhauſted ſtrength. My children were all decently clothed, and my infant in particular. The firſt day, while I was taking a nap, they dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſo fantaſtically, a la France, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to own it, when brought to my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, not gueſſing that I was the mother of ſuch a ſtrange thing.</p>
               <p>ON the fourth day, to our great grief and mortification, we were again delivered to the Indians, who led us to the water
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030180_0056_0FE4C232027CDB28"/>
ſide, where we all embarked in one veſſel for St. Johns. The wind ſhifted, after a ſhort ſail and we dropped anchor. In a little time, a canoe came a long ſide of us, in which was a white woman, who was bound for Albany. Mr. Johnſon beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to ſtop a few minutes, while he wrote to Col. Lydius, of Albany, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of our ſituation, and to requeſt him to put the ſame in the Boſton newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, that our friends might learn that we were alive. The woman delivered the letter, and the contents were publiſhed, which conveyed the agreeable tidings to our friends, that although priſoners, we were then alive.</p>
               <p>AFTER a diſagreeable voyage of three days, we made St. Johns, the ſixteenth of September, where we again experienced the politeneſs of a French Commander. I, with my child, was kindly lodged in the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030180_0057_0FE4C2395C4ECF98"/>
ſame room with himſelf and lady. In the morning, we ſtill found misfortune tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe at our heels;—we muſt again be delivered to our ſavage maſters, and take another paſſage in the boats for Chamblee, when within three miles of which, Labar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree, myſelf and child, with our two maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were put on ſhore; we were ignorant of our deſtiny, and parting from my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and friends, was a ſevere trial, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing whether we were ever to meet them again. We walked on to Chamblee; here our fears were diſſipated, by meeting our friends. In the garriſon of this place, we found all the hoſpitality our neceſſities required. Here, for the firſt, after my captivity, I lodged on a bed. Brandy was handed about in large bowls, and we lived in high ſtyle. The next morning we were put in the cuſtody of our old maſters, who took us to the canoes, in which we had a painful voyage that day,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030180_0058_0FE4C23B211C1AD0"/>
and the following night to Sorell; where we arrived on the nineteenth. A hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table friar came to the ſhore to ſee us, and invited us to his houſe; he gave us a good breakfaſt, and drank our better healths, in a tumbler of brandy; he took compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate notice of my child, and ordered it ſome ſuitable food. But the Indians hurried us off, before it could eat. He then went with us to the ſhore, and ordered his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to carry the food, prepared for the child, to the canoe, where he waited till I fed it. The friar was a very genteel man, and gave us his benediction, at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in feeling language. We then row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on till the middle of the afternoon, when we landed on a barren heath, and by the help of a fire, cooked an Indian dinner; after which the war dance was held, and another infernal yelling. The priſoners were obliged to ſing, till they were hoarſe, and dance round the fire.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030180_0059_0FE4C23CA3D9BFE8"/>
We had now arrived within a few miles of the village St. Francis, to which place our maſters belonged. Whenever the warriors return from an excurſion againſt an enemy, their return to the tribe or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, muſt be deſignated by warlike cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emonial; the captives or ſpoil, which may happen to crown their valour, muſt be conducted in a triumphant form, and decorated to every poſſible advantage. For this end we muſt now ſubmit to paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; their vermillion, with which they were ever ſupplied, was mixed with bear's greaſe, and every cheek, chin, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, muſt have a daſh. We then rowed on within a mile of the town, where we ſtopped at a French houſe, to dine; the priſoners were ſerved with ſoup meagre, and bread. After dinner, two ſavages proceeded to the village, to carry the glad tidings of our arrival. The whole atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere ſoon reſounded from every quarter,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030180_0060_0FE4C23F2FFA12F0"/>
with whoops, yells, ſhrieks, and ſcreams. St. Francis, from the noiſe that came from it, might be ſuppoſed the centre of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonium. Our maſters were not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they made every reſponſe they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could. The whole time we were ſailing from the French houſe, the noiſe was direful to be heard. Two hours before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, we came to the landing, at the village. No ſooner had we landed, than the yell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the town was redoubled, a cloud of ſavages, of all ſizes, and ſexes, ſoon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed running towards us; when they reached the boats, they formed themſelves into a long parade, leaving a ſmall ſpace, through which we muſt paſs. Each Indian then took his priſoner by his hand, and after ordering him to ſing the war ſong, began to march through the gauntlet. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a ſevere beating, before we got through, but were agreeably diſappointed, when we found that each Indian only gave
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030180_0061_0FE4C2478D7F75A8"/>
us a tap on the ſhoulder. We were led directly to the houſes, each taking his priſoner to his own wigwam. When I entered my maſter's door, his brother ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted me with a large belt of wampum, and my maſter preſented me with another. Both were put over my ſhoulders, and croſſed behind and before. My new home was not the moſt agreeable; a large wigwam without a floor, with a ſire in the centre, and only a few water veſſels and diſhes, to eat from, made of birch bark, and tools for cookery, made clumſily of wood, for furniture, will not be thought a pleaſing reſidence to one accuſtomed to civilized life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>CHAP. V. Reſidence at St. Francis. Sale of moſt of the Priſoners to the French, and Removal to Montreal.</head>
               <p>NIGHT preſently came, after our arrival at St. Francis. Thoſe, who have felt the gloomy, homeſick feelings, which ſadden thoſe hours which a youth paſſes, when firſt from a father's houſe, may judge of part of my ſufferings; but when the reſt of my circumſtances are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their conception muſt fall infinitely ſhort. I now found myſelf, with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, in a large wigwam, accompanied with two or three warriors, and as many ſquaws, where I muſt ſpend the night, and perhaps a year. My fellow priſoners were diſpoſed over the town; each one,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030180_0063_0FE4C24AD96E77B0"/>
probably, feeling the ſame gloomineſs, with myſelf. Haſty pudding preſently was brought forward, for ſupper. A ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bowl of wood, well filled, was placed in a central ſpot, and each one drew near with a wooden ſpoon. As the Indians never uſe ſeats, nor have any in their wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams, my awkwardneſs in taking my poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a matter of no ſmall amuſement to my new companions. The ſquaws firſt fall upon their knees, and then ſit back upon their heels. This was a poſture that I could not imitate. To ſit in any other, was thought by them, indelicate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite. But I advanced to my pudding, with the beſt grace I could, not, however, eſcaping ſome of their funny remarks. When the hour for ſleep came on, for it would be improper to call it bedtime, where beds were not, I was pointed to a platform, raiſed half a yard, where upon a board, covered with a blanket, I was to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030180_0064_0FE4C24D6E0B79C0"/>
paſs the night. The Indians threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down, in various parts of the building, in a manner that more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled cows, in a ſhed, than human beings, in a houſe. In the morning, our break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt conſiſted of the relicks of the laſt night; my ſiſter came to ſee me in the forenoon, and we ſpent ſome hours, in obſervations upon our ſituation, while waſhing ſome apparel, at a little brook. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, I with my infant, was taken to the grand parade, where we found a large col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the village inhabitants; an aged chief ſtepped forward, into an area, and after every noiſe was ſilenced, and every one fixed in profound attention, he began to harrangue; his manner was ſolemn— his motions and expreſſion gave me a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect idea of an orator. Not a breath was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and every ſpectator ſeemed to rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence what he ſaid. After the ſpeech, my little ſon was brought to the oppoſite
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030180_0065_0FE4C2530F0467F8"/>
ſide of the parade, and a number of blank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets laid by his ſide. It now appeared that his maſter and mine, intended a ſwop of priſoners. My maſter being a hunter, wiſhed for my ſon, to attend him on his excurſions. Each delivered his property with great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; my ſon and blankets, being an equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent for myſelf, child, and wampum. I was taken to the houſe of my new maſter, and found myſelf allied to the firſt family; my maſter was ſon in law to the grand ſachem, was accounted rich, had a ſtore of goods, and lived in a ſtyle far above the majority of his tribe. Soon after my arrival at his houſe, the interpreter came to inform me, that I was adopted into his family. I was then introduced to the family, and was told to call them brothers and ſiſters.—I made a ſhort reply, expreſſive of gratitude, for being introduced to a houſe of high blood, and requeſted their patience, while I ſhould learn the cuſtoms of the nation.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030180_0066_0FE4C2559C69D978"/>
This was ſcarce over, when the attention of the village was called to the grand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, to attend a rejoicing, occaſioned by the arrival of ſome warriors, who had brought ſome ſcalps. They were carried in triumph on a pole. Savage butchery, upon murdered countrymen. The ſight was horrid. As I retired to my new reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I could hear the ſavage yells, that accompany the war dance. I ſpent the night in ſad reflection.</p>
               <p>MY time now was ſolitary beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; my new ſiſters and brothers treated me with the ſame attention that they did their natural kindred, but it was an unnatural ſituation to me. I was a novice at making canoes, bunks, and tumplines, which was the only occupation of the ſquaws; of courſe, idleneſs was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my calamities.—My fellow priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were as gloomy as myſelf ignorant,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030180_0067_0FE4C25721A357E8"/>
whether they were to ſpend their days in this inactive village, to be carried into a war campaign, to ſlaughter their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or to be dragged to the cold Lakes of the north, in a hunting voyage. We viſited each other daily, and ſpent our time in conjecturing our future deſtiny.</p>
               <p>THE ſpace of forty five years having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed, ſince my reſidence in St. Francis, it is impoſſible to give the reader a minute detail of events, that occurred, while there; many of them are ſtill forcibly impreſſed upon my memory, but dates and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, are now inaccurately treaſured up, by faint recollection. Mr. Johnſon tarried but a few days with me, before he was carried to Montreal, to be ſold. My two daughters, ſiſter and Labarree, were ſoon after carried to the ſame place, at different times. Farnſworth was carried by his maſter, on a hunting ſcout, but not prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030180_0068_0FE4C259AF4CD360"/>
ſo active in the chaſe and ambuſh, as they wiſhed, he was returned, and ſent to Montreal. I now found an increaſe to my trouble, with only my ſon and infant, in this ſtrange land, without a proſpect of relief, and with all my former trouble lying heavy upon me, diſappointment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair came well nigh being my execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In this dilemma, who can imagine my diſtreſs, when my little ſon came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to me one morning, ſwollen with tears, exclaiming, that the Indians were going to carry him into the woods to hunt; he had ſcarcely told the piteous ſtory, before his maſter came, to pull him away; he threw his little arms around me, begging in the agony of grief, that I would keep him. The inexorable ſavage, unclenched his hands, and forced him away; the laſt words I heard, intermingled with his cries, were, Ma'am I ſhall never ſee you again.

me to wiſh that I never had been a moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Farewell, Sylvanus, ſays I, God will preſerve you.</p>
               <p>IT was now the fifteenth of October. Forty five days had paſſed ſince my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and no proſpect, but what was darkened with clouds of misfortune. The uneaſineſs occaſioned by indolence, was in ſome meaſure relieved, by the privilege of making ſhirts for my brother. At night and morn, I was allowed to milk the cows. The reſt of the time I ſtrolled gloomily about, looking ſometimes into an unſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wigwam, at others ſauntering into the buſhes, and walking on the banks of brooks. Once, I went to a French houſe, three miles diſtant, to viſit ſome friends of my brother's family, where I was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained politely a week; at another time, I went with a party to fiſh, accompanied by a number of ſquaws. My weakneſs
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030180_0070_0FE4C262737C1590"/>
obliged me to reſt often, which gave my companions a poor opinion of me; but they ſhewed no other reſentment, than calling me "no good ſquaw," which was the only reproach my ſiſter ever gave, when I diſpleaſed her. All the French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants I formed an acquaintance with, treated me with that civility, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the nation; once in particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt diſtracted with an aching tooth, I was carried to a French phyſician, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the river, for relief. They prevailed on the Indians, to let me viſit them a day or two, during which time, their mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attention and generoſity, claims my warmeſt gratitude. At parting, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their earneſt wiſhes to have me viſit them again.</p>
               <p>ST. Francis contained about thirty wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams, which were thrown diſorderly into a clump. There was a church, in which
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030180_0071_0FE4C263F7D267C0"/>
maſs was held every night and morning, and every Sunday, the hearers were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by a bell; and attendance was pretty general. Ceremonies were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a French friar, who lived in the midſt of them, for the ſalvation of their ſouls. He appeared to be in that place, what the legiſlative branch is in civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, and the grand ſachem the executive. The inhabitants lived in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony, holding moſt of their prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty in common. They were prone to indolence, when at home, and not remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for neatneſs. They were extremely modeſt, and apparently averſe to airs of courtſhip. Neceſſity was the only thing that called them to action, this induced them to plant their corn, and to undergo the fatigues of hunting. Perhaps I am wrong, to call neceſſity the only motive; revenge, which prompts them to war, has great power. I had a numerous retinue
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030180_0072_0FE4C2668A90B258"/>
of relations, which I viſited daily; but my brother's houſe, being one of the moſt decent in the village, I fared full as well at home. Among my connexions, was a little brother Sabatis, who brought the cows for me, and took particular notice of my child. He was a ſprightly little fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and often amuſed me, with feats per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with his bow and arrow.</p>
               <p>IN the early part of November, Mr. Johnſon wrote from Montreal, requeſting me to prevail on the Indians, to carry me to Montreal, for ſale, as he had made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for that purpoſe. I diſcloſed the matter, which was agreed to by my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſiſter, and, on the ſeventh, we ſet ſail in a little bark canoe. While croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lake St. Peters, we came nigh land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſhores of eternity. The waves were raiſed to an enormous height, by the wind, and often broke over the canoe.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030180_0073_0FE4C26C116D1328"/>
My brother and ſiſter, were pale as ghoſts, and we all expected immediate deſtruction; but the arm of Salvation was extended for our relief, and we reached the ſhore. We were four days in this voyage, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obliging civilities every night, at French ſettlements; on the eleventh, we arrived at Montreal, where I had the ſupreme ſatisfaction of meeting my huſband, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and friends. Here I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to find, that all my fellow priſoners had been purchaſed, by gentlemen of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability, by whom they were treated with great humanity. Mr. Du Queſne bought my ſiſter, my eldeſt daughter was owned by three affluent old maids, by the name of Jaiſſon, and the other was owned by the mayor of the city.</p>
               <p>MR. Johnſon had obtained the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of two month's abſence, on parole, for the purpoſe of going to Newengland, to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030180_0074_0FE4C26E9D8B1088"/>
procure caſh, for the redemption of his family; he ſat out on his journey the day after my arrival at Montreal. Mr. Du Queſne engaged to ſupply his family with neceſſaries, during his abſence, and was to be recompenſed at his return. Directly after his departure, I found myſelf doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to freſh trouble. The Indians brought me here, for the purpoſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing me for ſome Micanaw ſavages, a tribe with whom they were at war; but being diſappointed in this, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant in their demands, and refuſed to take leſs than a thouſand livres, for me, and my child, Mr. Du Queſne fixed his offer at ſeven hundred, which was utterly refuſed, by my ſavage maſters. Their next ſtep was, to threaten to carry me back to St. Francis. After a half day's ſurly deliberation, they concluded to take the offered ſum. I was received into Mr. Du Queſne's family. My joy at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030180_0075_0FE4C2702109AFF8"/>
delivered from ſavage captivity, was unbounded. From this period, Indians and ſufferings were no more to torture me, or my family, except the unfortunate Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus. The fond idea of liberty, held forth its dazzling pleaſures, and the ignorance of future calamities, precluded every cloud, that could obſcure its effulgence. On Mr. Johnſon's journey to Newengland, I reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all my hope, and felt full confidence in being relieved at his return.</p>
               <p>IN juſtice to the Indians, I ought to remark, that they never treated me with cruelty, to a wanton degree; few people have ſurvived a ſituation like mine, and few have fallen into the hands of ſavages, diſpoſed to more lenity and patience. Modeſty has ever been a characteriſtick of every ſavage tribe; a truth which my whole family will join to corroborate, to the extent of their knowledge. As they
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030180_0076_0FE4C272AB2987B0"/>
are aptly called the children of nature, thoſe who have profited by refinement and education, ought to abate part of the prejudice, which prompts them to look with an eye of cenſure on this untutored race. Can it be ſaid of civilized conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, that they, in the main, are willing to ſhare with their priſoners, the laſt ration of food, when famine ſtares them in the face? Do they ever adopt an enemy, and ſalute him by the tender name of brother? And I am juſtified in doubting, whether if I had fallen into the hands of French ſoldiery, ſo much aſſiduity would have been ſhewn, to preſerve my life.</p>

               <p>THE reader will leave me, and my family, under the care of our factor, a ſhort time, and proceed with Mr. Johnſon.

They were to tarry at Albany, till his return. In a ſhort time, I had a letter from Col. Lydius, informing me, that he had ſafely arrived at Albany, and had gone to Boſton.

further orders. His ſituation now, was really deplorable. His parole, which was only for two months, muſt be violated; his credit in Canada loſt. His family expoſed to the malice of exaſperated Frenchmen, and all his good proſpects, at an end. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſing every exertion, in Boſton, for leave to recommence his journey, and ſpending the reſt of the winter, and all the ſpring, he found his efforts were in vain. During this time, my ſituation grew daily diſtreſſing. Mr. Du Queſne made honorable proviſion for myſelf, ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and child, till the expiration of my huſband's parole; the two Indians were then ſent to Albany, to pilot him back; after waiting ſome time, and learning nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, they returned. Previous to this, I had been treated with great attention and civility; dined frequently in the firſt families, received cards, to attend them on parties of pleaſure, and was introduced to

a large and reſpectable acquaintance. As an unfortunate woman, I received thoſe general tokens of generoſity, which flow from a humane people. Among the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which I received, was one of no ſmall magnitude, from Captains Stowbrow and Vambram, two gentlemen, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Major Waſhington, as hoſtages, when he, with the Virginia troops, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the French and Indians.

privileges of his children; ſhe, with his daughter, frequently came in their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carriage, to ride with my ſiſter and me. Gratitude to my numerous bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, pleads loudly in favor of inſerting all their names, and particularizing every act of generoſity. If I omit it, it muſt not be imagined that I have forgotten their charity; it has left an impreſſion on my heart, that can only be eraſed with the extinction of life.</p>
               <p>WHILE in Mr. Du Queſnes family, my little daughter was very unwell, and the ſuperſtitious people were convinced that ſhe would either die, or be carried off by the Devil, unleſs baptized. I yielded to their wiſhes, and they prepared for the ceremony, with all the appendages annexed to their religion. Mr. Du Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne was godfather, and the young Engliſh lady godmother; by Mrs. Du Queſne's
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030180_0089_0FE4C29F5B6B5920"/>
particular requeſt, ſhe was chriſtened Louis, after herſelf—to which I added the name of Captive.</p>
               <p>THE return of the Indians, without Mr. Johnſon, boded no good to me. I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with pain, the gradual change in my friends, from coldneſs to neglect, and from neglect to contempt. Mr. Du Queſne, who had the moſt delicate ſenſe of honor, ſuppoſed that he had deſignedly broken his parole, and abuſed his confidence; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to grant me further aſſiſtance, or even to ſee my face. I now found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf friendleſs and alone; not a word had I heard from Mr. Johnſon, not a word had I heard from my little ſon, with the Indians. Affliction lowered upon me, with all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; in this dilemma, my ſiſter and I agreed to take a ſmall room, and ſupport our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, till our little ſtore of caſh was expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then have recourſe to our needles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:030180_0090_0FE4C2A0E132C780"/>IN the beginning of April, the Indians made a ſecond tour to Albany, in queſt of Mr. Johnſon, and again returned without him. I wrote to Col. Lydius, for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but he could tell nothing. Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs increaſed; but I ſummoned all my reſolution, and indulged the fond hope, of being ſoon relieved. We kept our little room till June, when I had the happineſs to hear, that my huſband was without the city, waiting for permiſſion to come in. He was conducted in by a file of men; his preſence baniſhed care and trouble, and turned the tear of ſorrow, to the effuſion of joy; after the gratulation of meeting had ſubſided, he related his ſad fate in Newengland. He finally got permiſſion from Gov. Wentworth, to come private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the way of Albany, where he took his bills, drawn by Mr. Cuyler, on Mr. St. Luc Lucorne, and Mr. Rine Du Queſne. The face of affairs in Canada had mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030180_0091_0FE4C2A26624E098"/>
changed; during his abſence a new Governor had been ſent over, and various manoeuvres in politicks had taken place, which were very injurious to him. Had the old Governor tarried, his abſence would have probably been excuſed. But Monſ. Vaudrieul was ignorant of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, on which he went home, and could not admit apologies, for the breach of his parole. Our diſappointment and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication were ſevere, when we found our bills proteſted. This reduced us at once to a beggarly ſtate. The evil was partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedied, by St. Luc Lucorne's lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us paper money, while we could ſend ſome Indians, to Mr. Cuyler, for ſilver. Mr. Johnſon received orders to ſettle his affairs, with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
               <p>SPIRITED preparations were now mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for war. General Dieſkau, arrived from France, with an army, and Montreal
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030180_0092_0FE4C2A4E55B4350"/>
was a ſcene of buſy confuſion. We were completing our ſettlements, with our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, expecting to have full permiſſion to go home, when the Indians returned. But the meaſure of our miſery was not yet full. In the beginning of July, Mr. Johnſon was put into jail. Terrible to me, was this unexpected ſtroke; without money, credit or friends, I muſt now roam the ſtreets, without a proſpect of relief, from the cloud of misfortune, that hung over me. In a few days, the faithful Indians, who had been ſent to Mr. Cuyler, for the ſilver, returned, with four hundred and thirty eight dollars, with an order on St. Luc Lucorne, for ſeven hundred addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional livres; but he took the whole into poſſeſſion, and we never after received a penny from him.</p>
               <p>HALF diſtracted, and almoſt exhauſted with deſpair and grief, I went to the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030180_0093_0FE4C2A98E943D20"/>
to paint our diſtreſs, and aſk relief. I found him of eaſy acceſs, and he heard my lamentable ſtory, with ſeeming emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his only promiſe was, to take care of us, and, at parting, he gave me a crown, to buy milk for my babes. Ignorant of our deſtiny, my ſiſter and I, kept our little room, and were fortunate enough, to get ſubſiſtance from day to day. Often going to the gloomy priſon, to ſee my poor huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whoſe misfortunes in Boſton had brought him to this wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>OUR own misfortunes had taught us how to feel for the ſufferings of others, and large demands were now made, on our ſympathetick powers. Juſt as we were plunged into this new diſtreſs, a ſcout of ſavages brought a number of priſoners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Montreal, which were our old friends
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030180_0094_0FE4C2AC60CB2440"/>
and acquaintance.<note n="*" place="bottom">Two children from Mr. H. Grout's family, and two children belonging to Mrs. How, the fair captive, celebrated in Col. Humphrey's life of Putnam. Their names were Polly and Submit Phips. Mrs. How was then a priſoner at St. Johns, with ſix other children, and one Garfield. They were all taken at Hinſdale.—Mrs. How's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were purchaſed by Monſ. Vaudrieul, the Governor, and had every attention paid their ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation. After a year's reſidence in Montreal, they were ſent to the grand nunnery in Quebec, where my ſiſter and I, made them a viſit; they were beautiful girls, cheerful and well taught. We here found two aged Engliſh ladies, who had been taken in former wars. One, by the name of Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, who had a brother in Boſton, on whom ſhe requeſted me to call, if ever I went to that place; I complied with her requeſt afterwards, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many civilities from her brother.</note> Our meeting was a ſcene of ſorrow, and melancholly pleaſure.</p>
               <p>ALL were now flocking to the ſtandard of war. The Indians came from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030180_0095_0FE4C2AEEF6306F8"/>
thirſting for Engliſh blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving inſtruction from the French. A number of tribes, with all their horrid weapons of war, paraded, one morning, before the General's houſe, and held the war dance, and filled the air with infernal yells, after which, in a formal manner, they took the hatchet, againſt the Engliſh, and marched for the field of battle. Alas! my poor countrymen, thought I, how many of you are to derive miſery from theſe monſters.</p>
               <p>ON the twenty ſecond of July, Mr. Johnſon was taken from jail, and with myſelf, and our two youngeſt children, were ordered on board a veſſel for Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec. To leave our friends at Montreal, was a diſtreſſing affair; my ſiſters ranſom had been paid, but ſhe could not go with us. She went into the family of the Lieut. Governor, where ſhe ſupported
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030180_0096_0FE4C2B0741023E8"/>
herſelf, with her needle. My eldeſt daughter, was ſtill with the three old maids, who treated her tenderly. Labar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree and Farnſworth, had paid the full price of their redemption, but were not allowed to go home. Not a word had we heard yet, from poor Sylvanus. We parted in tears, ignorant of our deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but little thinking, that we were to embark for a place of wretchedneſs and woe. After two days good ſailing, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Quebec, and were all conducted directly to jail.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Six month's reſidence in the Criminal Jail, and removal to the Civil Priſon.</head>
               <p>WE now, to our indeſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pain, found the fallacy of Mr. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's promiſes, for our welfare. This jail was a place, too ſhocking for deſcription. In one corner, ſat a poor being, half dead with the ſmall pox; in another, were ſome louſy blankets and ſtraw; in the centre ſtood a few dirty diſhes, and the whole preſented a ſcene miſerable to view. The terrors of ſtarvation, and the fear of ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in filth, were overpowered, by the more alarming evil of the ſmall pox, which none of us had had. But there was no retreat, reſignation was our only reſource; the firſt fortnight we waited
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030180_0098_0FE4C2B8298AEEF8"/>
anxiouſly for the attack of the diſeaſe, in which time, we were ſupported by a ſmall piece of meat a day, which was ſtewed with ſome ruſty cruſts of bread, and brought to us in a pail, that ſwine would run from. The ſtraw and louſy blankets, were our only lodging, and the reſt of our furniture conſiſted of ſome wooden blocks, for ſeats. On the fifteenth day, I was taken with the ſmall pox, and removed to the hoſpital; leaving my huſband and two children in the horrid priſon. In two days, Mr. Johnſon put my youngeſt child, Captive, out to nurſe. The woman kept the child but a few days, before ſhe returned it, owing to a miſtruſt, that ſhe ſhould not get her pay. But ſhould it remain in priſon, certain death muſt be its portion. Her father was reduced to the ſad neceſſity, of requeſting her, to carry it to the Lord In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, and tell him, that he muſt either allow her a compenſation for keeping it,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030180_0099_0FE4C2B9AE7BDF30"/>
or it muſt be left at his door. The good woman dreſſed it decently, and obeyed her orders. Mr. Intendant ſmiled at her ſtory, and took the child in his arms, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was a pretty little Engliſh devil, it was a pity it ſhould die; he ordered his clerk to draw an order for its allowance, and ſhe took good care of it, till the laſt of October, except a few days, while it had the ſmall pox.</p>
               <p>A few days after I left the priſon, Mr. Johnſon and my other daughter, were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with ſymptoms, and came to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to me. It is a ſingular inſtance of Divine Interpoſition, that we all recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from this malignant diſeaſe. We were remanded to priſon, but were not compelled to our former rigid confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. Johnſon was allowed, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, to go about the city, in queſt of proviſion. But, on the twentieth of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030180_0100_0FE4C30581481060"/>
October, St. Luc Lucorne arrived from Montreal, with the news of Dieſkau's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat; he had ever ſince my huſband's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, about his parole, been his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting enemy. By his inſtigation, we were all put directly to cloſe priſon.</p>
               <p>THE ravages of the ſmall pox, reduced us to the laſt extremity, and the foetid priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without fire or food, added bitterneſs to our diſtreſs. Mr. Johnſon preferred a petition to the Lord Intendant, ſtating our melancholy ſituation. I had the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of preſenting it myſelf, and by the aſſiſtance of Mr. Pertua, the interpreter, in whom we ever found a compaſſionate friend, we got ſome ſmall relief. About the firſt of November. I was taken violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill of a fever, and was carried to the hoſpital, with my daughter Captive. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a month's reſidence there, with toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good attendance, I recovered from
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030180_0101_0FE4C2BC324BA410"/>
my illneſs, and went back to my huſband. While at the hoſpital, I found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to convey the unwelcome tidings of our deplorable ſituation to my ſiſter, at Montreal, charging her to give my beſt love to my daughter Suſanna, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our fellow priſoners, Labarree and Farnſworth, that our good wiſhes awaited them. Not a word had we yet heard from poor Sylvanus.</p>
               <p>WINTER now began to approach, and the ſevere froſts of Canada, operated keenly upon our feelings. Our priſon was a horrid defence, from the blaſts of December, with two chairs, and a heap of ſtraw, and two louſy blankets, we may well be ſuppoſed to live uncomfortably; but, in addition to this, we had but one poor fire a day, and the iron grates gave free acceſs to the chills of the inclement ſky. A quart baſon, was the only thing
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030180_0102_0FE4C2C1CCF663D0"/>
allowed us to cook our ſmall piece of meat and dirty cruſts in, and it muſt ſerve at the ſame time for table furniture. In this ſad plight—a priſoner—in jail—winter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching—conceive reader, for I cannot ſpeak our diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>OUR former benevolent friends, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Stowbrow and Vambram, had the peculiar misfortune, to be caſt into a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oppoſite to us. Suſpicion of having correſponded with their countrymen, was the crime, with which they were charged. Their misfortune did not preclude the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of generoſity; they frequently ſent us, by the waiting maid, bottles of wine, and articles of proviſion. But the malice of Frenchmen, had now arrived to ſuch a pitch, againſt all our country, that We muſt be deprived of theſe comforts. Theſe good men were forbidden their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of kindneſs, and our intercourſe was
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030180_0103_0FE4C2C49D7D0E98"/>
entirely prohibited. We, however, found means, by ſtratagem, to effect, in ſome meaſure, what could not be done by open dealing. When the ſervants were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our daily ſupplies, we ſlipped into the entry, and depoſited our letters in an aſh box, which were taken by our friends, they leaving one at the ſame time for us; this ſerved in ſome meaſure, to amuſe a dull hour—ſometimes, we diverted our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the uſe of Spaniſh cards; as Mr. Johnſon was ignorant of the game, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived no inconſiderable pleaſure from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing him. But the vigilance of our keepers increaſed, and our paper and ink were withheld.—We had now been priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſeventeen months, and our proſpects were changing from bad to worſe, five months had elapſed, ſince our confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this horrid receptacle, except the time we lingered in the hoſpital. Our jailer was a true deſcendant from Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030180_0104_0FE4C2C62149CA20"/>
but, urged by impatience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, I ſoftened him ſo much, as to get him to aſk Mr. Pertua, to call on us. When the good man came, we deſcribed our ſituation, in all the moving terms, which our feelings inſpired, which in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to what he ſaw, convinced him of the reality of our diſtreſs. He propoſed aſking an influential friend of his, to call on us, who, perhaps, would deviſe ſome mode, for our relief. The next day, the gentleman came to ſee us; he was one of thoſe good ſouls, who ever feel for others woes. He was highly affronted with his countrymen, for reducing us to ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and declared, that the Lord Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant himſelf, ſhould call on us, and ſee the extremities to which he had reduced us; he ſent, from his own houſe, that night, a kettle, ſome candles, and each of us a change of linen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:030180_0105_0FE4C2C8A444BAA0"/>THE next day, January 8th, 1756, Mr. Intendant came to ſee us; he exculpated himſelf, by ſaying, that we were put there, by the ſpecial order of Monſ. Vaudrieul, the Governor in chief, and that he had no authority to releaſe us. But he would convey a letter from Mr. Johnſon to Monſieur, which might have the deſired effect. The letter was accordingly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſtating our troubles, and beſeeching relief; likewiſe praying that our ſon might be got from the Indians, and ſent to us, with our daughter and ſiſter, from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal. The Governor returned the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliging letter.</p>

L. Intendant, will be ſo good as to take ſome notice of the things you ſtand in need of, and to help you. As to your boy, who is in the hands of the Indians, I will do all that is in my power, to get him, but I do not hope to have a good ſucceſs in it; your child in town, and your ſiſter, in law are well. If it is ſome opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſome pleaſure, I will make uſe of it; unleſs ſome reaſon might happen, that hinder and ſtop the effects of my goodwill. If you had not before, given ſome cauſe of being ſuſpected, you ſhould be at liberty. I am, Sir, your moſt humble and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſervant.</p>

               <p>FROM the receipt of this letter, we dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our eſcape from direful bondage. Mr. Intendant ordered us directly to the new jail, called the civil priſon, where our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodations were infinitely better. We
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030180_0107_0FE4C2D1B0011BB8"/>
had a decent bed, candles, fuel, and all the conveniences belonging to priſoners of war. Mr. Johnſon was allowed fifteen pence, per day, on account of a Lieutenant's commiſſion, which he held under George the ſecond, and I was permitted to go once a week into the city to purchaſe nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſaries; and a waſherwoman was provided for my uſe. We were not confined to the narrow limits of a ſingle room, but were reſtrained only by the bounds of the jail yard. Our ſituation formed ſuch a contraſt, with what we endured in the gloomy criminal jail, that we imagined ourſelves the favorites of fortune, and in high life.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII Reſidence in the Civil Jail, and occurrences till the twentieth of July, 1757.</head>
               <p>TO be indolent from neceſſity, has ever been deemed a formidable evil. No better witneſſes than ourſelves, can teſtify the truth of the remark, although, our lodgings were now ſuch as we envied a month before, yet, to be compelled to continual idleneſs, was grievous to be borne. We derived ſome amuſement, from the cultivation of a ſmall garden, within the jail yard; but a continued ſameneſs of friends and action, rendered our time extremely weariſome.</p>
               <p>ABOUT a month after our arrival at this new abode, one Captain Milton, with
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030180_0109_0FE4C2D5BB1824B0"/>
his crew, who, with their veſſel, were taken at ſea, were brought priſoners of war to the ſame place. Milton was lodged in our apartment; he had all the rude boiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous airs of a ſeaman; without the leaſt trait of a gentleman, which rendered him a very troubleſome companion. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence was conſummate, but that was not the greateſt evil; while ſome new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits were parading before the priſon, one day, Milton addreſſed them in very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper language, from our window, which was noticed directly by city authority, who, ſuppoſing it to be Mr. Johnſon, ordered him into the dungeon. Deeply affected, by this new trouble, I again called on my friend, Mr. Pertua, who, after having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained the facts, got him releaſed. Mr. Milton was then put into other quarters.</p>
               <p>A new jailer, who had an agreeable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for his wife, now made our ſituation
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030180_0110_0FE4C2DCA71ABA18"/>
ſtill more happy. My little daughters played with hers, and learned the French language.</p>
               <p>CAPT. M'Neil, and his brother, from Boſton, were brought to us as priſoners; they told us the ſtate of politicks, in our own country, and told us ſome intereſting news, about ſome of our friends at home.</p>
               <p>IN the morning of the thirteenth of Auguſt, our jailer, with moon eyes, came to congratulate us, on the taking of Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, by the French. We entered little into his ſpirit of joy, preferring much, to hear good news from the other ſide. We were ſoon viſited by ſome of the priſoners, who had ſurrendered. Col. Schuyler was in the number, who, with the gentlemen in his ſuit, made us a generous preſent.</p>
               <p>THE remainder of the ſummer and fall,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030180_0111_0FE4C2DE2C6FDAC0"/>
of fifty ſix, paſſed off without any ſenſible variation. We frequently heard from Montreal my ſiſter was very well ſituated, in the family of the Lieut. Governor, and my eldeſt daughter was careſſed by her three mothers. Could I have heard from my ſon, half my trouble would have ended.</p>
               <p>IN December, I was delivered of a ſon, which lived but a few hours, and was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied under the Cathedral Church.</p>
               <p>IN the winter, I received a letter from my ſiſter, containing the ſad tidings of my father's death, who was killed by Indians, on his own farm, the preceding May. Savage vengeance fell heavily upon our family; I had a brother wounded at the ſame time, who ran to the fort, with the ſpear ſticking in his thigh. Too much grief reduced me to a weak condition; I
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030180_0112_0FE4C2DFB11D3248"/>
was taken ſick, and carried to the hoſpital, where, after a month's lingering illneſs, I found myſelf able to return.</p>
               <p>THE commencement of the year fifty ſeven, paſſed off without a proſpect of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. Part of our fellow priſoners, were ſent to France, but we made no voyage out of the jail yard. About the firſt of May, we petitioned Monſ. Vaudrieul, to permit our ſiſter to come to us. Our prayer was granted, and in May, we had the pleaſure of ſeeing her, after an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of two years. She had ſupported herſelf by her needle, in the family of the Lieut. Governor, where ſhe was treated extremely well, and received a preſent of four crowns at parting.</p>
               <p>IMPATIENT of confinement, we now made another attempt to gain our liberty. Mr. Pertua conducted us to the houſe of

the Lord Intendant, to whom we petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in preſſing terms; ſtating that we had now been priſoners almoſt three years, and had ſuffered every thing but death; and that would be our ſpeedy portion, unleſs we had relief. His Lordſhip liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſeeming pity, and promiſed to lay our caſe before the head man, at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, and give us an anſwer, in ſeven days; at the expiration of which time, we had a permit to leave the priſon. It is not eaſy to deſcribe the effect of ſuch news; thoſe only, who have felt the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of confinement, can figure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the happineſs we enjoyed, when breathing, once more, the air of liberty. We took lodgings in town, where we tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried till the firſt of June; when a cartel ſhip arrived, to carry priſoners to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, for an exchange. Mr. Johnſon wrote an urgent letter, to Monſ. Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drieul, praying that his family might be
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030180_0114_0FE4C2EA02653090"/>
included with thoſe, who were to take paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Monſieur wrote a very encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter back, promiſing that he and his family ſhould ſail, and that his daughter, Suſanna, ſhould be ſent to him—he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by congratulating him on his good proſpects, and ordering the Governor of Quebec to afford us his aſſiſtance. This letter was dated June the 27th.</p>
               <p>THIS tide of good fortune almoſt wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away the remembrance of three years adverſity. We began our preparations for embarkation, with alacrity. Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wrote St. Luc Lucorne, for the ſeven hundred livres, due on Mr. Cuyler's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but his requeſt was, and ſtill is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied. This was a period, big with every thing propitious and happy. The idea of leaving a country, where I had ſuffered the keeneſt diſtreſs, during two months and a half, with the ſavages—been
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030180_0115_0FE4C2EB9CD800B0"/>
bowed down by every mortification and inſult, which could ariſe from the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of my husband in New-England; and, where I had ſpent two years in ſickneſs and deſpair, in a priſon too ſhocking to mention, contributed to fill the moment with all the happineſs, which the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reader will conceive my due, after ſufferings ſo intenſe; to conſummate the whole, my daughter was to be returned to my arms, who had been abſent more than two years.—There was a good proſpect of our ſon's being releaſed from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; the whole, formed ſuch a lucky combination of fortunate events, that the danger of twice croſſing the ocean, to gain our native ſhore, vaniſhed in a moment. My family were all in the ſame joyful mood, and hailed the happy day, when we ſhould ſail for England.</p>
               <p>BUT little did we think, that this ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030180_0116_0FE4C2ED21431360"/>
of proſperity was ſo ſoon to be darkened, by the heavieſt clouds of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. Three days before the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day for ſailing, the ſhip came down from Montreal, without my daughter; in a few moments, I met Mr. Pertua, who told me, that counter orders had come, and Mr. Johnſon muſt be retained a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner; only my two little daughters, ſiſter and myſelf could go. This was calamity indeed; to attempt ſuch a long, weariſome voyage, without money, and without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and to leave a huſband, and two children in the hands of enemies, was too abhorrent for reflection. But is was an affair of importance, and required weighty conſideration; accordingly, the next day a ſolemn council, of all the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in the city, was held in the coffee houſe.—Col. Schuyler was preſident, and, after numerous arguments, for and againſt, were heard, it was voted, by a large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030180_0117_0FE4C2EEA520CA90"/>
that I ſhould go.—I, with heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave my conſent. Some, perhaps, will cenſure the meaſure, as raſh, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may applaud my courage; but I had ſo long been accuſtomed to danger and diſtreſs, in the moſt menacing forms, they could aſſume, that I was now almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to their threats; and this act was not a little biaſſed by deſperation. Life could no longer retain its value, if linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the inimical regions of Canada. In Europe, I ſhould, at leaſt, find friends, if not acquaintance; and among the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous veſſels bound to America, I might chance to get a paſſage. But then, to leave a tender huſband, who had ſo long, at the hazard of his life, preſerved my own; to part, perhaps forever, from two children, put all my reſolution to the teſt, and ſhook my boaſted firmneſs.</p>
               <p>COL. Schuyler, whom we ever found
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030180_0118_0FE4C2F74F433230"/>
our benevolent friend, promiſed to uſe his influence, for Mr. Johnſon's releaſe, and for the redemption of our children.</p>
               <p>ON the twentieth of July, we went on board the veſſel, accompanied by Mr. Johnſon, who went with us to take leave. We were introduced to the Captain, who was a gentleman, and a perſon of great civility;—he ſhewed us the beſt cabin, which was to be the place of our reſidence, and, after promiſing my huſband, that the voyage ſhould be made as agreeable to me as poſſible, he gave orders for weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anchor.—The time was now come, that we muſt part—Mr. Johnſon took me by the hand—our tears impoſed ſilence— I ſaw him ſtep into the barge;—but my two little children, ſiſter, and myſelf, were bound for Europe.</p>
               <p>WE fell down the river St. Lawrence,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030180_0119_0FE4C2F8EF27ABA8"/>
but a ſmall diſtance that night. The next morning, the Captain, with a cheerful countenance, came to our cabin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to riſe, and take our leave of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec; none but myſelf complied, and I gazed, as long as ſight would permit, at the place, where I had left my deareſt friend.</p>

               <p>ALL my fears and affliction, did not prevent my feeling ſome little joy, at being releaſed from the juriſdiction of Frenchmen. I could pardon the Indians, for their vindictive ſpirit, becauſe they had no claim to the benefits of civilization. But the French, who give leſſons of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, to the reſt of the world, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive no advantage from the plea of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The blind ſuperſtition, which is inculcated by their monks and friars, doubtleſs, ſtifles, in ſome meaſure, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of pity towards their enemies; and the common herd, which includes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030180_0121_0FE4C2FCF1172380"/>
ſeven eighths of their number, have no advantages from education. To theſe ſources, I attribute moſt of my ſufferings. But I found ſome benevolent friends, whoſe generoſity I ſhall ever recollect, with the warmeſt gratitude.</p>
               <p>THE commencement of the voyage, had every favorable preſage; the weather was fine, the ſailors cheerful, and the ſhip in good trim. My accommodations in the Captain's family, were very commodious; a boy was allowed me, for my particular uſe. We ſailed with excellent fortune, till the nineteenth of Auguſt, when we hove in ſight of old Plymouth, and at four o'clock, in the afternoon, dropped anchor.</p>
               <p>THE next day, all but myſelf and fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, were taken from the veſſel; we felt great anxiety at being left, and began to
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030180_0122_0FE4C303F708AB38"/>
fear, that fortune was not willing to ſmile on us, even on theſe ſhores; we waited in deſpair, thirty or forty hours, and found no relief. The Captain, obſerving our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency, began his airs of gaiety to cheer us; he aſſured us, that we ſhould not ſuffer—that if the Engliſh would not receive us, he would take us to France, and make us happy. But, at laſt an officer came on board, to ſee if the veſſel was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the reception of French priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. We related to him our ſituation; he conducted us on ſhore, and applied to the Admiral for directions—who ordered us lodgings, and the King's allowance of two ſhillings ſterling, per day, for our ſupport. Fortunately, we were lodged in a houſe, where reſided Captain John Tuſton Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe name will be familiar to the inhabitants of Newhampſhire, on account of his patent. He very kindly intereſted himſelf in our favor, and wrote to Meſſrs.

Thomlinſon and Apthorp, agents at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for the Province of Newhampſhire, ſoliciting their aſſiſtance, in my behalf. We tarried at Plymouth but a fortnight, during which time, I received much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had to gratify many an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive friend, with the hiſtory of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>CAPT. Maſon procured me a paſſage to Portſmouth, in the Rainbow man of war, from whence I was to take paſſage in a packet, for America. Juſt as I ſtepped on board the Rainbow, a good lady, with her ſon, came to make me a viſit; her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to ſee a perſon of my deſcription, was not abated, by my being on my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; ſhe ſaid ſhe could not ſleep, till ſhe had ſeen the perſon, who had ſuffered ſuch hard fortune.—After ſhe had aſked all the queſtions that time would allow of, ſhe gave me a guinea, and a half guinea
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030180_0124_0FE4C307062BF4C0"/>
to my ſiſter, and a muſlin handkerchief to each of my little girls. On our arrival at Portſmouth, the packet had ſailed; the Captain of the Rainbow, not finding it convenient to keep us with him, introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us on board the Royal Ann.</p>
               <p>WHEREVER we lived, we found the beſt friends and the politeſt treatment.— It will be thought ſingular, that a defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs woman, ſhould ſuffer ſo many changes, without meeting with ſome inſults, and many incivilities. But, during my long reſidence on board the various veſſels, the moſt delicate gallantry ever deſignated my companions. The officers were aſſiduous in making my ſituation agreeable, and readily proffered their ſervices.</p>
               <p>WHILE on board the Royal Ann, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the following letters; the reader will excuſe the recitation; it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude

               <p>THE Captain of the Royal Ann, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing my ſituation with him, might not be ſo convenient, applied to the mayor, for a permit for me to take lodgings in the city, which was granted. I took new lodgings, where I tarried three or four days, when orders came for me to be on board the Orange, man of war, in three
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030180_0129_0FE4C3163B327EC8"/>
hours, which was to ſail for America. We made all poſſible diſpatch, but when we got to the ſhore, we were aſtoniſhed to find the ſhip too far under way, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken. No time was to be loſt, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a waterman, to carry us to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantman, who was weighing anchor, at a diſtance, to go in the ſame fleet. He heſitated long enough to pronounce a chapter of oaths, and rowed us off. When we came to the veſſel, I petitioned the Captain to take us on board, till he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Orange. He directly flew into a violent paſſion, and offered greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, than I had ever received, during my whole voyage; he ſwore we were women of bad fame, who wiſhed to follow the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that he would have nothing to do with us. I begged him to calm his rage, and we would convince him of his error. But, fortunately, the victualler of the fleet happened to be in the ſhip, who
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030180_0130_0FE4C31D5C2B4DC0"/>
at this moment ſtepped forward, with his roll of names, and told the outrageous Captain, that he would ſoon convince him, whether we deſerved notice, by ſearching his liſt. He ſoon found our names, and the Captain began to beg pardon.—He took us on board, and apologized for his rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We ſailed with a fair wind for Cork, where the fleet took proviſion. We tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fortnight in this place, during which time, the Captain of the Orange came on board to ſee me, and to offer me a birth in his veſſel; but that being a battle ſhip, it was thought beſt for me to ſtay where I then was. After weighing anchor at Cork, we had a paſſage of ſeven weeks, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pleaſant, to Newyork. On the tenth of December, we dropped anchor at San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Hook; on the eleventh, I had the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme felicity, to find myſelf on ſhore in my native country, after an abſence of three years, three months, and eleven days.</p>

               <p>I MIGHT deſcant for many a page, on the felicity I felt, on being once more in my own country; but others can gueſs my feelings better than I can tell them. The Mayor of Newyork, ordered lodgings for us; here I had the pleaſure of meeting my friend, Col. Schuyler, who gave me much information about affairs in Canada, he told me that my huſband had been releaſed, and taken paſſage in a cartel ſhip, for Halifax; and that he had redeemed my ſon from the Indians, for the ſum of five hundred livres.</p>
               <p>MY fellow priſoner, Labarree, had made his eſcape from the French, and had been

               <p>WE tarried in Newyork ten days—then took water paſſage for Newhaven, where I had the good fortune to find a number of officers who had been ſtationed at Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, the preceding ſummer, who gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my curioſity with intelligence reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my relations and friends in that place.

                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:030180_0135_0FE4C32B9B428018"/>AFTER his diſmiſſion, from the guards in Boſton, he proceeded directly for Charleſtown. When within fifteen miles of Springfield, he was met by a gentleman, who had juſt before ſeen me, who gave him the beſt news he could have heard; although, it was then late at night, he loſt not a moment.—At two o'clock, in the morning of the firſt of January 1758, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain embraced my deareſt friend—happy new year, with pleaſure would I deſcribe my emotions of joy, could language paint them ſufficiently forcible; but the feeble pen ſhrinks from the taſk.</p>
               <p>CHARLESTOWN was ſtill a frontier town, and ſuffered from ſavage depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which rendered it an improper reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for me; conſequently I went to Lancaſter.</p>
               <p>MR. Johnſon, in a few days, ſat out for Newyork, to adjuſt his Canada accounts.
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030180_0136_0FE4C32D215DA040"/>
But, on his journey, he was perſuaded by Gov. Pownal to take a Captain's commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and join the forces, bound for Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga; where he was killed on the 8th of July following, while fighting for his country. Humanity will weep with me. The cup of ſorrow, was now replete with bitter drops. All my former miſeries were loſt in the affliction of the widow.</p>
               <p>IN the October following, I had the happineſs to embrace rny ſon Sylvanus; he had been above three years with the Indians, followed them in all their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excurſions and learnt too many of their habits; to civilize him, and learn him his native language was a ſevere taſk.</p>
               <p>I lived in Lancaſter till October 1759, when I returned to old Charleſtown.— The ſight of my former reſidence afforded a ſtrange mixture of joy and grief, while
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030180_0137_0FE4C32FA78D1770"/>
the deſolations of war, and the loſs of a number of dear and valuable friends, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to give the place an air of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. Soon after my arrival, Major Rogers returned from an expedition againſt the village St. Francis, which he had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and killed moſt of the inhabitants. He brought with him a young Indian priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who ſtopped at my houſe, the moment he ſaw me, he cried, my God, my God here is my ſiſter; it was my little brother Sabatis, who formerly uſed to bring the cows for me, when I lived at my Indian maſters. He was tranſported to ſee me, and declared that he was ſtill my brother, and I muſt be his ſiſter. Poor fellow! The fortune of war had left him without a ſingle relation, but with his country's enemies, he could find one who too ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly felt his miſeries; I felt the pureſt pleaſure in adminiſtering to his comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:030180_0138_0FE4C336AF9B9388"/>MY daughter Suſanna, was ſtill in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada—but as I had the fulleſt aſſurances that every attention was paid to her edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and welfare, by her three mothers, I felt leſs anxiety than I otherwiſe might have done.</p>
               <p>EVERY one will imagine, that I have paid affliction her utmoſt demand, the pains of impriſonment, the ſeparation from my children, the keen ſorrow occaſioned by the death of a butchered father, and the ſevere grief ariſing from my huſband's death, will amount to a ſum, perhaps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equaled. But ſtill my family muſt be doomed to further, and ſevere perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the ſavages. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the ſummer of ſeventeen hundred and ſixty, my brother in law, Mr. Joſeph Willard, with his wife and five children, who lived but two miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from me, were taken by a party of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030180_0139_0FE4C338353FC278"/>
Indians. They were carried much the ſame rout that I was, to Montreal. Their journey of fourteen days, through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, was a ſeries of miſeries, unknown to any but thoſe who ſuffered with me, they loſt two children, whoſe deaths were owing to ſavage barbarity. The hiſtory of their captivity would almoſt equal my own, but the reader's commiſeration and pity muſt now be exhauſted. No more of anguiſh, no more of ſufferings.</p>
               <p>THEY arrived at Montreal, a few days before the French ſurrendered it to the Engliſh; and after four Month's abſence, returned home, and brought my daughter Suſanna to my arms; while I rejoiced at again meeting my child, whom I had not ſeen for above four years, I felt extremely grateful to the Mrs. Jaiſſons, for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate attention they had beſtowed her. As they had received her as their
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030180_0140_0FE4C339B937DF78"/>
child, they had made their affluent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſubſervient to her beſt intereſt. To give her the accompliſhments of a polite education had been their principal care, ſhe had contracted an ardent love for them, which never will be obliterated. Their parting was an affecting ſcene of tears.</p>
               <p>MR. Farnſworth, my only fellow priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whoſe return I have not mentioned, came home a little before.</p>
               <p>THUS, by the goodneſs of Providence, we all returned in the courſe of ſix pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful years, to the place from whence we were taken. The long period of our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the ſeverity of our ſufferings, will be called uncommon and unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented. But we even found ſome friends to pity, among our moſt perſecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and from the various ſhapes, in which mankind appeared, we learned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030180_0141_0FE4C33C3B116238"/>
valuable leſſons. Whether in the wilds of Canada, the horrid jails of Quebec, or in our voyage to Europe, daily occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences happened, to convince us, that the paſſions of men are as various as their complexions. And, although my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were often increaſed by the ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world's ſpirit, yet the numerous teſtimonies of generoſity I received, bids me ſuppreſs the charge of neglect, or want of benevolence. That I have been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate woman, all will grant; yet, my misfortunes, while they enriched my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and taught me the value of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, have increaſed my gratitude to the author of all bleſſings, whoſe goodneſs and mercy have preſerved my life to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time.</p>
               <p>I am now in the winter of life, and feel ſenſibly the effects of old age, my vacant hours I often employ in reflecting on the
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030180_0142_0FE4C342E7F3C0B0"/>
various ſcenes, that have marked the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtages of my life. When viewing the preſent riſing generation, in the bloom of health, and enjoying thoſe gay pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures which ſhed their exhilerating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo plentifully in the morn of life, I look back to my early days, when I too was happy, and baſked in the ſunſhine of good fortune: Little do they think, that the meridian of their lives, can poſſibly be rendered miſerable by captivity or a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as little too did I think, that my gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proſpects could be obſcured, but it was the happy deluſion of youth; and I fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently wiſh there was no deception. But that Being, who "ſits upon the circle of the earth, and views the inhabitants as graſshoppers," allots our fortunes.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH I have drank ſo largely, from the cup of ſorrow, yet my preſent happineſs is a ſmall compenſation. Twice
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030180_0143_0FE4C3448EC2C730"/>
has my country been ravaged by war, ſince my remembrance; I have detailed the ſhare I bore in the firſt; in the laſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the place in which I live, was not a field of bloody battle, yet its vicinity to Ticonderoga, and the ſavages that ravaged the Coos country, rendered it perilous and diſtreſſing. But now, no one can ſet a higher value on the ſmiles of peace, than myſelf. The ſavages are driven beyond the Lakes, and our country has no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The gloomy wilderneſs, that forty years ago, ſecreted the Indian and the beaſt of prey, has vaniſhed away; and the thrifty farm ſmiles in its ſtead; the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, that were then employed in guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fort, are now quietly devoted to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the tomahawk and ſcalping knife, have given place to the ſickle and plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhare; and proſperous huſbandry now thrives, where the terrors of death once chilled us with fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:030180_0144_0FE4C34613BFB9A0"/>MY numerous progeny, often gather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me, to hear the ſufferings once felt by their aunt or grandmother, and wonder at their magnitude. My daughter, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſtill keeps the dreſs ſhe appeared in, when brought to my bed ſide, by the French nurſe, at the Ticonderoga hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and often refreſhes my memory with paſt ſcenes, when ſhowing it to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Theſe things yield a kind of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy pleaſure.</p>
               <p>INSTANCES of longevity are remarkable in my family. My aged mother ſays to me, ariſe daughter and go to thy daughter, for your daughter's daughter, has got a daughter; a command which few mothers can make and be obeyed.</p>
               <p>AND now reader, after ſincerely wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your days may be as happy, as mine have been unfortunate, I bid you adieu.</p>
