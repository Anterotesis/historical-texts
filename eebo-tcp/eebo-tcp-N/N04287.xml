            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAN was orginally form'd &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by the glorious, bounteous and beneficent Author of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for Religion and Happineſs; and in a wiſe &amp; harmonious ſubſerviency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for Society, mutual Converſe, Commerce, Aid and Helpfulneſs: As is evident from his original Make, Frame and Conſtitution; and likewiſe from the Oracles of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:005295_0004_1016F458F6401B78"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt form'd then <hi>Eve:</hi> For the LORD God ſaid, <hi>It is not good that the man ſhould be alone.</hi> And if the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> while in a ſtate of Innocence, would have been uneaſie, even in the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> and grop'd for happineſs in the midſt of Paradiſe: at leaſt would not have been ſo happy as his Nature (which was a Copy of the Divine and therefore Communicative) was capable of, for want of a Companion of his own Species; a Fellow-helper and a Partner in his Joys, had not God made him an <hi>Help-meet for him:</hi> If Company was neceſſary to compleat his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity while in a ſtate of integrity &amp; perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſurely we in this lapſed State, can't ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and live independent one of another. Naked &amp; helpleſs come we out of our Mothers womb and ſhould ſoon return thither, ſhou'd die from the womb and give up the ghoſt as ſoon as born, did not the knees prevent us &amp; the breaſts that we ſhould ſuck. Nor are or wants diminiſhed as our days or years are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, but rather grow and increaſe upon us: Wo therefore to him that is alone and hath not another to help him.</p>
            <p>Mankind couſider's as divided into different and diſtinct Families, Churches, Towns, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Members one of another, and thence obliged to be Social. God hath ſo ſet and plac'd the ſeveral Members of each
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005295_0005_1016F45BC23C6340"/>Body-politick of each Comminity whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, that the Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of thee: For as in the Boby-natural, if one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber rejoice, all the Members rejoicce with it; and <hi>e. c.</hi> if one Member ſuffer, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſuffer with it; ſo it is here, — The King cannot ſubſift without his Subjects; (for <hi>the King is ſerved by the Field</hi>) neither can the Subejct be ſafe and happy without their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. When there is no King in Iſrael every one does what is right in his own eyes: The dire Effects, fatal and deſtructive Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which, have made mankind long ſince, generally give into that Maxim, viz. <hi>That Tyranny it ſelf is better and more elegible than Anarchy.</hi> Had we no Ruler over us, alas! how ſoon ſhould we become like the Fiſhes of the Sea that devour one another?</p>
            <p>Well then, Since it is our intereſt to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der civil Government, it muſt needs be our bounden duty to Revere, Honour and Obey them that have the Rule over us; to be ſubject to the higher Powers, to the King as Supream, and unto Governours and Maginſtrates and all in Civil Authority as unto them that are ſent by Him, derive their Authority from Him, and act in His Majeſty's Name, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we find this duty ſtrictly injoin'd &amp;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005295_0006_1016F460015BDAC8"/>frequently inculcated on us throughout the Revelations of God; and particularly in the paſſage of ſacred Writ and words of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I have now read to you. Which words are found among the ſage, judicious &amp; pithy Sentences or wiſe Sayings of Solomon the Son of David King of Iſrael; who was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpir'd Preacher, and ſpake as he was moved by the Holy Gohſt</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid he ſpake three Thouſand Proverbs, and in this divine Collection of them his Doctrine drop'd as the Rain, his Speech diſtill'd as the Dew, as the ſmall Rain upon the tender Herb and as the Showers upon the Graſs: That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Prophet David his Royal Father, ſaying, <hi>He ſhall come down like the Rain on the mown Graſſ and as the Showers that water the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 72. 6.</p>
            <p>It would now be an invaſion of the Prieſts Office for Civil Rulers (as it is for any others who are not call'd of God as was Aaron) to take this honour to themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> to be publick Teachers or Exhorters. (<hi>The Lord rebuke the madneſs of all ſuch falſe Prophets who run before they are ſent; ſuch Sons of Chorah, ſuch preſumptuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza's who venture to touch the Ark.</hi>) Nevertheleſs in the days of Inſpiration and while the Moſaick Oeconomy and Legal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration laſted, we find that ſome who
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005295_0007_1016F462B8E5FAA0"/>were Kings were likewiſe Prophets and Teachers. So Solomon by God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was anointed King, and by his Spirit was made the Preacher: Nor does this great and renowned Prince think it beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Royal Character to undertake the Inſtruction of others in things pertaining to God and Religion; — For 'tis manifeſtly his great Scope and Deſign in this (as alſo in his Book call'd <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi>) to teach men <hi>the fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to depart from evil which is underſtanding.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.1, — 4.</p>
            <p>Happy were they that continually ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and heard his wiſdom; and happy are we that have theſe Divine <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> copied out and handed down to us: But eſpecially ſince we know theſe things, happy are we if we do them.</p>
            <p>Among many other Excellent words of Counſel, documents of Wiſdom, precepts and rules of Living contain'd in this Book, calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tending to render us happy both here and hereafter, our Text is one; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd with this loving &amp; endearing, kind and winning Compellation, <hi>My Son,</hi> — A term or title expreſſive of his tender Affection and paternal Regards to his fellow Men; of his pitying them like as a Father pities his Children. And it may likewiſe be deſign'd
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005295_0008_1016F46441E6FFE0"/>to intimate to his Hearers that they ought (as becomes Children) to be of a docible, tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, teachable diſpoſition, ready and forward to learn, to hearken to and follow wholſom &amp; good Advice.</p>
            <p>The Counſel of GOD and the Divine Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here given, is (if I miſtake not) peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seaſonable for us at this <hi>Preſent Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we ſhall now endeavour briefly to Explain and Inforce the ſame.</p>
            <p>The words may be divided into Three parts or diſtinct Heads of Diſcourſe, which I ſhall a little Expatiate and Inlarge upon, in the Order wherein they here ſtand plac'd.</p>
            <p>And,</p>

               <hi>Bleſſed of God and happy then are all they that fear Him and hope in his Mercy, whoſe Mercy is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him. Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandments. The fear of the Lord tendeth to Life, and he that hath it ſhall abide ſatisfied. The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Convenant. Surely his Salvation is nigh them that fear him, and as the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his Mercy toward them. He will bleſs them that fear the Lord, both ſmall and great: He will fulfill their deſire, He alſo will hear their Cry and will ſave them.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. To conſider the Importance of the next Head of advice contain'd in the Text, or to ſhew what it is to <hi>fear the King.</hi> The term King is undoubtedly here figurately and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdochically put for all that are in civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whom we are frequently in Scripture commanded to Fear, Honour, Obey and be in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005295_0011_1016F46E2E92ED88"/>all dutiful Subjection unto. And as fearing the Lord imports univerſal Piety; ſo by fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, we may underſtand <hi>univerſal Loyalty,</hi> i e all the Duties we owe to civil Rulers as ſuch: Not only the King who is Supream, but all who are in Subordinate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority have a right to what is couch'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this expreſſion See 1 Pet 2 12, 14 <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake; whether it be to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, or unto Governours, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This commandment in our text is exceeding broad and comprehenſive: And would we obey it in the full Latitude and Extent of it, <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions and giving of Thanks muſt be made by us for Kings, and for all that are in Authority,</hi> 1 Tim. 2 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Moreover, We muſt pay all due Reſpect &amp; civil Honours to men of this character, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their dignity and worth; So St <hi>Peter</hi> expounds our Text, 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>Fear GOD, Honour the King.</hi> Compare this with Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render to all their dues, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> We ſhould beware that we our ſelves do in no wiſe ſlight, deſpiſe or caſt contempt upon their Perſons or Authority; and do all we can to prevent this in others, — And that their Honour may be upheld and their Perſons had in Reverence of all, — That none may
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005295_0012_1016F46FB523AB10"/>diſregard and trample on their Authority, vilify their Government, or lay their Honour in the duſt. We are bound and obliged by all the Laws of God reſpecting our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to yield a chearful Obdience to all their good and wholſom Laws. <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft.</hi> Before men adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to tranſgreſs humane Laws, they had need be ſure that that Text will bear 'em out in ſo doing. Act. 4.19 <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, Judge ye.</hi> — A Text frequently miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyd, wreſted, perverted and miſimprov'd, eſpecially <hi>at this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt be able to make it evident from the lively Oracles, that Miſchief is fram'd and that Iniquity is eſtabliſh'd by a Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may venture to act Counter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>They certainly run a dreadful riſque and do it at their utmoſt peril, who diſobey and trample on ſuch Laws of Men, as are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant but conſonant to the Divine Law. See Rom. 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher Powers; for the Powers that be are ordained of God: Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. We come now to conſider the laſt and Cautionary Branch or part of the Text,— <hi>And meddle not with them that are given to Change.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to draw the ugly, miſhapen and forlorn Picture of them that are given to Change.</p>
            <p>And this muſt be done in <hi>Miniaeture:</hi> For it would be endleſs to trace them in their almoſt infinite mutations, mazes, meanders, intricate turnings &amp; windings, in all their Excentrick, Progreſſive and Retrograde, Apogee and Perigee motions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005295_0015_1016F47A6D0A9420"/>
But to come to the Point and to the Caſe in hand.</p>
            <p>They that are given to Change, are men that (being under the direction, influence &amp; government of no fix'd ſteady Principles) are frequently altering their Mind, ſhifting and changing their Opinion, and in conſequence hereof their Practice and Conduct, not for the better but for the worſe</p>
            <p>There is a good as well as a bad Change: A Change which all of us are, or muſt be the Subjects of as ever we hope to be happy, <hi>viz.</hi> That which St Paul ſpeaks of; 2 Cor. 3.18 <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are chang'd into the ſame Image from glory to glory, oven as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> There is ſuch a thing as a man's chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from bad to good, and from good to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which cannot be condemned. If men have imbib'd unſound Principles, embrac'd Errors and eſpous'd falſe Maxims and acted upon them; 'tis fit they ſhould change their Sentiments and alter their Courſe of acting — 'Tis ſtrictly Juſt, 'tis Honorary to our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as Chriſtians, and our Glory as Men to Embrece Truth when ever it offers it ſelf to our Choice: 'Tis highly commendable for any when they find themſelves in an Error, whether in Opinion or Practice, ſpeedily to renounce, relinquiſh and abandon the ſame:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005295_0016_1016F47BF5097FD8"/>To exchange falſhood for truth, darkneſs for light, and bitter things for ſweet. 'Tis praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to do all we can to rectify our Miſtakes and falſe Judgments of things, and to turn from crooked and perverſe Ways into ſuch as are right and ſtrait, and the paths of Peace,</p>
            <p>But this (I conceive) is not the Change here intended. No but a changing from good to bad, or from better to worſe; a changing true Maxims and Opinions for falſe ones: turning away from the truth and turning unto fables, and turning from the right ways of the Lord to commit works with the workers of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>Changlings there are of this ſort too too many. There are, who love and uſe Changes, and are ſo addicted hereunot, that they are here ſaid <hi>to be given to Change;</hi> even as one that inordinately loves and follows ſtrong Drink is ſaid to be given to it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>Some there are who are Unſtable in all their ways, in their obedience to God, and to the King, and are prone to Rebellion againſt both. They Change their mind &amp; manners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as often as the <hi>Camaleon</hi> is ſaid to change his Colour: Are as changeable as the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; variable as the Wind: Meer Weather-Cocks — Conſtant in nothing, ſave only in Inconſtancy.</p>

(1) <hi>They are given to change in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> They ſeem always as tho' they had their Religion to chuſe, in regard they are never fix'd in any thing; but are for ever wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering like a wave of the Sea, driven to and fro and carried about with diverſe &amp; ſtrange Doctrines. One while theſe are allow'd to be ſound Doctrines; anon, theſe are condemn'd and diſcharged. One while theſe are good Preachers, orthodox and ſound in the Faith; preſently, theſe are deſerted and ſtigmatiz'd by them as <hi>Hereticks, Legaliſts, Letter-learned Phariſees, Soul-daubers, &amp;c.</hi> And others ſet up Careſs'd and Canoniz'd, even ſuch as come from the Ends of the Earth, and for ought they Know may be <hi>Miſſionaries from the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Rome (For theſe that have turned the World upſide down, are come hither allo,</hi> whom ſome have receiv'd —) Which (by the way) can be no Mark of their being Chriſt's Sheep: Joh. 10 5. <hi>And a Stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of Strangers.</hi> Compare this with Chapt. 5.43 <hi>I am come in my Father's Name, and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Me not: if another ſhall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi>

            <p>One while theſe are ſome of the beſt of Books; after a while theſe are rejected, are nigh unto Curſing and their End is to be <hi>Burned.</hi> Nor can the departed Spirits of their
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005295_0018_1016F481AD6D3A08"/>Authors be found (by the Extenſive Charity of theſe right Catholick men) any where but in the devouring Flames of Hell: and becauſe (as they think the Smoke of their Torment will aſcend up for ever and ever, they can ſing Hallelujahs ou this Joyful Occaſion: <hi>So Pityful, Tender-hearted and full of Compaſſion are theſe dear Children and diſtinguiſh'd Saints.</hi> —</p>
            <p>One while this is the beſt and the only true Form of Worſhip &amp; Church-Diſcipline; the only likely Method to promote Religion, to further Awakenings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By &amp; by this Scheme is diſlik'd, cry'd down, laid aſide and ſuperſeded by another that is bran-new. Thus moveable are their ways that you cannot know them. Perhaps a Hare does not oftener alter her courſe, interchange ground, turn ſhort about, wind &amp; twiſt, than ſome of theſe change their Faith and Practice. They are like Children toſſed to &amp; fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, and led aſide by the cunning Craftineſs of them that lie in wait to deceive. Like a ſilly Dove wandring from Mountain to Valley, ſeeking reſt but finding none to their unſettled &amp; wavering Minds. Like Ephraim of old <hi>feeding on the wind, and following after the Eaſt wind.</hi> Their goodneſs is as a morning Cloud and early Dew, it goeth away, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4.</p>
            <p>This is to be <hi>given</hi> to Change. —</p>

So thoſe men that wickedly forſake God &amp; break his Laws, are ſaid to <hi>change their God, Jer.</hi> 2 11 And to change GOD's Judgments &amp; Ordinances Iſa. 24 5 <hi>The Earth alſo is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, changed the Ordinances and broken the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> See alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5 5, 6. — So they did in the Prophet Elijah's day, <hi>The children of Iſrael</hi> (ſays he) <hi>have forſaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars and ſlaem thy Prophets with the ſword.</hi> So in the time of the Prophet Hoſea; <hi>My people</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ask Counſel at their Stocks, and their Staff declareth unto them; for the ſpirit of Whoridom, hath cauſed them to Err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God:</hi> They Sacrifice (not in the Place that God had choſen and appointed for this purpoſe) No, but upon the tops of the Mountains, and burn Incenſe upon the Hills, under Oaks and Poplars and Elms, becauſe the ſhadow thereof is good Their Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy'd Lies in God's Name, and the People lov'd to have in ſo.

            <p>Thus did they gad about to change their way; like a common Proſtitute whoſe Love is never fix'd, but ſomtimes ſet on this, ſomtimes on that Paramour; playing the Harlot with many Lovers. And are there none at the <hi>preſent Day</hi> who might here behold their Face &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Features as in a Glaſs?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>This ſort of Men are likewiſe given to Change with reference to Civil Affairs.</hi> In conſequence of this <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or dizzineſs in the Head, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability, fickleneſs &amp; variation in Opinion and Judgment, they are ever &amp; anon for change of Government, and thence are raiſing a Duſt, making a Buſtle, and endeavouring to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the Government; to turn things <hi>topſy turvy</hi> and bring all into Confuſion. —</p>

One while they are for this Model &amp; Form of civil Government, another while for that, &amp; oftner for none at all. Thoſe men they eſteem the beſt Qualified for Rulers (and accordingly will Vote for them) who are moſt like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, viz. <hi>given to Change:</hi> well knowing that ſuch are moſt likely to abett &amp; encourage, or at leaſt to connive at their Fluctuating &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Principles &amp; Practiſes.

            <p>We have a flagrant Inſtance of this being given to Change, with regard to State affairs, in the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their being ſo ſet for a new Form of Government, even, while good old <hi>Samuel</hi> their chief Judge was yet living: And that notwithſtanding they were Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed what the bad Conſequence of ſuch a Change as they inſiſted on would be, what would be the manner of their King, — how

            <p>Lo, theſe are a part of their ways.</p>
            <p>But I muſt paſs on,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew, <hi>That theſe men are not to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with.</hi> To make way for which, it may not be amiſs of we take ſome brief Notice of what is implied in this Caution, — <hi>And meddle not with them that are give to Change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the Original, it is, <hi>Mix not thy ſelf with them, —" i. e.</hi> Either in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels "and Practiſes, or in familiar Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Pool</hi> in locum.</note> But there is moreover a Mioſis in the words, more imply'd &amp; intended than is expreſs'd. 'Tis not enough that we mix not our ſelves with them in their Counſels and Practiſes, but we muſt uſe all lawful Methods and Endeavours that the Counſel of theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hithophels,</hi> theſe Changlings, may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fooliſhneſs, that their Devices may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005295_0023_1016F48F537C72F8"/>that they may be taken in their own Craftineſs, that their Counſel may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried headlong, and that their hands may not perform their Enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>When we plainly ſee them attempting to introduce a Change, whether in Church or State, or both; a Change which is likely to be ſubverſive of and deſtructive to our moſt dear and valuable Intereſts: When we hear them ſay one to another, <hi>Raſe it, raſe it, even to the Foundation thereof!</hi> Does it not concern us to Counter-act them, and do what we can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the growing &amp; important Miſchief?</p>
            <p>When they that are given to Change, are opening a wide and perillous Door for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of <hi>Enthuſiaſtical Impulſes, Trances, Viſions &amp; Revelation, Antinomian &amp; Familiſtical Hereſy,</hi> and the like; and what loudly threatens a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to all the peaceable Order in a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when the moſt barefac'd Contempt is caſt upon Authority both Civil &amp; Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical; in this caſe Neutrality ſeems hardly ſufficient. Eph 5.10. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> 'Tis doubtleſs beſt that ſuch <hi>Grapes of Sodom &amp; Cluſters of Gomorrha</hi> be nipp'd in the Bud, that the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> be cruſh'd in the Egg. The way to do which (one would think) is not to ſit ſtill and do nothing: Prov. 22.3
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005295_0024_1016F490D83C3558"/>
               <hi>A prudent man foreſeeth the Evil and hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the ſimple paſs on and are puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed we now to make it our, that men given to Change are not to be meddled with. And this may appear in the light of theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The meddling with men of this Character is expreſly Forbidden by the Holy Ghoſt in this and implicitly in ſundry other Texts of Scripture: Particularly where we are Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd not to be <hi>Partakers of other mens Sins; To withdraw from them that walk Diſorderly; To mark them that cauſe Diviſions and avoid them.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their being oppos'd in the Text to ſuch as Fear GOD and the King, plainly intimates that they are men of no Religion, men void of Piety and Loyalty; and therefore they are not to be meddl'd with.</p>
            <p>The mixing our ſelves with them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Coverſation, but eſpecially in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is unprofitable, yea, 'tis hurtful: <hi>For their Heart ſtudieth Deſtruction and their Lips talk of Miſchief,</hi> Prov. 24.2. Hence Job could ſay, Chap. 21.16. <hi>The Counſel of the wicked is far from me.</hi> He that walketh with the wiſe ſhall be wiſe; but a companion of fools ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And perſons that Fear not GOD neither regard men cloath'd with Authority,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005295_0025_1016F4938B03C360"/>muſt needs be unqualify'd and unfit to ſuſtain any publick Poſt either in the Church or in the State. <hi>Shall even he that hateth right, govern?</hi> Job 34.17. So that they are to be let alone and not meddl'd with in this reſpect. If they that are given to Change are men that fear not GOD nor the King, what profit can we expect to reap from intermeddling or mixing our ſelves with them in their Counſels and Practiſes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O may Soul, come not thou into their Secret!</hi> It was David'<hi>s</hi> honour and happineſs that he could Appeal to Almighty GOD and profeſs, <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</hi> And again, <hi>I have not ſat with Vain Perſons, neither will I go in with Diſſemblers: I hate the congregation of Evil doers and will not ſit with the Wicked.</hi> So Jeremiah, Chap. 15.17. <hi>I ſat not in the Aſſembly of the Mockers, nor rejoiced.— Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the Counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of Sinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the Scornful.

'Tis true, theſe are in their own Opinion, the only Lights of the World, burning and ſhining Lights: But as the Moon is known to be an Opake Body, void of innate Light, by its frequent Lunations &amp; Changes; ſo their being given to Change, is Evidential that the Light which is in them is Darkneſs, yea, 'tis Darkneſs that may be felt: 1 Joh 2 9 <hi>He that ſaith he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, is in Darkneſs even until now.

So what a Tumult and Rout was caus'd in the State by Abſalom (a Seditious Villain) and thoſe that Tagg'd after him?

And know it, GOD will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in Vain. That add to their other Crimes, the moſt hainous, aggravated and dreadful Sin of Perjury.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I Counſel thee to keep the King's Commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of GOD. My Son, Fear thou the LORD,

Meddle not with a double-minded man, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, who is Unſtable in all his ways; whoſe Counſels, Purpoſes, Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are a Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Inconſiſtances.

They delight in Lies; they bleſs with their Mouth, but they Curſe inwardly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.4 He hath put forth his hands againſt ſuch as be at peace with him: he hath broken his Covenant. The words of his Mouth were ſmoother than butter; but War was in his heart: his Words were ſofter than oyl, yet were they drawn Swords, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55 20, 21. Their Tongue is as an Arrow ſhot out, it ſpeaketh deceit: One ſpeaketh peaceably to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait, <hi>Jer.</hi> 98.
