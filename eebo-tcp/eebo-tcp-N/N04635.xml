            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no Question whatsoever, that is of greater Importance to Mankind, and that it more concerns every individual Person to be well resolved in, than this, <hi>What are the distinguishing Qualifications of those that are in Favour with God, and entitled to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rewards?</hi> Or, which comes to the same Thing, <hi>What is the Nature of true Religion? and wherein do lie the distinguishing Notes of that Vertue and Holiness, that is acceptable in the Sight of God.</hi> But tho' it be of such Importance, and tho' we have clear and abundant Light in the Word of God to direct us in this Matter, yet there is no one Point, wherein professing Christians do more differ one from another. It would be endless to reckon up the Variety of Opinions in this Point, that divide the christian World; making manifest the Truth of that of our Saviour, <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leads to Life, and few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Consideration of these Things has long engaged me to attend to this Matter, with the utmost Diligence and Care, and Exactness of Search and Enquiry, that I have been capable of: It is a Subject on which my Mind has been peculiarly intent, ever since I first entred on the Study of Divinity.—But as to the Success of my Enquiries, it must be left to the Judgment of the Reader of the following Treatise.</p>
            <p>I am sensible it is much more difficult to judge impartially of that which is the Subject of this Discourse, in the midst of the Dust and Smoke of such a State of Controversy, as this Land is now in, about Things of this Nature: As it is more difficult to write impartially, so
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:005767_0004_1027047EC8D6AA30"/>
it is more difficult to read impartially.—Many will probably be hurt in their Spirits, to find so much that appertains to religious Affection, here condemned: And perhaps Indignation and Contempt will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in others, by finding so much here justified and approved. And it may be, some will be ready to charge me with Inconsistence with my self, in so much approving some Things, and so much condemning others; as I have found, this has always been objected to me by some, ever since the Beginning of our late Controversies about Religion. 'Tis a hard Thing to be a hearty zealous Friend of what has been <hi>good</hi> and glorious, in the late extraordinary Appearances, and to rejoice much in it; and at the same Time, to see the evil and pernicious Tendency of what has been <hi>bad,</hi> and earnestly to oppose that. But yet, I am <hi>humbly,</hi> but <hi>fully</hi> perswaded, we shall never be in the Way of Truth, nor go on in a Way acceptable to God, and tending to the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, 'till we do so. There is indeed something very mysterious in it, that so much Good, and so much Bad, should be mix'd together in the <hi>Church of God:</hi> As 'tis a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thing, and what has puzzled and amazed many a good Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that there should be that which is so divine and precious, as the saving Grace of God, and the new and divine Nature, dwelling in the same Heart, with so much Corruption, Hypocrisy and Iniquity, in <hi>a particular Saint.</hi> Yet neither of these, is more mysterious than real. And neither of 'em is a new or rare Thing. 'Tis no new Thing, that much false Religion should prevail, at a Time of great reviving of true Religion; and that at such a Time, Multitudes of Hypocrites should spring up among true Saints. It was so in that great Reformation, and Revival of Religion, that was in <hi>Josiah'</hi>s Time; as appears by <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 10. and 4. 3, 4. and also by the great Apostacy that there was in the Land, so soon after his Reign. So it was in that great Out-pouring of the Spirit upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> that was in the Days of <hi>John the Baptist;</hi> as appears by the great Apostacy of that People, so soon after so general an Awakening, and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary religious Comforts and Joys of many; John 5. 35. <hi>Ye were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for a Season, to rejoice in his Light.</hi> So it was in those great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions that were among the Multitude, occasion'd by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jesus Christ: <hi>Of the many that were then called, but few were chosen;</hi> of the Multitude that were roused and affected by his Preaching, and at one Time or other appeared mightily engaged, full of Admiration of Christ, and elevated with Joy, but few were true Disciples, that stood the Shock of the great Trials that came afterwards, and endured to the End: Many were like the stony Ground, or thorny Ground; and but few, comparatively, like the good Ground: Of the whole Heap that was gathered, great Part was Chaff, that the Wind afterwards drove away; and the Heap of Wheat that was left, was comparatively small; as appears abundantly, by the History of
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:005767_0005_10270481DF5C2ED8"/>
the new Testament. So it was in that great Out-pouring of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was in the Apostle's Days; as appears by <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. and 4. 11, 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. and 3. 18, 19. And the two Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and many other Parts of the new Testament. And so it was in the great <hi>Reformation</hi> from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.—It appears plainly to have been in the visible Church of God, in Times of great reviving of Religion, from Time to Time, as it is with the Fruit Trees in the Spring; there are a Multitude of Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms; all which appear fair and beautiful, and there is a promising Appearance of young Fruits; but many of 'em are but of short Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, they soon fall off, and never come to Maturity.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> For tho' there never will, in this World, be an entire Purity; either in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Saints, in a perfect Freedom from Mixtures of Corruption; or in the Church of God, without any Mixture of Hypocrites with Saints, and counterfeit Religion, and false Appearances of Grace, with true Religion and real Holiness: Yet, 'tis evident, that there will come a Time of much greater Purity in the Church of God, than has been in Ages past: it is plain by those Texts of Scripture. <hi>Isai.</hi> 52. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 6, 7, 9. <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 32, 35, 36. <hi>Isai.</hi> 35. 8, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 38. <hi>Psal.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. And one great Reason of it will be, that at that Time, God will give much greater Light to his People, to distinguish between true Religion and its Counterfeits; Mal. 3. 3. <hi>And he shall sit as a Refiner, and Purifier of Silver; and he shall purify the Sons of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis by the Mixture of counterfeit Religion with true, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and distinguished, that the Devil has had his greatest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against the Cause and Kingdom of Christ, all along, hitherto. 'Tis plainly by this Means, principally, that he has prevail'd against all Revivings of Religion, that ever have been, since the first founding of the christian Church. By this, he hurt the Cause of Christianity, in, and after the apostolic Age, much more than by all the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens: The Apostles, in all their Epistles, shew themselves much more concerned at the former Mischief, than the latter. By this, <hi>Satan</hi> prevail'd against the Reformation, begun by <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> &amp;c. to put a Stop to its Progress, and bring it into Disgrace; ten Times more, than by all those bloody, cruel, and before, unheard of Persecutions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> By
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005767_0006_10270484B6B3E800"/>
this principally, has he prevail'd against Revivals of Religion, that have been in our Nation since the Reformation. By this he prevail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>New-England,</hi> to quench the Love, and spoil the Joy of her Espousals, about an hundred Years ago. And I think, I have had Opportunity enough to see plainly, that by this, the Devil has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd against the late, great Revival of Religion in <hi>New-England,</hi> so happy and promising in its Beginning: Here most evidently has been the main Advantage <hi>Satan</hi> has had against us; by this he has foil'd us; 'tis by this Means, that the Daughter of Zion in this Land, now lies on the Ground, in such piteous Circumstances, as we now behold her; with her Garments rent, her Face disfigur'd, her Nakedness expos'd, her Limbs broken, and weltring in the Blood of her own Wounds, and in no wise able to arise; and this, so quickly after her late great Joys and Hopes. Lam. 1. 17. Zion <hi>

               </hi> thro' his Subtilty, by perverting us from the Simplicity that is in Christ, hath suddenly prevail'd to deprive us of that fair Prospect, we had a little while ago, of a Kind of paradisaic State of the Church of God in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Religion has revived in the Church of God, &amp; Enemies appear, People that are engaged to defend it's Cause, are commonly most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, where they are least sensible of Danger. While they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent upon the Opposition that appears openly before 'em, to make Head against that, and do neglect carefully to look all round 'em, the Devil comes behind 'em, and gives a fatal Stab unseen; and has Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to give a more home Stroke, and wound the deeper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he strikes at his Leisure, and according to his Pleasure, being obstructed by no Guard or Resistance.</p>
            <p>And so it is likely ever to be in the Church, whenever Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives remarkably, 'till we have learned well to distinguish between true and false Religion, between saving Affections and Experiences, and those manifold fair Shews, and glistering Appearances, by which they are counterfeited; the Consequences of which, when they are not distinguished, are often inexpressibly dreadful. <hi>By this Means,</hi> the Devil gratifies himself, by bringing it to pass, that That should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

to God, by Multitudes, under a Notion of a pleasing acceptable Sacrifice to him, that is indeed above all Things abominable to him. <hi>By this Means,</hi> he deceives great Multitudes about the State of their Souls; making them think they are something, when they are nothing; and so eternally undoes 'em: And not only so, but esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes many, in a strong Confidence of their eminent Holiness, who are in God's Sight, some of the vilest of Hypocrites. <hi>By this Means,</hi> he many Ways, damps and wounds Religion in the Hearts of the Saints, obscures and deforms it by corrupt Mixtures, causes their religious Affections wofully to degenerate, and sometimes for a considerable Time, to be like the <hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with earnest Forwardness and Zeal, and with all their Might. <hi>By this Means,</hi> he brings in, even the Friends of Religion, insensibly to themselves, to do the Work of Enemies, by destroying Religion, in a far more effectual Manner, than open Enemies can do, under a Notion of advancing it. <hi>By this Means</hi> the Devil scatters the Flock of Christ, and sets 'em one against another, and that with great Heat of Spirit, under a Notion of Zeal for God; and Religion by Degrees, degenerates into vain Jangling; and during the Strife, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> leads both Parties far out of the right Way, driving each to great Extremes, one on the right Hand, and the other on the Left, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he finds they are most inclined, or most easily moved and sway'd, 'till the right Path in the Middle, is almost wholly neglected. And in the midst of this Confusion, the Devil has great Opportunity to advance his own Interest, and make it strong in Ways innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and get the Government of all into his own Hands, and work his own Will. And by what is seen of the terrible Consequences of this counterfeit Religion, when not distinguished from true Religion, God's People in general have their Minds unhinged and unsettled, in Things of Religion, and know not where to set their Foot, or what to think or do; and many are brought into Doubts, whether there be any Thing at all in Religion; and Heresy, and Infidelity and Atheism greatly prevail.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it greatly concerns us to use our utmost Endeavours, clearly to discern, and have it well settled and established, wherein
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005767_0008_102704890A851998"/>
true Religion does consist. 'Till this be done, it may be expected that great Revivings of Religion, will be but of short Continuance: 'Till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be done, there is but little Good to be expected, of all our warm Debates, in Conversation and from the Press, not knowing clearly and distinctly, what we ought to contend for.</p>
            <p>My Design is to contribute my Mite, and use my best (however feeble) Endeavours to this End, in the ensuing Treatise: Wherein it must be noted, that my Design is somewhat diverse from the Design of what I have formerly published, which was to shew <hi>the distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God,</hi> including both his common, and saving Operations; but what I aim at now, is to shew the Nature and Signs of the <hi>gracious Operations</hi> of God's Spirit, by which they are to be distinguished from all Things whatsoever that the Minds of Men are the Subjects of, which are not of a saving Nature. If I have succeeded in this my Aim, in any tolerable Measure, I hope it will tend to promote the Interest of Religion. And whether I have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to bring any Light to this Subject, or no and however my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt may be reproach'd, in these captious, censorious Times, I hope in the Mercy of a gracious and righteous God, for the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Sincerity of my Endeavours, and hope also, for the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Prayers of the true Followers of the Meek and charitable Lamb of God.</p>

               <head>Whom having not seen, ye love: In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory.</head>
               <p>IN these Words, the Apostle represents the State of the Minds of the Christians he wrote to, under the Persecutions they were then the Subjects of. These Persecutions are what he has Respect to, in the two preceeding Verses, when he speaks of <hi>the Trial of their Faith,</hi> and of <hi>their being in Heaviness through manifold Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Trials are of threefold Benefit to true Religion: Hereby the Truth of it is manifested, and it appears to be indeed <hi>true Religion:</hi> They, above all other Things, have a Tendency to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true Religion and false, and to cause the Difference between them evidently to appear. Hence they are called by the Name of <hi>Trials,</hi> in the Verse nextly preceeding the Text, and in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other Places: They try the Faith and Religion of Professors, of what Sort it is, as apparent Gold is tried in the Fire, and manifested,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005767_0010_10270492E2F54B88"/>
whether it be true Gold or no. And the Faith of true Christians being thus tried and proved to be true, is <hi>found to Praise, and Honour, and Glory;</hi> as in that preceeding Verse.</p>
               <p>And then, These Trials are of further Benefit to true Religion; they not only manifest the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, but they make it's genuine <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Amiableness</hi> remarkably to appear. True Vertue never appears so lovely, as when it is most oppressed: And the divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of real Christianity, is never exhibited with such Advantage, as when under the greatest Trials: Then it is that true Faith appears much more precious than Gold; and upon this Account, is <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to Praise, and Honour, and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, Another Benefit that such Trials are of to true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is, that they purify and increase it. They not only manifest it to be true, but also tend to refine it, and deliver it from those Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that which is false, which incumber and impede it; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be left but that which is true. They tend to cause the Amiableness of true Religion to appear to the best Advantage, as was before observed; and not only so, but they tend to increase it's Beauty, by establishing and confirming it, and making it more lively and vigourous, and purifying it from those Things that obscured it's Lustre and Glory. As Gold that is tried in the Fire, is purged from it's Alloy, and all Remainders of Dross, and comes forth more solid and beautiful; so true Faith being tried as Gold is tried in the Fire, becomes more precious; and thus also is <hi>found unto Praise, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory.</hi> The Apostle seems to have Respect to each of these Benefits, that Persecutions are of to true Religion, in the Verse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Text.</p>
               <p>And in the Text, the Apostle observes how true Religion operated in the Christians he wrote to, under their Persecutions, whereby these Benefits of Persecution appeared in them; or what manner of Operation of true Religion, in them, it was, whereby their Religion, under Persecution, was manifested to be <hi>true</hi> Religion, and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared in the genuine <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Amiableness</hi> of true Religion, and also appeared to be <hi>increased</hi> and <hi>purified,</hi> and so was like to be <hi>found unto Praise, and Honour, and Glory, at the Appearing of Jesus Christ.</hi> And there were two Kinds of Operation, or Exercise of true Religion, in them, under their Sufferings, that the Apostle takes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in the Text, wherein these Benefits appeared.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Love to Christ; Whom having not seen, ye love.</hi> The World was ready to wonder, what strange Principle it was, that influenc'd them to expose themselves to so great Sufferings, to forsake the Things that were seen, and renounce all that was dear and pleasant, which was the Object of Sense: They seem'd to the Men of the World about them, as though they were beside themselves,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005767_0011_1027049488048D20"/>
and to act as tho' they hated themselves; there was nothing in their View, that could induce them thus to suffer, and support them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and carry them thro' such Trials. But altho' there was nothing that was seen, nothing that the World saw, or that the Christians themselves ever saw with their bodily Eyes, that thus influenced and supported 'em; yet they had a supernatural Principle of Love to something <hi>unseen;</hi> they loved Jesus Christ, for they saw him spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, whom the World saw not, and whom they themselves had never seen with bodily Eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Joy in Christ.</hi> Tho' their outward Sufferings were very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, yet their inward spiritual Joys were greater than their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and these supported them, and enabled them to suffer with Chearfulness.</p>
               <p>There are two Things which the Apostle takes Notice of in the Text concerning this Joy. 1. The Manner in which it rises, the Way in which Christ, tho' unseen, is the Foundation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> By Faith; which is the Evidence of Things not seen; <hi>In whom, though now ye see him not, yet</hi> beleiving, <hi>ye rejoice</hi>—2. The Nature of this Joy; <hi>unspeakable, and full of Glory. Unspeakable</hi> in the <hi>Kind</hi> of it; very different from worldly Joys, and carnal Delights; of a vastly more pure, sublime and heavenly Nature, being something superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and truly divine, and so ineffably excellent; the Sublimity, and exquisite Sweetness of which, there were no Words to set forth. Unspeakable also in <hi>Degree;</hi> it pleasing God to give 'em this holy Joy, with a liberal Hand, and in large Measure, in their State of Persecution.</p>
               <p>Their Joy was <hi>full of Glory:</hi> Altho' the Joy was unspeakable, and no Words were sufficient to describe it; yet something might be said of it, and no Words more fit to represent it's Excellency, than these, that it was <hi>full of Glory;</hi> or, as it is in the Original, <hi>glorified Joy.</hi> In rejoicing with this Joy, their Minds were filled, as it were, with a glorious Brightness, and their Natures exalted and perfected: It was a most worthy, noble Rejoicing, that did not corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base the Mind, as many carnal Joys do; but did greatly beautify and dignify it: It was a Prelibation of the Joy of Heaven, that raised their Minds to a Degree of heavenly Blessedness: It fill'd their Minds with the Light of God's Glory, and made 'em themselves to shine with some Communication of that Glory.</p>
               <p>Hence the Proposition or Doctrine, that I would raise from these Words is this,</p>
               <p>DOCT. <hi>True Religion, in great Part, consists in holy Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We see that the Apostle, in observing and remarking the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Exercises of Religion, in the Christians he wrote to, wherein
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005767_0012_10270497D0537950"/>
their Religion appeared to be true and of the right Kind, when it had it's greatest Trial of what Sort it was, being tried by Persecution as Gold is tried in the Fire, and when their Religion not only proved true, but was more pure, and cleansed from it's Dross and Mixtures of that which was not true, and when Religion appeared in them most in it's genuine Excellency and native Beauty, and was found to Praise, and Honour, and Glory; be singles out the religious Affections of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> that were then in exercise in them: These are the Exercises of Religion he takes Notice of, wherein their Religion did thus appear true and pure, and in it's proper Glory.</p>
               <p>Here I would,</p>
               <p>I. Shew what is intended by the <hi>Affections,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Observe some Things which make it evident, that a great Part of true Religion lies in the Affections.</p>
               <p>I. It may be enquired, what the Affections of the Mind are?</p>
               <p>I answer, The Affections are no other, than the more vigorous and sensible Exercises of the Inclination and Will of the Soul.</p>
               <p>God has indued the Soul with two Faculties: One is that by which it is capable of Perception and Speculation, or by which it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns and views and judges of Things; which is called the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. The other Faculty is that by which the Soul don't meerly perceive and view. Things, but is some Way inclin'd with respect to the Things it views or considers; either is inclined <hi>to 'em,</hi> or is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined, and averse <hi>from 'em;</hi> or is the Faculty by which the Soul don't behold Things, as an indifferent unaffected Spectator, but either as liking or disliking, pleas'd or displeas'd, approving or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting. This Faculty is called by various Names: It is sometimes called the <hi>Inclination:</hi> And, as it has respect to the Actions that are determined and governed by it, is called the <hi>Will:</hi> And the Mind, with regard to the Exercises of this Faculty, is often called the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Exercises of this Faculty are of two Sorts; either those by which the Soul is carried out towards the Things that are in view, in <hi>approving</hi> of them, being pleased with them, and inclined to them; or those in which the Soul opposes the Things that are in view, in <hi>disapproving</hi> them, and in being displeased with them, averse from them, and rejecting them.</p>
               <p>And as the Exercises of the Inclination and Will of the Soul are various in their <hi>Kinds,</hi> so they are much more various in their <hi>Degrees.</hi> There are some Exercises of Pleasedness or Displeasedness, Inclination or Disinclination, wherein the Soul is carried but a little beyond a State of perfect Indifference. And there are other Degrees above this, wherein the Approbation or Dislike, Pleasedness or Aversion, are stronger; wherein we may rise higher and higher, 'till the Soul comes
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005767_0013_1027049A88B69B28"/>
to act vigorously and sensibly, and the Actings of the Soul are with that Strength that (thro' the Laws of the Union which the Creator has fix'd between Soul and Body) the Motion of the Blood and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits begins to be sensibly alter'd; whence oftentimes arises some bodily Sensation, especially about the Heart and Vitals, that are the Fountain of the Fluids of the Body: From whence it comes to pass, that the Mind, with regard to the Exercises of this Faculty, perhaps in all Nations and Ages, is called <hi>the Heart.</hi> And it is to be noted, that they are these more rigorous and sensible Exercises of this Faculty, that are called the <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Affections</hi> of the Soul, are not two Faculties; the Affections are not essentially distinct from the Will, nor do they differ from the meer Actings of the Will and Inclination of the Soul, but only in the Liveliness, and Sensibleness of Exercise.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed, that Language is here somewhat imperfect, and the Meaning of Words in a considerable Measure loose and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, and not precisely limited by Custom, which governs the Use of Language. In some Sense, the Affection of the Soul differs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all from the Will and Inclination, and the Will never is in any Exercise any further than it is <hi>affected;</hi> it is not moved out of a State of perfect Indifference, any otherwise than as it is <hi>affected</hi> one Way or other, and acts nothing voluntarily any further. But yet there are many Actings of the Will and Inclination, that are not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Affections:</hi> In every Thing we do, wherein we act voluntarily, there is an Exercise of the Will and Inclination, 'tis our Inclination that governs us in our Actions: But all the actings of the Inclination and Will, in all our common Actions of Life, are not ordinarily called Affections. Yet, what are commonly called Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not essentially different from them, but only in the Degree and Manner of Exercise. In every Act of the Will whatsoever, the Soul either likes or dislikes, is either inclined or disinclined to what is in view: These are not essentially different from those Affections of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred:</hi> That Liking or Inclination of the Soul to a Thing, if it be in a high Degree, and be vigorous and lively, is the very same Thing with the Affection of <hi>Love:</hi> And that Disliking and Disinclining, if in a great Degree, is the very same with <hi>Hatred.</hi> In every Act of the Will <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>towards</hi> something not present, the Soul is in some Degree inclined to that Thing; and that Inclination, if in a considerable Degree, is the very same with the Affection of <hi>Desire.</hi> And in every Degree of the Act of the Will, wherein the Soul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of something Present, there is a Degree of Pleasedness; and that Pleasedness, if it be in a considerable Degree, is the very same with the Affection of <hi>Joy</hi> or <hi>Delight.</hi> And if the Will disapproves of what is present, the Soul is in some Degree displeased, and if that Displeasedness be great, 'tis the very same with the Affection of <hi>Grief</hi> or <hi>Sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005767_0014_1027049D506CFC90"/>
Such seems to be our Nature, and such the Laws of the Union of Soul and Body, that there never is in any Case whatsoever, any lively and vigorous Exercise of the Will or Inclination of the Soul, without some Effect upon the Body, in some Alteration of the Motion of it's Fluids, and especially of the animal Spirits. And on the other Hand, from the same Laws of the Union of Soul and Body, the Constitution of the Body, and the Motion of it's Fluids, may promote the Exercise of the Affections. But yet, it is not the Body, but the Mind only, that is the proper Seat of the Affections. The Body of Man is no more capable of being really the Subject of Love or Hatred, Joy or Sorrow, Fear or Hope, than the Body of a Tree, or than the same Body of Man is capable of thinking and understanding. As 'tis the Soul only that has Ideas, so 'tis the Soul only that is pleased or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with it's Ideas. As 'tis the Soul only that thinks, so 'tis the Soul only that loves or hates, rejoices or is grieved at what it thinks of. Nor are these Motions of the animal Spirits, and Fluids of the Body, any thing properly belonging to the Nature of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; tho' they always accompany them, in the present State: but are only Effects or Concomitants of the Affections, that are entirely distinct from the Affections themselves, and no Way essential to them; so that an unbodied Spirit may be as capable of Love and Hatred, Joy or Sorrow, Hope or Fear, or other Affections, as one that is united to a Body.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> are frequently spoken of as the same; and yet, in the more common Use of Speech, there is in some Respect a Difference; and <hi>Affection</hi> is a Word, that in it's ordinary Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, seems to be something more extensive than <hi>Passion;</hi> being used for all vigorous lively Actings of the Will or Inclination; but Passion for those that are more sudden, and whose Effects on the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits are more violent, and the Mind more overpower'd, and less in its own Command.</p>
               <p>As all the Exercises of the Inclination and Will, are either in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and liking, or disapproving and rejecting; so the Affections are of two Sorts; they are those by which the Soul is carried out to what is in view, cleaving <hi>to</hi> it, or <hi>seeking</hi> it; or those by which it is averse <hi>from</hi> it, and <hi>opposes</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Of the former Sort are <hi>Love, Desire, Hope, Joy, Gratitude, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence.</hi> Of the latter Kind, are <hi>Hatred, Fear, Anger, Grief,</hi> and such like; which it is needless now to stand particularly to define.</p>
               <p>And there are some Affections wherein there is a Composition of each of the aforementioned Kinds of Actings of the Will; as in the Affection of <hi>Pity,</hi> there is something of the <hi>former Kind,</hi> towards the Person suffering, and something of the <hi>Latter;</hi> towards what he suffers. And so in <hi>Zeal,</hi> there is in it high <hi>Approbotion</hi> of some Person or Thing, together with vigorous <hi>Opposition</hi> to what is conceived to be contrary to it.</p>

               <p>That Religion which God requires, and will accept, don't consist in weak, dull and lifeless Wouldings, raising us but a little above a State of Indifference: God, in his Word, greatly insists upon it, that we be in good Earnest, <hi>servent is Spirit,</hi> and our Hearts vigorously engaged in Religion: Rom. 12. 11. <hi>Be ye servent in Spirit, serving the Lord.</hi> Deut. 12. 12. <hi>And new</hi> Israel, <hi>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his Ways, and is love him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>If we ben't in good earnest in Religion, and our Wills and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ben't strongly exercised, we are nothing. The Things of Religion are so great, that there can be no Suitableness in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of our Hearts, to their Nature and Importance, unless they be lively and powerful. In nothing, is Vigour in the Actings of our Inclinations so requisite, as in Religion; and in nothing is Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so odious. True Religion is evermore a powerful Thing; and the Power of it appears, in the first Place, in the inward Exercises of it in the Heart, where is the principal and original Seat of it. Hence true Religion is called the <hi>Power of Godliness,</hi> in Distinction from the external Appearances of it, that are <hi>the Form</hi> of it, 2 Tim. 3. 5. <hi>Having a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power of it.</hi> The Spirit of God, in those that have sound and solid Religion, is a Spirit of powerful holy Affection; and therefore, God is said <hi>to have given them the Spirit of Power, and of Love, and of a sound Mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. And such, when they receive the Spirit of God, in his sanctifying
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005767_0016_102704A213FC5158"/>
and saving Influences, are said to be <hi>baptized with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire;</hi> by reason of the Power and Fervour of those Exercises the Spirit of God excites in their Hearts, whereby their Hearts, when Grace is in exercise, may be said to <hi>burn within them;</hi> as is said of the Disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32.</p>
               <p>The Business of Religion is, from Time to Time, compared to those Exercises, wherein Men are wont to have their Hearts and Strength greatly exercised and engaged; such as Running, Wrestling or Agonizing for a great Prize or Crown, and Fighting with strong Enemies that seek our Lives, and Warring as those that by Violence take a City or Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And tho' true Grace has various Degrees, and there are some that are but Babes in Christ, in whom the Exercise of the Inclination and Will towards divine and heavenly Things, is comparatively weak; yet every one that has the Power of Godliness in his Heart, has his Inclinations and Heart exercised towards God and divine Things, with such Strength and Vigour, that these holy Exercises do prevail in him above all carnal or natural Affections, and are effectual to overcome them: For every true Disciple of Christ, <hi>loves him above Father or Mother, Wife and Children, Brethren and Sisters, Houses and Lands; yea, than his own Life.</hi> From hence it follows, that wherever true Religion is, there are vigorous Exercises of the Inclination and Will, towards divine Objects: But by what was said before, the vigorous, lively and sensible Exercises of the Will, are no other than the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Author of the human Nature has not only given Affections to Men, but has made 'em very much the Spring of Men's Actions. As the Affections do not only necessarily belong to the human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but are a very great Part of it; so (inasmuch as by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Persons are renewed in the whole Man, and sanctified thro' out) holy Affections do not only necessarily belong to true Religion, but are a very great Part of that. And as true Religion is of a practical Nature, and God hath so constituted the human Nature, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are very much the Spring of Men's Actions, this also shews, that true Religion must consist very much in the Affections.</p>
               <p>Such is Man's Nature, that he is very unactive, any otherwise than he is influenc'd by some Affection, either <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred, Desire, Hope, Fear</hi> or some other. These Affections we see to be the Springs that set Men a going, in all the Affairs of Life, and engage them in all their Pursuits: These are the Things that put Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and carry 'em along, in all their worldly Business; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are Men excited and animated by these, in all Affairs, wherein they are earnestly engaged, and which they pursue with Vigour. We see the World of Mankind to be exceeding busy and active;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005767_0017_102704A66C8391A0"/>
and the Affections of Men are the Springs of the Motion: Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> all <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> all <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eal</hi> and affectionate <hi>Desire,</hi> and the World would be, in a great Measure, motionless and dead; there would be no such Thing as Activity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Mankind, or any earnest Pursuit whatsoever. 'Tis Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that engages the covetous Man, and him that is greedy of worldly Profits, in his Pursuits; and it is by the Affections, that the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Man is put forward in his Pursuit of wordly Glory; and 'tis the Affections also that actuate the voluptuous Man, in his Pursuit of Pleasure and sensual Delights: The World continues, from Age to Age, in a continual Commotion and Agitation, in a Pursuit of these Things; but take away all Affection, and the Spring of all this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be gone, and the Motion it self would cease. And as in worldly Things, worldly Affections are very much the Spring of Mens Motion and Action; so in religious Matters, the Spring of their Actions are very much religious Affections: He that has doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal Knowledge and Speculation only, without Affection, never is engaged in the Business of Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nothing is more manifest <hi>in Fact,</hi> than that the Things of Religion take hold of Men's Souls, no further than they <hi>affect</hi> them. There are Multitudes that often hear the Word of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hear of those Things that are infinitely great and important, and that most nearly concern them, and all that is heard seems to be wholly ineffectual upon them, and to make no Alteration in their Disposition or Behaviour; and the Reason is, they are not affected with what they hear. There are many that often hear of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perfections of God, his almighty Power, and boundless Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his infinite Majesty, and that Holiness of God, by which he is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and cannot look on Iniquity, and the Heavens are not pure in his Sight, and of God's infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy, and hear of the great Works of God's Wisdom, Power and Goodness, wherein there appear the admirable Manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of these Perfections; they hear particularly of the unspeakable Love of God and Christ, and of the great Things that Christ has done and suffer'd, and of the great Things of another World, of eternal Misery, in bearing the Fierceness and Wrath of almighty God, and of endless Blessedness and Glory in the Presence of God, and the Enjoyment of his dear Love; they also hear the peremptory Commands of God, and his gracious Counsels and Warnings, and the sweet Invitations of the Gospel; I say, they often hear these Things, and yet remain as they were before, with no sensible Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on them, either in Heart or Practice, because they are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what they hear; and never will be so 'till they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. I am bold to assert, that there never was any considerable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005767_0018_102704A921C0ABB8"/>
Change wrought in the Mind or Conversation of any one Person, by anything of a religious Nature, that ever he read, heard or saw, that had not his Affections mov'd. Never was a natural Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged earnestly to seek his Salvation: Never were any such brought to cry after Wisdom, and lift up their Voice for Understanding, and to wrestle with God in Prayer for Mercy; and never was one humbled, and bro't to the Foot of God, from any thing that ever he heard or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd of his own Unworthiness and Deservings of God's Displeasure; nor was ever one induced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y for Refuge unto Christ, while his Heart remain'd unaffected. Nor was there ever a Saint awakened out of a cold, lifeless Frame, or recovered from a declining State in Religion, and brought back from a lamentable Departure from God, without having his Heart affected. And in a Word, there never was any Thing considerable brought to pass in the Heart or Life of any Man living, by the Things of Religion, that had not his Heart deeply affected by those Things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The holy Scriptures do every where place Religion very much in the Affections; such as Fear, Hope, Love, Hatred, Desire, Joy, Sorrow, Gratitude, Compassion and Zeal.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures place much of Religion in godly <hi>Fear;</hi> insomuch that 'tis often spoken of as the Character of those that are truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Persons, that <hi>they tremble at God's Word,</hi> that they <hi>fear before him,</hi> that <hi>their Flesh trembles for Fear of him,</hi> and that <hi>they are afraid of his Judgments,</hi> that <hi>his Excellency makes them afraid, and his Dread falls upon them;</hi> and the like: And a compellation commonly given the Saints in Scripture, is, <hi>Fearers of God,</hi> or <hi>they that fear the Lord.</hi> And because the Fear of God is a great Part of true Godliness, hence true Godliness in general, is very commonly called by the Name of <hi>the Fear of God;</hi> as every one knows, that knows any thing of the Bible.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Hope</hi> in God and in the Promises of his Word, is often spoken of in the Scripture, as a very considerable Part of true Religion. 'Tis mention'd as one of the three great Things of which Religion consists, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. Hope in the Lord is also frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the Character of the Saints: Psal. 146. 5. <hi>Happy is he that hath the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>for his Help, whose Hope is in the Lord his God.</hi> Jer. 17. 7. <hi>Blessed is the Man that trusteth in the Lord, whose Hope the Lord is.</hi> Psal. 31. 24. <hi>Be of good Courage, and he shall strengthen your Heart, all ye that Hope in the Lord.</hi> And the like in many other Places. Religious Fear and Hope are, once and again, joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as jointly constituting the Character of the true Saints. Psal. 33. 18. <hi>Behold the Eye of the Lord is upon them that</hi> Fear <hi>him, upon them that</hi> Hope <hi>in his Mercy.</hi> Psal. 147. 11. <hi>The Lord taketh Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them that</hi> Fear <hi>him, in those that</hi> Hope <hi>in his Mercy.</hi> Hope is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005767_0019_102704AC09C1DD20"/>
so great a Part of true Religion, that the Apostle says we are <hi>saved by Hope.</hi> Rom 8. 24. And this is spoken of as the Helmet of the Christian Soldier. 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Scriptures place Religion very much in the Affection of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Love to God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and Love to the People of God, and to Mankind. The Texts in which this is manifest, both in the Old Testament, and New, are innumerable. But of this more afterwards.</p>
               <p>The contrary Affection of <hi>Hatred</hi> also, as having Sin for its Object, is spoken of in Scripture, as no inconsiderable Part of true Religion. It is spoken of as that by which true Religion may be known and distinguished, Prov. 8. 13. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to hate Evil.</hi> And accordingly the Saints are called upon to give Evidence of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity by this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

which renders or denotes a Man truly blessed, in the Beginning of Christ's Sermon on the Mount, Matth. 5. 6. <hi>Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after Righteousness, for they shall be filled.</hi> And this holy Thirst is spoken of, as a great Thing in the Condition of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Blessings of eternal Life, Rev. 21. 6. <hi>I will give unto him that is athirst, of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures speak of holy <hi>Joy,</hi> as a great Part of true Religion. So is it represented in the Text. And as an important Part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is often exhorted to, and press'd, with great Earnestness; Psal. 37. 4. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of thine Heart.</hi> Psal. 97. 12. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord, ye Righteous.</hi> So Psal. 33. 1. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord, O ye Righteous.</hi> Matth. 5. 12. <hi>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad.</hi> Phil. 3. 1. <hi>Finally Brethren, rejoice in the Lord.</hi> And Chap. 4. 4. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say rejoice.</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 16. <hi>Rejoice evermore.</hi> Psal. 149. 2. <hi>Let</hi> Israel <hi>rejoice in him that made him; let the Children of</hi> Zion <hi>be joyful in their King.</hi> This is mention'd among the principal Fruits of the Spirit of Grace, Gal. 5. 22. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy,</hi> &amp;c.—The Psalmist mentions his holy Joy, as an Evidence of his Sincerity, Psal. 110. 14. <hi>I have rejoiced in the Way of thy Testimonies, as much as in all Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Religious <hi>Sorrow,</hi> Mourning, and Brokenness of Heart, are also frequently spoken of as a great Part of true Religion. These Things are often mentioned as distinguishing Qualities of the true Saints, and a great Part of their Character; Matth 5. 4. <hi>Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.</hi> Psal. 34. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken Heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite Spirit.</hi> Isai. 61. 1, 2. <hi>The Lord hath anointed me—to bind up the Broken-hearted,—to comfort all that mourn.</hi> This godly Sorrow, and Brokenness of Heart is often spoken of, not only, as a great Thing in the distinguishing Character of the Saints, but that in them, which is peculiarly acceptable and pleasing to God; Psal. 51. 17. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of God are a broken Spirit; a broken and a contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> Isai. 57. 15. <hi>Thus faith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him also that is of a humble and contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones.</hi> Chap. 66. 2. <hi>To this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Affection often mentioned, as that in the Exercise of which much of true Religion appears, is <hi>Gratitude;</hi> especially as exercised in Thankfulness and Praise to God. This being so much spoken of in the Book of Psalms, and other Parts of the holy Scriptures, I need not mention particular Texts.</p>

               <p>I have mentioned but a few Texts, out of an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all over the Scripture, which place Religion very much in the Affections. But what has been observed, may be sufficient to shew that they who would deny that much of true Religion lies in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and maintain the Contrary, must throw away what we have been wont to own for our Bible, and get some other Rule, by which to judge of the Nature of Religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Scriptures do represent true Religion, as being summarily comprehended in <hi>Love,</hi> the Chief of the Affections, and Fountain of all other Affections.</p>
               <p>So our blessed Saviour represents the Matter, in answer to the Lawyer, who asked him, which was the great Commandment of the Law. Matth. 22. 37, 38, 39, 40. <hi>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and

                  </gap> the Duty prescribed, and the Religion taught in the Law and the Prophets. And the Apostle <hi>Part</hi> does from Time to Time make the same Representation of the Matter; as in Poem. 13. 8. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in 1 Tim. 1. 5. <hi>Now the End of the Commandment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of a pure Heart,</hi> &amp;c. So the same Apostle speaks of Love, as the greatest Thing in Religion, and as the Vitals. Essence and Soul of it; without which, the greatest Knowledge and Gifts, and the most glaring Profession, and every thing else which appertains to Religion, are vain and worthless; and represents it as the Fountain from whence proceeds all that is good, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. thro'out; for that which is there rendred <hi>charity,</hi> in the Original, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the proper English of which is <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now altho' it be true, that the Love thus spoken of, includes the whole of a sincerely benevolent Propensity of the Soul, towards God and Man; yet it may be considered, that it is evident from what has been before observed, that this Propensity or Inclination of the Soul, when in sensible and vigorous Exercise, becomes <hi>Affection,</hi> and is no other than affectionate Love. And surely it is such vigourous and servent Love which Christ speaks of, as the Sum of all Religion, when he speaks of Loving God with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Minds, and our Neighbour as ourselves, as the Sum of all that was taught and prescribed in the Law and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Indeed it cannot be supposed, when this Affection of Love is here, and in other Scriptures, spoken of as the Sum of all Religion, that hereby is meant the Act, exclusive of the Habit, or that the Exercise of the Understanding is excluded, which is implied in all reasonable Affection. But it is doubtless true, and evident from these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the <hi>Essence</hi> of all true Religion lies in holy Love; and that in this divine Affection, and an habitual Disposition to it, and that Light which is the Foundation of it, and those Things which are the Fruits of it, consists the <hi>Whole</hi> of Religion.</p>
               <p>From hence it clearly and certainly appears, that great Part of true Religion consists in the Affections. For Love is not only one of the Affections, but it is the first and chief of the Affections, and the Fountain of all the Affections. From <hi>Love</hi> arises <hi>Hatred</hi> of those Things which are contrary to what we love, or which oppose &amp; thwart us in those Things that we delight in: And from the various Exercises of Love and Hatred, according to the Circumstances of the Objects of these

               <p n="6">6. The Religion of the most eminent Saints we have an Account of in the Scripture, consisted much in holy <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall take particular Notice of three eminent Saints, which have express'd the Frame and Sentiments of their own Hearts, and so described their own Religion, and the Manner of their Intercourse with God, in the Writings which they have left us, that are a Part of the sacred Canon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Instance I shall take notice of, is <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Man after God's own Heart;</hi> who has given us a lively Portraiture of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the Book of <hi>Psalms.</hi> Those holy Songs of his, he has there left us, are nothing else but the Expressions and Breathings of devout and <hi>holy Affections;</hi> such as an humble and fervent <hi>Love</hi> to God, <hi>Admiration</hi> of his glorious Perfections and wonderful Works, earnest <hi>Desires,</hi> Thirstings and Pantings of Soul after God, <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in God, a sweet and melting <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God for his great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, an holy <hi>Exultation</hi> and Triumph of Soul in the Favour, Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and Faithfulness of God, his <hi>Love</hi> to, and <hi>Delight</hi> in the Saints the excellent of the Earth, his great <hi>Delight</hi> in the Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, his <hi>Grief</hi> for his own and others Sins, and his fervent <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, and against the Enemies of God and his Church. And these Expressions of holy Affection, which the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> are every where full of, are the more to our present Purpose, because those Psalms are not only the Expressions of the Religion of so eminent a Saint that God speaks of as so agreeable to his Mind; but were also, by the Direction of the Holy Ghost, penn'd for the Use of the Church of God in its publick Worship, not only in that Age, but in after Ages; as being fitted to express the Religion of all Saints, in all Ages, as well as the Religion of the Psalmist. And it is moreover to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that <hi>David,</hi> in the Book of Psalms, speaks not as a private Person, but as the <hi>Psalmist of Israel,</hi> as the subordinate Head of the Church of God, and Leader in their Worship and Praises; and in many of the Psalms, speaks in the Name of Christ, as personating him in these Breathings forth of holy Affection, and in many other Psalms, he speaks in the Name of the Church.</p>

               <p>The other Instance I shall mention, is of the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> that beloved Disciple, who was the nearest and dearest to his Master of any of the Twelve, and was by him admitted to the greatest Privileges of any of them: Being not only one of the three who were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be present with him in the Mount at his Transfiguration, and at the raising of <hi>Jai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005767_0026_102704BEF1223770"/>
It is evident by all his Writings, (as is generally observed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) that he was a Person remarkably full of Affection: His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to those whom he wrote to, being inexpressibly tender and pathetical, breathing nothing but the most fervent Love; as tho' he were all made up of sweet and holy Affection. The Proofs of which can't be given without Disadvantage, unless we should transcribe his whole Writings.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He whom God sent into the World, to be the Light of the World, and Head of the whole Church, and the perfect Example of true Religion and Vertue, for the Imitation of all, the Shepherd whom the whole Flock should follow wherever he goes, even the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, was a Person who was remarkably of a tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Heart; and his Vertue was express'd very much in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of holy Affections. He was the greatest Instance of Ardency, Vigour and Strength of <hi>Love,</hi> to both God and Man, that ever was. It was these Affections which got the Victory, in that mighty Struggle and Conflict of his Affections, in his Agonies, when <hi>he prayed more earnestly, and offered strong Crying and Tears,</hi> and wrestled in Tears and in Blood. Such was the Power of the Exercises of his holy Love, that they were stronger than Death, and in that great Struggle, overcame those strong Exercises of the natural Affections of Fear and Grief, when he was sore amazed, and his Soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death. And he also appear'd to be full of Affection, in the Course of his Life. We read of his great <hi>Zeal,</hi> fulfilling that in the 69th Psalm, <hi>The Zeal of thine House hath eaten me up,</hi> John 2. 17. We read of his <hi>Grief</hi> for the Sins of Men, Mark 3. 5. <hi>He looked round about on them with Anger, being grieved for the Hardness of their Hearts.</hi> And his breaking forth in Tears and Exclamations, from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Sin and Misery of ungodly Men, and on the Sight of the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was full of such Inhabitants, Luke 19. 41, 42. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, saring, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy Day, the Things which belong unto thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> With Chap. 13. 34. <hi>O</hi> Jerusalem, Jerusalem, <hi>which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, How often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen doth gather her Brood under her Wings, and ye would not!</hi> We read of Christ's earnest <hi>Desire,</hi> Luke 22. 15. <hi>With Desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you, before I suffer.</hi> We often read of the Affection of <hi>Pity</hi> or <hi>Compassion</hi> in Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 32. and 18. 34. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 13. and of his <hi>being moved with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,</hi> Matth. 9. 36 and 14. 14. and <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 34. And how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did his Heart appear to be, on occasion of <hi>Mary'</hi>s and <hi>Martha'</hi>s Mourning for their Brother, and coming to him with their Complaints and Tears: Their Tears soon drew Tears from his Eyes: He was
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005767_0027_102704C2D57E0788"/>
affected with their Grief, and <hi>wept</hi> with them; tho' he knew their Sorrow should so soon be turned into Joy, by their Brother's being raised from the Dead; see <hi>John</hi> 11. And how ineffably affectionate was that last and dying Discourse, which Jesus had with his eleven Disciples the Evening before he was crucified? when he told them he was going away, and foretold them the great Difficulties and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they should meet with in the World, when he was gone; and comforted and counseled 'em, as his dear little Children, and bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them his holy Spirit, and therein his Peace, and his Comfort and Joy, as it were in his last Will and Testament, in the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Chapters of <hi>John;</hi> and concluded the Whole with that affectionate intercessory Prayer for them, and his whole Church, in Chap. 17. Of all the Discourses ever penn'd, or utter'd by the Mouth of any Man, this seems to be the most affectionate, and affecting.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Religion of Heaven consists very much in Affection.</p>
               <p>There is doubtless true Religion in Heaven, and true Religion in it's utmost Purity and Perfection. But according to the Scripture Representation of the heavenly State, the Religion of Heaven consists chiefly in holy and mighty <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and the Expression of these in most fervent and exalted Praises. So that the Religion of the Saints in Heaven, consists in the same Things with that Religion of the Saints on Earth, which is spoken of in our Text, viz.<hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory.</hi> Now it would be very foolish to pretend, that because the Saints in Heaven ben't united to Flesh and Blood, and have no animal Fluids to be moved, (through the Laws of Union of Soul and Body) with those great Emotions of their Souls, that therefore their exceeding Love and Joy are no Affections.—We are not speaking of the Affections of the Body, but of the Affections of the Soul, the chief of which are <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> When these are in the Soul, whether that be in the Body or out of it, the Soul is affected and moved. And when they are in the Soul, in that Strength in which they are in the Saints in Heaven, the Soul is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily affected and moved, or, which is the same Thing, has great Affections. 'Tis true, we don't experimentally know what Love and Joy are in a Soul out of a Body, or in a glorified Body; <hi>i. e.</hi> we han't had Experience of Love and Joy in a Soul in these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; but the Saints on Earth do know what divine Love and Joy in the Soul are &amp; they know what Love &amp; Joy are of the same Kind, with the Love and Joy which are in Heaven, in separate Souls there. The Love and Joy of the Saints on Earth, is the Beginning and Dawning of the Light, Life, and Blessedness of Heaven, and is like their Love and Joy there; or rather, the same in Nature, tho' not the same with it, or like to it, in Degree and Circumstances. This is
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005767_0028_102704C4890C92F8"/>
evident by many Scriptures, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 40, 47, 50, 51, 54, 58. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 'Tis unreasonable therefore to suppose, that the Love and Joy of the Saints in Heaven, not only differ in Degree and Circumstances, from the holy Love and Joy of the Saints on Earth, but is so entirely different in Nature, that they are no Affections; and meerly because they have no Blood and animal Spirits to be set in Motion by them, which Motion of the Blood and animal Spirits is not of the Essence of these Affections, in Men on the Earth, but the Effect of them; altho' by their Reaction they may make some circumstantial Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Sensation of the Mind. There is a Sensation of the Mind which loves and rejoices, that is antecedent to any Effects on the Fluids of the Body; and this Sensation of the Mind, therefore don't depend on these Motions in the Body, and so may be in the Soul without the Body. And wherever there are the Exercises of Love and Joy, there is that Sensation of the Mind, whether it be in the Body, or out; and that inward Sensation, or kind of spiritual Sense, or Feeling, and Motion of the Soul, is what is called Affection; The Soul when it thus feels, (if I may so say) and is thus moved, is said to be affected, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when this inward Sensation and Motion, are to a very high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as they are in the Saints in Heaven. If we can learn any thing of the State of Heaven from the Scripture, the Love and Joy that the Saints have there, is exceeding great and vigorous; impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Heart with the strongest and most lively Sensation, of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible Sweetness, mightily moving, animating, and engaging them, making them like to a Flame of Fire. And if such Love and Joy ben't Affections, then the Word <hi>Affection</hi> is of no Use in Language.—Will any say, that the Saints in Heaven, in beholding the Face of their Father, and the Glory of their Redeemer, and contemplating his wonderful Works, and particularly his laying down his Life for them, have their Hearts nothing moved and affected, by all which they behold or consider?</p>
               <p>Hence therefore the <hi>Religion of Heaven,</hi> consisting chiefly in holy Love and Joy, consists very much in Affection: And therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, <hi>true Religion</hi> consists very much in Affection. The Way to learn the true Nature of any Thing, is to go where that Thing is to be found in it's Purity and Perfection. If we would know the Nature of true Gold, we must view it, not in the Oar, but when it is refined. If we would learn what true Religion is, we must go where there is true Religion, and nothing but true Religion, and in it's highest Perfection, without any Defect or Mixture. All who are truely religious are not of this World, they are Strangers here, and belong to Heaven; they are born from above, Heaven is their native Country, and the Nature which they receive by this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Birth, is an heavenly Nature, they receive <hi>an Anointing from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;</hi> that Principle of true Religion which is in them, is a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

of the Religion of Heaven; their Grace is the Dawn of Glory; and God fits them for that World by conforming them to it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This appears from the Nature and Design of the Ordinances and Duties, which God hath appointed, as Means and Expressions of true Religion.</p>
               <p>To instance in the Duty of Prayer: 'Tis manifest, we are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, in this Duty, to declare God's Perfections, his Majesty, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Goodness, and Allsufficiency, and our own Meanness, Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Dependence, and Unworthiness, and our Wants and Desires, to inform God of these Things, or to incline his Heart, and prevail with him to be willing to shew us Mercy; but suitably to affect our own Hearts with the Things we express, and so to prepare us to receive the Blessings we ask. And such Gestures, and Manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Behaviour in the Worship of God, which Custom has made to be Significations of Humility and Reverence, can be of no further Use, than as they have some Tendency to affect our own Hearts, or the Hearts of others.</p>
               <p>And the Duty of singing Praises to God, seems to be appointed wholly to excite and express religious Affections. No other Reason can be assigned, why we should express our selves to God in Verse, rather than in Prose, and do it with Musick, but only, that such is our Nature and Frame, that these Things have a Tendency to move our Affections.</p>
               <p>The same thing appears in the Nature and Design of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which God hath appointed. God, considering our Frame, hath not only appointed that we should be told of the great Things of the Gospel, and of the Redemption of Christ, and instructed in them by his Word; but also that they should be, as it were, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to our View, in sensible Representations, in the Sacraments, the more to affect us with them.</p>
               <p>And the impressing divine Things on the Hearts and Affections of Men, is evidently one great and main End for which God has ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his Word delivered in the holy Scriptures, should be opened, applied, and set home upon Men, in Preaching. And therefore it don't answer the Aim which God had in this Institution, meerly for Men to have good Commentaries and Expositions on the Scripture, and other good Books of Divinity; because, altho' these may tend, as well as Preaching, to give Men a good doctrinal or speculative Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Work of God, yet they have not an equal Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to impress them on Men's Hearts and Affections. God hath appointed a particular, and lively Application of his Word, to Men, in the Preaching of it, as a fit Means to affect Sinners, with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Things of Religion, and their own Misery, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Remedy, and the Glory and Sufficiency of a Remedy

provided; and to stir up the pure Minds of the Saints, and quicken their Affections, by often bringing the great Things of Religion to their Remembrance, and setting them before them in their proper Colours, tho' they know them, and have been fully instructed in them already; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13. And particularly, to promote those two Affections in them, which are spoken of in the Text, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy: Christ gave same Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, that the Body of Christ might be edified in Love,</hi> Eph. 4. 11, 12, 16. The Apostle, in instructing and counselling <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning the Work of the Ministry, informs him that the great End of that Word which a Minister is to preach, is <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 3, 4, 5. And another Affection which God has appointed Preaching as a Means to promote in the Saints, is <hi>Joy;</hi> and therefore Ministers are called <hi>Helpers of their Joy,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 24.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 'Tis an Evidence that true Religion, or Holiness of Heart, lies very much in the Affection of the Heart, that the Scriptures place the Sin of the Heart very much in <hi>Hardness of Heart.</hi> Thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do every where.

Rom. 2. 5. <hi>After thy Hardness and impenitent Heart, treasurest up unto thy self Wrath, against the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</hi> The Reason given why the House of <hi>Israel</hi> would not obey God, was that they were hard-hearted, Ezek. 3. 7. <hi>But the House of</hi> Israel <hi>will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: For all the House of</hi> Israel <hi>are impudent and hard-hearted.</hi> The Wickedness of that perverse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Generation in the Wilderness, is ascribed to the Hardness of their Hearts; Psal. 95. 7,—10, <hi>To Day, if ye will hear my Voice, harden not your Heart, as in the Provocation, and as in the Day of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Wilderness; when your Fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my Work: Forty Years long was I grieved with this Generation, and said it is a People that do err in their Heart,</hi> &amp;c.—This is spoken of as what prevented <hi>Zedekiah'</hi>s turning to the Lord, 2 Chron. 36. 13. <hi>He stiffened his Neck, and hardned his Heart, from turning to the Lord God of</hi> Israel.

                     </gap> their Mind, and hardened their Hearts.</hi> And the Apostle seems to speak of <hi>an evil Heart, that departs from the living God,</hi> and <hi>a hard Heart,</hi> as the same Thing. Heb. 3. 8. <hi>Harden not your Heart, as in the Provocation,</hi> &amp;c. Verse 12, 13. <hi>Take heed Brethren, left there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief in departing from the living God, but exhort one another daily, while it is called is Day; lest any of you be hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin.</hi> And that great Work of God in Conversion, which consists in delivering a Person from the Power of Sin, and mortifying Corruption, is express'd, once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by God's <hi>taking away the Heart of Stone, and giving an Heart of Flesh,</hi> Ezek. 11. 10. and Chap. 36. 26.</p>
               <p>Now by a hard Heart, is plainly meant an unaffected Heart, or a Heart not easy to be moved with vertuous Affections, like a Stone, insensible, stupid, unmoved and hard to be impressed. Hence the hard Heart is called a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Heart,</hi> and is opposed to an <hi>Heart of Flesh,</hi> that has feeling, and is sensibly touch'd and moved. We read in Scripture of a <hi>hard Heart,</hi> and a <hi>tender Heart:</hi> And doubtless we are to understand these, as contrary the one to the other. But what is a tender Heart, but a Heart which is easily impressed with what ought to affect it? God commends <hi>Josiah,</hi> because his Heart was tender; and 'tis evident by those Things which are mention'd as Expressions and Evidences of this Tenderness of Heart, that by his Heart being tender is meant, his Heart being easily moved with religious and pious Affection; 2 Kings 22. 19. <hi>Because thine Heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thy self before the Lord, when thou heardst what I spake against this Place, and against the Inhabitants thereof, that they should become a Desolation, and a Curse, and hast rent thy Clothes, and hast wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord.</hi> And this is one thing, wherein it is necessary we should <hi>become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in order to our entring into the Kingdom of God,</hi> even that we should have our Hearts tender, and easily affected and moved in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and divine Things, as little Children have in other Things.</p>
               <p>'Tis very plain in some Places, in the Texts themselves, that by Hardness of Heart is meant a Heart void of Affection. So to signify the <hi>Ostrich'</hi>s being without natural Affection to her Young, it is said, Job 39. 16. <hi>She hardeneth her Heart against her young Ones, as though they were not hers.</hi> So a Person having a Heart unaffected in Time of Danger, is express'd by his hardening his Heart, Prov. 28. 14 <hi>Happy is the Man that feareth alway; but he that hardneth his Heart shall fall into Mischief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore since it is so plain, that by a hard Heart, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is meant a Heart destitute of pious Affections, and since also
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005767_0032_102704D1D343A018"/>
the Scriptures do so frequently place the Sin and Corruption of the Heart in Hardness of Heart; it is evident, that the Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Heart, on the contrary, must, in a great Measure, consist in its having pious Affections, and being easily susceptive of such Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Divines are generally agreed, that Sin radically and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally consists in what is negative, or privative, having its Root and Foundation in a Privation or Want of Holiness. And therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, if it be so that Sin does very much consist in Hardness of Heart, and so in the Want of pious Affections of Heart; Holiness does consist very much <hi>in those pious Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am far from supposing that all Aff<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions do shew a tender Heart: Hatred, Anger, Vain-glory, and other selfish and self-exalting Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may greatly prevail in the hardest Heart. But yet it is evident that <hi>Hardness of Heart,</hi> and <hi>Tenderness of Heart,</hi> are Expressions that relate to the Affections of the Heart, and denote the Heart's being susceptible of, or shut up against, <hi>certain Affections,</hi> of which I shall have Occasion to speak more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, I think it clearly and abundantly evident, that true Religion lies very much in the Affections. Not that I think these Arguments prove, that Religion in the Hearts of the truly Godly, is ever in exact Proportion to the Degree of Affection, and present Emotion of the Mind. For undoubtedly, there is much Affection in the true Saints which is not spiritual: Their religious Affections are often mixed; all is not from Grace, but much from Nature. And tho' the Affections have not their Seat in the Body, yet the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, may very much contribute to the present Emotion of the Mind. And the Degree of Religion is rather to be judged of by the Fixedness and Strength of the Habit that is exercised in Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby holy Affection is habitual, than by the Degree of the present Exercise: And the Strength of that Habit is not always in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to outward Effects and Manifestations, or inward Effects, in the Hurry and Vehemence, and sudden Changes of the Course of the Thoughts of the Mind. But yet it is evident, that Religion consists so much in Affection, as that without holy Affection there is no true Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no Light in the Understanding is good, which don't produce holy Affection in the Heart; no Habit or Principle in the Heart is good, which has no such Exercise; and no external Fruit is good, which don't proceed from such Exercises.</p>
               <p>Having thus considered the Evidence of the Proposition laid down, I proceed to some Inferences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence learn how great their Error is, who are for discarding all religious Affections, as having nothing solid or substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in them.</p>
               <p>

There seems to be too much of a Disposition this Way, prevailing in this Land at this Time. Because many who, in the late extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Season, appeared to have great religious Affections, did not manifest a right Temper of Mind, and run into many Errors, in the Time of their Affection, and the Heat of their Zeal; and because the high Affections of many seem to be so soon come to nothing, and some who seemed to be mightily raised and swallowed with Joy and Zeal, for a While, seem to have returned like the Dog to his Vomit: Hence religious Affections in general are grown out of Credit, with great Numbers, as tho' true Religion did not at all consists in them. Thus we easily, and naturally run from one Extreme to another. A little while ago we were in the other Extreme; there was a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Disposition to look upon all high religious Affections, as eminent Exercises of true Grace, without much inquiring into the Nature and Source of those Affections, and the Manner in which they arose: If Persons did but appear to be indeed very much moved and raised, so as to be full of religious Talk, and express themselves with great Warmth and Earnestness, and to be <hi>fill'd,</hi> or to be <hi>very full,</hi> as the Phrases were; it was too much the Manner, without further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to conclude such Persons were full of the Spirit of God, and had eminent Experience of his gracious Influences. This was the Extreme which was prevailing three or four Years ago. But of late, instead of <hi>esteeming</hi> and <hi>admiring</hi> all religious <hi>Affections, without Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction,</hi> it is a Thing much more prevalent, to <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>discard</hi> all <hi>without Distinction.</hi> Herein appears the Subtilty of <hi>Satan.</hi> While he saw that <hi>Affections</hi> were much in Vogue, knowing the greater Part of the Land were not versed in such Things, and had not had much Experience of great <hi>religious Affections,</hi> to enable them to judge well of 'em, and distinguish between true and false; then he knew he could best play his Game, by sowing Tares amongst the Wheat, and mingling <hi>false Affections</hi> with the Works of God's Spirit: He knew this to be a likely Way to delude and eternally ruin many Souls, and greatly to wound Religion in the Saints, and entangle them in a dreadful Wilderness, and by and by, to bring all Religion into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute. But now, when the ill Consequences of these <hi>false Affections</hi> appear, and 'tis become very apparent, that some of those Emotions which made a glaring Shew, and were by many greatly admired, were in Reality Nothing; the Devil sees it to be for his Interest to go another Way to work, and to endeavour to his utmost to propagate and establish a Perswasion, that all Affections and sensible Emotions of the Mind, in Things of Religion, are nothing at all to be regarded, but are rather to be avoided, and carefully guarded against, as Things of a pernicious Tendency. This he knows is the Way to bring all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to a meer lifeless Formality, and effectually shut out the Power of Godliness, and every Thing which is spiritual, and to have all true

Christianity turn'd out of Doors. For altho' to true Religion, there must indeed be something else besides Affection; yet true Religion consists so much in the Affections, that there can be no true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without them. He who has no religious Affection, is in a State of spiritual Death, and is wholly destitute of the powerful, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, saving Influences of the Spirit of God upon his Heart. As there is no true Religion, where there is nothing else but Affection; so there is no true Religion where there is no <hi>religious Affection.</hi> As on the one Hand, there must be Light in the Understanding, as well as an <hi>affected</hi> fervent Heart, where there is Heat without Light, there can be nothing divine or heavenly in that Heart; so on the other Hand, where there is a Kind of Light without Heat, a H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffected Heart, there can be nothing divine in that Light, that Knowledge is no true spiritual Knowledge of divine Things. If the great Things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are rightly understood, they will affect the Heart. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Men are not affected by such infinitely great, important, glorious, and wonderful Things, as they often hear and read of, in the Word of God, is undoubtedly because they are blind; if they were not so, it would be impossible, and utterly inconsistent with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, that their Hearts should be otherwise, than strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, and greatly moved by such Things.</p>
               <p>This Manner of slighting all religious <hi>Affections,</hi> is the Way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to harden the Hearts of Men, and to encourage 'em in their Stupidity and Senselessness, and to keep 'em in a State of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Death as long as they live, and bring 'em at last to Death eternal. The prevailing Prejudice against <hi>religious Affections</hi> at this Day, in the Land, is apparently of awful Effect, to harden the Hearts of Sinners, and damp the Graces of many of the Saints, and stund the Life and Power of Religion, and preclude the Effect of Ordinances, and hold us down in a State of Dulness and Apathy, and undoubtedly causes many Persons greatly to offend God, in entertaining mean and low Thoughts of the extraordinary Work he has lately wrought in this Land.</p>
               <p>And for Persons to despise and cry down all religious <hi>Affections,</hi> is the Way to shut all Religion out of their own Hearts, and to make thorough Work in ruining their Souls.</p>
               <p>They who condemn high Affections in others, are certainly not likely to have high Affections themselves. And let it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they who have but little religious Affection, have certainly but little Religion. And they who condemn others for their <hi>religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and have none themselves, have no Religion.</p>
               <p>There are false <hi>Affections,</hi> and there are true. A Man's having <hi>much Affection,</hi> don't prove that he has any true Religion: But if he has <hi>no Affection,</hi> it proves that he has no true Religion. The right
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005767_0035_102704DBE70814A8"/>
Way, is not to reject all Affections, nor to approve all; but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between Affections, approving some, and rejecting others; separating between the Wheat and the Chaff, the Gold and the Dross, the Precious and the Vile.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be so, that true Religion lies much in the <hi>Affections,</hi> hence we may infer, that such Means are to be desired, as have much of a Tendency to move the Affections. Such Books, and such a Way of Preaching the Word, and Administration of Ordinances, and such a Way of worshipping God in Prayer, and singing Praises, is much to be desired, as has a Tendency deeply to affect the Hearts of those who attend these Means.</p>
               <p>Such a Kind of Means, would formerly have been highly approved of and applauded by the Generality of the People of the Land, as the most excellent and profitable, and having the greatest Tendency to promote the Ends of the Means of Grace. But the prevailing Taste seems of late strangely to be alter'd: That pathetical Manner of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching, which would formerly have been admir'd and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that for this Reason, because it had such a Tendency to move the Affections, now, in great Multitudes, immediately excites Disgust, and moves no other Affections, than those of Displeasure and Contempt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, formerly the Generality (at least of the common People) were in the Extreme, of looking too much to an affectionate Address, in publick Performances: But now, a very great Part of the People, seem to have gone far into a contrary Extreme. Indeed there may be such Means, as may have a great Tendency to stir up the Passions of weak and ignorant Persons, and yet have no great Tendency to Benefit their Souls. For tho' they may have a Tendency to excite Affections, they may have little or none to excite gracious Affections, or any Affections tending to Grace. But undoubtedly, if the Things of Religion, in the Means used, are treated according to their Nature, and exhibited truly, so as tends to convey just Apprehensions, and a right Judgment of them; the more they have a Tendency to move the Affections, the better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If true Religion lies much in the Affections, hence we may learn, what great Cause we have to be ashamed and confounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, that we are no more affected with the great Things of Religion. It appears from what has been said, that this arises from our having so little true Religion.</p>
               <p>God has given to Mankind Affections, for the same Purpose which he has given all the Faculties and Principles of the human Soul for, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might be subservient to Man's chief End, and the great Business for which God has created him, that is the Business of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

And yet how common is it among Mankind, that their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are much more exercised and engaged in other Matters, than in Religion! In Things which concern Men's worldly Interest, their outward Delights, their Honour and Reputation, and their natural Relations, they have their Desires eager, their Appetites vehement, their Love warm and affectionate, their Zeal ardent; in these Things their Hearts are tender and sensible, easily moved, deeply impress'd, much concerned, very sensibly affected, and greatly engaged; much depress'd with Grief at worldly Losses, and highly raised with Joy at worldly Successes and Prosperity. But how insensible and unmov'd are most Men, about the great Things of another World! How dull are their Affections! How heavy and hard their Hearts in these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! Here their Love is cold, their Desires languid, their Zeal low, and their Gratitude small. How they can sit and hear of the infinite Height and Depth and Length and Breadth of the Love of God in Christ Jesus, of his giving his infinitely dear Son, to be offered up a Sacrifice for the Sins of Men, and of the unparallel'd Love of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, holy and tender Lamb of God, manifested in his dying Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, his bloody Sweat, his loud and bitter Cries, and bleeding Heart, and all this for Enemies, to redeem them from deserved, eternal Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to bring to unspeakable and everlasting Joy and Glory; and yet be cold, and heavy, insensible, and regardless! Where are the Exercises of our Affections proper, if not here? What is it that does more require them? And what can be a fit Occasion of their lively and vigorous Exercise, if not such an one as this? Can any Thing be set in our View, greater and more important? Any Thing more wonderful and surprising? Or more nearly concerning our Interest? Can we suppose the wise Creator implanted such Principles in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature as the Affections, to be of Use to us, and to be exercised on certain proper Occasions, but to lie still on such an Occasion as this? Can any Christian, who believes the Truth of these Things, entertain such Thoughts?</p>
               <p>If we ought ever to exercise our Affections at all, and if the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor han't unwisely constituted the human Nature, in making these Principles a Part of it, when they are vain and useless; then they ought to be exercised about those Objects which are most worthy of them. But is there any Thing, which Christians can find in Heaven or Earth, so worthy to be the Objects of their Admiration and Love, their earnest and longing Desires, their Hope, and their Rejoicing, and their fervent Zeal, as those Things that are held forth to us in the Gospel of Jesus Christ? In which, not only are Things declared most worthy to affect us, but they are exhibited in the most affecting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Glory and Beauty of the blessed Jehovah, which is most worthy in it self, to be the Object of our Admiration and Love, is there exhibited in the most affecting Manner that can be conceived of, as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005767_0037_102704E0449E01C0"/>
it appears shining in all its Lustre, in the Face of an incarnate, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely loving, meek, compassionate, dying Redeemer. All the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Lamb of God, his Humility, Patience, Meekness, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, Obedience, Love &amp; Compassion, are exhibited to our View, in a manner the most tending to move our Affections, of any that can be imagined; as they all had their greatest Trial, and their highest Exercise, and so their brightest Manifestation, when he was in the most affecting Circumstances; even when he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his last Sufferings, those unutterable and unparallel'd Sufferings, he endered, from his tender Love and Pity to us. There also, the hateful Nature of our Sins is manifested in the most affecting Manner possible; as we see the dreadful Effects of them, in what our Redeemer, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to answer for us, suffered for them. And there we have the most affecting Manifestations of God's Hatred of Sin, and his Wrath and Justice in punishing it; as we see his Justice in the Strictness and Inflexibleness of it, and his Wrath in its Terribleness, in so dreadfully punishing our Sins, in One who was infinitely dear to him, and loving to us. So has God disposed Things, in the Affair of our Redemption, and in his glorious Dispensations, revealed to us in the Gospel, as tho' every Thing were purposely contrived in such a Manner, as to have the greatest, possible Tendency to reach our Hearts in the most tender Part, and move our Affections most sensibly and strongly. How great Cause have we therefore to be humbled to the Dust, that we are no more affected!</p>

               <head>Shewing what are no certain Signs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Affections are truly gracious, or that they are not.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any one, on the Reading of what has been just now said, is ready to acquit himself, and say, <q>I am not one of those who have no religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; I am often greatly moved with the Consideration of the great Things of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</q> Let him not content himself with this, that he has religious Affections. For (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served before) as we ought not to reject and condemn all Affections, as tho' true Religion did not at all consist in Affection; so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, we ought not to approve of all, as tho' every one that was religiously affected, had true Grace, and was therein the Subject of the saving Influences of the Spirit of God: and that therefore the right Way is to distinguish among religious Affections, between one sort and another. Therefore let us now endeavour to do this: And in order to it, I would do two Things.</p>
               <p>I. I would mention some Things, which are no Signs one Way or the other, either that Affections are such as true Religion consists in, or that they are otherwise; that we may be guarded against judging of Affections by false Signs.</p>
               <p>II. I would observe some Things, wherein those Affections which are spiritual and gracious, differ from those which are not so, and may be distinguished and known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:005767_0039_102704E93204A060"/>
FIRST, I would take Notice of some Things, which are no Signs that Affections are gracious, or that they are not.</p>
               <p>I. 'Tis no Sign one Way or the other, that religious Affections are very great, or raised very high.</p>
               <p>Some are ready to condemn all high Affections: If Persons appear to have their religious Affections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> extraordinary Pitch, they are prejudiced against them, and determine that they are Delusions, without further Enquiry. But if it be as has been proved, that true Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> very much in religious Affections, then it follows, that if there be a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of true Religion, there will be great religious Affections; if true Religion in the Hearts of Men, be raised to a great Height, divine and holy Affections will be raised to a great Height.</p>
               <p>Love is an Affection; but will any Christian say, Men ought not to love God and Jesus Christ in a high Degree? And will any say, we ought not to have a very great Hatred of Sin, and a very deep Sorrow for it? Or that we ought not to exercise a high Degree of Gratitude to God, for the Mercies we receive of him, and the great Things he has done for the Salvation of fallen Men? Or that we should not have very great and strong Desires after God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness? Is there any who will profess, that his Affections in Religion are great enough; and will say, <q>I have no Cause to be humbled, that I am no more affected with the Things of Religion than I am, I have no Reason to be ashamed, that I have no greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Love of God, and Sorrow for Sin, and Gratitude for the Mercies which I have received?</q> Who is there that will go and bless God, that he is affected enough with what he has read and heard, of the wonderful Love of God to Worms and Rebels, in giving his only begotten Son to die for them, and of the dying Love of Christ; and will pray that he mayn't be affected with them in any higher Degree, because high Affections are improper, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely in Christians, being enthusiastical, and ruinous to true Religion?</p>
               <p>Our Text plainly speaks of great and high Affections, when it speaks of <hi>rejoicing with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory:</hi> Here the most suparlative Expressions are used, which Language will afford. And the Scriptures often require us to exercise very high Affections: Thus in the first and great Commandment of the Law, there is an Accumulation of Expressions, as tho' Words were wanting to express the Degree, in which we ought to love God; <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength.</hi> So the Saints are called upon to exercise high Degrees of Joy: <hi>Rejoice,</hi> says Christ to his Disciples, <hi>and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad,</hi> Matth. 5. 12. So it is said, Psal. 68. 3. <hi>Let the Righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God; yea, let them exceedingly

               <p>The Saints and Angels in Heaven, that have Religion in it's highest Perfection, are exceedingly affected with what they behold and contemplate, of God's Perfections and Works. They are all as a pure heavenly Flame of Fire, in their Love, and in the Greatness and Strength of their Joy and Gratitude: Their Praises are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, <hi>as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And therefore, it religious Affections in Men here below, are but of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Kind with their's, the higher they are, and the nearer they are to their's in Degree, the better; because therein they will be so much the more conformed to Truth, as their's are.</p>
               <p>From these Things it certainly appears, that religious Affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a very high Degree, is no Evidence that they are not such as have the Nature of true Religion. Therefore they do greatly err, who condemn Persons as Enthusiasts, meerly because their Affections are very high.</p>
               <p>And on the other Hand, 'Tis no Evidence that religious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of a spiritual and gracious Nature, because they are great. 'Tis very manifest by the holy Scripture, our sure and infallible Rule to judge of Things of this Nature, that there are religious Affections which are very high, that are not spiritual and saving. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of Affections in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> which had been exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elevated, and which yet he manifestly speaks of, as fearing that they were vain, and had come to nothing. Gal. 4. 15. <hi>Where is the Blessedness you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

So they were greatly affected again, at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when they saw the marvelous

Manifectations God made of himself there; and seemed mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in their Minds, and with great Forwardness made Answer, when God proposed his holy Covenant to them, saying, <hi>All that the Lord hath spoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</hi> But how soon was there an End to all this mighty Forwardness and Engagedness of Affection? How quickly were they turned aside after other Gods, rejoicing and shouting around their golden Calf? So great Multitudes who were affected with the Miracle of raising <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead, were elevated to a high Degree, and made a mighty ado, when Jesus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after enter'd into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> exceedingly magnifying Christ, as tho' the Ground were not good enough for the Ass he rode to tread upon; and therefore cut down Branches of Palm-trees, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rawed them in the Way; yea pull'd off their Garments, and spread them in the Way; and cried with loud Voices, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Hosanna in the Highest;</hi> so as to make the whole City ring again, and put all into an Uproar. We learn by the Evangelist <hi>John,</hi> that the Reason why the People made this ado, was because they were affected with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of raising <hi>Lazarus; John</hi> 12. 18. Here was a vast Multitude crying <hi>Hosanna</hi> on this Occasion, so that it gave Occasion to the Pharisees to say, <hi>Behold the World is gone after him,</hi> John 12. 19. but Christ had at that Time but few true Disciples. And how quickly was this ado at an End? All of this Nature is quell'd and dead, when this <hi>Jesus</hi> stands bound, with a mock Robe and a Crown of Thorns, to be derided, spit upon, scoarg'd, condemn'd and executed. Indeed there was a great and loud Out cry concerning him, among the Multitude then, as well as before; but of a very different Kind: 'Tis not then, <hi>Hosanna, Hosanna,</hi> but <hi>Crucify, Crucify.</hi>

               <p>And it is the concurring Voice of all orthodox Divines, that there may be religious Affections, which are raised to a very high Degree, and yet there be nothing of true Religion. <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>II. 'Tis no Sign that Affections have the Nature of true Religion, or that they have not, that they have great Effects on the Body.</p>
               <p>All Affections whatsoever, have in some Respect or Degree, an Effect on the Body. As was observed before, such is our Nature, and such are the Laws of Union of Soul and Body, that the Mind can have no lively or vigorous Exercise, without some Effect upon the Body. So subject is the Body to the Mind, and so much do its Fluids, especially the animal Spirits, attend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005767_0043_102704F2845613B0"/>
without an Effect upon them. Yea, 'tis questionable, whether an embodied Soul ever so much as thinks one Thought, or has any Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise at all, but that there is some corresponding Motion or Alteration of Motion, in some Degree, of the Fluids, in some Part of the Body. But universal Experience shews, that the Exercise of the Affections, have in a special Manner a Tendency, to some sensible Effect upon the Body. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this be so, that all Affections have some Effect on the Body, we may then well suppose, the greater those Affections be, and the more vigorous their Exercise (other Circumstances being equal) the greater will be the Effect on the Body. Hence it is not to be wondered at, that very <hi>great</hi> and strong Exercises of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, should have <hi>great</hi> Effects on the Body. And therefore, seeing there are very great Affections, both common and spiritual; hence it is not to be wondered at, that great Effects on the Body, should arise from both these Kinds of Affections. And consequently these Effects are no Signs, that the Affections they arise from, are of one Kind or the other.</p>
               <p>Great Effects on the Body certainly are no sure Evidences that Affections are spiritual; for we see that such Effects oftentimes arise from great Affections about temporal Things, and when Religion is no Way concerned in them. And if great Affections about secular Things, are purely natural, may have these Effects, I know not by what Rule we should determine, that high Affections about religious Things, which arise in like Manner from Nature, can't have the like Effect.</p>
               <p>Nor on the other Hand, do I know of any Rule any have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that gracious and holy Affections, when raised as high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> any natural Affections, and have equally strong and vigorous Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, can't have a great Effect on the Body. No such Rule can be drawn from Reason: I know of no Reason, why a being affected with a View of God's Glory should not cause the Body to faint, as well as a being affected with a View of <hi>Solomon'</hi>s Glory. And no such Rule has as yet been produced from the Scripture: None has ever been found in all the late Controversies which have been about Things of this Nature. There is a great Power in spiritual Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we read of the Power which worketh in Christians, <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 3. 7.</note> and of the Spirit of God being in them, as the Spirit of Power, <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. 1. 7.</note> and of the effectual working of his Power in them <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid v. 7.

The Text we are upon speaks of <hi>Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory.</hi> And who that considers what Man's Nature is, and what the Nature of the Affections are, can reasonably doubt but that such unutterable and glorious Joys, may be too great and mighty for weak Dust and Ashes, so as to be considerably overbearing to it? It is evident by the Scripture, that true divine Discoveries, or Ideas of God's Glory, when given in a great Degree, have a Tendency, by affecting the Mind, to overbear the Body; because the Scripture teaches us often, that if these Ideas or Views should be given to such a Degree, as they are given in Heaven, the weak Frame of the Body could not subsist under it, and that no Man can, in that Manner, see God and live. The Knowledge which the Saints have of God's Beauty and Glory in this World, and those holy Affections that arise from it, are of the same Nature and Kind with what the Saints are the Subjects of in Heaven, differing only in Degree and Circumstances: What God gives them here, is a Foretaste of heavenly Happiness, and an Earnest of their future Inheritance. And who shall limit God in his giving this Earnest, or say he shall give so much of the Inheritance, such a Part of the future Reward, as an Earnest of the Whole, and no more? And seeing God has taught us in his Word, that the whole Reward is such, that it would at once destroy the Body, is it not too bold a Thing for us, so to set Bounds to the sovereign God, as to say, that in giving the Earnest of this Reward in this World, he shall never give so much of it, as in the least to diminish the Strength of the Body, when God has no where thus limited himself?</p>
               <p>The Psalmist speaking of vehement religious Affections he had, speaks of an Effect in his Flesh or Body, besides what was in his Soul, expressly distinguishing one from the other, once and again, Psal. 84. 2. <hi>My Soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, my</hi> Heart <hi>and my</hi> Flesh <hi>crieth out for the living God.</hi> Here is a plain Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Heart and the Flesh, as being each affected. So Psal. 63. 1. <hi>My</hi> Soul <hi>thirsteth for thee, my</hi> Flesh <hi>longeth for thee, in a dry and thirsty Land, where no Water is.</hi> Here also is an evident designed Distinction between the Soul and the Flesh.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> speaks of his Body's being over-born, by a Sense of the Majesty of God, Hab. 3. 16. <hi>When I heard, my Belly trembled, my Lips quivered at the Voice, Rottenness enter'd into my Bones, and I trembled in myself.</hi> So the Psalmist speaks expresly of his Flesh trembling, Psal. 119. 120. <hi>My Flesh trembleth for Fear of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That such Ideas of God's Glory, are sometimes given in this World, have a Tendency to over-bear the Body, is evident, because the Scripture gives us an Account, that this has sometimes actually been the Effect of those external Manifestations God has made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to some of the Saints, which were made to that End, <hi>viz.</hi> to give them an Idea of God's Majesty and Glory. Such Instances we

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the End, for which God intended these outward Signs, they received by them a great and lively Apprehension of the real Glory and Majesty of God's Nature, which they were Signs of; and thus were greatly affected, their Souls swallowed up, and their Bodies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. And I think, they are very bold and daring, who will say God cannot, or shall not give the like clear and affecting Ideas and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the same real Glory and Majesty of his Nature, to none of his Saints, without the Intervention of any such external Shadows of it.</p>

III. 'Tis no Sign that Affections are truly gracious Affections, or that they are not, that they cause those who have them, to be fluent, fervent and abundant, in talking of the Things of Religion.</p>
               <p>There are many Persons, who if they see this in others, are greatly prejudiced against them. Their being so full of Talk, is with them, a sufficient Ground to condemn them, as Pharisees, and ostentatious Hypocrites. On the other Hand, there are many, who if they see this Effect in any, are very ignorantly and imprudently forward, at once to determine that they are the true Children of God, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the saving Influences of his Spirit, and speak of it as a great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a new Creature: They say <hi>such an one's Mouth is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>: He used to be slow to speak; but now he is full and free: He is free now to open his Heart, and tell his Experiences, and declare the Praises of God; it comes from him, as free as Water from a Fountain,</hi> and the like. And especially are they captivated into a confident and undoubting Perswasion that they are savingly wrought upon, if they are not only free and abundant, but very affectionate and earnest in their Talk.</p>
               <p>But this is the Fruit of but little Judgment, a scanty and short Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; as Events do abundantly shew: and is a Mistake, Persons often run into, through their trusting to their own Wisdom and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, and making their own Notions their Rule, instead of the holy Scripture. Tho' the Scripture be full of Rules, both how we should judge of our own State, and also how we should be conducted in our Opinion of others; yet we have no where any Rule, by which to judge ourselves or others to be in a good Estate, from any such Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For this is but the Religion of the Mouth and of the Tongue, and what is in the Scripture represented by the Leaves of a Tree, which tho' the Tree ought not to be without them, yet are no where given as an Evidence of the Goodness of the Tree.</p>
               <p>That Persons are disposed to be abundant in talking of Things of Religion, may be from a good Cause, and it may be from a bad one. It may be because their Hearts are very full of holy Affections; for <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaketh:</hi> And it may be because Persons Hearts are very full of religious Affection which is not holy; for still out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh. It is very much the Nature of the Affections, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Kind they be, and whatever Objects they are exercised about, if they are strong, to dispose Persons to be very much in speaking of that which they are affected with; and not only to speak much, but to speak very earnestly and fervently. And therefore Persons talking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly and very fervently about the Things of Religion, can be an Evidence of no more than this, that they are very much affected with the Things of Religion; but this may be, (as has been already shown) and there be no Grace. That which Men are greatly affected with, while the high Affection lasts, they will be earnestly engaged

about, and will be likely to shew that Earnestness in their Talk and Behaviour; as the greater Part of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in all <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> did for a while, about <hi>John the Baptist'</hi>s Preaching and Baptism, when they were willing for a Season to rejoice in his Light: A mighty ado was made, all over the Land, and among all sorts of Persons, about this great Prophet and his Ministry. And so the Multitude in like Manner, often manifested a great Earnestness, and mighty Engaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit, in every Thing that was external, about Christ and his Preaching and Miracles, <hi>being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

As a Tree that is over-full of Leaves seldom bears much Fruit: And as a Cloud, tho' to Appearance very pregnant and full of Water, if it brings with it overmuch Wind, seldom affords much Rain to the dry and thirsty Earth: Which very Thing the holy Spirit is pleased several Times to make use of, to represent a great Shew of Religion with the Mouth, without answerable Fruit in the Life: Prov. 25. 14. <hi>Whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

IV. 'Tis no Sign that Affections are gracious, or that they are otherwise, that Persons did not make 'em themselves, or excite 'em of their own Contrivance, and by their own Strength.</p>
               <p>There are many in these Days, that condemn all Affections which are excited in a Way that the Subjects of 'em can give no Account of, as not seeming to be the Fruit of any of their own Endeavours, or the natural Consequence of the Faculties and Principles of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in such Circumstances, and under such Means; but to be from the Influence of some extrinsick and supernatural Power upon their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. How greatly has the Doctrine of the inward Experience or sensible Perceiving of the immediate Power and Operation of the Spirit of God, been reproach'd and ridicul'd by many of late. They say the Manner of the Spirit of God, is to co-operate in a silent, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and undiscernable Way, with the Use of Means, and our own Endeavours; so that there is no distinguishing by Sense, between the Influences of the Spirit of God, and the natural Operations of the Faculties of our own Minds.</p>
               <p>And it is true, that for any to expect to receive the saving Influences of the Spirit of God, while they neglect a diligent Improvement of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means of Grace, is unreasonable Presumption. And to expect that the Spirit of God will savingly operate upon their Minds, without the Spirits making Use of Means, as subservient to the Effect, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical. 'Tis also undoubtedly true, that the Spirit of God is very various in the Manner and Circumstances of his Operations, and that sometimes he operates in a Way more secret and gradual, and from smaller Beginnings, than at others.</p>

                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:005767_0049_1027050677DE7D80"/>
But if there be indeed a Power, entirely different from and beyond our Power, or the Power of all Means and Instruments, and above the Power of Nature, which is requisite in order to the Production of saving Grace in the Heart, according to the general Profession of the Country; Then certainly, it is in no wise unreasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that this Effect should very frequently be produced after such a Manner, as to make it very manifest, apparent, and sensible that it is so. If Grace be indeed owing to the powerful and efficacious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an extrinsick Agent, or divine Efficient out of our selves, why is it unreasonable to suppose, it should seem to be so, to them who are the Subjects of it? Is it a strange Thing, that it should seem to be as it is? When Grace in the Heart, indeed is not produced by our Strength, nor is the Effect of the natural Power of our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or any Means or Instruments, but is properly the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Production of the Spirit of the Almighty, Is it a strange and unaccountable Thing, that it should seem to them who are Subjects of it agreable to Truth, and not right contrary to Truth, so that if Persons tell of Effects that they are conscious to in their own Minds, that seem to them not to be from the natural Power or Operation of their Minds, but from the supernatural Power of some other Agent, it should at once be look'd upon as a sure Evidence of their being under a Delusion, because Things seem to them to be as they are? For this is the Objection which is made: 'Tis look'd upon as a clear Evidence that the Apprehensions and Affections that many Persons have, are not really from such a Cause, because they seem to them to be from that Cause: They declare that what they are conscious of, seems to them evidently not to be from themselves, but from the mighty Power of the Spirit of God; and others from hence condemn 'em, and determine what they experience is not from the Spirit of God, but from themselves, or from the Devil. Thus unreasonably are Multitudes treated at this Day, by their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>If it be indeed so, as the Scripture abundantly teaches, that Grace in the Soul, is so the Effect of God's Power, that it is fitly compared to those Effects, which are farthest from being owing to any Strength in the Subject, such as a <hi>Generation,</hi> or <hi>a being begotten,</hi> and <hi>Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>a being raised from the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Creation,</hi> or <hi>a being brought out of nothing into Being,</hi> and that it is an Effect wherein the mighty Power of God is greatly glorified, and the exceeding Greatness of his Power is manifested; <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 1. 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> then what Account can be given of it, that the Almighty, in so great a Work of his Power, should so carefully hide his Power, that the Subjects of it should be able to discern nothing of it? Or what Reason or Revelation have any to determine that he

does so? If we may judge by the Scripture, this is not agreable to God's Manner, in his Operations and Dispensations; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 'tis God's Manner, in the great Works of his Power and Mercy which he works for his People, to order Things so, as to make his Hand visible, and his Power conspicuous, and Men's Dependance on him most evident, that no Flesh should glory in his Presence, <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 27, 28, 29.</note> that God alone might be exalted, <note n="*" place="bottom">Isai. 2. 11,—17.</note> and that the Excellency of the Power might be of God and not of Man, <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. 4. 7.</note> and that Christ's Power might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in our Weakness, <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> and none might say mine own Hand hath saved me. <note n="**" place="bottom">Judg. 7. 2.</note> So it was in most of those temporal Salvations which God wrought for <hi>Israel</hi> of old, which were Types of the Salvation of God's People from their spiritual Enemies. So it was in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of <hi>Israel,</hi> from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage; he redeem'd them with a strong Hand, and an outstretched Arm; and that his Power might be the more conspicuous, he suffer'd <hi>Israel</hi> first to be brought into the most helpless and forlorn Circumstances. So it was in the great Redemption by <hi>Gideon;</hi> God would have his Army dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to a Handful, and they without any other Arms, than Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and Lamps, and earthen Pitchers. So it was in the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Israel</hi> from <hi>Goliah,</hi> by a Stripling, with a Sling and a Stone. So it was in that great Work of God, his calling the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and converting the heathen World, after Christ's Ascension, after that the World by Wisdom knew not God, and all the Endeavours of Philosophers had proved in vain, for many Ages, to reform the World, and it was by every Thing, become abundantly evident that the World was utterly helpless, by any Thing else, but the mighty Power of God. And so it was in most of the Conversions of particular Persons, we have an Account of in the History of the new Testament: They were not wrought on in that silent, secret, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and insensible Manner, which is now insisted on; but with those manifest Evidences of a supernatural Power, wonderfully and suddenly causing a great Change, which in these Days are looked upon as certain Signs of Delusion and Enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>The Apostle in Eph. 1. 18, 19. speaks of God's enlightning the Minds of Christians, and so bringing them to believe in Christ, to the End, that they <hi>might know</hi> the exceeding Greatness of his Power to them who believe. The Words are, <hi>The Eyes of your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being enlightned, that ye may know what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding Greatness of his Power to us-ward, who believe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Working of his mighty Power,</hi> &amp;c. Now when the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005767_0051_1027050DC79FA130"/>
Apostle speaks of their being thus the Subjects of his Power, in their enlightning and effectual Calling, to the End, that they might know what his mighty Power was to them who believe, he can mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, than <hi>that they might know by Experience.</hi> But if the Saints know this Power by Experience, then they feel it, and discern it, and are conscious of it; as sensibly distinguishable from the natural Operations of their own Minds, which is not agreable to a Notion of God's operating so secretly, and undiscernably, that it can't be known that they are the Subjects of the Influence of any extrinsick Power at all, any otherwise than as they may argue it from Scripture Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which is a different Thing from knowing it by Experience.</p>
               <p>So that it is very unreasonable and unscriptural, to determine that Affections are not from the gracious Operations of God's Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are sensibly not from the Persons themselves, that are the Subjects of them.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, it is no Evidence that Affections are gracious, that they are not purposely produced by those who are the Subjects of them, or that they arise in their Minds in a Manner they can't ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for.</p>
               <p>There are some who make this an Argument in their own Favour, when speaking of what they have experienced, they say, <q>I am sure I did not make it myself: It was a Fruit of no Contrivance or Endeavour of mine; it came when I thought nothing of it; if I might have the World for it, I can't make it again when I please.</q> And hence they determine, that what they have experienced, must be from the mighty Influence of the Spirit of God, and is of a saving Nature; but very ignorantly, and without Grounds. What they have been the Subjects of, may indeed, not be from themselves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, but may be from the Operation of an invisible Agent, some Spirit besides their own: But it does not thence follow, that it was from the Spirit of God. There are other Spirits who have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Minds of Men, besides the Holy Ghost. We are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they be of God. There are many false Spirits, exceeding busy with Men, who often transform themselves into Angels of Light, and do in many wonderful Ways, with great Subtilty and Power, mimick the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of God. And there are many of <hi>Satan'</hi>s Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are very distinguishable from the voluntary Exercises of Men's own Minds. They are so, in those dreadful and horrid Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, and blasphemous Injections with which he follows many Persons; and in vain and fruitless Frights and Terrors, which he is the Author of. And the Power of <hi>Satan</hi> may be as immediate, and as evident in false Comforts and Joys, as in Terrors and horrid Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions; and oftentimes is so in Fact. 'Tis not in Men's Power to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005767_0052_1027050F638B2AB8"/>
put themselves into such Raptures, as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and many other raving Enthusiasts like them, have been the Subjects of.</p>
               <p>And besides, it is to be consider'd, that Persons may have those Impressions on their Minds, which may not be of their own produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, nor from an evil Spirit, but from the Spirit of God, and yet not be from any saving, but a common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>And where neither a good nor evil Spirit have any immediate Hand, Persons, especially such as are of a weak and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Habit of Body, and the Brain weak, and easily susceptive of Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, may have strange Apprehensions and Imaginations, and strong Affections attending them, unaccountably arising, which are not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily produced by themselves. We see that such Persons are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to such Impressions, about temporal Things; and there is equal Reason, why they should about spiritual Things. As a Person who is asleep, has Dreams, that he is not the voluntary Author of; so many such Persons, in like Manner, be the Subjects of involuntary Impressions, when they are awake.</p>
               <p>V. 'Tis no Sign that religious Affections are truly holy and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, or that they are not, that they come with Texts of Scripture, remarkably brought to the Mind.</p>
               <p>'Tis no Sign that Affections are not gracious, that they are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by Scriptures so coming to Mind; provided it be the Scripture itself, or the Truth which the Scripture so brought contains and teaches, that is the Foundation of the Affection, and not meerly or mainly, the sudden and unusual Manner of it's coming to the Mind.</p>
               <p>But on the other Hand, neither is it any Sign that Affections are gracious, that they arise on Occasion of Scriptures brought suddenly and wonderfully to the Mind; whether those Affections be Fear, or Hope, Joy, or Sorrow, or any other. Some seem to look upon this, as a good Evidence that their Affections are saving; especially if the Affections excited are Hope or Joy, or any other which are pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delightful. They will mention it as an Evidence that all is right, that their Experience <hi>came with the Word,</hi> and will say, <q>There were such and such sweet Promises brought to my Mind: They came suddenly, as if they were spoke to me: I had no Hand in bringing such a Text to my own Mind; I was not thinking of any Thing leading to it: it came all at once, so that I was surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. I had not thought of it a long Time before; I did not know
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005767_0053_1027051249C192E8"/>
at first that it was Scripture; I did not remember that ever I had read it.</q> And it may be, they will add, <q>One Scripture came flowing in after another, and so Texts all over the Bible, the most sweet and pleasant, and the most apt and suitable, which could be devised; and fill'd me full as I could hold: I could not but stand and admire: The Tears flow'd; I was full of Joy, and could not doubt any longer.</q> And thus, they think they have undoubted Evidence, that their Affections must be from God, and of the right Kind, and their State good: But without any Manner of Grounds. How come they by any such Rule, as that if any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or Experiences arise with Promises, and comfortable Texts of Scripture, unaccountably brought to Mind, without their Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or if a great Number of sweet Texts follow one another in a Chain, that this is a certain Evidence their Experiences are saving? Where is any such Rule to be found in the Bible, the great and only sure Directory in Things of this Nature?</p>
               <p>What deceives many of the less understanding and considerate Sort of People, in this Matter, seems to be this; That the Scripture is the Word of God, and has nothing in it which is wrong, but is pure and perfect: And therefore, those Experiences which come from the Scripture must be right. But then it should be considered, Affections may arise on <hi>occasion</hi> of the Scripture, and not properly come <hi>from</hi> the Scripture, as the genuine Fruit of the Scripture, and by a right Use of it; but from an Abuse of it. All that can be argued from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Perfection of the Word of God, with Respect to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is this, that those Experiences which are <hi>agreable</hi> to the Word of God, are right, and can't be otherwise; and not that those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections must be right, which arise <hi>on Occasion</hi> of the Word of God, coming to the Mind.</p>
               <p>What Evidence is there that the Devil can't bring Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Mind, and misapply them, to deceive Persons? There seems to be nothing in this which exceeds the Power of <hi>Satan.</hi> 'Tis no Work of such mighty Power, to bring Sounds or Letters to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Minds, that we have any Reason to suppose; nothing short of Omnipotence can be sufficient for it. If <hi>Satan</hi> has Power to bring any Words or Sounds at all to Persons Minds, he may have Power to bring Words contained in the Bible. There is no higher Sort of Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Men, to make the Sounds which express the Words of a Text of Scripture, than to make the Sounds which express the Words of an idle Story or Song. And so the same Power in <hi>Satan,</hi> which is sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new one of those Kinds of Sounds in the Mind, is sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the other: The different Signification, which depends wholly on Custom, alters not the Case, as to Ability to make or revive the Sounds or Letters. Or will any suppose, that Texts of Scripture are such sacred Things, that the Devil durst not abuse them, nor touch them? In this also they are mistaken. He who was bold
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005767_0054_102705165F472FD8"/>
enough to lay hold on Christ himself, and carry him hither and thither, into the Wilderness, and into an high Mountain, and to a Pinnacle of the Temple, is not afraid to touch the Scripture, and abuse that for his own Purposes: As he shew'd at the same Time that he was so bold with Christ, he then brought one Scripture and another, to deceive and tempt him. And if <hi>Satan</hi> did presume, and was permitted, to put Christ himself in Mind of Texts of Scripture to tempt <hi>Him,</hi> what Reason have we to determine, that he dare not, or will not be permitted, to put wicked Men in mind of Texts of Scripture, to tempt and deceive <hi>them?</hi> And if <hi>Satan</hi> may thus abuse one Text of Scripture, so he may another. It's being a very excellent Place of Scripture, a comfortable and precious Promise, alters not the Case, as to his Courage or Ability. And if he can bring one comfortable Text to the Mind, so he may a Thousand; and may choose out such Scriptures as tend most to serve his Purpose; and may heap up Scripture Promises, tending, according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Application he makes of them, wonderfully to remove the rising Doubts, and to confirm the false Joy and Confidence of a poor deluded Sinner.</p>
               <p>We know the Devil's Instruments, corrupt and heretical Teachers, can and do pervert the Scripture, to their own and others Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. We see they have the free Use of Scripture, in every Part of it: There is no Text so precious and sacred, but they are permitted to abuse it, to the eternal Ruin of Multitudes of Souls: And there are no Weapons they make Use of with which they do more Execution. And there is no Manner of Reason to determine, that the Devil is not permitted thus to use the Scripture, as well as his Instruments. For when the Latter do it, they do it as his Instruments and Servants, and thro' his Instigation and Influence: And doubtless he does the same he instigates others to do: The Devil's Servants do but follow their Master, and do the same Work that he does himself.</p>
               <p>And as the Devil can abuse the Scripture, to deceive and destroy Men, so may Men's own Folly and Corruptions, as well. The Sin which is in Men, acts like it's Father. Men's own Hearts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful like the Devil, and use the same Means to deceive.</p>
               <p>So that 'tis evident, that Persons may have high Affections of Hope and Joy, arising on occasion of Texts of Scripture, yea pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promises of Scripture coming suddenly and remarkably to their Minds, as tho' they were spoke to them, yea a great Multitude of such Texts, following one another in a wonderful Manner, and yet all this be no Argument that these Affections are divine, or that they are any other than the Effects of <hi>Satan's</hi> Delusions</p>
               <p>And I would further observe, that Persons may have raised and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Affections, which may come with the Word of God, and not only so, but from the Word, and those Affections not be from <hi>Satan,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:005767_0055_1026E02ADA018820"/>
nor yet properly from the Corruptions of their own Hearts, but from some Influence of the Spirit of God with the Word, and yet have nothing of the Nature of true and saving Religion in them. Thus the stony-ground Hearers had great Joy from the Word; yea which is represented as arising from the Word, as Growth from a Seed; and their Affections had, in their Appearance, a very great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Resemblance with those represented by the Growth on the good Ground, the Difference not appearing, 'till it was discovered by the Consequences, in a Time of Trial: And yet there was no saving Religion in these Affections. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> in his <hi>Guide to Christ,</hi> speaks of it as a <hi>common Thing,</hi> for Persons while in a natural Condition, and before they have ever truly <hi>accepted of Christ,</hi> to have Scripture <hi>Promises</hi> come to them, with <hi>a great deal of Refreshing;</hi> which they <hi>take as Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of God's Love, and hope that God has accepted them;</hi> and so are confident of their good Estate. Page 8, 9. Impression <hi>Anno</hi> 1735.</note>
               </p>
               <p>VI. 'Tis no Evidence that religious Affections are saving, or that they are otherwise, that there is an Appearance of Love in them.</p>
               <p>There are no professing Christians who pretend, that this is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the Truth and saving Nature of religious Affections. But on the other Hand, there are some who suppose, it is a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that Affections are from the sanctifying and saving Influences of the Holy Ghost. Their Argument is, that <hi>Satan cannot Love;</hi> this Affection being directly contrary to the Devil, whose very Nature is Enmity and Malice. And it is true, that nothing is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, heavenly and divine than a Spirit of true christian Love to God and Men: 'Tis more excellent than <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Prophecy,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> or <hi>speaking with the Tongue of Men and Angels.</hi> 'Tis the chief of the Graces of God's Spirit, and the Life, Essence and Sum of all true Religion; and that by which we are most conformed to Heaven, and most contrary to Hell and the Devil. But yet it is ill arguing from hence, that there are no Counterfeits of it. It may be observed, that the more excellent any Thing is, the more will be the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits of it. Thus there are many more Counterfeits of Silver and Gold, than of Iron and Copper: There are many false Diamonds and Rubies, but who goes about to counterfeit common Stones? Tho' the more excellent Things are, the more difficult it is to make any Thing that shall be like them, in their essential Nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Virtue; vet the more manifold will the Counterfeits be, and the more will Art and Subtilty be exercised and displayed, in an exact Imitation of the outward Appearance. Thus there is the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005767_0056_1027051CECC4B180"/>
greatest Danger of being cheated in buying of Medicines that are most excellent and sovereign, tho' it be most difficult to imitate 'em, with any thing of the like Value and Virtue, and their Counterfeits are good for nothing when we have them. So it is with christian Vertues and Graces; the Subtilty of <hi>Satan,</hi> and Men's deceitful Hearts, are wont chiefly to be exercised in counterfeiting those that are in highest Repute. So there are perhaps no Graces that have more Counterfeits than Love and Humility; these being Vertues wherein the Beauty of a true Christian does especially appear.</p>
               <p>But with Respect to Love; it is plain by the Scripture, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may have a Kind of religious Love, and yet have no saving Grace. Christ speaks of many professing Christians that have such Love, whose Love will not continue, and so shall fail of Salvation, Matth. 24. 12, 13. <hi>And because Iniquity shall abound, the Love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the End, the same shall be saved.</hi> Which latter Words plainly shew, that those spoken of before, whose Love should not <hi>endure to the End,</hi> but <hi>wax cold,</hi> should not be saved.</p>
               <p>Persons may seem to have Love to God and Christ, yea to have very strong and violent Affections of this Nature, and yet have no Grace. For this was evidently the Case with many graceless <hi>Jews,</hi> such as cried him up so high, following him Day and Night, without Meat, Drink or Sleep; such as said, <hi>Lord I will follow thee whither so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou goest,</hi> and cried <hi>Hosanna to the Son of</hi> David. <note n="†" place="bottom">Agreable to this Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> observes, in his <hi>Guide to Christ,</hi> That some Sinners <hi>have Pangs of Affection, and give an Account that they find a Spirit of Love to God, and of their aiming at the Glory of God, having that which has a great Resemblance of saving Grace,</hi> and that <hi>sometimes their common Affections are stronger than saving.</hi> And supposes that sometimes natural Men may have such <hi>violent Pangs of false Affection to God, that they may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves willing to be damned.</hi> Page 21, and 65.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle seems to intimate, that there were many in his Days, who had a counterfeit Love to Christ, in Eph. 6. 24. <hi>Grace be with all them that love the Lord Jesus Christ</hi> in Sincerity. The last Word, in the Original, signifies <hi>in Incorruption;</hi> which shews that the Apostle was sensible that there were many who had a Kind of Love to Christ, whose Love was not pure and spiritual.</p>
               <p>So also christian Love to the People of God may be counterfeited. 'Tis evident by the Scripture, that there may be strong Affections of this Kind, without saving Grace; as there were in the <hi>Galatians</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> when they were ready to pluck out their Eyes and give 'em to him; although the Apostle expresses his Fear
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005767_0057_102705214AB53DD0"/>
that their Affections were come to nothing, and that he had bestowed upon them Labour in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 11, 15.</p>
               <p>VII. Persons having religious Affections of many Kinds, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying one another, is not sufficient to determine whether they have any gracious Affections or no.</p>
               <p>Tho' false Religion is wont to be maimed and monstrous, and not to have that Entireness and Symmetry of Parts, which is to be seen in true Religion; yet there may be a great Variety of false Affections together, that may resemble gracious Affections.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident that there are Counterfeits of all Kinds of gracious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; as of <hi>Love to God,</hi> and <hi>Love to the Brethren,</hi> as has been just now observed: so of <hi>godly Sorrow for Sin,</hi> as in <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness; <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16, 17. and 26. 21. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 27. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 39, 40. and of the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> as in the <hi>Samaritans, who feared the Lord, and served their own Gods</hi> at the same Time; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 32, 33. and those Enemies of God we read of Psal. 66. 3. who <hi>through the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God's Power, submit themselves to him,</hi> or, as it is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>lie unto him,</hi> i. e. yield a counterfeit Reverence and Submission: so of a <hi>gracious Gratitude,</hi> as in the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who sang God's Praise at the red Sea, Psal. 106. 12. and <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> after his miraculous Cure of his Leprosy, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 15, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So of <hi>spiritual Joy,</hi> as in the stony-ground Hearers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. and particularly many of <hi>John the Baptist's</hi> Hearers, <hi>John</hi> 5. 35. So of <hi>Zeal,</hi> as in <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16. and in <hi>Paul</hi> before his Conversion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. and the unbelieving <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 22. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. So graceless Persons may have earnest religious <hi>Desires,</hi> which may be like <hi>Balaam'</hi>s Desires, which he expresses under an extraordinary View that he had of the happy State of God's People, as distinguished from all the rest of the World, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 9, 10. They may also have a strong <hi>Hope</hi> of eternal Life, as the Pharisees had.</p>
               <p>And as Men, while in a State of Nature, are capable of a Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of all Kinds of religious Affections, so nothing hinders but that they may have many of them together. And what appears in Fact does abundantly evince that it is very often so indeed. It seems com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be so, that when false Affections are raised high, there are many false Affections attend each other. The Multitude that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Christ into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> after that great Miracle of raising <hi>Lazarus,</hi> seem to be moved with many religious Affections at once, and all in a high Degree. They seem to be filled with <hi>Admiration,</hi> and there was a Shew of an high Affection of <hi>Love,</hi> and also of a great Degree of <hi>Reverence,</hi> in their laying their Garments on the Ground, for Christ to tread upon; and also of great <hi>Gratitude</hi> to him, for the great and good Works he had wrought, praising him with loud Voices
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005767_0058_10270522E5CE3CE8"/>
for his Salvation; and earnest <hi>Desires</hi> of the Coming of God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they supposed <hi>Jesus</hi> was now about to set up, and shewed great <hi>Hopes</hi> and raised Expectations of it, <hi>expecting it would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appear,</hi> and hence were filled with <hi>Joy,</hi> by which they were so animated in their Acclamations, as to make the whole City ring with the Noise of them; and appear'd great in their <hi>Zeal</hi> and Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to attend Jesus, and assist him without further Delay, now in the Time of the great Feast of the <hi>Passover,</hi> to set up his Kingdom. And it is easy, from Nature, and the Nature of the Affections, to give an Account why, when one Affection is raised very high, that it should excite others; especially if the Affection which is raised high, be that of counterfeit <hi>Love,</hi> as it was in the Multitude who cried <hi>Hosanna.</hi> This will naturally draw many other Affections after it. For, as was observed before, Love is the Chief of the Affections, and as it were the Fountain of them. Let us suppose a Person who has been for some Time in great Exercise and Terror thro' Fear of Hell, and his Heart weaken'd with Distress and dreadful Apprehensions, and upon the Brink of Despair, and is all at once deliver'd, by being firmly made to believe, thro' some Delusion of <hi>Satan,</hi> that God has pardon'd him, and accepts him as the Object of his dear Love, and promises him eternal Life: as suppose thro' some Vision, or strong Idea or Imagination, suddenly excited in him, of a Person with a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Countenance, smiling on him, and with Arms open, and with Blood dropping down, which the Person conceives to be Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Enlightning of the Understanding, to give a View of the spiritual divine Excellency of Christ and his Fulness, and of the Way of Salvation reveal'd in the Gospel; or perhaps by some Voice or Words coming as if they were spoke to him, such as those, <hi>Son, be of good Cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee,</hi> or, <hi>Fear not, it is the Father's good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> which he takes to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken by God to him, tho' there was no preceeding Acceptance of Christ, or closing of the Heart with him: I say, if we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such a Case, what various Passions would naturally croud at once, or one after another, into such a Person's Mind? It is easy to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, from meer Principles of Nature, that a Persons Heart, on such an Occasion, should be raised up to the Skies with Transports of Joy, and be fill'd with fervent Affection, to that imaginary God or Redeemer, who he supposes has thus rescued him from the Jaws of such dreadful Destruction, that his Soul was so amazed with the Fears of, and has received him with such Endearment, as a peculiar Favourite; and that now he should be fill'd with Admiration and Gratitude, and his Mouth should be open'd, and be full of Talk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what he has experienc'd; and that, for a while, he should think and speak of scarce any Thing else, and should seem to magnify that God who has done so much for him, and call upon others to rejoice
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005767_0059_10270524838B8FF0"/>
with him, and appear with a cheerful Countenances, and talk with a loud Voice: and however, before his Deliverance, he was full of quarrellings against the Justice of God, that now it should be easy for him to submit to God, and own his Unworthiness, and cry out against himself, and appear to be very humble before God, and lye at his Feet as tame as a Lamb; and that he should now confess his Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, and cry out, <hi>Why me? Why me?</hi> (Like <hi>Saul,</hi> who when <hi>Samuel</hi> told him that God had appointed him to be King, makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Am not I a</hi> Benjamite, <hi>of the smallest of the Tribes of</hi> Israel, <hi>and my Family the least of all the Families of the Tribe of</hi> Benjamin? <hi>Wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</hi> Much in the Language of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the true Saint, 2 Sam. 7. 18. <hi>Who am I, and what is my Father's House, that thou hast brought me hitherto!</hi>) Nor is it to be wonder'd at, that now he should delight to be with them who acknowledge and applaud his happy Circumstances, and should love all such as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and admire him and what he has experienc'd, and have violent Zeal against all such as would make nothing of such Things, and be disposed openly to separate, and as it were to proclaim War with all who ben't of his Party, and should now glory in his Sufferings, and be very much for condemning and censuring all who seem to doubt, or make any Difficulty of these Things; and while the Warmth of his Affections last, should be mighty forward to take Pains, and deny himself, to promote the Interest of the Party who he imagines favour such Things, and seem earnestly desirous to increase the Number of them, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> compassed Sea and Land to make one <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte</hi>

                     <q>Associating with godly Men don't prove that a Man has Grace: <hi>Ahithophel</hi> was <hi>David'</hi>s Companion. Sorrows for the Afflictions of the Church, and Desires for the Conversion of Souls, don't prove it. These Things may be found in carnal Men, and so can be no Evidences of Grace</q>. Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard'<hi>s Nature of saving Conversion,</hi> p. 82.</note>. And so I might go on, and mention many other Things, which will naturally arise in such Circumstances. He must have but slightly consider'd human Nature, who thinks such Things as these can't arise in this Manner, without any supernatural Interposition of divine Power.</p>
               <p>As from true divine Love flow all christian Affections, so from a counterfeit Love in like Manner, naturally flow other false Affections. In both Cases, Love is the Fountain, and the other Affections are the Streams. The various Faculties, Principles and Affections of the human Nature, are as it were many Channels from one Fountain: If there be sweet Water in the Fountain, sweet Water will from thence flow out into those various Channels; but if the Water in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005767_0060_102705262433BB10"/>
be poisonous, then poisonous Streams will also flow out into all those Channels. So that the Channels and Streams will be alike, corresponding one with another; but the great Difference will lye in the Nature of the Water. Or, Man's Nature may be compar'd to a Tree, with many Branches, coming from one Root: If the Sap in the Root be good, there will also be good Sap distributed thro' out the Branches, and the Fruit that is brought forth will be good and wholesome; but if the Sap in the Root and Stock be poisonous, so it will be in many Branches, (as in the other Case) and the Fruit will be deadly. The Tree in both Cases may be alike; there may be an exact Resemblance in Shape; but the Difference is found only in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fruit. 'Tis thus (in some Measure at least) oftentimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Saints and Hypocrites. There is sometimes a very great Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude between true and false Experiences, in their Appearance, and in what is expressed and related by the Subjects of them: and the Difference between them is much like the Difference between the Dreams of <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s chief Butler and Baker; they seem'd to be much alike; insomuch that when <hi>Joseph</hi> interpreted the chief Butler's Dream, that he should be deliver'd from his Imprisonment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to the King's Favour, and his honourable Office in the Palace, the chief Baker had raised Hopes and Expectations, and told his Dream also; but he was wofully disappointed; and tho' his Dream was so much like the happy and well-boding Dream of his Companion, yet it was quite contrary in its issue.</p>
               <p>VIII. Nothing can certainly be determined concerning the Nature of the Affections by this, that Comforts and Joys seem to follow A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings and Convictions of Conscience, in a <hi>certain Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many Persons seem to be prejudiced against Affections and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, that come in such a Method, as has been much insisted on by many Divines; first, such Awakenings, Fears and awful Apprehensions followed with such legal Humblings, in a Sense of total Sinfulness and Helplesness, and then, such and such Light and Comfort: they look upon all such Schemes, laying down such Methods and Steps, to be of Men's devising: And particularly if high Affections of Joy follow great Distress and Terror, it is made by many an Argument against those Affections. But such Prejudices and Objections are without Reason or Scripture. Surely it can't be unreasonable to suppose, that before God delivers Persons from a State of Sin and Exposedness to eternal Destruction, he should give them some considerable Sense of the Evil he delivers from; that they may be deliver'd sensibly, and understand their own Salvation, and know something of what God does does for them. As Men that are saved are in two exceeding different States, first a State of Condemnation, and then in a State of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Blessedness; and as God in the Work of the Salvation of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005767_0061_102705297A7220B0"/>
Mankind, deals with them suitably to their intelligent rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; so it seems reasonable, and agreeable to God's Wisdom, that Men who are saved, should be in these <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>o States sensibly, first, that they should sensibly to themselves, be in a State of Condemnation, and so in a State of woful Calamity and dreadful Misery, and so afterwards sensibly in a State of Deliverance and Happiness; and that they should be first sensible of their absolute extreme Necessity, and afterwards of Christ's Sufficiency and God's Mercy thro' him.</p>
               <p>And that it is God's Manner of dealing with Men, to <hi>lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wilderness, before he speaks comfortably to them,</hi> and so to order it, that they shall be brought into Distress, and made to see their own Helplesness, and absolute Dependance on his Power and Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he appears to work any great Deliverance for them, is abundantly manifest by the Scripture. Then is God wont to <hi>repent himself for his professing People, when their Strength is gone, and there is none shut up or left,</hi> and when they are brought to see that their false Gods can't help them, and that the Rock in whom they trusted is vain; <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 36, 37. Before God delivered the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were prepared for it, by being made to <hi>see that they were in on evil Case,</hi> and <hi>is cry unto God, because of their hard Bondage;</hi> Exod. 2. 23. and 5. 19. And before God wrought that great Deliverance for them at the Red Sea, they were brought into great Distress, <hi>the Wilderness had shut them in,</hi> they could not turn to the right Hand nor the left, and the <hi>Red Sea</hi> was before them, and the great <hi>Egyptian</hi> Host behind, and they were brought to see that they could do nothing to help themselves, and that if God did not help them, they should be immediately swallowed up; and then God appeared and turn'd their Cries into Songs. So before they were brought to their Rest, and to enjoy the Milk and Honey of <hi>Canaan,</hi> God <hi>led them through a great and terrible Wilderness, that he might humble them, and teach them what was in their Heart, and so do them Good in their latter End;</hi> Deut. 8. 2, 16. The Woman that had the Issue of Blood twelve Years, was not deliver'd, 'till she had first <hi>spent all her Living on earthly Physicians, and could not be healed of any,</hi> and so was left helpless, having no more Money to spend; and then she came to the great Physician, without any Money or Price, and was healed by him; <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 43, 44. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ would answer the Request of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he first seem'd utterly to deny her, and humbled her, and brought her to own herself worthy to be called a Dog; and then he shewed her Mercy, and received her as a dear Child; <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 22, &amp;c. The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> before a remarkable Deliverance, was <hi>pressed out of Measure, above Strength, insomuch that he despaired even of Life; but had the Sentence of Death in himself, that he might not trust in himself, but in God that raiseth the Dead;</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 8, 9, 10. There was first a great Tempest, and the Ship was covered with the Waves, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005767_0062_1027052D80035B60"/>
just ready to sink, and the Disciples were brought to cry to Jesus, <hi>Lord, save us, we perish;</hi> and then the Winds and Seas were rebuked, and there was a great Calm; <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. The Leper, before he is cleansed, must have his Mouth stop'd, by a covering on his upper Lip, and was to acknowledge his great Misery and utter Uncleanness, by rending his Cloaths, and crying, <hi>Unclean, unclean:</hi> Levit. 13. 45. And backsliding <hi>Israel,</hi> before God heals them, are brought to <hi>acknowledge that they have sinned, and have not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Voice of the Lord,</hi> and to see that <hi>they ly down in their Shame, and that Confusion covers them,</hi> and <hi>that in vain is Salvation hoped for from the Hills, and from the Multitude of Mountains,</hi> and that God only can save them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was sold by his Brethren, and therein was a Type of Christ, brings his Brethren into great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and Distress, and brings them to reflect on their Sin, and to say we are verily guilty; and at last to resign up themselves entirely into his Hands for Bondmen; and then reveals himself to them, as their Brother and their Saviour.</p>
               <p>And if we consider those extraordinary Manifestations which God made of himself to Saints of Old, we shall find that he commonly first manifested himself in a Way which was terrible, and then by those Things that were comfortable. So it was with <hi>Abraham;</hi> first a <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of great Darkness fell upon him,</hi> and then God revealed himself to him in sweet Promises; <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 12, 13. So it was with <hi>Moses</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> first, God appeared to him in all the Terrors of his dreadful Majesty, so that <hi>Moses</hi> said, I exceedingly fear and quake, and then he made all his Goodness to pass before him, and proclaimed his Name, <hi>the Lord God gracious and merciful,</hi> &amp;c. So it was with <hi>Elijah;</hi> first, there is a stormy Wind, and Earthquake, and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, and then a still, small, sweet Voice; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. So it was with <hi>Daniel;</hi> he first saw Christ's Countenance as Lightning, that terrified him, and caused him to faint away; and then he is strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and refreshed with such comfortable Words as these, <hi>O</hi> Daniel, <hi>a Man greatly beloved,</hi> Dan. 10. So it was with the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1. And there is an Analogy observable in God's Dispensations and Deliverances which he works for his People, and the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he makes of himself to them, both ordinary and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
               <p>But there are many Things in Scripture which do more directly shew, that this is God's ordinary Manner in working Salvation for the Souls of Men, and in the Manifestations God makes of himself and of his Mercy in Christ, in the ordinary Works of his Grace on the Hearts of Sinners. The Servant that owed his Prince ten thousand Talents, is first held to his Debt, and the King pronounces Sentence of Condemnation upon him, and commands him to be sold, and his Wife and Children, and Payment to be made; and thus he humbles
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005767_0063_10270531DAEB3C40"/>
him, and brings him to own the whole Debt to be just, and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives him all. The prodigal Son spends all he has, and is brought to see himself in extreme Circumstances, and to humble himself, and own his Unworthiness, before he is reliev'd and feasted by his Father; <hi>Luke</hi> 15. Old inveterate Wounds must be searched to the Bottom, in order to Healing. And the Scripture compares Sin, the Wound of the Soul, to this, and speaks of healing this Wound without thus search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as vain and deceitful; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 11. Christ, in the Work of his Grace on the Hearts of Men, is compared to Rain on the mown Grass, Grass that is cut down with a Scythe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 6. represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his refreshing, comforting Influences on the wounded Spirit. Our first Parents, after they had sinned, were first terrified with God's Majesty and Justice, and had their Sin, with its Aggravations, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them by their Judge, before they were reliev'd, by the Promise of the Seed of the Woman. Christians are spoken of as those <hi>that have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before them,</hi> Heb. 6. 18. which Representation implies great Fear, and Sense of Danger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. To the like Purpose, Christ is called <hi>a hiding Place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempest, and as Rivers of Water in a dry Place, and as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land;</hi> Isai. 32. at the Beginning. And it seems to be the natural Import of the Word <hi>Gospel,</hi> glad Tydings, that it is News of Deliverance and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, after great Fear and Distress. There is all Reason to suppose, that God deals with particular Believers, as he dealt with his Church, which he first made to hear his Voice in the Law, with terrible Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Lightnings, and kept her under that School Master, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her for Christ; and then comforted her with the joyful Sound of the Gospel from Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> So likewise <hi>John the Baptist</hi> came to prepare the Way for Christ, and prepare Men's Heart for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, by shewing them their Sins, and by bringing the self-righteous <hi>Jews</hi> off from their own Righteousness, telling them that they were a <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> and shewing them their Danger of <hi>the Wrath to come,</hi> telling them that <hi>the Ax was laid at the Root of the Trees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if it be indeed God's Manner (as I think the foregoing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations shew that it undoubtedly is) before he gives Men the Comfort of a Deliverance from their Sin and Misery, to give them a considerable Sense of the Greatness and Dreadfulness of those Evils, and their extreme Wretchedness by Reason of them; surely it is not unreasonable to suppose, that Persons, at least oftentimes, while under these Views, should have great Distress and terrible Apprehensions of Mind: Especially if it be consider'd what these Evils are, that they have a View of; which are no other than great and manifold Sins, against the infinite Majesty of the great Jehovah, and the Suffering of the Fierceness of his Wrath to all Eternity. And the more so still, when we have many plain Instances in Scripture, of Persons that have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005767_0064_10270533D09AD2F0"/>
actually been brought into extreme Distress, by such Convictions, before they have received saving Consolations: As the Multitude at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who were <hi>pricked in their Heart, and said unto</hi> Peter, <hi>and the rest of the Apostles, Men and Brethren, What shall we do?</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>trembled and was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>From these Things it appears to be very unreasonable in professing Christians, to make this an Objection against the Truth and spiritual Nature of the comfortable and joyful Affections which any have, that they follow such awful Apprehensions and Distresses, as have been mentioned.</p>
               <p>And on the other Hand, It is no Evidence that Comforts and Joys are right, because they succeed great Terrors, and amazing Fears of Hell <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> speaks of Men's <q>being cast down as low as Hell by Sorrow, and lying under Chains, quaking in Apprehension of Terror to come, and then raised up to Heaven in Joy, not able to live; and yet not rent from Lust, and such are Objects of Pity now, and are like to be the Objects of Terror at the great Day</q>. <hi>Parable of the ten Virgins,</hi> P. 1. p. 125.</note> This seems to be what some Persons lay great Weight upon; esteeming great Terrors an Evidence of a great Work of the Law wrought on the Heart, well preparing the Way for solid Comfort: Not considering that Terror, and a Conviction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, are different Things. For tho' Convictions of Conscience do often cause Terror; yet they don't consist in it; and Terrors do often arise from other Causes. Convictions of Conscience, thro' the Influences of God's Spirit, consist in Conviction of Sinfulness of Heart and Practice, and of the Dreadfulness of Sin, as committed against a God of terrible Majesty, infinite Holiness and Hatred of Sin, and strict Justice in punishing of it. But there are some Persons that have frightful Apprehensions of Hell, a dreadful Pit ready to swallow them up, and Flames just ready to lay hold of them, and Devils around them, ready to seize them; who at the same Time seem to have very little proper Enlightnings of Conscience, really convincing them of their Sinfulness of Heart and Life. The Devil, if permitted, can terrify Men as well as the Spirit of God: 'Tis a Work natural to him, and he has many Ways of doing it, in a Manner tending to no Good. He may exceedingly affright Persons, by impressing on them many external Images and Ideas, of a Countenance frowning, a Sword drawn, black Clouds of Vengeance, Words of an awful Doom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,

               <p>But if Comforts and Joys do not only come after great Terrors and Awakenings, but there be an Appearance of <hi>such</hi> preparatory Convictions and Humiliations, and brought about very distinctly, by <hi>such</hi> Steps, and in <hi>such</hi> a Method, as has frequently been observable in true Converts; this is no certain Sign that the Light and Comforts which follow are true and saving. And for these following Reasons,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As the Devil can counterfeit all the saving Operations and Graces of the Spirit of God, so he can counterfeit those Operations that are preparatory to Grace. If Satan can counterfeit those Effects of God's Spirit which are special, divine and sanctioning; so that there shall be a very great Resemblance, in all that can be observed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; much more easily may he imitate those Works of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which are common, and which Men, while that are yet his own Children, are the Subjects of. These Works are in no wise so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him as the other. There are no Works of God that are so high and divine, and above the Powers of Nature, and out of the Reach of the Power of all Creatures, as those Works of his Spirit, whereby he forms the Creature in his own Image, and makes it to be a Partaker of the divine Nature. But if the Devil can be the Author of such Resemblances of these as have been spoken of, without doubt he may of those that are of an infinitely inferiour Kind. And it is abundantly evident in Fact, that there are false Humiliations, and false Submissions, as well as false Comforts <note n="*" place="bottom">The venerable <hi>Stoddard</hi> observes, <q>A Man may say, that now he can justify God however he deals with him, and not be brought off from his own Righteousness; and that some Men do justify God, from a partial Conviction of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Condemnation; Conscience takes notice of their Sinfulness &amp; tells them that they may be righteously damn'd; as <hi>Pharach,</hi> who justified God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27. And they give some Kind of Consent to it, but many Times it don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, they have only a Pang upon them, that usually dies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after a little Time</q>. <hi>Guide to Christ,</hi> p. 71.</note>. How far was <hi>Saul</hi> brought, tho' a very
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005767_0067_1027053F0A678F18"/>
wicked Man, and of a haughty Spirit, when he (tho' a great King) was brought, in Conviction of his Sin, as it were to fall down, all in Tears, weeping aloud, before <hi>David</hi> his own Subject, (and one that he had for a long Time mortally hated, and openly treated as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy) and condemn himself before him, crying out, <hi>Thou art more Righteous than I. Thou hast rewarded me Good, whereas I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded thee Evil?</hi> And at another Time, <hi>I have sinned, I have played the Fool, I have erred suceedingly,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 16, 17. and Chap. 26. 21. And yet <hi>Soul</hi> seems then to have had very little of the Influences of the Spirit of God, it being after God's Spirit had departed from him, and given him up, and an evil Spirit from the Lord troubled him. And if this proud Monarch, in a Pang of Affection, was brought to humble himself so low, before a Subject that he hated, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued an Enemy to; there doubtless may be Appearances of great Conviction and Humiliation in Men, before God, while they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Enemies to him, and tho' they finally continue so. There is oftentimes in Men who are terrified thro' Fears of Hell, a great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their being brought off from their own Righteousness, when they are not brought off from it in all Ways, altho' they are in many Ways that are more plain and visible. They have only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd some Ways of trusting in their own Righteousness, for others that are more secret and subtil. Oftentimes a great Degree of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as to many Things they us'd to depend upon, is taken for Humiliation: And that is called a Submission to God, which is no absolute Submission, but has some secret Bargain in it, that it is hard to discover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Operations and Effects of the Spirit of God, in the Convictions and Comforts of true Converts may be sophisticated, then the Order of them may be imitated. If Satan can imitate the Things themselves, he may easily put them one after another, in such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Order. If the Devil can make A, B, and C, 'tis as easy for him to put A first, and B next, and C next, as to range 'em in a contrary Order. The Nature of divine Things is harder for the Devil to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, than their Order. He can't <hi>exactly</hi> imitate divine Operations in their Nature, tho' his Counterfeits may be very much like them in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005767_0068_10270540B3575750"/>
external Appearance; but he can exactly imitate their Order. When Counterfeits are made, there is no divine Power needful in order to the placing one of them first, and another last. And therefore no Order or Method of Operations and Experiences, is any certain Sign of their Divinity. That only is to be trusted to, as a certain Evidence of Grace, which Satan cannot do, and which it is impossible should be brought to pass by any Power short of divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have no certain Rule to determine how far God's own Spirit may go in those Operations and Convictions which in themselves are not spiritual and saving, and yet the Person that is the Subject of them, never be converted, but fall short of Salvation at last. There is no necessary Connection in the Nature of Things, between any Thing that a natural Man may experience, while in a State of Nature, and the saving Grace of God's Spirit. And if there be no Connection in the Nature of Things, then there can be no known and certain Connection at all, unless it be by divine Revelation. But there is no revealed certain Connection between a State of Salvation, and any Thing that a natural Man can be the Subject of, before he believes in Christ. God has revealed no certain Connection between Salvation, and any Qualifications in Men, but only Grace and its Fruits. And therefore we don't find any legal Convictions, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts following those legal Convictions, in any certain Method or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ever once mention'd in the Scripture, as certain Signs of Grace, or Things peculiar to the Saints; altho' we do find gracious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Effects themselves, so mention'd, Thousands of Times. Which should be enough with Christians, who are willing to have the Word of God, rather than their own Philosophy, and Experiences, and Conjectures, as their sufficient and sure Guide in Things of this Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Experience does greatly confirm, that Persons seeming to have Convictions &amp; Comforts following one another in such a Method and Order, as is frequently observable in true Converts, is no certain Sign of Grace <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> who had much Experience of Things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, long ago observed, that converted and unconverted Men can't be certainly distinguished by the Account they give of their Experience: The same <hi>Relation of Experiences being common to both.</hi> And <hi>that many Persons have given a fair Account of a Work of Conversion, that have carried well in the Eye of the World for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years, but have not proved well at last.</hi> Appeal to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, p. 75, and 76.</note>. I appeal to all those Ministers in this Land, who have had much Occasion of dealing with Souls, in the late extraordinary Season, whether there han't been many who don't prove well, that have given
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005767_0069_10270542E38287C8"/>
a fair Account of their Experiences, and have seem'd to be converted according to Rule, <hi>i. e.</hi> with Convictions and Affections, succeeding distinctly and exactly, in that Order and Method, which has been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily insisted on, as the Order of the Operations of the Spirit of God in Conversion.</p>
               <p>And as a Seeming to have this Distinctness as to Steps and Method, is no certain Sign that a Person is converted; so a being without it, is no Evidence that a Person is not converted. For tho' it might be made evident to a Demonstration, on Scripture Principles, that a Sinner can't be brought heartily to receive Christ as his Saviour, who is not convinced of his Sin and Misery, and of his own Emptiness and Helplesness, and his just desert of eternal Condemnation; and that therefore such Convictions must be some Way <hi>implied</hi> in what is wro't in his Soul; yet nothing proves it to be necessary, that all those Things which are implied or presupposed in an Act of Faith in Christ must be plainly and distinctly wrought in the Soul, in so many suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive and separate Works of the Spirit that shall be, each one, plain and manifest, in all who are truly converted. On the contrary, (as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> observes) sometimes the Change made in a Saint, at first Work, is like a confused Chaos; so that the Saints know not what to make of it. The Manner of the Spirit's proceeding in them that are born of the Spirit, is very often exceeding mysterious &amp; unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: We, as it were, hear the Sound of it, the Effect of it is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but no Man can tell whence it came, or whither it went. And 'tis oftentimes as difficult to know the Way of the Spirit in the new Birth, as in the first Birth: Eccl. 11. 5. <hi>Thou knowest not what is the Way of the Spirit, or how the Bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child: Even so thou knowest not the Work of God, that worketh all.</hi> The ingenerating of a Principle of Grace in the Soul, seems in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be compar'd to the conceiving of Christ in the Womb: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. And therefore the Church is called Christ's Mother, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11. And so is every particular Believer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 49, 50. And the Conception of Christ in the Womb of the blessed Virgin, by the Power of the holy Ghost, seems to be a designed Resemblance of the Conception of Christ in the Soul of a Believer, by the Power of the same holy Ghost. And we know not what is the Way of the Spirit, nor how the Bones do grow, either in the Womb, or Heart that conceives this holy Child. The new Creature may use that Language in Psal. 139. 14, 15. <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvellous are thy Works: And that my Soul knoweth right well. My Substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Generation of Christ, both in his Person, and also in the Hearts of his People, it may be said, as in Isai. 53. 8. <hi>Who can declare his Generation.</hi> We know not the Works of God, that worketh all. <hi>'Tis the Glory of God to conceal a Thing,</hi> (Prov. 25. 2.) and to have
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005767_0070_10270547AAE9C760"/>
                  <hi>his Path as it were in the mighty Waters, that his Footsteps may not be known:</hi> And especially in the Works of his Spirit on the Hearts of Men, which are the highest and chief of his Works. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, Isai. 40. 13. <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counsellor hath taught him.</hi> 'Tis to be feared that some have gone too far towards directing the Spirit of the Lord, and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Footsteps for him, and limiting him to certain Steps and Methods. Experience plainly shews, that God's Spirit is unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and untraceable, in some of the best of Christians, in the Method of his Operations, in their Conversion. Nor does the Spirit of God proceed discernably in the Steps of a particular established Scheme, one half so often as is imagined. A Scheme of what is necessary, and according to a Rule already received and established by common O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, has a vast (tho' to many a very insensible) Influence in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons Notions of the Steps and Method of their own Experiences. I know very well what their Way is; for I have had much Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to observe it. Very often, at first, their Experiences appear like a confused <hi>Chaos,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> expresses it: But then those Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of their Experience are pick'd out, that have most of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of such particular Steps that are insisted on; and these are dwelt upon in the Thoughts, and these are told of from Time to Time, in the Relation they give: These Parts grow brighter and brighter in their View; and others, being neglected, grow more and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: And what they have experienc'd is insensibly strain'd to bring all to an exact Conformity to the Scheme that is established. And it becomes natural for Ministers, who have to deal with them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them that insist upon Distinctness and Clearness of Method, to do so too. But yet there has been so much to be seen of the Operations of the Spirit of God, of late, that they who have had much to do with Souls, and are not blinded with a seven-fold Veil of Prejudice, must know that the Spirit is so exceeding various in the Manner of his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, that in many Cases it is impossible to trace him, or find out his Way.</p>
               <p>What we have principally to do with, in our Enquiries into our own State, or Directions we give to others, is the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Effect that God has brought to pass in the Soul. As to the Steps which the Spirit of God took to bring that Effect to pass, we may leave them to him. We are often in Scripture expresly directed to try our selves by the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Fruits of the Spirit; but no where by the Spirit's <hi>Method</hi> of producing them <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> speaking of the Soul's closing with Christ, says, <q>As a Child cannot tell how his Soul comes into it, nor it may be when; but afterwards it sees and feels that Life; so that he were as bad as a Beast, that should deny an immortal Soul; so here</q>.

               <p>IX. 'Tis no certain Sign that the religious Affections which Persons have are such as have in them the Nature of true Religion, or that they have not, that they dispose Persons to spend much Time in Religion, and to be zealously engaged in the external Duties of Worship.</p>
               <p>This has, very unreasonably, of late been looked upon as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the religious Affections which some have had, that they spend so much Time in reading, praying, singing, hearing Sermons, and the like. 'Tis plain from the Scripture that it is the Tendency of true Grace to cause Persons very much to delight in such religious Exercises. True Grace had this Effect on <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetess; Luke 1. 37. <hi>She departed not from the Temple; but served God with Fastings and Prayers, Night and Day.</hi> And Grace had this Effect upon the primitive Christians in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Acts 2. 46, 47. <hi>And they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily, with one Accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from House to House, did eat their Meat with Gladness, and Singleness of Heart, praising God.</hi> Grace made <hi>Daniel</hi> delight in the Duty of Prayer, and solemnly to attend it three Times a Day: As it also did <hi>David;</hi> Psal. 55. 17. <hi>Evening, Morning and at Noon</hi> will I pray. Grace makes the Saints delight in singing Praises to God: Psal. 135. 3. <hi>Sing Praises unto his Name, for it is pleasant.</hi> And 147. 1. <hi>Praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing Praises unto our God, for it is pleasant, and Praise is comely.</hi> It also causes them to delight to hear the Word of God
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005767_0072_1027054BF6FAF768"/>
preached: It makes the Gospel a joyful Sound to them; Psal. 89. 15. And makes the Feet of those who publish these good Tidings, to be beautiful; Isai. 52. 7. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains are the Feet of him that bringeth good Tidings,</hi> &amp;c! It makes them love God's publick Worship; Psal. 26. 8. <hi>Lord I have loved the Habitation of thy House, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</hi> And 27. 4. <hi>One Thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the House of the Lord, all the Days of my Life; to behold the Beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</hi> Psal. 84. 1, 2, &amp;c.—<hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! my Soul longeth, yea even fainteth, for the Courts of the Lord.—Yea the Sparrow hath found an House, and the Swallow a Nest for herself, where she may lay her Young, even thine Alters, O Lord of Hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in thine House,; they will be still praising thee. Blessed is the Man in whose Heart are the Ways of them, who passing through the Valley of</hi> Baca,—<hi>go from Strength to Strength, every one of them in</hi> Zion <hi>appeareth before God.</hi>—Ver. 10. <hi>A Day in thy Courts is better than a thousand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Nature of true Grace. But yet, on the other Hand, Persons being disposed to abound and to be zealously engaged in the external Exercises of Religion, and to spend much Time in them, is no sure Evidence of Grace; because such a Disposition is found in many that have no Grace. So it was with the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old, whose Services were abominable to God; they attended the <hi>new Moons, and Sabbaths, and calling of Assemblies, and spread forth their Hands, and made many Prayers;</hi> Isai. 1. 12,—15. So it was with the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> they <hi>made long Prayers, and fasted twice a Week.</hi> False Religion may cause Persons to be loud and earnest in Prayer: Isai. 58. 4. <hi>Ye shall not fast as ye do this Day, to cause your Voice to be heard on high.</hi> That Religion which is not spiritual and saving, may cause Men to delight in religious Duties and Ordinances: Isai. 58. 2. <hi>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my Ways; as a Nation that did Righteousness, and forsook not the Ordinance of their God. They ask of me the Ordinances of Justice, they take Delight in approaching to God.</hi> It may cause them to take Delight in hearing the Word of God preached; as it was with <hi>Ezekiel'</hi>s Hearers, Ezek. 33. 31, 32. <hi>And they come unto thee as my People cometh, and they sit before thee as my People, and they hear thy Words; but they will not do them: for with their Mouth they shew much Love; but their Heart goeth after their Covetousness. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, thou art unto them, as a very lovely Song, of one that hath a pleasant Voice, and can play well on an Instrument: For they hear thy Words, but they do them not.</hi> So it was with <hi>Herod;</hi> he <hi>heard</hi> John the Baptist <hi>gladly:</hi> Mark 6. 20. So it was with others of his Hearers, <hi>for a Season, they

rejoiced in his Light;</hi> John 5. 35. So the stony ground Hearers <hi>heard the Word with Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Experience shews that Persons, from false Religion, may be inclined to be exceeding abundant in the external Exercises of Religion; yea, to give themselves up to them, and devote almost their whole Time to them. Formerly a Sort of People were very numerous in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Church, called <hi>Recluses;</hi> who forsook the World, and utterly abandon'd the Society of Mankind, and shut themselves up close, in a narrow Cell, with a Vow never to stir out of it, nor to see the Face of any of Mankind any more; (unless that they might be visited in Case of Sickness) to spend all their Days in the Exercises of Devotion and Converse with God. There were also in old Time, great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes called <hi>Hermits</hi> and <hi>Authorites,</hi> that left the World to spend all their Days in lonesome Desarts, to give themselves up to religious Contemplations and Exercises of Devotion; some Sorts of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Dwellings, but the Caves and Vaults of the Mountains, and no Food, but the spontaneous Productions of the Earth.—I once lived, for many Months, next Door to a <hi>Jew,</hi> (the Houses adjoining one to another) and had much Opportunity daily to observe him; who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me the devoutest Person that ever I saw in my Life; great Part of his Time being spent in Acts of Devotion, at his eastern Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, which open'd next to mine, seeming to be most earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, not only in the Day-time, but sometimes whole Nights.</p>
               <p>X. Nothing can be certainly known of the Nature of religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by this, that they much dispose Persons with their Mouths to praise and glory God. This indeed is implied in what has been just now observed, of abounding and spending much Time in the external Exercises of Religion, and was also hinted before; but because many seem to look upon it as a bright Evidence of gracious Affection, when Persons appear greatly disposed to praise and magnify God, to have their Mouths full of his Praises, and affectionately to be calling on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to praise and extol him, I thought it deserved a more particular Consideration.</p>
               <p>No Christian will make it an Argument against a Person, that he seems to have such a Disposition. Nor can it reasonably be look'd upon as an Evidence for a Person, if these Things that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready observed and proved, be duly considered, <hi>viz.</hi> that Persons, without Grace, may have high Affections towards God and Christ, and that their Affections, being strong, may fill their Mouths, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to speak much, and very earnestly, about the Things they are affected with, and that there may be Counterfeits of all Kinds of gracious Affection. But it will appear more evidently and directly, that this is no certain Sign of Grace, if we consider what Instances the Scripture gives us of it in those that were graceless. We often

               <p>It is an Argument with some, against Persons, that they are deluded if they pretend to be assured of their good Estate, and to be carry'd beyond all Doubting of the Favour of God; supposing that there is no such Thing to be expected in the Church of God, as a full and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Assurance of Hope; unless it be in some very extraordinary Circumstances; as in the Case of Martyrdom: Contrary to the Doctrine of Protestants, which has been maintained by their most ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Writers against the Papists; and contrary to the plair <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Evidence. It is manifest that it was a common Thing for the Saints that we have a History, or particular Account of in Scripture, to be assured.

                     </gap>, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Daniel,</hi> and others. <hi>Job</hi> often speaks of his Sincerity and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the greatest imaginable Confidence and Assurance, often calling God to witness to it; and says plainly, <hi>I know that my Redeems liveth, and that I shall see him for my self, and not another,</hi> Job. 19. 25. &amp;c. <hi>David,</hi> throughout the Book of Psalms, almost every where speaks without any Hesitancy, and in the most positive Manner of God as his God; glorifying in him as his Portion and Heritage, his Rock and Confidence, his Shield, Salvation, and high Tower, and the like. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> appeals to God, as one that knew that he had walked before him in Truth and with a perfect Heart, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 3. Jesus Christ, in his dying Discourse with his eleven Disciples, in the 14th, 15th and 16th Chapters of <hi>John,</hi> (which was as it were Christ's last Will and Testament to his Disciples, and to his whole Church) often declares his special and everlasting Love to them, in the plainest and most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Terms; and promises them a future Participation with him in his Glory, in the most absolute Manner; and tells them at the same Time, that he does so, to the End, that their Joy might be <hi>full;</hi> John 15. 11. <hi>These Things have I spoken unto you, that my Joy night remain in you, and that your Joy might be full.</hi> See also at the Conclusion of his whole Discourse, Chap. 16. 33. <hi>These Things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have Peace. In the World ye shall Tribulation; but be of good Cheer, I have overcome the World.</hi> Christ was not afraid
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005767_0076_10270558AEFA4690"/>
of speaking too plainly and positively to them: He did not desire to hold them in the least Suspense. And he concluded that last Discourse of his, with a Prayer in their Presence, wherein he speaks positively to his Father of those eleven Disciples, as having all of them savingly known him, and believed in him, and received and kept his Word; and that they were not of the World; and that for their Sakes he sanctified himself; and that his Will was that they should be with him in his Glory: And tells his Father, that he spoke these Things in his Prayer, to the End, that his Joy might be fulfilled in them, Verse 13. By these Things it is evident, that 'tis agreeable to Christ's Designs, and the continued Ordering and Disposition Christ makes of Things in his Church, that there should be sufficient and abundant Provision made, that his Saints might have full Assurance of their future Glory.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> thro' all his Epistles, speaks in an assured Strain; ever speaking positively of his special Relation to Christ, his Lord and Master and Redeemer, and his Interest in, and Expectation of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reward. It would be endless to take notice of all Places that might be enumerated; I shall mention but three or four, Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Christ liveth in me, and the Life which I now live in the Flesh I live by the Faith of the Son of God; who loved me, and gave him of for me.</hi> Phil. 1. 21. <hi>For me to live is Christ, and to die is Gain.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed; and I am perswaded that he is able to keep that which I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmitted to him, against that Day.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 8. <hi>I have fought a good Fight; I have finished my Course; I have kept the Faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, and God's declared Ends in the Appointment and Constitution of Things in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, do plainly shew it to be God's Design to make ample Provision for the Saints having an assured Hope of eternal Life, while living here upon Earth. For so are all Things ordered and contrived in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that every Thing might be made sure on God's Part. <hi>The Covenant is ordered in all Things, and sure:</hi> The Promises are most full, and very often repeated, and various Ways exhibited; and there are many Witnesses, and many Seals; and God has confirmed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises with an Oath. And God's declared Design in all this is, that the Heirs of the Promises might have an undoubting Hope, and full Joy, in an Assurance of their future Glory. Heb. 6. 17, 18. <hi>Wherein God willing, more abundantly to shew to the Heirs of Promise, the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his Counsel, confirmed it by an Oath; that by two immutable Things, in which it was impossible for God to Lie, we might have a strong Consolation, who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before us.</hi> But all this would be in vain, to any such Purpose, as the Saints strong Consolation, and Hope of their obtaining future Glory, if their Interest in those sure Promises in ordinary Cases, was but attainable.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005767_0077_1027055A82748658"/>
For God's Promises and Oaths, let them be as sure as they will, can't give strong Hope and Comfort to any particular Person, any further than he can know that those Promises are made to him. And in vain is Provision made in Jesus Christ, that Believers might be perfect as pertaining to the Conscience, as is signified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. if Assurance of Freedom from the Guilt of Sin is not attainable.</p>
               <p>It further appears that Assurance is not only attainable in some very extraordinary Cases, that <hi>all</hi> Christians are directed to give all Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure, and are told how they may do it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5,—8. And 'tis spoken of as a Thing very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of Christians, and an Argument of something very blameable in them, not to know whether Christ be in them or no; 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</hi> And 'tis implied that it is an Argument of a very blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Negligence in Christians, if they practice Christianity after such a Manner as to remain uncertain of the Reward, in that 1 Cor. 9. 26. <hi>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly.</hi> And to add no more, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that Christians knowing their Interests in the saving Benefits of Christianity is a Thing ordinarily attainable, because the Apostles tell us by what Means <hi>Christians</hi> (and not only <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi>) were won't to know this; 1 Cor. 2. 12. <hi>Now we have received, not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> And 1 John 2. 3. <hi>And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</hi> And Verse 5. <hi>Hereby know we that we are in him.</hi> Chap. 3. 14. <hi>We know that we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren.</hi> Verse 19. <hi>Hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts before him.</hi> Verse 24. <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that he hath given us.</hi> So Chap. 4. 13. and Chap. 5. 2. and Verse 19.</p>
               <p>Therefore it must needs be very unreasonable to determine, that Persons are Hypocrites, and their Affections wrong, because they seem to be out of Doubt of their own Salvation, and the Affections they are the Subjects of seem to banish all Fears of Hell.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, it is no sufficient Reason to determine that Men are Saints, and their Affections gracious, because the Affections they have are attended with an exceeding Confidence that their State is good, and their Affections divine <note n="†" place="bottom">

from their Confidence, how great and strong soever it seems to be. If we see a Man that boldly calls God his Father, and commonly speaks in the most bold, familiar and appropriating Language in Prayer, <hi>My Father, my dear Redeemer, my sweet Saviour, my Beloved,</hi> and the like,—and it is a common Thing for him to use the most confident Expressions before Men, about the Goodness of his State; such as, <hi>I know certainly that God is my Father; I know so surely as there is a God in Heaven, that he is my God; I know I shall go to Heaven, as well as if I were there; I know that God is now manifesting himself to my Soul, and is now smiling upon me:</hi> And seems to have done forever with any Enquiry or Examination into his State, as a Thing sufficiently known, and out of Doubt, and to contemn all that so much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or suggest that there is some Reason to Doubt or Fear whether all is right; such Things are no Signs at all that it is indeed so as he is confident it is <note n="*" place="bottom">

Sort of Confidence as this, so affecting to declare it self with a most glaring Show, in the Sight of Men, which is to be seen in many, has not the Countenance of a true christian Assurance: It favours more of the Spirit of the Pharisees, who never doubted but that they were Saints, and the most eminent of Saints, and were bold to go to God, and come up near to him, and lift up their Eyes, and thank him for the great Distinction he had made between them and other Men; and when Christ intimated that they were blind and graceless, despised the Suggestion; John 9. 40. <hi>And some of the Pharisees which were with him, heard these Words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</hi> If they had more of the Spirit of the <hi>Publican,</hi> with their Confidence, who in a Sense of his exceeding Unworthiness, stood afar off, and durst not so much as lift up his Eyes to Heaven, but smote on his Breast, and cried out of himself as a Sinner, their Confidence would have more of the Aspect of the Confidence of one that humbly trusts and hopes in Christ, and has no Confidence in himself.</p>
               <p>If we do but consider what the Hearts of natural Men are, what Principles they are under the Dominion of, what Blindness and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, what Self-Flattery, Self-Exaltation and Self-Confidence reigns there, we need not at all wonder that their high Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and Confidence of their happy Circumstances, be as high and strong as Mountains, and as violent as a Tempest, when once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is blinded, and Convictions kill'd, with false, high Affections, and those foremention'd Principles let loose, fed up and prompted by false Joys and Comforts, excited by some pleasing Imaginations im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by <hi>Satan,</hi> transforming himself into an Angel of Light.</p>
               <p>When once a Hypocrite is thus establish'd in a false Hope, he han't those Things to cause him to call his Hope in Question, that oftentimes are the Occasion of the Doubting of true Saints; as <hi>First,</hi> He han't that cautious Spirit, that great Sense of the vast Importance of a sure Foundation, and that Dread of being deceived. The Comforts of the true Saints increase Awakening and Caution, and a lively Sense how great a Thing it is to appear before an infinitely holy, just and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient Judge. But false Comforts put an End to these Things, and dreadfully stupify the Mind. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Hypocrite has not the Knowledge of his own Blindness, and the Deceitfulness of his own Heart, and that mean Opinion of his own Understanding, that the true Saint has. Those that are deluded with false Discoveries and Affections, are evermore highly conceited of their Light and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Devil don't assault the Hope of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005767_0080_10270565E0097A20"/>
as he does the Hope of a true Saint. The Devil is a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to a true christian Hope, not only because it tends greatly to the Comfort of him that hath it, but also because it is a Thing of a holy, heavenly Nature, greatly tending to promote and cherish Grace in the Heart, and a great Incentive to Strictness and Diligence in the christian Life. But he is no Enemy to the Hope of a Hypocrite, which above all Things establishes his Interest in him that has it. A Hypocrite may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tain his Hope without Opposition, as long as he lives, the Devil never disturbing it, nor attempting to disturb it. But there is perhaps no true Christian but what has his Hope assaulted by him. <hi>Satan</hi> assaulted Christ himself, upon this, whether he were the Son of God or no: And the Servant is not above his Master, nor the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple above his Lord; 'tis enough for the Disciple, that is most privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in this World, to be as his Master. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He who has a false Hope has not that Sight of his own Corruptions, which the Saint has. A true Christian has ten Times so much to do with his Heart, and its Corruptions, as an Hypocrite: And the Sins of his Heart and Practice, appear to him in their Blackness; they look dreadful; and it often appears a very mysterious Thing that any Grace can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with such Corruption, or should be in such a Heart. But a false Hope hides Corruption, covers it all over, and the Hypocrite looks clean and bright in his own Eyes.</p>
               <p>There are two Sorts of Hypocrites: one that are deceived with their outward Morality and external Religion; many of which are profess'd <hi>Arminians,</hi> in the Doctrine of Justification: And the other, are those that are deceived with false Discoveries and Elevations; which often cry down Works, and Mens own Righteousness, and talk much of free Grace; but at the same Time make a Righteousness of their Discoveries, and of their Humiliation, and exalt themselves to Heaven with them. These two Kinds of Hypocrites Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> in his Exposition of the Parable of the ren Virgins, distinguishes by the Names of <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>evangelical</hi> Hypocrites; and often speaks of the latter as the worst. And 'tis evident that the latter are commonly by far the most confident in their Hope, and with the most Difficulty brought off from it: I have scarcely known the Instance of such an one, in my Life, that has been undeceived. The chief Grounds of the Confidence of many of them, are the very same Kind of Impulses and supposed Revelations, (sometimes with Texts of Scripture, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without) that so many of late have had concerning future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; calling these Impulses about their good Estate, the Witness of the Spirit; intirely misunderstanding the Nature of the Witness of the Spirit, as I shall shew hereafter. Those that have had Visions and Impulses about other Things, it has generally been to reveal such Things as they are desirous and fond of: And no wonder that Persons who give heed to such Things, have the same Sort of Visions or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005767_0081_10270568E09E5B68"/>
about their own eternal Salvation, to reveal to them that their Sins are forgiven them, that their Names are written in the Book of Life, that they are in high Favour with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and especially when they earnestly seek, expect and wait for Evidence of their Election and Salvation this Way, as the surest and most glorious Evidence of it. Neither is it any Wonder, that when they have such a supposed Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their good Estate, it raises in them the highest Degree of Confidence of it. 'Tis found by abundant Experience that those who are led away by Impulses and imagined Revelations, are extremely confident: They suppose that the great Jehovah has declared these and those Things to them; and having his immediate Testimony, a strong Confidence is the highest Vertue. Hence they are bold to say, <hi>I know this or that;—I know certainly;—I am as sure as that I have a Being,</hi> and the like: And they despise all Argument and Enquiry in the Case. And above all Things else, 'tis easy to be accounted for, that Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Impulses about that which is so pleasing, so suiting their Self-Love and Pride, as their being the dear Children of God, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from most in the World in his Favour, should make them strongly confident: Especially when with their Impulses and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations they have high Affections, which they take to be the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Exercises of Grace. I have known of several Persons, that have had a fond Desire of something of a temporal Nature, thro' a violent Passion that has possessed them, and they have been earnestly pursuing the Thing they have desired should come to pass, and have met with great Difficulty and many Discouragements in it, but at last have had an Impression or supposed Revelation that they should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what they sought; and they have look'd upon it as a sure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from the most High, which has made them most ridiculously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, against all Manner of Reason to convince them to the contrary, and all Events working against them. And there is nothing hinders, but that Persons who are seeking their Salvation, may be deceived by the like delusive Impressions, and be made confident of that, the same Way.</p>
               <p>The Confidence of many of this Sort of Hypocrites, that Mr. <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi> calls <hi>evangelical Hypocrites,</hi> is like the Confidence of some mad Men, who think they are Kings: They will maintain it against all Manner of Reason and Evidence. And in one Sense, it is much more immoveable than a truly gracious Assurance; a true Assurance is not upheld, but by the Soul's being kept in a holy Frame, and Grace maintain'd in lively Exercise. If the Actings of Grace do much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in the Christian, and he falls into a lifeless Frame, he looses his Assurance: But this Kind of Confidence of Hypocrites will not be shaken by Sin: They, (at least some of them) will maintain their Boldness in their Hope, in the most corrupt Frames and wicked

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> speaks of it, as a <hi>presumptuous Peace, that is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and broke by evil Works.</hi> And says, that the <hi>Spirit will sigh, and not sing in that Bosom, whence corrupt Dispositions and Passions break out.</hi> And that <hi>tho' Men in such Frames may seem to maintain the Consolation of the Spirit, and not suspect their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy, under Pretence of trusting the Lord's Mercy; yet they can't avoid the Condemnation of the Word.</hi> Parable of the ten Virgins, Part 1. p. 139.</p>

               <p>And here I can't but observe, that there are certain Doctrines often preach'd to the People, which need to be deliver'd with more Caution and Explanation than they frequently are; for as they are by many understood, they tend greatly to establish this Delusion and false Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Hypocrites. The Doctrines I speak of are those of <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians living by Faith, not by Sight; their giving Glory to God, by trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the Dark; living upon Christ, and not upon Experiences; not making their good Frames the Foundation of their Faith:</hi> Which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and important Doctrines indeed, rightly understood, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and destructive, as many understand them. The Scripture speaks of living or walking by Faith, and not by Sight, in no other Way than these, <hi>viz.</hi> a being govern'd by a Respect to eternal Things, that are the Objects of Faith, and are not seen, and not by a Respect to temporal Things, which are seen; and believing Things revealed that we never saw with bodily Eyes; and also living by Faith in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of future Things; without yet seeing or enjoying the Things promised, or knowing the Way how they can be fulfilled. This will be easily evident to any one that looks over the Scriptures which speak of <hi>Faith</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Sight;</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. and 5. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1, 8, 13, 17, 27, 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. <hi>John</hi> 20. 29. But this Doctrine, as it is understood by many, is that Christians ought firmly to believe and trust in Christ, without spiritual Sight or Light, and altho' they are in a dark dead Frame, and, for the present, have no spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences or Discoveries. And it is truly the Duty of those who are thus in Darkness, to come out of Darkness into Light, and believe. But that they should confidently believe and trust, while they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without spiritual Light or Sight, is an antiscriptural and absurd Doctrine. The Scripture is ignorant of any such Faith in Christ of

the Operation of God, that is not founded in a spiritual Sight of Christ. That believing on Christ, which accompanies a Title to everlasting Life, is a <hi>seeking the Son, and believing on him,</hi> John 6. 40. True Faith in Christ is never exercised, any further than Persons <hi>behold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They into whose Minds <hi>the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, does not shine: They believe not;</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. That Faith, which is without spiritual Light, is not the Faith of the Children of the Light, and of the Day; but the Presumption of the Children of Darkness. And therefore to press and urge them to believe, without any spiritual Light or Sight, tends greatly to help forward the Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Prince of Darkness. Men not only can't exercise Faith without some spiritual Light, but they can exercise Faith only just in such Proportion as they have spiritual Light. Men will trust in God no further than they know him: And they can't be in the Exercise of Faith in him one Ace further than they have a Sight of his Fulness and Faithfulness <hi>in Exercise.</hi> Nor can they have the Exercise of Trust in God, any further than they are in a <hi>gracious Frame.</hi> They that are in a dead carnal Frame, doubtless ought to trust in God; because that would be the same Thing as coming out of their bad Frame, and turning to God: But to exhort Men confidently to trust in God, and so hold up their Hope and Peace, tho' they are not in a gracious Frame, and continue still to be so, is the same Thing in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to exhort them confidently to trust in God, but not with a gracious Trust: And what is that but a wicked Presumption? It is just so impossible for Men to have a strong or lively trust in God, when they have no lively Exercises of Grace, or sensible christian Experiences, as it is for them to be in the lively Exercises of Grace, without the Exercises of Grace.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that it is the Duty of God's People to trust in him, when in Darkness, and tho' they remain still in Darkness, in that Sense, that they ought to trust in God when the Aspects of his Providence are dark, and look as tho' God had forsaken them, and did not hear their Prayers, and many Clouds gather, and many Enemies surround them, with a formidable Aspect, threatning to swallow them up, and all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Providence seem to be against them, all Circumstances seem to render the Promises of God difficult to be fulfill'd, and God must be trusted out of Sight, <hi>i. e.</hi> when we can't see which Way it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to fulfill his Word, every Thing but God's meer Word makes it look unlikely, so that if Persons believe, they must Hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Hope. Thus the antient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and the Psalmist, and <hi>Jeremiah, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshech</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> gave Glory to God by trusting in God in Darkness. And we have many Instances of such a glorious victorious Faith in the Eleventh
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:005767_0084_1027057269305B78"/>
of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But how different a Thing is this, from trusting in God without spiritual Sight, and being at the same Time in a dead and carnal Frame!</p>
               <p>There is also such a Thing as spiritual Light's being let into the Soul in one Way, when it is not in another; and so there is such a Thing as the Saints trusting in God, and also knowing their good Estate, when they are destitute of some Kinds of Experience. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, they may have clear Views of God's Sufficiency and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and so confidently trust in him, and know that they are his Children; and at the same Time, not have those clear and sweet Ideas of his Love, as at other Times: For it was thus with Christ himself in his last Passion. And they may have Views of much of God's Sovereignty, Holiness and Alsufficiency, enabling them quietly to submit to him, and exercise a sweet and most encouraging Hope in God's Fulness, when they are not satisfy'd of their own good Estate. But how different Things are these, from confidently trusting in God, without spiritual Light or Experience!</p>
               <p>Those that thus insist on Persons living by Faith, when they have no Experience, and are in very bad Frames, are also very absurd in their Notions of Faith. What they mean by Faith is, believing that they are in a good Estate. Hence they count it a dreadful Sin for them to doubt of their State, whatever Frames they are in, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wicked Things they do, because 'tis the great and heinous Sin of Unbelief; and he is the best Man, and puts most Honour upon God, that maintains his Hope of his good Estate the most confidently and immoveably, when he has the least Light or Experience; that is to say, when he is in the worst and wickedest Frame and Way; because, forsooth, that is a Sign that he is strong in Faith, giving Glory to God, and against Hope believes in Hope. But what Bible do they learn this Notion of Faith out of, that it is a Man's confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that he is in a good Estate? <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Men don't know that they are godly, by believing that they are godly. We know many Things by Faith, Heb. 11. 3. <hi>By Faith we understand that the Worlds were made by the Word of God.</hi> Faith is the Evidence of Things not seen; Heb. 11. 1. Thus Men know the Trinity of Persons of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in him will have eternal Life; the Resurrection of the Dead. And if God should tell a Saint that he hath Grace, he might know it by believing the Word of God. But it is not this Way, that godly Men do know that they have Grace. It is not revealed in the Word; and the Spirit of God doth not testify it to particular Persons</q>. <hi>Stoddard'</hi>s Nature of saving Conversion, p. 83, 84.</note> If this be Faith, the Pharisees
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005767_0085_10270574106EE0F0"/>
had Faith in an eminent Degree; some of which, Christ teaches, committed the unpardonable Sin against the Holy Ghost. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture represents Faith, as that by which Men are <hi>brought into</hi> a good Estate; and therefore it can't be the same Thing, as believing that they <hi>are already</hi> in a good Estate. To suppose that Faith consists in Persons believing that they are in a good Estate, is in effect the same Thing, as to suppose that Faith consists in a Person's believing that he has Faith, or in believing that he believes.</p>
               <p>Indeed Persons doubting of their good Estate, may in several Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <hi>arise from</hi> Unbelief. It may be from Unbelief, or because they have so little Faith, that they have so little <hi>Evidence</hi> of their good Estate: If they had more Experience of the Actings of Faith, and so more Experience of the Exercise of Grace, they would have clearer Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that their State was good; and so their Doubts would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. And then their doubting of their State may be from Unbelief thus, When tho' there be many Things that are good Evidences of a Work of Grace in 'em, yet they doubt very much whether they are really in a State of Favour with God, because it is <hi>they,</hi> those that are so unworthy, and have done so much to provoke God to Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Their Doubts in such a Case arise from Unbelief, as they arise from want of a sufficient Sense <hi>of,</hi> and reliance <hi>on</hi> the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Riches of God's Grace, and the Sufficiency of Christ for the Chief of Sinners. They may also be from Unbelief, when they doubt of their State, because of the Mystery of God's Dealings with them: They are not able to reconcile such Dispensations with God's Favour to them: Or when they doubt whether they have any Interest in the Promises, because the Promises from the Aspects of Providence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so unlikely to be fulfilled; the Difficulties that are in the Way, are so many and great. Such Doubting arises from want of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God's Almighty Power, and his Knowledge and Wisdom, as infinitely above theirs. But yet, in such Persons, their Unbelief, and their Doubting of their State, are not the same Thing; tho' one arises from the other.</p>
               <p>Persons may be greatly to blame for doubting of their State, on such Grounds as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> last mentioned; and they may be to blame, that they have no more Grace, and no more of the present Exercises and Experiences of it, to be an Evidence to 'em of the Goodness of their State: Men are doubtless to blame for being in a dead carnal Frame; but when they are in such a Frame, and have no sensible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Exercises of Grace, but on the contrary, are very much under the Prevalence of their Lusts, and an unchristian Spirit, they are not to blame for doubting of their State. 'Tis as impossible, in the Nature of Things, that a holy and christian Hope, should be kept alive, in its Clearness and Strength, in such Circumstances, as it is to keep the Light in the Room, when the Candle is put out; or
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005767_0086_102705775E815F38"/>
to maintain the bright Sun-shine in the Air, when the Sun is gone down.

               <p>But to return from this Digression, I would mention one Thing more under the general Head that I am upon.</p>
               <p>XII. Nothing can be certainly concluded concerning the Nature of religious Affections, that any are the Subjects of, from this, that the outward Manifestations of them, and the Relation Persons give of

them, are very affecting and pleasing to the truly Godly, and such as greatly gain their Charity, and win their Hearts.</p>
               <p>The true Saints have not such a Spirit of discerning, that they can certainly determine who are godly, and who are not. For tho' they know experimentally what true Religion is, in the internal Exercises of it; yet these are what they can neither feel, nor see, in the Heart of another <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Men may have the Knowledge of their own Conversion: The Knowledge that other Men have of it is uncertain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no Man can look into the Heart of another, and see the Workings of Grace there.</q>

Chap. 15. at the Beginning.</note> There is nothing in others, that comes within their View, but outward Manifestations and Appearances; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly intimates that this Way of judging what is in Men by outward Appearances, is at best uncertain, and liable to Deceit; 1 Sam. 16. 7. <hi>The Lord seeth not as Man seeth; for Man looketh on the outward Appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi> Isai. 11. 3. <hi>He shall not judge after the Sight of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

And truly, considering what hath been said, 'tis no Wonder that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Mistakes are so frequently made in this Matter.</q>

They betray one of these three Things; either that they have had but little Experience; or are Persons of a weak Judgment; or that they have a great Degree of Pride and Self-Confidence, and so Ignorance of themselves. Wise and experienced Men will proceed with great Caution in such an Affair.</p>

When there are many probable Appearances of Piety in others, it is the Duty of the Saints to receive them cordially into their Charity, and to love them and rejoice in them, as their Brethren in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. But yet the best of Men may be deceived, when the Appearances seem to them exceeding fair and bright, even so as entirely to gain their Charity, and conquer their Hearts. It has been a common Thing in the Church of God, for such bright Professors, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as eminent Saints, among the Saints, to fall away and come to nothing <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Be not offended, if you see great Cedars fall, Stars fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, great Professors die and decay: Do not think they be all such: Do not think that the Elect shall fall. Truly, some are such, that when they fall, one would think a Man truly sanctified might fall away, as the <hi>Arminions</hi> think. 1 Joh. 2. 19. <hi>They were not of us.</hi> I speak this, because the Lord is shaking; and I look for great Apostacies: For God is trying all his Friends, thro' all the Christian World. In <hi>Germany</hi> what Profession was there! Who would have tho't it? The Lord who delights to manifest that openly, which was hid secretly, sends a Sword and they fall.</q> 
                     <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Parab. Part I. p. 118, 119. <q>The Saints may approve thee, and God condemn thee; Rev. 3. 1. <hi>Thou hast a Name that thou livest, and art dead.</hi> Men may say, There is a true <hi>Nathanael;</hi> and God may say, There is a self-cozening <hi>Pharisee.</hi>—Reader, Thou hast heard of <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> once renown'd and famous Professors, and thou hast heard how they proved at last</q>. <hi>Flavel'</hi>s Touchstone of Sincerity, Chap. 2. Sect. 5.</note>. And this we need not wonder at, if we consider the Things that have been already observed; what Things it has been shown, may appear in Men who are altogether graceless. Nothing hinders but that all these Things may meet together in Men, and yet they be without a Spark of Grace in their Hearts. They may have religious Affections of many Kinds together; they may have a Sort of Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards God, that bears a great Resemblance of dear Love to him; and so a kind of Love to the Brethren, and great Appearances of Admiration of God's Perfections and Works, and Sorrow for Sin, and Reverence, Submission, Self-Abasement, Gratitude, Joy, religious Longings, and Zeal for the Interest of Religion and the Good of Souls. And these Affections may come after great Awakenings and Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Conscience; and there may be great Appearances of a Work of Humiliation; and counterfeit Love and Joy, and other Affections may seem to fellow these, and one another, just in the same Order, that is commonly observable in the holy Affections of true Converts.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005767_0090_10270582A54FECF8"/>
And these religious Affections may be carried to a great Height, and may cause Abundance of Tears, yea, may overcome the Nature of those who are the Subjects of them, and may make them affectionate, and fervent, and fluent in speaking of the Things of God, and dispose them to be abundant in it; and may be attended with many sweet Texts of Scripture, and precious Promises, brought with great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on their Minds; and may dispose them with their Mouths to praise and glorify God, in a very ardent Manner, and fervently to call upon others to praise him, crying out of their Unworthiness, and extolling free Grace. And may, moreover, dispose them to abound in the external Duties of Religion, such as Prayer, hearing the Word preached, Singing, and religious Conference: and these Things attended with a great Resemblance of a christian Assurance, in its greatest Height, when the Saints mount on Eagles Wings, above all Darkness and Doubting. I think it has been made plain, that there may be all these Things, and yet there be nothing more than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Influences of the Spirit of God, join'd with the Delusions of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and the wicked and deceitful Heart. To which I may add, that all these Things may be attended with a sweet natural Temper, and a good doctrinal Knowledge of Religion, and a long Acquaintance with the Saints Way of talking and of expressing their Affections and Experiences, and a natural Ability and Subtilty in accommodating their Expressions &amp; Manner of speaking to the Dispositions &amp; Notions of the Hearers, and a taking Decency of Expression and Behaviour, formed by a good Education. How great therefore may the Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance be, as to all outward Expressions and Appearances, between an Hypocrite and a true Saint! Doubtless 'tis the glorious Prerogative of the omniscient God, as the great Searcher of Hearts, to be able well to separate between Sheep and Goats. And what an indecent, Self-Exaltation, and Arrogance is it, in poor fallible dark Mortals, to pretend that they can determine and know, who are really sincere and upright before God, and who are not!</p>
               <p>Many seem to lay great Weight on that, and to suppose it to be what may determine them with respect to others real Piety, when they not only tell a plausible Story, but when, in giving an Account of their Experiences, they make such a Representation, and speak after such a Manner, that they <hi>feel</hi> their Talk; that is to say, when their Talk seems to harmonize with their own Experience, and their Hearts are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But there is not that Certainty in such Things, and that full Dependance to be had upon them, which many imagine. A true Saint greatly delights in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: It is a most beautiful Thing in his Eyes; And God's Work, in savingly renewing and making holy and happy, a poor, and before perishing Soul, appears to him a most glorious Work. No wonder

therefore, that his Heart is touch'd, and greatly affected, when he hears another give a probable Account of this Work, wrought on his own Heart, and when he sees in him probable Appearances of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; whether those pleasing Appearances have any Thing real to answer them, or no. And if he uses the same Words, which are commonly made use of, to express the Affections of true Saints, and tells of many Things following one another in an Order, agreeable to the Method of the Experience of him that hears him, and also speaks freely and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with an Air of Assurance: No wonder that the other thinks his Experiences harmonize with his own. And if besides all this, in giving his Relation, he speaks with much Affection; and above all, if in speaking, he seems to shew much Affection to him, to whom he speaks, such an Affection as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did to the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi> these Things will naturally have a powerful Influence, to affect and draw his Hearers Heart, and open wide the Doors of his Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. <hi>David</hi> speaks as one who had felt <hi>Ahithophel'</hi>s Talk, and had once a sweet Savour and Relish of it.

And many of those, that in a little Time wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up, and drop off, and not under the Trees; yet for a while, look as beautiful and gay as others; and not only so, but smell Sweet, and send forth a pleasant Odour: So that we can't, by any of our Senses, certainly distinguish those Blossoms which have in them that secret Vertue, which will afterwards appear in the Fruit, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Solidity and Strength which shall enable them to bear, and cause them to be perfected by the hot Summer Sun, that will dry up the others. 'Tis the mature Fruit which comes afterwards, and not the beautiful Colours and Smell of the Blossom, that we must judge by. So new Converts, (professedly so) in their Talk about Things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may appear fair, and be very favoury, and the Saints may think
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:005767_0092_1027058ACBDDB458"/>
they talk feelingly. They may relish their Talk, and imagine they perceive a divine Savour in it; and yet all may come to nothing.</p>
               <p>'Tis strange how hardly Men are brought to be contented with the Rules and Directions Christ has given them, but they must needs go by other Rules, of their own inventing, that seem to them wiser and better. I know of no Directions or Counsels which Christ ever deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered more plainly, than the Rules he has given us, to guide us in our judging of others Sincerity; <hi>viz.</hi> that we should judge of the Tree chiefly by the Fruit: But yet this won't do; but other Ways are found out, which are imagined to be more distinguishing and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Friends, <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> may represent a full Ear with Fruit in it, typify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fruits of the Friends of Christ, the Antitype of <hi>Jephtbab;</hi> and the more lean Pronounciation of the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> his Enemies, may represent their empty Ears, typifying the Show of Religion in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, without Substance and Fruit. This is agreable to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we are abundantly taught in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That he who is set to judge those that pass through Death, whether they have a Right to enter into the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> or no, or whether they should not be stain, will judge every Man according to his Works.</p>
               <p>We seem to be taught the same Things, by the Rules given for the Priests discerning the Leprosy. In many Cases it was impossible for the Priest to determine whether a Man had the Leprosy, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were clean, by the most narrow Inspection of the Appearances that were upon him, 'till he had waited to see what the Appearances would come to, and had shut up the Person who shewed himself to him, one seven Days after another; and when he judged, he was to determine by the Hair, which grew out of the Spot that was shewed him, which was as it were the Fruit that it brought forth.</p>
               <p>And here, before I finish what I have to say under this Head, I would say something to a strange Notion some have of late been led away with, of certainly knowing the good Estate that others are in, as tho' it were immediately revealed to 'em from Heaven, by their Love flowing out to 'em in an extraordinary Manner. They argue thus, that their Love being very sensible and great, it may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known by them who feel it, to be a true christian Love: And if it be a true christian Love, the Spirit of God must be the Author of it: And inasmuch as the Spirit of God, who knows certainly, whether others are the Children of God or no, and is a Spirit of Truth, is pleased, by an uncommon Influence upon 'em, to cause their Love to flow out, in an extraordinary Manner, towards such a Person, as a Child of God; it must needs be that this infallible Spirit, who deceives none, knows that that Person is a Child of God. But such Persons might be convinced of the Falseness of their Reasoning, if they would consider whether or no it be not their Duty, and what God requires of 'em, to love those as the Children of God, who they think are the Children of God, and whom they have no Reason to think otherwise of, from all that they can see in them.</p>
               <p>Tho' God, who searches the Hearts, knows 'em not to be his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. If it be their Duty, then it is Good, and the Want of it Sin; and therefore, surely the Spirit of God may be the Author of it: The Spirit of God, without being a Spirit of Falshood, may in such a Case assist a Person to do his Duty, and keep him from Sin. But then they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the uncommon Degree and special Manner, in which their Love flows out to the Person; which they think the Spirit of God never would cause, if he did not know the Object to be a Child of God.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005767_0094_1027058FAFCBE2B8"/>
But then I would ask them, whether or no it is not their Duty to love all such as they are bound to think are the Children of God, from all that they can see in them, to a very great Degree, tho' God, from other Things which he sees, that are out of Sight to them, knows 'em not to be so. 'Tis Men's Duty to love all whom they are bound in Charity to look upon as the Children of God, with a vastly dearer Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than they commonly do. As we ought to love Christ to the utmost Capacity of our Nature, so 'tis our Duty to love those who we think are so near and dear to him as his Members, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dear Affection, as Christ has loved us; and therefore it is Sin in us not to love them so. We ought to pray to God that he would, by his Spirit keep us from Sin, and enable us to do our Duty: And may not his Spirit answer our Prayers, and enable us to do our Duty, in a particular Instance, without lying? If he can't, then the Spirit of God is bound not to help his People to do their Duty in some Instances, because he can't do it without being a Spirit of Falshood. But surely God is so sovereign as that comes to, that he may enable us to do our Duty when he pleases, and on what Occasion he pleases. When Persons think others are his Children, God may have other Ends in causing their exceedingly endeared Love to flow out to them, besides revealing to them whether their Opinion of 'em be right or no: He may have that merciful End in it, to enable them to do their Duty, and to keep them from that dreadful infinite Evil, Sin. And will they say God shall not show 'em that Mercy in such a Case? If I am at a Distance from Home, and hear, that in my Absence, my House is burnt, but my Family have, in some extraordinary Manner, all escaped the Flames; and every Thing in the Circumstances of the Story, as I hear it, makes it appear very credible; It would be Sin in me, in such a Case, not to feel a very great Degree of Gratitude to God, tho' the Story indeed be not true. And is not God so sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, that he may if he pleases, shew me that Mercy on that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and enable me to do my Duty in a much further Degree than I used to do it, and yet not incur the Charge of Deceitfulness, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming a Falshood?</p>
               <p>'Tis exceeding manifest, that Error or Mistake may be the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a gracious Exercise, and consequently a gracious Influence of the Spirit of God, by Rom. 14. 6. <hi>He that eateth to the Lord, he eateth, and giveth God Thanks; and he that eateth not to the Lord, he eateth not, and giveth God Thanks.</hi> The Apostle is speaking of those, who thro' erroneous and needless Scruples, avoided eating legally unclean Meats.—By this it is very evident, that there may be true Exercises of Grace, a true Respect <hi>to the Lord,</hi> and particularly, a true Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, which may be occasion'd, both by an erroneous Judgment and Practice. And consequently, an Error may be the Occasion of those truly holy Exercises that are from the infallible Spirit of God.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005767_0095_10270593948AF4F8"/>
And if so, 'tis certainly too much for us to determine, to how great a Degree the Spirit of God may give this holy Exercise, on such an Occasion.</p>
               <p>This Notion, of certainly discerning another's State, by Love flowing out, is not only not founded on Reason or Scripture, but it is anti-scriptural, 'tis against the Rules of Scripture; which say not a Word of any such Way of judging the State of others as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but direct us to judge chiefly by the Fruits that are seen in them. And it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Doctrines of Scripture, which do plainly teach us that the State of others Souls towards God, cannot be known by us, as in Rev. 2. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the</hi> hidden Manna; <hi>and I will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone a new Name written, which</hi> no Man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. And Rom. 2. 29. <hi>He is a</hi> Jew, <hi>which is one inwardly; and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is that of the Heart; in the Spirit, and not in the Letter; whose Praise is not of Men, but of God.</hi> That by this last Expression, <hi>whose Praise is not of Men, but of God,</hi> the Apostle has Respect to the Insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Men to judge concerning him, whether he be inwardly a <hi>Jew</hi> or no (as they could easily see by outward Marks, whether Men were outwardly <hi>Jews</hi>) and would signify, that it belongs to God alone to give a determining Voice in this Matter, is confirmed by the same Apostle's Use of the Phrase, in 1 Cor. 4. 5. <hi>Therefore judge nothing before the Time, until the Lord come; who both will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkness, and will make manifest the Counsels of the Hearts;</hi> and then shall every Man have Praise of God. The Apostle, in the two foregoing Verses, says, <hi>But with me, it is a very small Thing, that I should be judged of you, or of Man's Judgment: Yea, I judge not mine own self, for I know nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> And again, it is further confirmed, because the Apostle in this second Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> directs his Speech especially to those who had a high Conceit of their own Holiness, made their Boast of God, and were confident of their own Discerning, and that they knew God's Will, and approved the Things which were excellent, or tried the Things that differ (as it is in the Margin.) V. 18. <hi>And were confident that they were Guides of the Blind, and a Light to them which are in Darkness, Instructors of the Foolish, Teachers of Babes;</hi> and so took upon them to judge others, see V. 1. and 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>And how arrogant must the Notion he, that they have, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they can certainly know others Godliness, when that great Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> pretends not to say any more concerning <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <head>PART III.</head>
               <head>Shewing what are distinguishing Signs of truly gracious and holy Affections.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> COME now to the SECOND Thing appertaining to the <hi>Trial</hi> of religious Affections, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <hi>viz.</hi> To take notice of some Things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in those Affections that are spiritual and gracious, do differ from those that are not so.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed directly to the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Characters, I would previously mention some Things which I desire may be observed, concerning the Marks I shall lay down.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I am far from undertaking to give such Signs of gracious Affections, as shall be sufficient to enable any certainly to distinguish true Affection from false in others; or to determine positively which of their Neighbours are true Professors, and which are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. In so doing, I should be guilty of that Arrogance which I have been condemning. Tho' it be plain that Christ has given Rules to all Christians, to enable 'em to judge of Professors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whom they are concerned with, so far as is necessary for their own Safety, and to prevent their being led into a Snare by false Teachers, and false Pretenders to Religion; And tho' it be also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Doubt, that the Scriptures do abound with Rules, which may be very serviceable to Ministers, in counselling and conducting Souls committed to their Care, in Things appertaining to their spiritual
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005767_0097_1027059A846A3BD8"/>
and eternal State; yet, 'tis also evident, that it was never God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to give us any Rules, by which we may certainly know, who of our Fellow-Professors are his, and to make a full and clear Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between Sheep and Goats: But that on the Contrary, it was God's Design to reserve this to himself, as his Prerogative. And therefore no such distinguishing Signs as shall enable Christians or Ministers to do this, are ever to be expected to the World's End: For no more is ever to be expected from any Signs, that are to be found in the Word of God, or gathered from it, than Christ design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No such Signs are to be expected, that shall be sufficient to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble those Saints certainly to discern their own good Estate, who are very low in Grace, or are such as have much departed from God, and are fallen into a dead, carnal and unchristian Frame. It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to God's Design (as has been already observed) that such should know their good Estate: Nor is it desirable that they should; but on the contrary, every Way best that they should not; and we have Reason to bless God, that he has made no Provision that such should certainly know the State that they are in, any other Way, than by first coming out of the ill Frame and Way they are in.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is not properly thro' the Defect of the Signs given in the Word of God, that every Saint living, whether strong or weak, and those who are in a bad Frame, as well as others, can't certainly know their good Estate by them. For the Rules in themselves are certain and infallible, and every Saint has, or has had those Things in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which are sure Evidences of Grace; for <hi>every,</hi> even the <hi>least</hi> Act of Grace is so. But it is thro' his Defect to whom the Signs are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There is a twofold Defect in that Saint who is very low in Grace, or in an ill Frame, which makes it impossible for him to know certainly that he has true Grace, by the best Signs and Rules which can be given him. <hi>First,</hi> A Defect in the <hi>Object,</hi> or the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be view'd and examin'd. I don't mean an essential Defect; because I suppose the Person to be a real Saint; but a Defect in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Grace being very small, cannot be clearly and certainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and distinguished. Things that are very small, we can't clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discern their Form, or distinguish them one from another; tho', as they are in themselves, their Form may be very different. There is doubtless a great Difference between the Body of Man, and the Bodies of other Animals, in the first Conception in the Womb: But yet if we should view the different <hi>Embryos,</hi> it might not be possible for us to discern the Difference, by reason of the imperfect State of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but as it comes to greater Perfection, the Difference becomes very plain. The Difference between Creatures of very contrary Qualities, is not so plainly to be seen while they are very young, even
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005767_0098_1027059CB65DDCA8"/>
after they are actually brought forth, as in their more perfect State. The Difference between Doves and Ravens, or Doves and Vultures, when they first come out of the Egg, is not so evident; but as they grow to their Perfection, 'tis exceeding great and manifest. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defect attending the Grace of those I am speaking, is its being mingled with so much Corruption, which clouds and hides it, and makes it impossible for it certainly to be known. Tho' different Things that are before us, may have in themselves many Marks tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly distinguishing them one from another; yet if we see them only in a thick Smoke, it may nevertheless be impossible to distinguish them. A fix'd Star is easily distinguishable from a Comet, in a clear Sky; but if we view them thro' a Cloud, it may be impossible to see the Difference. When true Christians are in an ill Frame, Guilt lies on the Conscience; which will bring Fear, and so prevent the Peace and Joy of an assured Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is in such a Case a Defect in the <hi>Eye.</hi> As the Feebleness of Grace and Prevalence of Corruption, obscures the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; so it enfeebles the Sight; it darkens the Sight as to all spiritual Objects, of which Grace is one. Sin is like some Distempers of the Eyes, that make Things to appear of different Colours from those which properly belong to them, and like many other Distempers, that put the Mouth out of Taste, so as to disenable from distinguishing good and wholesome Food from bad, but every Thing tastes bitter. Men in a corrupt and carnal Frame, have their spiritual Senses in but poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>light for judging and distinguishing spiritual Things.</p>
               <p>For these Reasons, no Signs that can be given, will actually satisfy, Persons in such a Case: Let the Signs that are given, be never so good and infallible, and clearly laid down, they will not serve them. It is like giving a Man Rules, how to distinguish visible Objects in the dark: The Things themselves may be very different, and their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may be very well and distinctly described to him; yet all is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to enable him to distinguish them, because he is in the dark. And therefore many Persons in such a Case spend Time in a fruitless Labour, in poring on past Experiences, and examining themselves by Signs they hear laid down from the Pulpit, or that they read in Books; when there is other Work for them to do, that is much more expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them; which, while they neglect, all their Self-Examinations are like to be in vain, if they should spend never so much Time in them. The accursed Thing is to be destroyed from their Camp, and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> to be slain; and 'till this be done they will be in Trouble. 'Tis not God's Design that Men should obtain Assurance in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way, than by mortifying Corruption, and encreasing in Grace, and obtaining the lively Exercises of it. And altho' Self-Examination be a Duty of great Use and Importance, and by no Means to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005767_0099_1027059F9EC88228"/>
yet it is not the principal Means, by which the Saints do get Satisfaction of their good Estate. Assurance is not to be obtain'd so much by <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> as by <hi>Action.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sought Assurance chiefly this Way, even by <hi>forgetting the Things that were behind, and reaching forth unto those Things that were before, pressing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mark for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; if by any Means he might attain unto the Resurrection of the Dead.</hi> And it was by this Means chiefly that he obtain'd Assurance, 1 Cor. 9. 26. <hi>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly.</hi> He obtain'd Assurance of winning the Prize, more by <hi>running,</hi> than by <hi>considering.</hi> The <hi>Swiftness of his Pace,</hi> did more towards his Assurance of a Conquest, than the <hi>Strictness of his Examination.</hi> Giving all Diligence to grow in Grace, by adding to Faith, Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Direction that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> gives us, for <hi>making our Calling and Election sure,</hi> and having <hi>an Entrance ministred to us abundantly, into Christ's everlasting Kingdom;</hi> signifying to us, that without this, our Eyes will be dim, and we shall be as Men in the Dark, and cannot plainly see Things past or to come, either the Forgiveness of our Sins past, or our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance that is future, and <hi>far off,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 5,—11. <note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>Therefore, tho' good Rules to distinguish true Grace from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, may tend to convince Hypocrites, and be of great Use to the Saints, in many Respects; and among other Benefits, may be very useful to them to remove many needless Scruples, and establish their Hope; yet I am far from pretending to lay down any such Rules, as shall be sufficient of themselves, without other Means, to enable all true Saints to see their good Estate, or as supposing they should be the principal Means of their Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor is there much Encouragement, in the Experience of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or past Times, to lay down Rules or Marks to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and false Affections, in Hopes of convincing any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number of that Sort of Hypocrites, who have been deceived with great false Discoveries and Affections, and are once settled in a false Confidence, and high Conceit of their own supposed great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005767_0100_102705A3A9291FE8"/>
and Privileges. Such Hypocrites are so conceited of their own Wisdom, &amp; so blinded &amp; harden'd with a very great Self-Righteousness, (but very subtil and secret, under the Disguise of great Humility) and so invinceable a Fondness of their pleasing Conceit, of their great Exaltation, that it usually signifies nothing at all, to lay before them the most convincing Evidences of their Hypocrisy. Their State is indeed deplorable, and next to those that have committed the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin. Some of this Sort of Persons seem to be most out of the Reach of Means of Conviction and Repentance. But yet the laying down good Rules may be a Means of preventing such Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and of convincing many of other Kinds of Hypocrites: And God is able to convince even this Kind, and his Grace is not to be limited, nor Means to be neglected. And besides, such Rules may be of Use to the true Saints, to detect false Affections, which they may have mingled with true. And be a Means of their Religion's becoming more pure, and like Gold tried in the Fire.</p>
               <p>Having premised these Things, I now proceed directly to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those Things in which true religious Affections are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from false.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Affections that are truly spiritual and gracious, do arise from those Influences and Operations on the Heart, which are <hi>spiritual, super-natural</hi> and <hi>divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will explain what I mean by these Terms, whence will appear their Use to distinguish between those Affections which are spiritual, and those which are not so.</p>
               <p>We find that true Saints, or those Persons who are sanctified by the Spirit of God, are in the new Testament called <hi>spiritual</hi> Persons. And their being <hi>spiritual</hi> is spoken of as their peculiar Character, and that wherein they are distinguished from those who are not sanctified. This is evident because those who are spiritual are set in Opposition to natural Men, and carnal Men. Thus the spiritual Man, and the natural Man, are set in Opposition one to another; 1 Cor. 2. 14, 15. <hi>The</hi> natural Man <hi>receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can be know them; because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is</hi> spiritual <hi>judgeth all Things.</hi> The Scripture explains it self to mean an ungodly Man, or one that has no Grace, by a natural Man: Thus the Apostle <hi>Jude,</hi> speaking of certain <hi>ungodly Men,</hi> that had crept in unawares among the Saints, Verse 4. of his Epistle, says, Verse 19. <hi>These are</hi> sensual, <hi>having not the Spirit.</hi> This the Apostle gives as a Reason why they behaved themselves in such a wicked Manner as he had described.

                     </gap>;</hi> Col. 2. 18. Nor are Things called spiritual, because they are conversant about those Things that are immaterial, and not corporeal. For so was the Wisdom of the wise Men, and Princes of this World, conversant about Spirits, and immaterial Beings; which yet the Apostle speaks of as <hi>natural Men,</hi> totally ignorant of those Things that are <hi>spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. chap. 2. But it is with Relation to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> that Persons or Things are termed spiritual, in the New-Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the Word is used to signify the third Person in the Trinity, is the Substantive, of which is formed the Adjective <hi>spiritual,</hi> in the holy Scriptures. Thus Christians are called spiritual Persons, because they are born of the Spirit, and because of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling and holy Influences of the Spirit of God in them. And Things are called spiritual as related to the Spirit of God; 1 Cor. 2. 13, 14. <hi>Which Things also we speak, not in the Words which Man's Wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual Things with spiritual. But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God.</hi> Here the Apostle himself expresly signifies, that by <hi>spiritual Things,</hi> he means <hi>the Things of the Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>Things which the Holy Ghost teacheth.</hi> The same is yet more abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005767_0102_102705A8F48BFEF0"/>
by viewing the whole Context. Again, Rom. 8. 6. <hi>To be</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally minded <hi>is Death: But to be</hi> spiritually minded <hi>is Life and Peace.</hi> The Apostle explains what he means by being carnally and spiritually minded, in what follows in the 9th Verse, and shews that by being spiritually minded, he means a having the Indwelling and holy Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God in the Heart. <hi>But ye are not</hi> in the Flesh, <hi>but</hi> in the Spirit, <hi>if so be</hi> the Spirit of God dwell in you. <hi>Now if any Man</hi> have not the Spirit of Christ, <hi>he is none of his.</hi> The same is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by all the Context. But Time would fail to produce all the Evidence there is of this, in the New-Testamen.</p>
               <p>And it must be here observed, that altho' it is with Relation to tho Spirit of God and his Influences, that Persons and Things are called spiritual; yet not all those Persons who are subject to any Kind of Influence of the Spirit of God, are ordinarily called spiritual in the New-Testament. They who have only the common Influences of God's Spirit, are not so called, in the Places cited above, but only those, who have the special, gracious and saving Influences of God's Spirit: As is evident, because it has been already proved, that by spiritual Men is meant godly Men, in Opposition to natural, carnal and unsanctify'd Men. And it is most plain, that the Apostle by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 6. means graciously minded. And tho' the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, which natural Men might have, are sometimes called spiritual, because they are from the Spirit; ye, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men, whatever Gifts of the Spirit they had, were not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the usual Language of the New-Testament, called spiritual Persons. For it was not by Men's having the Gifts of the Spirit, but by their having the Vertues of the Spirit, that they were called spiritual; as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by Gal. 6. 1. <hi>Brethren, if any Man be overtaken in a Fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the Spirit of Meekness.</hi> Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is one of those Vertue which the Apostle had just spoken of, in the Verses next preceeding, shewing what are the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> Those Qualifications are said to be spiritual in the Language of the New-Testament, which are truly gracious and holy, and peculiar to the Saints.</p>
               <p>Thus when we read of spiritual Wisdom and Understanding (as in Col. 1. 9. <hi>We desire that ye may be filled with the Knowledge of his Will,</hi> in all Wisdom and spiritual Understanding.) Hereby is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Wisdom which is gracious, and from the sanctifying Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God. For doubtless, by <hi>spiritual Wisdom,</hi> is meant that which is opposite to what the Scripture calls <hi>natural Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> as the <hi>spiritual Man</hi> is opposed to the <hi>natural Man.</hi> And therefore spiritual Wisdom is doubtless the same with that Wisdom which is from above, that the Apostle <hi>James</hi> speaks of, Jam. 3. 17. <hi>The Wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, &amp;c.</hi> for this the Apostle opposes to natural Wisdom, Ver. 15. <hi>This
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005767_0103_102705AD3B4998D8"/>
Wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual</hi>—the last Word in the Original is the same that is translated <hi>natural,</hi> in 1 Cor. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>So that altho' natural Men may be the Subjects of many Influences of the Spirit of God, as is evident by many Scriptures, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 24 2. 1 <hi>Som.</hi> 10. 10. and 11. 6. and 16. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. and many others; yet they are not in the Sense of the Scripture, spiritual Persons; neither are any of those Effects, common Gifts, Qualities or Affections, that are from the Influence of the Spirit of God upon them, called spiritual Things. The great Difference lies in these two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God is given to the true Saints to dwell in them, as his proper lasting Abode; and to influence their Hearts, as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of new Nature, or as a divine supernatural Spring of Life and Action. The Scriptures represent the Holy Spirit, not only as moving, and occasionally influencing the Saints, but as dwelling in them as his Temple, his proper Abode, and everlasting Dwelling-Place; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17. And he is represented as being there so united to the Faculties of the Soul, that he becomes there a Principle or Spring of new Nature and Life.</p>
               <p>So the Saints are said to live by Christ living in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Christ by his Spirit not only <hi>is</hi> in them, but <hi>lives</hi> in them; and so that they live by his Life; so is his Spirit united to them, as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life in them; they don't only drink living Water, but this <hi>living Water becomes a Well</hi> or <hi>Fountain of Water,</hi> in the Soul, <hi>springing up into spiritual</hi> and <hi>everlasting Life,</hi> John 4. 14. and thus becomes a Principle of Life in them; this living Water, this Evangelist himself explains to intend the Spirit of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 38, 39. The Light of the Sun of Righteousness don't only shine upon them, but is so communicated to them that they shine also, and become little Images of that Sun which shines upon them; the Sap of the true Vine is not only conveyed into them, as the Sap of a Tree may be conveyed into a Vessel, but is conveyed as Sap is from a Tree into one of it's living Branches, where it becomes a Principle of Life. The Spirit of God being thus communicated and united to the Saints, they are from thence properly denominated from it, and are called <hi>spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other Hand, tho' the Spirit of God may many Ways influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence natural Men; yet because it is not thus communicated to them, as an indwelling Principle, they don't derive any Denomination or Character from it; for there being no Union it is not their own. The Light may shine upon a Body that is very dark or black; and tho' that Body be the Subject of the Light, yet, because the Light becomes no Principle of Light in it, so as to cause the Body to shine, hence that Body don't properly receive its Denomination from it, so
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005767_0104_102705AFF3FFB8C8"/>
as to be called a <hi>lightsome Body.</hi> So the Spirit of God acting upon the Soul only, without communicating it self to be an active Principle in it, can't denominate it <hi>spiritual.</hi> A Body that continues black, may be said <hi>not to have Light,</hi> tho' the Light shines upon it; so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men are said <hi>yet to have the Spirit,</hi> Jude 19. <hi>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sual,</hi> or <hi>natural</hi> (as the Word is elsewhere render'd) <hi>having not the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Reason why the Saints and their Vertues are called spiritual, (which is the principal Thing) is that the Spirit of God, dwelling as a vital Principle in their Souls, there produces those Effects wherein he exerts and communicate himself in his own <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Nature.</hi> Holiness is the Nature of the Spirit of God, therefore he is called in Scripture the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Holiness, which is as it were the Beauty and Sweetness of the Divine Nature, is as much the proper Nature of the Holy Spirit, as Heat is the Nature of Fire, or Sweetness was the Nature of that holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was the principal Type of the Holy Ghost in the <hi>Mesaick</hi> Dispensation; yea, I may rather say that Holiness is as much the proper Nature of the Holy Ghost, as Sweetness was the Nature of the sweet Odour of that Ointment. The Spirit of God so dwells in the Hearts of the Saints, that he there, as a Seed or Spring of Life, exerts and Communicates himself, in this his sweet and divine Nature, making the Soul a Partaker of God's Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Christ's Joy, so that the Saint has truly Fellowship <hi>with</hi> the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, in thus having the Communion or Participation <hi>of</hi> the Holy Ghost. The Grace which is in the Hearts of the Saints, is of the same Nature with the divine Holiness, as much as 'tis possible for that Holiness to be, which is infinitely less in Degree; as the Brightness that is in a Diamond which the Sun shines upon, is of the same Nature with the Brightness of the Sun, but only that it is as nothing to it in Degree. Therefore Christ says, John 3. 6. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit; i. e.</hi> the Grace that is begotten in the Hearts of the Saints, is something of the same Nature with that Spirit, and so is properly called a <hi>spiritual Nature;</hi> after the same Manner as that which is born of the Flesh is Flesh, or that which is born of corrupt Nature is corrupt Nature.</p>
               <p>But the Spirit of God never Influences the Minds of natural Men after this Manner. Tho' he may influence them many Ways, yet he never, in any of his Influences, communicates himself to them in his own proper Nature. Indeed he never acts disagreably to his Nature, either on the Minds of Saints or Sinners: But the Spirit of God may act upon Men agreably to his own Nature, and not exert his proper Nature in the Acts and Exercises of their Minds: The Spirit of God may act so, that his Actions may be agreable to his Nature, and yet may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> communicate himself in his proper Nature in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that Action. Thus, for Instance, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> moved
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005767_0105_102705B4BB42C6C0"/>
upon the Face of the Waters, and there was nothing disagreable to his Nature in that Action; but yet he did not at all communicate himself in that Action, there was nothing of the proper Nature of the Holy Spirit in that Motion of the Waters. And so he may act upon the Minds of Men many Ways, and not communicate himself any more than when he acts on inanimate Things.</p>
               <p>Thus not only the Manner of the <hi>Relation</hi> of the Spirit, who is the <hi>Operator,</hi> to the Subject of his Operations, is different; as the Spirit operates in the Saints, as dwelling in them, as an abiding Principle of Action, whereas he doth not so operate upon Sinners; but the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and <hi>Operation itself</hi> is different, and the <hi>Effect wrought</hi> exceeding different. So that not only the Persons are called <hi>spiritual,</hi> as having the Spirit of God dwelling in them; but those Qualifications, Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Experiences that are wrought in them by the Spirit, are also <hi>spiritual,</hi> and therein differ vastly in their Nature and Kind from all that a natural Man is or can be the Subject of, while he remains in a natural State; and also from all that Men or Devils can be the Authors of: 'Tis a spiritual Work in this high Sense; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above all other Works is peculiar to the Spirit of God. There is no Work so high and excellent; for there is no Work wherein God does so much communicate himself, and wherein the meer Creature hath, in so high a Sense, a Participation of God; so that it is expressed in Scripture by the Saints <hi>being made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. and <hi>having God dwelling in them, and they in God,</hi> 1 John 4. 12, 15, 16. and Chap. 3. 21. <hi>and having Christ in them,</hi> John 17. 21. Rom. 8. 10. <hi>being the Temples of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. <hi>living by Christ's Life,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>being made Partakers of God's Holiness,</hi> Heb. 12. 10. <hi>having Christ's Love dwelling in them,</hi> John 17. 26. <hi>having his Joy fulfilled in them,</hi> John 17. 13. <hi>seeing Light in God's Light,</hi> and <hi>being made to drink of the River of God's Pleasures,</hi> Psal. 36. 8, 9. <hi>having Fellowship with God,</hi> or <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and partaking with him</hi> (as the Word signifies) 1 John 1. 3. Not that the Saints are made Partakers of the Essence of God, and so are <hi>Godded</hi> with God, and <hi>Christed</hi> with Christ, according to the abominable and blasphemous Language and Notions of some Hereticks; but, to use the Scripture Phrase, they are made Partakers of God's <hi>Fullness, Eph.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. that is, of God's spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Beauty and Happiness, according to the Measure and Capacity of a Creature; for so it is evident the Word <hi>Fullness</hi> signifies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Language. Grace in the Hearts of the Saints, being therefore the most glorious Work of God, wherein he communicates of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Nature, it is doubtless his peculiar Work, and in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Manner, above the Power of all Creatures. And the Influences of the Spirit of God in this, being thus peculiar to God, and being those wherein God does, in so high a Manner, communicate himself,

                  </gap> the Creature Partaker of the divine Nature. (the Spirit of God communicating it self in its own proper Nature) This is what I mean by those Influences that are <hi>divine,</hi> when I say that <hi>truly gracious Affections do arise from those Influences that are spiritual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Saints only have that which is spiritual; others have nothing which is divine, in the Sense that has been spoken of. They not only have not these Communications of the Spirit of God in so high a <hi>Degree</hi> as the Saints, but have nothing of that <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Kind.</hi> For the Apostle <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>natural</hi> Men <hi>have not the Spirit;</hi> and Christ teaches the Necessity of a New-Birth, or a being born of the Spirit, from this, that <hi>He that is born of the Flesh, has</hi> only <hi>Flesh,</hi> and no <hi>Spirit, John</hi> 3. 6. They have not the Spirit of God dwelling in them in any Degree; for the Apostle teaches, that all who have the Spirit of God dwelling in them are some of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11. And an having the Spirit of God is spoken of as a certain Sign that Persons shall have the eternal Inheritance; for 'tis spoken of as the Earnest of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. and 5. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 24. and an having any Thing <hi>of the Spirit</hi> is mentioned as a sure Sign of being in Christ, 1 John 4. 13. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, because he hath given us</hi> of <hi>his Spirit.</hi> Ungodly Men, not only han't so much of the divine Nature as the Saints, but they are not <hi>Partakers of it;</hi> which implies that they have nothing of it; for a being <hi>Partaker</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is spoken of as the peculiar Priviledge of the true Saints, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Ungodly Men are not <hi>Partakers of God's Holiness,</hi> Heb. 12. 10. A natural Man has no Experience of any of those Things that are spiritual: The Apostle teaches us that he is so far from it, that he knows nothing about them, he is a perfect Stranger to them, the Talk about such Things is all Foolishness and Nonsense to him, he knows not what it means, 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him; neither can he know them; because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> And to the like Purpose Christ teaches us that the World is wholly unacquainted with the Spirit of God, John 14. 17. <hi>Even the Spirit of Truth, when the World cannot receive; because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> And 'tis further evident, that natural Men have nothing in them of the same Nature with the true Grace of the Saints, because the Apostle teaches us that those of them who go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest in Religion, have <hi>no Charity,</hi> or true christian Love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 13. So Christ elsewhere reproves the Pharisees, those high Pretenders to Religion, that they <hi>had not the Love of God in them,</hi> John 5. 42. Hence natural Men have no Communion or Fellowship with Christ, or Participation with him, (as these Words signify) for this is spoken of as the peculiar Privilege of the Saints, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. together with Verse 6, 7. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9. And the Scripture speaks of the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005767_0107_102705BC73ABDFF0"/>
actual Being of a gracious Principle in the Soul, tho' in its first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as a Seed there planted, as inconsistent with a Man's being a Sinner, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. And natural Men are represented in Scripture as having no spiritual Light, no spiritual Life, and no spiritual Being; and therefore Conversion is often compared to opening the Eyes of the Blind, raising the Dead, and a Work of Creation, (wherein Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are made entirely new) and becoming new born Children.</p>
               <p>From these Things it is evident, that those gracious Influences which the Saints are the Subjects of, &amp; the Effects of God's Spirit which they experience, are entirely above Nature, altogether of a different Kind from any Thing that Men find within themselves by Nature, or only in the Exercise of natural Principles; and are Things which no Improvement of those Qualifications, or Principles that are natural, no advancing or exalting them to higher Degrees, and no Kind of Composition of them, will ever bring Men to; because they not only differ from what is natural, and from every Thing that natural Men experience, in Degree and Circumstances; but also in Kind; and are of a Nature vastly more excellent. And this is what I mean by <hi>supernatural,</hi> when I say, that <hi>gracious Affections are from those Influences that are supernatural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it follows, that in those gracious Exercises and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are wrought in the Minds of the Saints, thro' the saving Influences of the Spirit of God, there is a new inward <hi>Perception</hi> or <hi>Sensation</hi> of their Minds, entirely different in its Nature and Kind, from any Thing that ever their Minds were the Subjects of before they were sanctified. For doubtless if God by his mighty Power produces something that is new, not only in Degree and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but in its whole Nature, and that which could be produced by no exalting, varying or compounding of what was there before, or by adding any Thing of the like Kind; I say, if God produces something thus new in a Mind, that is a perceiving, thinking, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious Thing; then doubtless something entirely new is felt, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or thought; or, which is the same Thing, there is some new Sensation or Perception of the Mind, which is entirely of a new Sort, and which could be produced by no exalting, varying or compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Kind of Perceptions or Sensations which the Mind had before; or there is what some Metaphysicians call a new <hi>simple Idea.</hi> If Grace be, in the Sense above described, an entirely new Kind of Principle; then the Exercises of it are also entirely a new Kind of Exercises. And if there be in the Soul a new Sort of Exercises which it is conscious of, which the Soul knew nothing of before, and which no Improvement, Composition or Management of what it was before conscious or sensible of, could produce, or any Thing like it; then it follows that the Mind has an entirely new Kind of Perception or Sensation; and here is, as it were, a new <hi>spiritual Sense</hi> that the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005767_0108_102705C1B624EE70"/>
Mind has, or a Principle of new Kind of Perception or spiritual Sensation, which is in its whole Nature different from any former Kinds of Sensation of the Mind, as Tasting is diverse from any of the other Senses; and something is perceived by a true Saint, in the Exercise of this new Sense of Mind, in spiritual and divine Things, as entirely diverse from any Thing that is perceived in them, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men, as the sweet Taste of Honey is diverse from the Ideas Men get of Honey by only looking on it, and feeling of it. So that the spiritual Perceptions which a sanctified and spiritual Person has, are not only diverse from all that natural Men have, after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the Ideas or Perceptions of the same Sense may differ one from another, but rather as the Ideas and Sensations of different Senses do differ. Hence the Work of the Spirit of God in Regeneration is often in Scripture compared to the giving a new Sense, giving Eyes to see, and Ears to hear, unstopping the Ears of the Deaf, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eyes of them that were born Blind, and turning from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto Light. And because this spiritual Sense is immensely the most noble and excellent, and that without which all other Principles of Perception, and all our Faculties are useless and vain; therefore the giving this new Sense, with the blessed Fruits and Effects of it in the Soul, is compared to a raising the Dead, and to a new Creation.</p>
               <p>This new spiritual Sense, and the new Dispositions that attend it, are no new <hi>Faculties,</hi> but are new <hi>Principles</hi> of Nature. I use the Word <hi>Principles,</hi> for want of a Word of a more determinate Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. By a <hi>Principle of Nature</hi> in this Place, I mean that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which is laid in Nature, either old or new, for any particular Manner or Kind of Exercise of the Faculties of the Soul; or a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Habit or Foundation for Action, giving a Person Ability &amp; Disposition to exert the Faculties in Exercises of such a certain Kind; so that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert the Faculties in that Kind of Exercises, may be said to be his Nature. So this new spiritual Sense is not a new Faculty of Understanding, but it is a new Foundation laid in the Nature of the Soul, for a new Kind of Exercises of the same Faculty of Understanding. So that new holy Dispositions of Heart that attends this new Sense, is not a new Faculty of Will, but a Foundation laid in the Nature of the Soul, for a new Kind of Exercises of the same Faculty of Will.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God, in all his Operations upon the Minds of natural Men, only moves, impresses, assists, improves, or some Way acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>natural Principles;</hi> but gives no new <hi>spiritual Principle.</hi> Thus when the Spirit of God gives a natural Man Visions, as he did <hi>Baiaam,</hi> he only impresses a natural Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sense of seeing, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately exciting Ideas of that Sense; but he gave no new Sense; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any Thing supernatural, spiritual or divine in it. So if the Spirit of God impresses on a Man's Imagination, either in a
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005767_0109_102705C8ACAA5F38"/>
Dream, or when he is awake, any outward Ideas of any of the Senses, either Voices, or Shapes and Colours, 'tis only exciting Ideas of the same Kind that he has by natural Principles and Senses. So if God reveals to any natural Man, any secret Fact; as for Instance, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he shall hereafter see or hear; this is not infusing or exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any new spiritual Principle, or giving the Ideas of any new spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sense; 'tis only impressing, in an extraordinary Manner, the Ideas that will hereafter be received by Sight and Hearing. So in the more ordinary Influences of the Spirit of God on the Hearts of Sinners, he only assists natural Principles to do the same Work to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degree, which they do of themselves by Nature. Thus the Spirit of God by his common Influences may assist Men's natural Ingeniosity, as he assisted <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aboliah</hi> in the curious Works of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: so he may assist Mens natural Abilities in political Affairs, and improve their Courage, and other natural Qualifications; as he is said to have put his Spirit on the seventy Elders, &amp; on <hi>Saul,</hi> so as to <hi>give him another Heart:</hi> so God may greatly assist natural Men's Reason, in their Reasoning about secular Things, or about the Doctrines of Religion, and may greatly advance the Clearness of their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Notions of Things of Religion in many Respects, without giving any spiritual Sense. So in those Awakenings and Convictions that natural Men may have, God only assists Conscience, which is a natural Principle, to do that Work in a further Degree, which it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally does. Conscience naturally gives Men an Apprehension of Right and Wrong, and suggests the Relation there is between Right and Wrong, and a Retribution: The Spirit of God assists Men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to do this in a greater Degree, helps Conscience against the stupifying Influence of worldly Objects and their Lusts. And so there are many other Ways might be mention'd wherein the Spirit acts upon, assists and moves natural Principles; but after all, 'tis no more than Nature moved, acted and improved; here is nothing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and divine. But the Spirit of God in his spiritual Influences on the Hearts of his Saints, operates by infusing or exercising new, divine and supernatural Principles; Principles which are indeed a new and spiritual Nature, and Principles vastly more noble and excellent than all that is in natural Men.</p>
               <p>From what has been said it follows, that all spiritual and gracious Affections are attended with, and do arise from some Apprehension, Idea or Sensation of Mind, which is in its whole Nature different, yea exceeding different from all that is or can be in the Mind of a natural Man; and which the natural Man discerns nothing of, and has no Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Idea of, (agreeable to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.) and conceives of no more than a Man without the Sense of Tasting can conceive of the sweet Taste of Honey, or a Man without the Sense of Hearing can conceive of the Melody of a Tune, or a Man born Blind can have a Notion of the Beauty of the Rainbow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:005767_0110_102705CDA156CA40"/>
But here two Things must be observed in order to the right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. On the one Hand it must be observed, that not every Thing which in any Respect appertains to spiritual Affections, is new and entirely different from what natural Men can conceive of, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; some Things are common to gracious Affections with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Affections; many Circumstances, Appendages and Effects are common. Thus a Saint's Love to God has a great many Things appertaining to it, which are common with a Man's natural Love to a near Relation: Love to God makes a Man have Desires of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and a Desire to please him; so does a natural Man's Love to his Friend make him desire his Honour, and desire to please him: Love to God causes a Man to delight in the Thoughts of God, and to delight in the Presence of God, and to desire Conformity to God, and the Enjoyment of God; and so it is with a Man's Love to his Friend; and many other Things might be mention'd which are common to both. But yet that Idea which the Saint has of the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of God, and that Sensation, and that Kind of Delight he has in that View, which is as it were the Marrow and Quintessence of his Love, is peculiar, and entirely diverse from any Thing that a natural Man has, or can have any Notion of. And even in those Things that seem to be common, there is something peculiar: Both spiritual Love and Natural, cause Desires after the Object beloved; but they ben't the same Sort of Desires; there is a Sensation of Soul in the spiritual Desires of one that loves God, which is entirely different from all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Desires: Both spiritual Love and natural Love are attended with Delight in the Object beloved; but the Sensations of Delight are not the same, but entirely and exceedingly diverse. Natural Men may have Conceptions of many Things <hi>about</hi> spiritual Affections; but there is something in them which is as it were the <hi>Nucleus,</hi> or Kernel of them, that they have no more Conceptions of, than one born blind has of Colours.</p>
               <p>It may be clearly illustrated by this: We will suppose two Men; one is born without the Sense of Tasting, the other has it; the latter loves Honey, and is greatly delighted in it because he knows the sweet Taste of it; the other loves certain Sounds and Colours: The Love of each has many Things that appertain to it, which is common; it causes both to Desire and Delight in the Object beloved, and causes Grief when it is absent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—: But yet, that Idea or Sensation which he who knows the Taste of Honey, has of its Excellency and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that is the Foundation of his Love, is entirely different from any Thing the other has or can have; and that Delight which he has in Honey, is wholly diverse from any Thing that the other can conceive of; tho' they both delight in their beloved Objects. So both these Persons may in some Respects love the same Object: The one may love a delicious Kind of Fruit, which is beautiful to the Eye, and of a
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005767_0111_102705D1D6E5F810"/>
delicious Taste; not only because he has seen it's pleasant Colours, but knows it's sweet Taste; the other, perfectly ignorant of this, loves it only for its beautiful Colours: There are many Things seem, in some Respect, to be common to both; both love, both desire, and both delight; but the Love, and Desire, and Delight of the one, is altogether diverse from that of the other. The Difference between the Love of a natural Man and spiritual Man is like to this; but only it must be observed, that in one Respect it is vastly greater, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Kinds of Excellency which are perceived in spiritual Objects, by these different Kinds of Persons, are in themselves vastly more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, than the different Kinds of Excellency perceived in delicious Fruit, by a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> Man; and in another Respect it may not be so great, <hi>viz.</hi> as the spiritual Man may have a spiritual Sense or Taste, to perceive that divine and most peculiar Excellency, but in small Beginnings, and in a very imperfect Degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other Hand, it must be observed, that a natural Man may have those religious Apprehensions and Affections, which may be in many Respects very new and surprising to him, and what before he did not conceive of; and yet what he experiences be nothing like the Exercises of a Principle of new Nature, or the Sensations of a new spiritual Sense: His Affections may be very new, by extraordinarily moving natural Principles, in a very new Degree, and with a great many new Circumstances, and a new Co-operation of natural Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a new Composition of Ideas; this may be from some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary powerful Influence of <hi>Satan</hi> and some great Delusion; but there is nothing but Nature extraordinarily acted. As if a poor Man, that had always dwelt in a Cottage, and had never looked beyond the obscure Village where he was born, should in a Jest, be taken to a magnificent City and Prince's Court, and there arrayed in princely Robes, and set in the Throne, with the Crown Royal on his Head, Peers and Nobles bowing before him, and should be made to believe that he was now a glorious Monarch; the Ideas he would have, and the Affections he would experience, would in many Respects be very new, and such as he had no Imagination of before; but all is no more, than only extraordinarily raising and exciting natural Principles, and newly exalting, varying and compounding such Sort of Ideas, as he has by Nature; here is nothing like giving him a new Sense.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, I think it is clearly manifest, that all truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Affections do arise from special and peculiar Influences of the Spirit, working that <hi>sensible Effect</hi> or <hi>Sensation</hi> in the Souls of the Saints, which are entirely different from all that it is possible a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man should experience, not only different in Degree and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but different in its whole Nature: So that a natural Man not only cannot experience that which is individually the same, but can't experience any thing but what is exceeding diverse, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensely
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005767_0112_102705D3761035C0"/>
below it, in its Kind; and that which the Power of Men or Devils is not sufficient to produce the like of, or any Thing of the same Nature.</p>
               <p>I have insisted largely on this Matter, because it is of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and Use, evidently to discover and demonstrate the Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Satan,</hi> in many Kinds of false religious Affections, which Multitudes are deluded by, and probably have been in all Ages of the christian Church; and to settle and determine many Articles of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, concerning the Operations of the Spirit of God, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true Grace.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, to apply these Things to the Purpose of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>From hence it appears that Impressions which some have made on their Imagination, or the imaginary Ideas which they have of God, or Christ, or Heaven, or any Thing appertaining to Religion, have nothing in them that is spiritual, or of the Nature of true Grace. Tho' such Things may attend what is spiritual, and be mixed with it, yet in themselves they have nothing that is spiritual, nor are they any Part of gracious Experience.</p>
               <p>Here, for the Sake of the common People, I will explain what is intended by <hi>Impressions on the Imagination,</hi> and <hi>imaginary Ideas.</hi> The Imagination is that Power of the Mind, whereby it can have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or Idea of Things of an external or outward Nature, (that is, of such Sort of Things as are the Objects of the outward Senses) when those Things are not present, and ben't perceived by the Senses. It is called Imagination from the Word <hi>Image;</hi> because thereby a Person can have an Image of some external Thing in his Mind, when that Thing is not present in Reality, nor any Thing like it. All such Kind of Things as we perceive by our five external Senses, <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting</hi> and <hi>Feeling,</hi> are external Things: And when a Person has an Idea, or Image of any of these Sorts of Things in his Mind, when they are not there, and when he don't really see, hear, smell, taste, nor feel them; that is to have an <hi>Imagination</hi> of them, and these Ideas are <hi>imaginary Ideas:</hi> And when such Kind of Ideas are strongly impress'd upon the Mind, and the Image of them in the Mind is very lively, almost as if one saw them, or heard them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is called an <hi>Impression on the Imagination.</hi> Thus Colours, and Shapes, and a Form of Countenance, they are outward Things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are that Sort of Things which are the Objects of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sense of Seeing: And therefore when any Person has in his Mind a lively Idea of any Shape, or Colour, or Form of Countenance; that is to have an Imagination of those Things. So if he has an Idea of such Sort of Light or Darkness, as he perceives by the Sense of Seeing; that is to have an Idea of outward Light, and so is an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So if he has an Idea of any Marks made on Paper, suppose
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005767_0113_102705D74871D1C8"/>
Letters and Words written in a Book; that is to have an external and imaginary Idea of such Kind of Things as we sometimes perceive by our bodily Eyes. And when we have the Ideas of that Kind of Things which we perceive by any of the other Senses, as of any Sounds or Voices, or Words spoken; this is only to have Ideas of outward Things, <hi>viz.</hi> of such Kind of Things as are perceived by the external Sense of Hearing, and so that also is Imagination: and when these Ideas are livelily impress'd, almost as if they were really heard with the Ears, this is to have an Impression on the Imagination. And so I might go on, and Instance in the Ideas of Things appertaining to the other three Senses of <hi>Smelling, Tasting</hi> and <hi>Feeling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many who have had such Things have very ignorantly supposed them to be of the Nature of spiritual Discoveries. They have had lively Ideas of some external Shape, and beautiful Form of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and this they call spiritually seeing Christ. Some have had impress'd upon them Ideas of a great outward Light; and this they call a spiritual Discovery of God's or Christ's Glory. Some have had Ideas of Christ's hanging on the Cross, and his Blood running from his Wounds; and this they call a spiritual Sight of Christ crucify'd, and the Way of Salvation by his Blood. Some have seen him with his Arms open ready to embrace them; and this they call a Discovery of the Sufficiency of Christ's Grace and Love. Some have had live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ideas of Heaven, and of Christ on his Throne there, and shining Ranks of Saints and Angels; and this they call seeing Heaven open'd to them. Some from Time to Time have had a lively Idea of a Person of a beautiful Countenance smiling upon them; and this they call a spiritual Discovery of the Love of Christ to their Souls, and tasting the Love of Christ. And they look upon it a sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that these Things are spiritual Discoveries, and that they see them spiritually, because they say they don't see these Things with their bodily Eyes, but in their Hearts; for they can see them when their Eyes are shut. And in like Manner, the Imaginations of some have been impress'd with Ideas of the Sense of Hearing; they have had Ideas of Words, as if they were spoke to them; sometimes they are the Words of Scripture, and sometimes other Words: They have had Ideas of Christ's speaking comfortable Words to them. These Things they have called having the inward Call of Christ, hearing the Voice of Christ spiritually in their Hearts, having the Witness of the Spirit, and the inward Testimony of the Love of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The common, and less considerate and understanding Sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are the more easily led into Apprehensions that these Things are spiritual Things, because spiritual Things being invisible, and not Things that can be pointed forth with the Finger, we are forced to use figurative Expressions in speaking of them, and to borrow Names from external and sensible Objects to signify them by. Thus we call
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005767_0114_102705DA5CC09C68"/>
a clear Apprehension of Things spiritual by the Name of <hi>Light;</hi> and an having such an Apprehension of such or such Things, by the Name of <hi>seeing</hi> such Things; and the Conviction of the Judgment, and the Perswasion of the Will, by the Word of Christ in the Gospel, we signify by <hi>spiritually hearing the Call of Christ:</hi> And the Scripture it self abounds with such like figurative Expressions. Persons hearing these often used, and having press'd upon them the Necessity of having their Eyes open'd, and having a Discovery of spiritual Things; and seeing Christ in his Glory, and having the inward Call, and the like, they ignorantly look and wait for some such external Discoveries, and imaginary Views as have been spoken of; and when they have them, are confident that now their Eyes are open'd, now Christ has disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himself to them, and they are his Children; and hence are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affected and elevated with their Deliverance and Happiness, and many Kinds of Affections are at once set in a violent Motion in them.</p>
               <p>But it is exceeding apparent that such Ideas have nothing in them which is spiritual and divine, in the Sense wherein it has been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated that all gracious Experiences are spiritual and divine. These external Ideas are in no wise of such a Sort, that they are entirely, and in their whole Nature diverse from all that Men have by Nature, perfectly different from, and vasily above any Sensation which 'tis possible a Man should have by any natural Sense or Principle, so that in order to have them, a Man must have a new spiritual and divine Sense given him, in order to have any Sensations of that Sort: So far from this, that they are Ideas of the same Sort which we have by the external Senses, that are some of the inferiour Powers of the humane Nature; they are meerly Ideas of external Objects, or Ideas of that Nature, of the same outward sensitive Kind; the same Sort of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of Mind (differing not in Degree, but only in Circumstances) that we have by those natural Principles which are common to us, with the Beasts, <hi>viz.</hi> the five external Senses. This is a low, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Notion of spiritual Sense, to suppose that 'tis only a conceiving or imagining that Sort of Ideas which we have by our animal Senses, which Senses the Beasts have in as great Perfection as we; it is, as it were, a turning Christ, or the divine Nature in the Soul, into a meer Animal. There is nothing wanting in the Soul, as it is by Nature, to render it incapable of being the Subject of all these external Ideas, without any new Principles. A natural Man is capable of having an Idea, and a lively Idea of Shapes and Colours and Sounds when they are absent, and as capable as a regenerate Man is: So there is nothing supernatural in them. And 'tis known by abundant Experience, that 'tis not the advancing or perfecting humane Nature, which makes Persons more capable of having such lively and strong imaginary Ideas, but that on the contrary, the Weakness of Body and Mind, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers

               <p>As to a truly spiritual Sensation, not only is the Manner of its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Mind extraordinary, but the Sensation it self is totally diverse from all that Men have, or can have, in a State of Nature, as has been shewn.

For Instance, the external Idea a Man has now of Christ hanging on the Cross, and shedding his Blood, is no better in it self, than the external Idea that the <hi>Jews</hi> his Enemies had, who stood round his Cross and saw this with their bodily Eyes. The imaginary Idea which Men have now, of an external Brightness and Glory of God, is no better than the Idea the wicked Congregation in the Wilderness had of the external Glory of the Lord at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when they saw it with bodily Eyes; or any better than that Idea which Millions of cursed Reprobates will have of the external Glory of Christ at the Day of Judgment, who shall see, and have a very lively Idea of ten thousand Times greater external Glory of Christ, than ever yet was conceived in any Man's Imagination <note n="†" place="bottom">

Meerly the Way of Persons receiving these imaginary Ideas, don't alter the Nature of the Ideas themselves that are received: Let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in what Way they will, they are still but external Ideas, or Ideas of outward Appearances, and so are not spiritual. Yea, if Men should actually receive such external Ideas by the immediate Power of the most high God upon their Minds, they would not be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, they would be no more than a common Work of the Spirit of God; as is evident in Fact, in the Instance of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd on his Mind, by God himself, a clear and lively outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation or Idea of Jesus Christ, as <hi>the Star rising out of</hi> Jacob, when <hi>he heard the Words of God, and knew the Knowledge of the most High, and saw the Vision of the Almighty, falling into a Trance,</hi> Numb. 24. 16, 17. But yet had no Manner of spiritual Discovery of Christ; that Day-Star never spiritually rose in his Heart, he being but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man.</p>
               <p>And as these external Ideas have nothing divine or spiritual in their Nature, and nothing but what natural Men, without any new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005767_0117_102705E7EA8F33E0"/>
are capable of; so there is nothing in their Nature which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that peculiar, inimitable and unparallel'd Exercise of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Power of God, in order to their Production, which it has been shown there is in the the Production of true Grace. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be nothing in their Nature above the Power of the Devil. 'Tis certainly not above the Power of <hi>Satan</hi> to suggest Thoughts to Men; because otherwise he could not tempt them to Sin. And if he can suggest any Thoughts or Ideas at all, doubtless imaginary ones, or Ideas of Things external are not above his Power <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Consider how difficult, yea and impossible it is to determine that such a Voice, Vision or Revelation is of God, and that <hi>Satan</hi> cannot feign or counterfeit it; seeing he hath left no certain Marks by which we may distinguish one Spirit from another</q>. <hi>Flavel'</hi>s Causes and Cures of mental Errors, Cause 14.</note>; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ideas Men have are the lowest Sort of Ideas. These Ideas may be raised only by Impressions made on the Body, by moving the animal Spirits, and impressing the Brain. Abundant Experience does certainly show, that Alterations in the Body will excite imaginary or external Ideas in the Mind; as often, in case of a high Fever, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These external Ideas are as much below the more intellectual Exercises of the Soul, as the Body is a less noble Part of Man than the Soul.</p>
               <p>And there is not only nothing in the Nature of these external Ideas or Imaginations of outward Appearances, from whence we can infer that they are above the Power of the Devil; but it is certain also that the Devil can excite, and often hath excited such Ideas. They were external Ideas which he excited in the Dreams and Visions of the false Prophets of old, who were under the Influence of lying Spirits, that we often read of in Scripture, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Isai.</hi> 28. 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 4. And they were external Ideas that he often excited in the Minds of the heathen Priests, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians and Sorcerers in their Visions and Extasies; and they were external Ideas that he excited in the Mind of the Man Christ Jesus, when he shewed him all the Kingdoms of the World with the Glory of them, when those Kingdoms were not really in Sight.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Satan,</hi> or any created Being, has Power to impress the Mind with outward Representations, then no particular Sort of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Representations can be any Evidence of a divine Power. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power is no more requisite to represent the Shape of Man to the Imagination, than the Shape of any Thing else: There is no higher Kind of Power necessary to form in the Brain one bodily Shape or Colour than another: It needs a no more glorious Power to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Form of the Body of Man, than the Form of a Chip or Block;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:005767_0118_102705EEC0D1FDD0"/>
tho' it be of a very beautiful human Body, with a sweet Smile in his Countenance, or Arms open, or Blood running from Hands, Feet, and Side: That Sort of Power which can represent Black or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Imagination, can also represent White and shining Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: The Power and Skill which can well and exactly paint a Straw, or a Stick of Wood, on a Piece of Paper or Canvas; the same in Kind, only perhaps further improved, will be sufficient to paint the Body of a Man, with great Beauty and in royal Majesty, or a magnificent City, pav'd with Gold, full of Brightness, and a glorious Throne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So 'tis no more than the same Sort of Power that is requisite to paint one as the other of these on the Brain. The same Sort of Power that can put Ink upon Paper, can put on Leaf-Gold. So that it is evident to a Demonstration, if we suppose it to be in the Devil's Power to make any Sort of external Representation at all on the Fancy, (as without Doubt it is, and never any one questioned it who believed there was a Devil, that had any Agency with Mankind) I say, if so, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrably evident that a created Power may extend to all Kinds of external Appearances and Ideas in the Mind.</p>
               <p>From hence it again clearly appears, that no such Things have any thing in them that is spiritual supernatural and divine, in the Sense in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it has been proved that all truly gracious Experiences have. And tho' external Ideas, thro' Man's Make and Frame, do ordinarily in some Degree attend spiritual Experiences, yet these Ideas are no Part of their spiritual Experience, any more than the Motion of the Blood, and Beating of the Pulse, that attends Experiences, are a Part of spiritual Experience. And tho' undoubtedly, thro' Men's Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the present State, and especially thro' the weak Constitution of some Persons, gracious Affections which are very strong, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite lively Ideas in the Imagination; yet 'tis also undoubted, that when Person's Affections are <hi>founded on</hi> Imaginations, which is often the Case, those Affections are meerly natural and common, because they are built on a Foundation that is not spiritual; and so are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from gracious Affections, which, as has been proved, do evermore arise from those Operations that are spiritual and divine.</p>
               <p>These Imaginations do oftentimes raise the carnal Affections of Men to an exceeding great Height <note n="†" place="bottom">There is a remarkable Passage of Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on the Shortness of a Pharisaic Righteousness, p. 370, 371, of his Select Discourses, describing that Sort of Religion which is built on such a Foundation as I am here speaking of. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear transcribing the whole of it. Speaking of a Sort of Christians, whose Life is nothing but a strong Energy of Fancy, he says, <q>Least their Religion might too grosly discover it self to be nothing else but a Piece of Art, there may be sometimes such extraordinary Motions stirred up within them, which may prevent all their own Thoughts, that they may seem to be a true Operation of the divine Life; when yet all this is nothing else but the Energy of their own Self-Love, touch'd with some fleshly Apprehensions of divine Things, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them. There are such Things in our christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when a carnal, unhallowed Mind takes the Chair, and gets the expounding of them, may seem very delicious to the fleshly Appetites of Men; some Doctrines and Notions of free Grace and Justification, the magnificent Titles of Sons of God and Heirs of Heaven, ever flowing Streams of Joy and Pleasure that blessed Souls shall swim in to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, a glorious Paradise in the World to come, always spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with well-scented and fragrant Beauties, a new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> paved with Gold, and bespangled with Stars, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending in its vast Circuit such numberless Varieties, that a busy Curiosity may spend it self about to all Eternity. I doubt not but that sometimes the most fleshly and earthly Men, that fly in their Ambition to the Pomp of this World, may be so ravished with the Conceits of such Things as these, that they may seem to be made Partakers of the Powers of the World to come. I doubt not but that they might be much exalted with them, as the Souls of crazed or distracted Persons seem to be sometimes, when their Fancies play with those quick and nimble Spirits, which a distemper'd Frame of Body, and unnatural Heat in their Heads, beget within them. Thus may these blazing Comets rise up above the Moon, and climb higher than the Sun; which yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no solid Consistence of their own, and are of a base and earthly Alloy, will soon vanish and fall down again, being only born up by an external Force. They may seem to themselves to have attained higher than those noble Christians, that are gently moved by the natural Force of true Goodness: They seem be <hi>pleniores Deo,</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> more full of God] than those that are really informed and actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the divine Spirit, and do move on steadily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in the Way towards Heaven. As the Seed that was sown in stony Ground, grew up, and lengthen'd out it's Blade faster, than that which was sown in the good and fruitful Soil. And as the Motions of our Sense and Fancy and Passions, while our Souls are in this mortal Condition, sank down deeply into the Body, are many Times more vigorous, and make stronger Impressions upon us, than those of the higher Powers of the Soul, which are more subtil, and remote from these mixt animal Perceptions: That Devotion which is there seated, may seem to have more Energy and Life in it, than that which gently, and with a more delicate Kind of Touch spreads it self upon the Understanding, and from thence mildly derives it self thro' our Wills and Affections. But however, the former may be more boisterous for a Time, yet this is of a more consistent, spermatical and thriving Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For that proceeding indeed from nothing but a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual and fleshly Apprehension of God and true Happiness, is but of a slitting &amp; fading Nature; and as the sensible Powers and Faculties grow more languid, or the Sun of divine Light shines more brightly upon us, these earthly Devotions, like our culinary Fires, will abate their Heat and Fervour. But a true celestial Warmth will never be extinguish'd, because it is of an immortal Nature; and being once seated vitally in the Souls of Men, it will regulate and order all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it in a due Manner; as the natural Heat, radicated in the Hearts of living Creatures, hath the Dominion and Oeconomy of the whole Body under it. True Religion is no Piece of Artifice; it is no boiling up of our imaginative Powers, nor the glowing Heats of Passion; tho' these are too often mistaken for it, when in our Jugglings in Religion we cast a Mist before our own Eyes: But it is a new Nature, informing the Souls of Men; it is a godlike Frame of Spirit, discovering it self most of all in serene and clear Minds, in deep Humility, Meekness, Self-denial, universal Love to God and all true Goodness, without Partiality, and without Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy, whereby we are taught to know God, and knowing him to love him, and conform our selves as much as may be to all that Perfection which shines in him.</q>
                  </note>: And no wonder, when the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005767_0119_102705F05D5AFFD8"/>
Subjects of them have an ignorant, but undoubting Perswasion, that they are divine Manifestations, which the great Jehovah immediately

makes to their Souls, therein giving them Testimonies, in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Manner, of his high and peculiar Favour.</p>
               <p>Again, it is evident from what has been observed and proved of the Manner in which gracious Operations and Effects in the Heart are spiritual, supernatural and divine, that the immediate suggesting of the Words of Scripture to the Mind, has nothing in it which is spiritual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:005767_0121_102705FB6A77FA90"/>
I have had Occasion to say something of this already; and what has been said may be sufficient to evince it: But if the Reader bears in Mind what has been said concerning the Nature of spiritual Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Effects, it will be more abundantly Manifest that this is no spiritual Effect. For I suppose there is no Person of common Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding who will say or imagine, that the bringing Words (let 'em be what Words they will) to the Mind, is an Effect of that Nature which it is impossible the Mind of a natural Man, while he remains in a State of Nature, should be the Subject of, or any thing like it; or that it requires any new divine Sense in the Soul; or that the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sounds or Letters to the Mind, is an Effect of so high, holy and excellent a Nature, that it is impossible any created Power should be the Cause of it.</p>
               <p>As the suggesting Words of Scripture to the Mind, is only the exciting in the Mind Ideas of certain Sounds or Letters; so it is only one Way of exciting Ideas in the Imagination; for Sounds and Letters are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Things, that are the Objects of the external Senses of Seeing and Hearing. Ideas of certain Marks upon Paper, such as any of the twenty four Letters, in whatever Order, or any Sounds of the Voice, are as much external Ideas, as of any other Shapes or Sounds whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And therefore, by what has been already said concerning these external Ideas, it is evident they are nothing spiritual; and if at any Time the Spirit of God suggests these Letters or Sounds to the Mind, this is a <hi>common,</hi> and not any <hi>special</hi> or <hi>gracious</hi> Influence of that Spirit. And therefore it follows from what has been already proved, that those Affections which have this Effect for their Foundation, are no spiritual or gracious Affections.—But let it be observed what it is that I say, <hi>viz.</hi> When this Effect, even the immediate and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Manner of Words of Scripture's coming to the Mind,</hi> is that which excites the Affections, and is properly the Foundation of them, then these Affections are not spiritual. It may be so, that Persons may have gracious Affections going with Scriptures which come to their Minds, and the Spirit of God may make use of those Scriptures to excite them; when it is some spiritual Sense, Taste or Relish they have of the divine and excellent Things contained in those Scriptures, that is the Thing which excites their Affections, and not the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and sudden Manner of Words being brought to their Minds. They are affected with the Instruction they receive from the Words, and the View of the glorious Things of God or Christ, and Things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to them, that they contain and teach; and not because the Words came suddenly, as tho' some Person had spoke them to 'em, thence concluding that God did as it were immediately speak to 'em. Persons oftentimes are exceedingly affected on this Foundation; the Words of some great and high Promises of Scripture come suddenly to their Minds, and they look upon the Words as directed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005767_0122_1027060011E17BF0"/>
by God to them, as tho' the Words that Moment proceeded out of the Mouth of God as spoken to them: So that they take it as a Voice from God, immediately revealing to 'em their happy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, and promising such and such great Things to them: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005767_0123_102706020BE7CE48"/>
these Things, and their being affected by them, and being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Affection, and Hope of an Interest in them. On the contrary, they first imagine they are interested, and then are highly affected with that, and then can own these Things to be excellent. So that the sudden and extraordinary Way of the Scriptures coming to their Mind, is plainly the first Foundation of the whole; which is a clear Evidence of the wretched Delusion they are under.</p>
               <p>The first Comfort of many Persons, and what they call their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, is after this Manner: After Awakening and Terrors, some comfortable sweet Promise comes suddenly and wonderfully to their Minds; and the Manner of its coming makes 'em conclude it comes from God <hi>to them:</hi> And this is the very Thing that is all the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faith, and Hope, and Comfort: From hence they take their first Encouragement to trust in God and in Christ, because they think that God, by some Scripture so brought, has now already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to 'em that he loves 'em, and has already promised them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: Which is very absurd; for every one of common Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Principles of Religion, knows that it is God's Manner to reveal his Love to Men, and their Interest in the Promises, after they have believed, and not before; because they must first believe, before they have any Interest in the Promises to be revealed. The Spirit of God is a Spirit of Truth, and not of Lies: He don't bring Scriptures to Men's Minds to reveal to them that they have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in God's Favour and Promises, when they have none, having not yet believed: Which would be the Case, if God's bringing Texts of Scripture to Men's Minds to reveal to them that their Sins were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, or that it was God's Pleasure to give them the Kingdom, or any Thing of that Nature, went before, and was the Foundation of their first Faith. There is no Promise of the Covenant of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to any Man, 'till he has first believed in Christ; for 'tis by Faith alone that we become interested in Christ, and the Promises of the new Covenant made in him: And therefore whatever Spirit applics the Promises of that Covenant to a Person who has not first believed, as being already his, must be a lying Spirit; and that Faith which is first built on such an Application of Promises, is built upon a Lie. God's Manner is not to bring comfortable Texts of Scripture to give Men <hi>Assurance</hi> of his Love, and that they shall be happy, before they have had a Faith of <hi>Dependance</hi>

Speaking of them that say they have the Witness of the Spirit, that makes a Difference between them and Hypocrites, He says, <q> The Witness of the Spirit makes not the first Difference: for first a Man is a Believer, and in Christ, and justified, called, and sanctified, before the Spirit does Witness it; else the Spirit should witness to an Untruth, and Lie.</q>

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005767_0124_10270607C5848D48"/>
to a Person's Mind, be not so properly a Promise, as an Invitation; Yet if he makes the sudden or unusual Manner of the Invitation's coming to his Mind, the Ground on which he believes that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, it is not true Faith; because it is built on that which is not the true Ground of Faith. True Faith is built on no precarious Foundation: but a Determination that the Words of such a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Text were, by the immediate Power of God, suggested to the Mind, at such a Time, as tho' then spoken and directed by God to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

uncertain and precarious Determination, as has been now shewn; and therefore is a false and sandy Foundation for Faith; and accordingly that Faith which is built upon it is false. The only certain Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which any Person has to believe that he is invited to partake of the Blessings of the Gospel, is that the Word of God declares that Persons so qualified as he is, are invited, and God who declares it is true and cannot lie. If a Sinner be once convinced of the Veracity of God, and that the Scriptures are his Word, he'll need no more to convince and satisfy him that he is invited; for the Scriptures are full of Invitations to Sinners, to the chief of Sinners, to come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Benefits of the Gospel: He won't want any new speaking of God to him, what he hath spoken already will be enough with him.</p>
               <p>As the first Comfort of many Persons, and their Affections at the Time of their supposed Conversion, are built on such Grounds as these which have been mentioned; so are their Joys and Hopes, and other Affections, from Time to Time afterwards. They have often particular Words of Scripture, sweet Declarations and Promises sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to 'em, which by Reason of the Manner of their coming, they think are <hi>immediately</hi> sent from God to them, <hi>at that Time;</hi> which they look upon as their Warrant to take 'em; and which they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make the main Ground of their appropriating them to themselves, and of the Comfort they take in them, and the Confidence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them. Thus they imagine a kind of Conversation is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on between God and them; and that God, from Time to Time, does, as it were, immediately speak to 'em, and satisfy their Doubts and testifies his Love to 'em, and promises 'em Supports and Supplies, and his Blessing in such and such Cases, and reveals to 'em clearly their Interest in eternal Blessings. And thus they are often elevated, and have a Course of a sudden and tumultuous Kind of Joys, mingled with a strong Confidence, and high Opinion of themselves; when indeed the main Ground of these Joys, and this Confidence is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing <hi>contained in,</hi> or <hi>taught by</hi> these Scriptures, as they lie in the

Again, it plainly appears from what has been demonstrated, <hi>That no Revelation of secret Facts by immediated Suggestion,</hi> is any thing spiritual and divine, in that Sense wherein gracious Effects and Operations are so.</p>
               <p>By <hi>secret Facts</hi> I mean Things that have been done, or are come to pass, or shall hereafter come to pass, which are secret in that Sense that they don't appear to the Senses, nor are known by any Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any Evidence to Reason, nor any other Way, but only by that Revelation by immediate Suggestion of the Ideas of them to the Mind. Thus for Instance, if it should be reveal'd to me that the next Year this Land would be invaded by a Fleet from <hi>France,</hi> or that such and such Persons would then be converted, or that I myself should then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; not by enabling me to argue out these Events from any thing which now appears in Providence; but immediately suggesting and bearing in upon my Mind, in an extraordinary Manner, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension or Ideas of these Facts, with a strong Suggestion or Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on my Mind, that I had no Hand in myself, that these Things would come to pass: Or if it should be revealed to me, that this Day there is a Battle fought between the Armies of such and such Powers in <hi>Europe;</hi> or that such a Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> was this Day converted, or is now in a converted State, having been converted formerly, or that one of my Neighbours is converted, or that I my self am converted; not by having any other Evidence of any of these Facts, from whence I argue them, but an immediate extraordinary Suggestion or Excitation of these Ideas, and a strong Impression of 'em upon my Mind: This is a Revelation of secret Facts by immediate Suggestion, as much as if the Facts were future; for the Facts being past, present, or future alters not the Case, as long as they are secret and hidden from my Senses and Reason, and not spoken of in Scripture, nor known by me any other Way than by <hi>immediate Suggestion.</hi> If I have it reveal'd to
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005767_0129_1027062062CC6AB0"/>
me, that such a Revolution is come to pass this Day in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, it is the very same Sort of Revelation, as if it were revealed to me that such a Revolution would come to pass there this Day come twelve-month; because, tho' one is present and the other future, yet both are equally hidden from me, any other Way than by immediate Revelation. When <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul</hi> that the Asses which he went to seek were found, and that his Father had left caring for the Asses and sorrowed for him; this was by the same Kind of Revelation, as that by which he told <hi>Saul,</hi> that in the Plain of <hi>Tabor,</hi> there should meet him three Men going up to God to <hi>Bethel,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 2, 3.) tho' one of these Things was future and the other was not. So when <hi>Elisha</hi> told the King of <hi>Israel</hi> the Words that the King of <hi>Syria</hi> spake in his Bed-chamber, it was by the same Kind of Revelation with that by which he foretold many Things to come.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident that this Revelation of secret Facts by immediate Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, has nothing of the Nature of a spiritual and divine Operation, in the Sense fore-mentioned: There is nothing at all in the Nature of the Perceptions or Ideas themselves, which are excited in the Mind, that is divinely excellent, and so, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar above all the Ideas of natural Men; tho' the Manner of exciting the Ideas be extraordinary. In those Things which are spiritual, as has been shown, not only <hi>the Manner of producing Effect,</hi> but <hi>the Effect wrought</hi> is divine, and so v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly above all that can be in an unsanctified Mind. Now simply the having an Idea of Facts, setting aside the Manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing those Ideas, is nothing beyond what the Minds of wicked Men are susceptible of, without any Goodness in 'em; and they all, either have or will have, the Knowledge of the Truth of the greatest and most important Facts, that have been, are, or shall be.</p>
               <p>And as to the extraordinary Manner of producing the Ideas or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Facts, even by immediate Suggestion, there is nothing in it, but what the Minds of natural Men, while they are yet natural Men, are capable of; as is manifest in <hi>Balaam,</hi> and others spoken of in the Scripture. And therefore it appears that there is nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to this immediate Suggestion of secret Facts that is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, in the Sense in which it has been proved that gracious Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are so. If there be nothing in the Ideas themselves, which is holy and divine, and so nothing but what may be in a Mind not sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, then God can put 'em into the Mind <hi>by immediate Power,</hi> without sanctifying it. As there is nothing in the Idea of a Rainbow itself, that is of a holy and divine Nature; so that there is nothing hinders but that an unsanctified Mind may receive that Idea: So God if he pleases, and when he pleases, <hi>immediately, and in an extraordinary Manner,</hi> may excite that Idea in an unsanctified Mind. So also, as there is nothing in the Idea or Knowledge that such and such particular Persons are forgiven and accepted of God, and entitled to Heaven, but what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005767_0130_1027062203BDEA90"/>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> it upon an unsanctified Mind now: There is no Principle wanting in an unsanctified Mind, to make it capable of such a Suggestion or Impression; nor is there any Thing in them to exclude, or necessarily to prevent such a Suggestion.</p>
               <p>And if these Suggestions of secret Facts be attended with <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> immediately and extraordinarily brought to Mind, about some other Facts that seem in some Respects similar, that don't make the Operation to be of a spiritual and divine Nature. For that Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Words of Scripture is no more divine, than the Suggestion of the Facts themselves; as his been just now demonstrated: And two Effects together, which are neither of them spiritual, can't make up one complex Effect, that is spiritual.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, from what has been already shewn, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, that those Affections which are properly founded on such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Suggestions, or supposed Suggestions of secret Facts, are not gracious Affections. Not but that it is possible that such Suggestions may <hi>be the Occasion,</hi> or <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> of gracious Affections; for so may a Mistake and Delusion; but it is never properly the <hi>Foundation</hi> of gracious Affections: For gracious Affections, as has been shewn, are all the Effects of an Influence and Operation which is spiritual, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and divine. But there are many Affections, and high Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which some have, that have such Kind of Suggestions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations for their very Foundation: They look upon these as spiritual Discoveries; which is a gross Delusion; and this Delusion is truly the Spring whence their Affections flow.</p>
               <p>Here it may be proper to observe, that 'tis exceeding manifest from what has been said, that what many Persons call the <hi>Witness of the Spirit</hi> that they are the Children of God, has nothing in it spiritual and divine; and consequently that the Affections built upon it, are vain and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. That which may call the Witness of the Spirit, is no other than an immediate Suggestion and Impression of that Fact, otherwise secret, that they are converted, or made the Children of God, and so that their Sins are pardoned, and that God has given 'em a Title to Heaven. This Kind of Knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowing that a certain Person is converted, and delivered from Hell, and entitled to Heaven, is no divine Sort of Knowledge in it self. This Sort of Fact, is not that which requires any higher or more divine Kind of Suggestion, in order to impress it on the Mind, than any other Fact which <hi>Balaam</hi> had impress'd on his Mind. It requires no higher Sort of Idea or Sensation, for a Man to have the Apprehension of his own Conversion impress'd upon him, than to have the Apprehension of his Neighbour's Conversion, in like Manner, impress'd: But God, if he pleased, might impress the Knowledge of this Fact, that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005767_0131_10270627F46E0EE0"/>
his Neighbour's Sins, and given him a Title to Heaven, as well as any other Fact, without any Communication of his Holiness: The Excellency and Importance of the Fact, don't at all hinder a natural Man's Mind being susceptible of an immediate Suggestion and Impression of it. <hi>Balaam</hi> had as excellent, and important, and glorious Facts as this, immediately impress'd on his Mind, without any gracious Influence; as particularly, the coming of Christ, an his setting up his glorious Kingdom, and the Blessedness of the spiritual <hi>Israel</hi> in his peculiar Favour and their Happiness living and dying.

And tho' it be true, that it is not possible that a natural Man should have that individual Sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Spirit of God, that he is converted, because it is not true; yet that don't arise from the Nature of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Influence which immediately suggests this Fact, when it is true, is of no different Kind from that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately suggests other true Facts: And so the Kind and Nature of the Influence, is not above what is common to natural Men, with good Men.</p>
               <p>But this is a mean ignoble Notion of the Witness of the Spirit of God given to his dear Children, to suppose that there is nothing in the Kind and Nature of that Influence of the Spirit of God, in imparting this high and glorious Benefits but what is common to natural Men, or which Men are capable of, and be in the mean Time altogether unsanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and the Children of Hell; and that therefore the Benefit or Gift it self has nothing of the holy Nature of the Spirit of God in it, nothing of a vital Communication of that Spirit. This Notion greatly debases that high and most exalted Kind of Influence and Operation of the Spirit, which there is in the true Witness of the Spirit <note n="†" place="bottom">The late venerable <hi>Stoddard</hi> in his younger Time, falling in with the Opinion of some others, receiv'd this Notion of the Witness of the Spirit, by way of immediate Suggestion; but in the latter Part of his Life, when he had more thoroughly weighed Things, and had more Experience, he entirely rejected it; as appears by his Treatise of the Nature of saving Conversion, p. 84. <q>The Spirit of God doth not testify to particular Persons, that they are godly. Some think that the Spirit of God doth testify it to some; and they ground it on Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit it self heareth Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi> They think the Spirit reveals it by giving on inward Testimony to it; and some godly Men think they have had Experience of it: But they may easily mistake; when the Spirit of God doth eminently stir up a Spirit of Faith, and sheds abroad the Love of God in the Heart, it is easy to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it for a Testimony. And that is not the Meaning of <hi>Paul'</hi>s Words. The Spirit reveals Things to us, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Eyes to see what is revealed in the Word; but the Spirit doth not reveal new Truths, not revealed in the Word. The Spirit discovers the Grace of God in Christ, and thereby draws forth special Actings of Faith and Love, which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential; but it doth not work in Way of Testimony.

I have known many that have had Assurances; yet never saw them prove right, 'till it witnessed this was here. What should be the Causes of this, and that Men should make Blusters in the Churches because of this, as tho' it was building on Works? In several Men they are several. 1.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> also much opposes this Notion of the Witness of the Spirit by immediate Revelation. Sacramental Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, Med. 4. speaking of the Sealing of the Spirit, he says, <q>In Sealing the Believer, he doth not make use of an audible Voice, nor the Ministry of Angels, nor immediate and extraordinary Revelations; but he makes use of his own Graces, implanted in our Hearts, and his own Promises, written in the Scripture: And in this Method, he usually brings the doubting trembling Heart of a Believer to Rest and Comfort</q>. Again, <hi>Ibid.</hi> 
                        <q>Assurance is produced in our Souls by the reflexive Acts of Faith: The Spirit helps us to reflect upon what hath been done by him formerly upon our Hearts; <hi>hereby we know that we know him,</hi> 1 John 2. 3. To know that we know, is a reflex Act. Now it is impossible there should be a reflex, before there hath been a direct Act. No Man can have the Evidence of his Faith, before the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is insused, and the vital Act perform'd. The Object Matter, to which the Spirit seals, is his own sanctifying Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</q>. Afterwards, <hi>Ibid.</hi> he says, <q>Immediate Ways of the Spirit's Sealing are ceased. No Man may now expect, by any new Revelation, or Sign from Heaven, by any Voice, or extraordinary Inspiration, to have his Salvation seal'd; but must expect that Mercy in God's ordinary Way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, searching the Scriptures examining our own Hearts, and waiting on the Lord in Prayer. The learned <hi>Gerson</hi> gives an Instance of one that had been long upon the Borders of Despair, and at last sweetly assured and settled: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Non ex nova aliqua Revelatione;</hi> not by any new Revelation, but by subjecting my Understanding to, and comparing my Heart with the written Word. And Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> in his Treatise of <hi>the Covenants,</hi> speaks of another, that so vehemently panted after the Sealings and Assurance of the Love of God to his Soul, that for a long Time he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired some Voice from Heaven; and sometimes, walking in the solitary Fields, earnestly desired some mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Voice from the Trees or Stones there. This was denied him; but in Time, a better was afforded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Way</q>. Again, <hi>Ibid.</hi> 
                        <q>This Method of Sealing, is beyond all other Methods in the World. For in miraculous Voices and Inspirations, 'tis possible there many <hi>subesse falsum,</hi> be found some Cheat, or Impostures of the Devil; but the Spirit's Witness in the Heart, suitable to the Revelation in the Scripture, cannot deceive us</q>.</p>

is the same Thing with the Earnest of the Spirit, by 2 Cor. 1. 22. <hi>Who hath also sealed Us, and given the Earnest of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> And Eph. 1. 13, 14. <hi>In whom, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise; which is the Earnest of our Inheritance, until the Redemption of the purchased Possession, unto the Praise of his Glory.</hi> Now the Earnest is Part of the Money agreed for, given in Hand, as a Token of the Whole, to be paid in due Time; a Part of the promised Inheritance, granted now, in Token of full Possession of the Whole hereafter. But surely that Kind of Communication of the Spirit of God, which is of the Nature of eternal Glory, is the highest and most excellent Kind of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, something that is in its own Nature spiritual, holy and divine, and far from any Thing that is common; and therefore high above any Thing of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

'Tis Grace that is the Seed of Glory, and Dawning of Glory in the Heart, and therefore 'tis Grace that is the Earnest of the future Inheritance. What is it that is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or Earnest of eternal Life in the Soul, but spiritual Life? And what is that but Grace? The Inheritance that Christ has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for the Elect, is the Spirit of God; not in any extraordinary Gifts, but in his vital Indwelling in the Heart, exerting and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating himself there, in his own proper, holy or divine Nature: And this is the Sum total of the Inheritance that Christ purchased for the Elect.

This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance was the grand Legacy which Christ left his Disciples and Church, in his last Will and Testament; <hi>John</hi> Chap. 14, and 15, and 16. This is the Sum of the Blessings of eternal Life, which shall be given in Heaven. (Compare <hi>John</hi> 7. 37, 38, 39. and <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 6. and 22. 1, 17.) 'Tis through the vital Communications and Indwelling of the Spirit, that the Saints have all their Light, Life, Holiness, Beauty and Joy in Heaven: And 'tis thro' the vital Communications and Indwelling of the same Spirit, that the Saints have all Light, Life, Holiness, Beauty &amp; Comfort on Earth; but only communicated in less Measure. And this vital Indwelling of the Spirit in the Saints, in this less Measure and small Beginning, is <hi>the Earnest of the Spirit, the Earnest of the future Inheritance, and the first Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> as the Apostle calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. where, by <hi>the first Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> the Apostle undoubtedly means the same vital gracious Principle, that he speaks of in all the preceeding Part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he calls Spirit, and sets in Opposition to Flesh or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore this Earnest of the Spirit, and first Fruits of the Spirit, which has been shown to be the same with the Seal of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is the vital, gracious, sanctifying Communication and Influence of the Spirit, and not any immediate Suggestion or Revelation of Facts by the Spirit. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <q>After a Man is in Christ, not to judge by the Work, is not to judge by the Spirit. For the Apostle makes the Earnest of the Spirit to be the Seal. Now Earnest is Part of the Money bargain'd for; the Beginning of Heaven, of the Light and Life of it. He that sees not that the Lord is his by that, sees no God his at all. Oh therefore, do not look for a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without a Word to reveal, nor a Word to reveal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeing and feeling of some Work first. I thank the Lord, I do but Pity those that think otherwise. If a Sheep of Christ, Oh, wander not</q>. <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Parable, P. I. p. 86.</note>

               <p>And indeed the Apostle, when in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. he speaks of the Spirit's bearing Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God, does sufficiently explain himself, if his Words were but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. What is here express'd, is connected with the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Verses, as resulting from what the Apostle had said there, as every Reader may see. The three Verses together are thus, <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: For ye
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005767_0140_102706483A225300"/>
have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear; but ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it self beareth Witness with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God.</hi> Here, what the Apostle says, if we take it together, plainly shews, that what he has Respect to, when he speaks of the Spirit's giving us Witness or Evidence that we are God's Children; is his dwelling in us, and leading us, as a Spirit of Adoption, or Spirit of a Child, disposing us to behave towards God as to a Father. This is the Witness or Evidence the Apostle speaks of, that we <hi>are Children,</hi> that we <hi>have the Spirit of Children,</hi> or Spirit of Adoption. And what is that, but the Spirit of Love? There are two Kinds of Spirits the Apostle speaks of, the Spirit of a Slave, or <hi>the Spirit of Bondage,</hi> that is <hi>Fear;</hi> and the Spirit of a Child, or <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> &amp; that is <hi>Love.</hi> The Apostle says, we han't received the Spirit of Bondage, or of Slaves, which is a Spirit of Fear; but we have received the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous noble Spirit of Children, a Spirit of Love, which naturally disposes us to go to God, as Children to a Father, and behave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God as Children. And this is the Evidence or Witness which the Spirit of God gives us that we are Children. This is the plain Sense of the Apostle: And so undoubtedly the Apostle here is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the very same Way of casting out Doubting, and <hi>Fear,</hi> and the Spirit of Bondage, which the Apostle <hi>John</hi> speaks of, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 18. <hi>viz.</hi> By the prevailing of <hi>Love,</hi> that is the Spirit of a Child. The Spirit of Bondage works by Fear, the Slave fears the Rod; but Love cries <hi>Abba Father;</hi> it disposes us to go to God, and behave ourselves towards God as Children; and it gives us clear Evidence of our Union to God as his Children, and so casts out Fear. So that it appears that the Witness of the Spirit the Apostle speaks of, is far from being any Whisper, or immediate Suggestion or Revelation; but that gracious holy Effect of the Spirit of God in the Hearts of the Saints, the Disposition and Temper of Children, appearing in sweet child-like Love to God, which casts out Fear, or a Spirit of a Slave.</p>
               <p>And the same Thing is evident from all the Context: 'Tis plain the Apostle speaks of the Spirit, over and over again, as dwelling in the Hearts of the Saints, as a gracious Principle, set in Opposition to the Flesh or Corruption: And so he does in the Words that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately introduce this Passage we are upon, Verse 13. <hi>For if ye live after the Flesh, ye shall die; but if ye, thro' the Spirit do mortify the Deeds of the Flesh, ye shall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed it is past Doubt with me, that the Apostle has a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Respect to the Spirit of Grace, or the Spirit of Love, or Spirit of a Child, in its more lively Actings: For 'tis <hi>perfect Love,</hi> or <hi>strong Love</hi> only, which so witnesses or evidences that we are Children, as to cast out Fear, and wholly deliver from the Spirit of Bondage. The strong and lively Exercises of a Spirit of child-like, evangelical,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005767_0141_1027064E2297E560"/>
humble Love to God, give clear Evidence of the Soul's Relation to God, as his Child; which does very greatly and directly satisfy be Soul. And tho' it be far from being true, that the Soul in this Case, judges only by an immediate Witness, without any Sign or Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for it judges and is assured by the greatest Sign and clearest Evidence; yet in this Case, the Saint stands in no need of multiplied Signs, or any long Reasoning upon them. And tho' the Sight of his <hi>relative Union</hi> with God, and his being in his Favour, is not without a Medium, because he sees it by that Medium, <hi>viz.</hi> his Love; yet his Sight of the <hi>Union of his Heart</hi> to God is immediate: Love, the Bond of Union, is seen intuitively: The Saint sees and feels plainly the Union between his Soul and God; it is so strong and lively, that he can't doubt of it. And hence he is assured that he is a Child. How can he doubt whether he stands in a child-like Relation to God, when he plainly sees a child-like Union between God and his Soul, and hence does boldly, and as it were, naturally and necessarily cry, <hi>Abba Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Apostle says, the Spirit bears Witness <hi>with our Spirits;</hi> by <hi>our Spirit</hi> here, is meant our Conscience, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Spirit of Man; Prov. 20. 27. <hi>The Spirit of Man is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord, searching all the inward Parts of the Belly.</hi> We else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where read of the Witness of this Spirit of our's; 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>For our Rejoicing is this, the Testimony of our Conscience.</hi> And 1 John 3. 19, 20, 21. <hi>And hereby do we know that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts before him. For if our Heart condemn us, God is greater than our Heart, and knoweth all Things. Beloved if our Heart condemn us not, then have we Confidence towards God.</hi> When the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Spirit of God bearing Witness with our Spirit, he is not to be understood of two Spirits, that are two sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, collatteral, independant Witnesses; but 'tis by one, that we receive the Witness of the other: The Spirit of God gives the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by infusing and shedding abroad the Love of God, the Spirit of a Child, in the Heart, and our Spirit, or our Conscience, receives and declares this Evidence for our Rejoicing.</p>
               <p>Many have been the Mischiefs that have arisen from that false and delusive Notion of the Witness of the Spirit, that it is a Kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Voice, Suggestion, or Declaration from God to a Man, that he is beloved of him, and pardoned, elected, or the like, sometimes with, and sometimes without a Text of Scripture; and many have been the false, and vain, (tho' very high) Affections that have arisen from hence. And 'tis to be feared that Multitudes of Souls have been eternally undone by it. I have therefore insisted the longer on this Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:005767_0142_10270653DDA2D678"/>
But I proceed now to a second Characteristic of gracious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>II. The first objective Ground of gracious Affections, is the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendently excellent and amiable Nature of divine Things, as they are in themselves; and not any conceived Relation they bear to Self, or Self-Interest.</p>
               <p>I say that the supremely excellent Nature of divine Things, is the <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>primary and original</hi> objective Foundation of the spiritual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of true Saints; for I do not suppose that all Relation which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things bear to themselves, and their own particular Interest, are wholly excluded from all Influence in their gracious Affections. For this may have, and indeed has, a secondary and consequential Influence in those Affections that are truly holy and spiritual; as I shall shew how by and by.</p>
               <p>It was before observed, that the Affection of Love is as it were the Fountain of all Affection; and particularly, that christian Love is the Fountain of all gracious Affections: Now the divine Excellency and Glory of God, and Jesus Christ, the Word of God, the Works of God, and the Ways of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the primary Reason, why a true Saint loves these Things; and not any supposed Interest that he has in them, or any conceived Benefit that he has received from them, or shall receive from them, or any such imagined Relation which they bear to his Interest, that Self-Love can properly be said to be the first Foundation of his Love to these Things.</p>
               <p>Some say that all Love arises from Self Love; and that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible in the Nature of Things, for any Man to have any Love to God, or any other Being, but that Love to himself must be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it. But I humbly suppose it is for Want of Consideration, that they say so. They argue, that whoever loves God, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires his Glory, or the Enjoyment of him, he desires these Things as his own Happiness; the Glory of God, and the beholding and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Perfections, are considered as Things <hi>agreeable to him,</hi> tending to make him happy; he places his Happiness in them, and desires them as Things, which (if they were obtained) would be delightful to him, or would fill him with Delight and Joy, and so make him happy. And so, they say, it is from Self-love, or a Desire of his own Happiness, that he desires God should be glorified, and desires to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and enjoy his glorious Perfections. But then they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a little further, and enquire how the Man came <hi>to place his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> in God's being glorified, and in contemplating and enjoying God's Perfections. There is no Doubt, but that after God's Glory, and the beholding his Perfections, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> become so agreeable to him, that he places his highest Happiness in these Things, then he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them, as he desires his own Happiness. But how came these
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:005767_0143_1027065584373170"/>
Things to be so agreeable to him, that he esteems it his highest Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to glorify God, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Is not this the Fruit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Love? A Man must first love God, or have his Heart united to him, before he will esteem God's Good his own, and before he will desire the glorifying and enjoying of God, as his Happiness. 'Tis not strong arguing, that because <hi>after</hi> a Man has his Heart united to God in Love, <hi>as a Fruit of this,</hi> he desires his Glory and Enjoyment as his own Happiness, that therefore a Desire of this Happiness of his own, must needs be the <hi>Cause and Foundation</hi> of his Love: Unless it be strong arguing, that because a Father begat a Son, that therefore his Son certainly begat him. If <hi>after</hi> a Man loves God, and has his Heart so united to him, as to look upon God as his chief Good, and on God's Good as his own, it will be a <hi>Consequence and Fruit of this,</hi> that even Self-love, or love to his own Happiness, will cause him to desire the glorifying and enjoying of God; it will not thence follow, that this very Exercise of Self-love, went <hi>before</hi> his Love to God, and that his Love to God was a <hi>Consequence and Fruit of that.</hi> Something else, entirely distinct from Self-love might be the Cause of this, <hi>viz.</hi> A Change made in the Views of his Mind, and Relish of his Heart; whereby he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends a Beauty, Glory, and supream Good, in God's Nature, as it is in it self. This may be the Thing that first draws his Heart to him, and causes his Heart to be united to him, prior to all Considerations of his own Interest or Happiness, altho' after this, and as a Fruit of this, he necessarily seeks his Interest and Happiness in God.</p>
               <p>There is such a Thing, as a Kind of Love or Affection, that a Man may have towards Persons or Things, which <hi>does properly arise</hi> from Self-love; a preconceived Relation to himself, or some Respect already manifested by another to him, or some Benefit already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or depended on, <hi>is truly the first Foundation</hi> of his Love, and what his Affection does wholly arise from; and is what preceedes any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of, or Delight in the Nature and Qualities inherent in the Being beloved, as beautiful and amiable, When the first Thing that draws a Man's Benevolence to another, is the beholding those Qualifications and Properties in him, which appear to him lovely in themselves; and the Subject of them, on this Account, worthy of Esteem and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, Love arises in a very different Manner, than when it first arises from some Gift bestowed by another, or depended on from him, as a Judge loves and favours a Man that has bribed him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or from the Relation he supposes another has to him, as a Man who loves another because he looks upon him as his Child. When Love to another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises thus, it does truly and properly arise from Self-love.</p>
               <p>That Kind of Affection to God or Jesus Christ, which does thus properly arise from Self-love, cannot be a truly gracious and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love; as appears from what has been said already: For Self-love is a Principle entirely natural, and as much in the Hearts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005767_0144_1027065B25C426E0"/>
as Angels; and therefore surely nothing that is the meer Result of it, can be supernatural and divine, in the Manner before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>There is a natural Love to Christ, as to one that doth thee Good, and for thine own Ends; and spiritual, for himself, whereby the Lord only is exalted</q>. <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Parable of the ten Virgins, P. I. p. 25.</note>. Christ plainly speaks of this Kind of Love, as what is nothing beyond the Love of wicked Men, Luke 6. 32. <hi>If ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? For Sinners also love those that love them.</hi> And the Devil himself knew that that Kind of Respect to God which was so mercenary, as to be only for Benefits received or depended on, (which is all one) is worthless in the Sight of God; otherwise he never would have made use of such a Slander before God, against <hi>Job,</hi> as in Job 1. 9, 10. <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>serve God for naught? Hast thou not made an Hedge about him, and about his House.</hi> &amp;c.—? Nor would God ever have implicitly allowed the Objection to have been good, in case the Accusation had been true, by allowing that that Matter should be tried, and that <hi>Job</hi> should be so dealt with, that it might appear in the Event, whether <hi>Job'</hi>s Respect to God was thus mercenary or no, and by putting the Proof of the Sincerity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Respect, upon that Issue.</p>
               <p>'Tis unreasonable to think otherwise, than that the first Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a true Love to God, is that whereby he is in himself love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or worthy to be loved, or the supream Loveliness of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is certainly what makes him chiefly amiable. What chiefly makes a Man, or any Creature lovely, is his! Excellency; and so what chiefly renders God lovely, and must undoubtedly be the chief Ground of true Love, is his Excellency. God's Nature, or the Divinity, is infinitely excellent; yea 'tis infinite Beauty, Brightness, and Glory itself. But how can that be <hi>true Love</hi> of this excellent and lovely Nature, which is not built on the Foundation of <hi>it's true Loveliness?</hi> How can that be true Love of Beauty and Brightness, which is not for Beauty and Brightness sake? How can that be a true Prizing of that which is in itself infinitely worthy and precious, which is not for the Sake of it's Worthiness and Preciousness? This infinite Excellency of the divine Nature, as it is in it self, is the true Ground of all that is good in God in any Respect; but how can a Man truly and rightly love God, without loving him for that Excellency in him, which is the Foundation of all that is in any Manner of Respect good or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable in him? They whose Affection to God is founded first on his Profitableness to them, their Affection begins at the wrong End; they regard God only for the utmost Limit of the Stream
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005767_0145_102706600581BAA0"/>
of divine Good, where it touches them, and reaches their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and have no Respect to that infinite Glory of God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the original Good, and the true Fountain of all Good, the first Fountain of all Loveliness of every Kind, and so the first Foundation of all true Love.</p>
               <p>A natural Principle of Self-love may be the Foundation of great Affections towards God and Christ, without seeing any Thing of the Beauty &amp; Glory of the divine Nature. There is a certain Gratitude that is a meer natural Thing. Gratitude is one of the natural Affections of the Soul of Man, as well as Anger; and there is a Gratitude that arises from Self-love, very much in the same Manner that Anger does. Anger in Men is an Affection excited <hi>against</hi> another, or in Opposition to another, for something in him that crosses Self-love: Gratitude is an Affection one has <hi>towards</hi> another, for loving him, or gratifying him, or for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him that suits Self-love. And there may be a Kind of Gratitude, without any true or proper Love; as there may be Anger without any proper Hatred, as in Parents towards their Children, that they may be angry with, and yet at the same Time have a strong habitual Love to them. This Gratitude is the Principle which is in exercise in wicked Men, in that which Christ declares concerning them, in the 6th of <hi>Luke,</hi> where he says, <hi>Sinners love those that love them;</hi> and which he declares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning even the <hi>Publicans,</hi> who were some of the most carnal and profligate Sort of Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 46. This is the very Principle that is wrought upon by Bribery, in unjust Judges; and it is a Principle that even the brute Beasts do exercise: A Dog will love his Master that is kind to him. And we see in innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that meer Nature is sufficient to excite Gratitude in Men, or to affect their Hearts with Thankfulness to others for Kindnesses received; and sometimes towards them, whom at the same Time they have an habitual Enmity against. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain greatly affected, and even dissolved with Gratitude towards <hi>David,</hi> for sparing his Life; and yet remained an habitual Enemy to him. And as Men, from meer Nature, may be thus affected towards Men; so they may towards God. There is nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but that the same Self-love may work after the same Manner towards God, as towards Men. And we have manifest Instances of it in Scripture; as indeed the Children of <hi>Israel, who sang God's Praises</hi> at the Red Sea,<hi> but soon forgot God's Works;</hi> and in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> who was greatly affected with the miraculous Cure of his Leprosy, so as to have his Heart engaged thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to worship the God that had heal'd him, and him only, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting when it would expose him to be ruin'd in his temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. So was <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> greatly affected with God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005767_0146_10270661A20A14B0"/>
to him, in restoring him to his Reason and Kingdom, after his dwelling with the Beasts.</p>
               <p>Gratitude being thus a natural Principle, it renders Ingratitude so much the more vile and heinous; because it shews a dreadful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of Wickedness when it even overbears, and suppresses the better Principles of human Nature: As it is mentioned as an Evidence of the high Degree of the Wickedness of many of the Heathen, that they were <hi>without natural Affection,</hi> Rom. 2. 31. But that the Want of Gratitude, or natural Affection, are Evidences of an high Degree of <hi>Vice,</hi> is no Argument that all Gratitude and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection, has the Nature of <hi>Vertue,</hi> or <hi>Saving-Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Self-love, through the Exercise of a meer natural Gratitude, may be the Foundation of a Sort of Love to God many Ways. A Kind of Love may arise from a false Notion of God, that Men have been educated in, or have some Way imbibed; as tho' he were only Goodness and Mercy, and no revenging Justice; or as tho' the Exercises of his Goodness were necessary, and not free and sovereign; or as tho' his Goodness were dependant on what is in them, and as it were constrained by them. Men on such Grounds as these, may love a God of their own forming in their Imaginations, when they are far from loving such a God as reigns in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Again, Self-love may be the Foundation of an Affection in Men towards God, thro' a great Insensibility of their State with Regard to God, and for Want of Conviction of Conscience to make 'em sensible how dreadfully they have provoked God to Anger; they have no Sense of the Heinousness of Sin, as against God, and of the infinite and terrible Opposition of the holy Nature of God against it: And so having formed in their Minds such a God as suits them, and thinking God to be such an one as themselves, who favours and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with them, they may like him very well, and feel a Sort of Love to him, when they are far from loving the true God. And Men's Affections may be much moved towards God, from Self-love, by some remarkable outward Benefits received from God; as it was with <hi>Naaman, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, a very high Affection towards God, may, and often does arise in Men, from an Opinion of the Favour and Love of God to them, as the first Foundation of their Love to him. After Awakenings and Distress through Fears of Hell, they may suddenly get a Notion, through some Impression on their Imagination, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Suggestion, with or without Texts of Scripture, or by some other Means, that God loves 'em, and has forgiven their Sins, and made them his Children; and this is the first Thing that causes their Affections to flow towards God and Jesus Christ: And then after this, and upon this Foundation, many Things in God may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005767_0147_102706654CD72BA0"/>
lovely to them, and Christ may seem excellent. And if such Persons are asked, whether God appears lovely and amiable in himself? They would perhaps readily answer, Yes; when indeed, if the Matter be strictly examined, this good Opinion of God was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased and paid for before ever they afforded it, in the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and infinite Benefits they imagined they received from God; and they allow God to be lovely in himself, no otherwise, than that he has forgiven them, and accepted them, and loves them above most in the World, and has engaged to improve all his infinite Power and Wisdom in preferring, dignifying and exalting them, and will do for 'em just as they would have him. When once they are firm in this Apprehension, 'tis easy to own God and Christ to be lovely and glorious, and to admire and extol them. 'Tis easy for them to own Christ to be a lovely Person, and the best in the World, when they are first firm in it, that he, tho' Lord of the Universe, is captivated with Love to them, and has his Heart swallowed up in them, and prizes 'em far beyond most of their Neighbours, and loved 'em from Eternity, and died for 'em, and will make 'em reign in eternal Glory with him in Heaven. When this is the Case with carnal Men, their very Lusts will make him seem lovely: Pride it self will prejudice them in Favour of that which they call Christ: Selfish proud Man naturally calls that lovely that greatly contributes to his Interest, and gratifies his Ambition.</p>
               <p>And as this Sort of Persons begin, so they go on. Their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are raised from Time to Time, primarily on this Foundation of Self-love and a Conceit of God's Love to them. Many have a false Notion of Communion with God, as tho' it were carried on by Impulses, and Whispers, and external Representations, immediately made to their Imagination. These Things they often have; which they take to be Manifestations of God's great Love to 'em, and Evidences of their high Exaltation above others of Mankind; and so their Affections are often renewedly set a going.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Exercises of true and holy Love in the Saints arise in another Way. They don't first see that God loves them, and then see that he is lovely; but they first see that God is lovely, and that Christ is excellent and glorious, and their Hearts are first captivated with this View, and the Exercises of their Love are wont from Time to Time to begin here, and to arise primarily from these Views; and then, consequentially, they see God's Love; and great Favour to them <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <q>There is a Seeing of Christ after a Man believes, which is Christ in his Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I speak of that first Sight of him that preceeds the second Act of Faith; and 'tis an intuitive, or real Sight of him, as he is in his Glory.</q> 
                     <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the ten Virgins, Part I. p. 74.</note>. The Saint's Affections begin with God; and
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:005767_0148_1027066858CC2500"/>
Self-Love has a Hand in these Affections consequentially, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily only. On the contrary, those false Affections begin with Self, and an Acknowledgement of an Excellency in God, and an Affectedness with it, is only consequential and dependant. In the true Saint God is the lowest Foundation; the Love of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Nature is the Foundation of all the Affections which come afterwards, wherein Self-Love is concern'd as an Handmaid: On the contrary, the Hypocrite lays himself at the Bottom of all, as the first Foundation, and lays on God as the Superstructure; and even his Acknowledgement of God's Glory it self, depends on his Regard to his private Interest.</p>
               <p>Self-Love may not only influence Men, so as to cause them to be affected with God's Kindness to them separately; but also with God's Kindness to them, as Parts of a Community: As a natural Principle of Self-Love, without any other Principle, may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a Man concerned for the Interest of the Nation to which he belongs: As for Instance, in the present War, Self-Love may make natural Men rejoice at the Successes of our Nation, and sorry for their Disadvantages, they being concerned as Members of the Body. So the same natural Principles may extend further, and even to the World of Mankind, and might be affected with the Benefits the Inhabitants of the Earth have, beyond those of the Inhabitants of other Planets; if we knew that such there were, and knew how it was with them. So this Principle may cause Men to be affected with the Benefits that Mankind have received beyond the fallen Angels. And hence Men, from this Principle, may be much affected with the wonderful Goodness of God to Mankind, his great Goodness in giving his Son to die for fallen Man, and the marvellous Love of Christ in suffering such great Things for us, and with the great Glory they hear God has provided in Heaven for us; looking on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as Persons concerned and interested, as being some of this Species of Creatures, so highly favour'd: The same Principle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Gratitude may influence Men here, as in the Case of personal Benefits.</p>
               <p>But these Things that I have said do by no Means imply that all Gratitude to God is a meer natural Thing, and that there is no such Thing as a spiritual Gratitude, which is a holy and divine Affection: They imply no more, than that there is a Gratitude which is meerly natural, and that when Persons have Affections towards God only or primarily for Benefits received, their Affection is only the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005767_0149_1027066B6ECFA480"/>
of a natural Gratitude. There is doubtless such a Thing as a gracious Gratitude, which does greatly differ from all that Gratitude which natural Men experience. It differs in the following Respects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. True Gratitude or Thankfulness to God for his Kindness to us, arises from a Foundation laid before, of Love to God for what he is in himself; whereas a natural Gratitude has no such antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Foundation. The gracious Stirrings of grateful Affection to God, for Kindness received, always are from a Stock of Love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Heart, established in the first Place on other Grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> God's own Excellency; and hence the Affections are disposed to flow out, on Occasions of God's Kindness. The Saint having seen the Glory of God, and his Heart overcome by it, and captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a supream Love to him on that Account, his Heart hereby becomes tender, and easily affected with Kindnesses received. If a Man has no Love to another, yet Gratitude may be moved by some extraordinary Kindness; as in <hi>Soul</hi> towards <hi>David:</hi> But this is not the same Kind of Thing, as a Man's Gratitude to a dear Friend, that his Heart was before possess'd with a high Esteem of, and Love to; whose Heart by this Means became tender towards him, and more easily affected with Gratitude, and affected in another Manner. Self-Love is not excluded from a gracious Gratitude; the Saints love God for his Kindness to them, Psal. 116. 1. <hi>I love the Lord, because he hath heard the Voice of my Supplication.</hi> But something else is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and another Love prepares the Way, and lays the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for these grateful Affections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a gracious Gratitude, Men are affected with the Attribute of God's Goodness and free Grace, not only as they are concerned in it, or as it affects their Interest, but as a Part of the Glory and Beauty of God's Nature. That wonderful and unparallel'd Grace of God, which is manifested in the Work of Redemption, and shines forth in the Face of Jesus Christ, is infinitely glorious in it self, and appears so to the Angels; 'tis a great Part of the moral Perfection and Beauty of God's Nature: This would be glorious, whether it were exercised towards us or no; and the Saint who exercises a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Thankfulness for it, sees it to be so, and delights in it as such; tho' his Concern in it serves the more to engage his Mind, and raise the Attention and Affection; and Self-Love here assists as an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, being subservient to higher Principles, to lead forth the Mind to the View and Contemplation, and engage and fix the Attention, and heighten the Joy and Love: God's Kindness to them is a Glass that God sets before them, wherein to behold the Beauty of the Attribute of God's Goodness: The Exercises and Displays of this Attribute, by this Means, are brought near to them, and set right
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005767_0150_1027066D5E6F9870"/>
before them. So that in a holy Thankfulness to God, the Concern our Interest has in God's Goodness, is not the first Foundation of our being affected with it; that was laid in the Heart before, in that Stock of Love which was to God, for his Excellency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that makes the Heart tender, and susceptive of such Impressions from his Goodness to us: Nor is our own Interest, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Benefits we have received, the only, or the chief objective Ground of the present Exercises of the Affection; but God's Goodness, as Part of the Beauty of his Nature; altho' the Manifestations of that lovely Attribute, set immediately before our Eyes, in the Exercises of it for us, be the special Occasion of the Mind's Attention to that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at that Time, and serves to fix the Attention, and heighten the Affection.</p>
               <p>Some may perhaps be ready to object against the whole that has been said, that Text, 1 John 4. 19. <hi>We love him, because he first loved us,</hi> as tho' this implied that God's Love to the true Saints were the <hi>first Foundation</hi> of their Love to him.</p>
               <p>In answer to this I would observe, that the Apostle's Drift in these Words, is to magnify the Love of God to us from hence, that he loved us, while we had no Love to him; as will be manifest to any one who compares this Verse, and the two following, with the 9th, 10th and 11th Verses. And that God loved us, when we had no Love to him, the Apostle proves by this Argument, that God's Love to the Elect, is the Ground of their Love to him. And that it is three Ways. 1. The Saints Love to God, is the Fruit of God's Love to them; as it is the Gift of that Love. God gave them a Spirit of Love to him, because he loved them from Eternity. And in this Respect God's Love to his Elect is the first Foundation of their Love to him, as it is the Foundation of their Regeneration, and the Whole of their Redemption. 2. The Exercises and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that God has made of his wonderful Love to sinful Men, by Jesus Christ, in the Work of Redemption, is one of the chief Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations, which God has made of the Glory of his moral Perfection, to both Angels and Men; and so is one main objective Ground of the Love of Both to God; in a good Consistence with what was said before. 3. God's Love to a particular elect Person, discovered by his Conversion, is a great Manifestation of God's moral Perfection and Glory to him, and a proper Occasion of the Excitation of the Love of holy Gratitude, agreeable to what was before said. And that the Saints do in these Respects love God, because he first loved them, fully answers the Design of the Apostle's Argument in that Place. So that no good Argument can be drawn from hence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a spiritual and gracious Love in the Saints, arising primarily from the Excellency of divine Things, as they are in themselves, and not from any conceived Relation they bear to their Interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:005767_0151_10270672300E6228"/>
And as it is with the Love of the Saints, so it is with their Joy, and spiritual Delight and Pleasure: the first Foundation of it, is not any Consideration or Conception of their Interest in divine Things; but it primarily consists in the sweet Entertainment their Minds have in the View or Contemplation of the divine and holy Beauty of these Things, as they are in themselves. And this is indeed the very main Difference between the Joy of the Hypocrite, and the Joy of the true Saint. The former rejoices in himself; Self is the first Foundation of his Joy: The latter rejoices in God. The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite has his Mind pleased and delighted, in the first Place, with his own Privilege, and the Happiness which he supposes he has attained, or shall attain. True Saints have their Minds, in the first Place, inexpressibly pleased and delighted with the sweet Ideas of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and amiable Nature of the Things of God. And this is the Spring of all their Delights, and the Cream of all their Pleasures; 'tis the Joy of their Joy. This sweet and ravishing Entertainment, they have in the View of the beautiful and delightful Nature of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, is the Foundation of the Joy that they have afterwards, in the Consideration of their being theirs. But the Dependance of the Affections of Hypocrites is in a contrary Order: They first rejoice, and are elevated with it, that they are made so much of by God; and then on that Ground, he seems in a Sort, lovely to them.</p>
               <p>The first Foundation of the Delight a true Saint has in God, is his own Perfection; and the first Foundation of the Delight he has in Christ, is his own Beauty; he appears in himself the Chief among Ten Thousand, and altogether lovely: the Way of Salvation by Christ, is a delightful Way to him, for the sweet and admirable Manifestations of the divine Perfections in it; the holy Doctrines of the Gospel, by which God is exalted and Man abased, Holiness ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and promoted, and Sin greatly disgraced and discouraged, and free and sovereign Love manifested; are glorious Doctrines in his Eyes, and sweet to his Taste, prior to any Conception of his Interest in these Things. Indeed the Saints rejoice in their Interest in God, and that Christ is their's; and so they have great Reason; But this is not the first Spring of their Joy: They first rejoice in God as glorious and excellent in himself, and then secondarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in it, that so glorious a God is their's: They first have their Hearts fill'd with Sweetness, from the View of Christ's Excellency, and the Excellency of his Grace, and the Beauty of the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him; and then they have a secondary Joy, in that so excellent a Saviour, and such excellent Grace is their's. <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> on THE SPIRIT, p. 199. speaking of a common Work of the Spirit, says, <q>The Effects of this Work on the Mind, which is the first Subject affected with it, proceeds not so far, as to give it Delight, Complacency and Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the lovely spiritual Nature and Excellencies of the Things revealed unto it. The true Nature of saving Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination consists in this, that it gives the Mind such a direct intuitive Insight and Prospect into spiritual Things, as that in their own spiritual Nature they suit, please, and satisfy it; so that it is transformed into them, cast into the Mould of them, and rests in them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 6. This, the Work we have insisted on, reacheth not unto. For notwithstanding any Discovery that is made therein of spiritual Things unto the Mind, it finds not an immediate, direct, spiritual Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them; but only with Respect unto some Benefit or Advantage, which is to be attained by Means thereof. It will not give such a spiritual Insight into the Mystery of God's Grace by Jesus Christ, called his Glory shining in the Face of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. as that the Soul, in its first direct View of it, should, for what it is in itself, admire it, delight in it, approve it, and find spiritual Solace, with Refreshment, in it. But such a Light, such a Knowledge, it communicates, as that a Man may like it well in its Effects, as a Way of Mercy and Salvation.</q>
                  </note> But that which is
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:005767_0152_102706751338E600"/>
the true Saint's Superstructure, is the Hypocrite's Foundation. When they hear of the wonderful Things of the Gospel, of God's great Love in sending his Son, of Christ's dying Love to Sinners, and the great Things Christ has purchased, and promised to the Saints, and hear these Things livelily and eloquently set forth; they may hear with a great deal of Pleasure, and be listed up with what they hear: but if their Joy be examined, it will be found to have no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than this, that they look upon these Things as their's, all this exalts them, they love to hear of the great Love of Christ so vastly distinguishing some from others; for Self-love, and even Pride itself, makes 'em affect great Distinction from others: No Wonder, in this confident Opinion of their own good Estate, that they feel well under such Doctrine, and are pleased in the highest Degree, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much God and Christ makes of 'em. So that their Joy is really a Joy in themselves, and not in God.</p>
               <p>And because the Joy of Hypocrites is in themselves, hence it comes to pass, that in their Rejoicings and Elevations, they are wont to keep their Eye upon themselves; having received what they call spiritual Discoveries or Experiences, their Minds are taken up about them, admiring their own Experiences: And what they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:005767_0153_10270677F5D6F968"/>
taken and elevated with, is not the Glory of God, or Beauty of Christ, but the Beauty of their Experiences. They keep thinking with themselves, What a good Experience is this! What a great Discovery is this! What wonderful Things have I met with! And so they put their Experiences in the Place of Christ, and his Beauty and Fullness; and instead of rejoicing in Christ Jesus, they rejoice in their admirable Experiences: instead of feeding and feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Souls in the View of what is without them, <hi>viz.</hi> the innate, sweet, refreshing Amiableness of the Things exhibited in the Gospel, their Eyes are off from these Things, or at least they view them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as it were Side-ways; but the Object that fixes their Contemplation, is their Experience; and they are feeding their Souls, and feasting a selfish Principle with a View of their Discoveries: They take more Comfort in their Discoveries than in Christ discovered, which is the true Notion of living upon Experiences and Frames; and not a using Experiences as the Signs, on which they rely for Evidence of their good Estate, which some call living on Experiences: Tho' it be very observable, that some of them who do so, are most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for living upon Experiences, according to the true Notion of it.</p>
               <p>The Affections of Hypocrites are very often after this Manner, they are first, much affected with some Impression on their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or some Impulse, which they take to be an immediate Sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Testimony from God, of his Love and their Happiness, and high Priviledge in some Respect, either with or without a Text of Scripture; they are mightily taken with this, as a great Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and hence arise high Affections. And when their Affections are raised, then they view those high Affections, and call them great and wonderful Experiences; and they have a Notion that God is greatly pleased with those Affections; and this affects them more; and so they are affected with their Affections. And thus their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections rise higher and higher, 'till they sometimes are perfectly swallowed up: And Self conceit, and a fierce Zeal rises withal; and all is built like a Castle in the Air, on no other Foundation but Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, Self-love and Pride.</p>
               <p>And as the Thoughts of this Sort of Persons are, so is their Talk; for out of the Abundance of their Heart, their Mouth speaketh. As in their high Affections, they keep their E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e upon the Beauty of their Experiences, and Greatness of their Attainments; so they are great Talkers about themselves. The true Saint, when under great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Affections, from the Fullness of his Heart, is ready to be speaking much of God, and his glorious Perfections and Works, and of the Beauty and Amiableness of Christ, and the glorious Things of the Gospel; but Hypocrites, in their high Affections, talk more of the Discovery, than they do of the Thing discovered; they are full
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:005767_0154_1027067A27A63138"/>
of Talk about the great Things they have met with, the wonderful Discoveries they have had, how sure they are of the Love of God to them, how safe their Condition is, and how they know they shall go to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A true Saint, when in the Enjoyment of true Discoveries of the sweet Glory of God and Christ, has his Mind too much captivated and engaged by what he views without himself, to stand at that Time to view himself, and his own Attainments: it would be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Loss which he could not bear, to take his Eye off from the ravishing Object of his Contemplation, to survey his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to spend Time in thinking with himself, what an high Attainment this is, and what a good Story they now have to tell others. Nor does the Pleasure and Sweetness of his Mind at that Time, chiefly arise from the Consideration of the Safety of his State, or any Thing he has in View of his own Qualifications, Experiences, or Circumstances; but from the divine and supream Beauty of what is the Object of his direct View, without himself; which sweetly entertains, and strongly holds his Mind.</p>
               <p>As the Love and Joy of Hypocrites, are all from the Source of Self-Love; so it is with their other Affections, their Sorrow for Sin, their Humiliation and Submission, their religious Desires and Zeal: Every Thing is as it were paid for before-hand, in God's highly gratifying their Self-love, and their Lusts, by making so much of them, and exalting them so highly, as Things are in their Imagination. 'Tis easy for Nature, as corrupt as it is, under a Notion of being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy some of the highest Favourites of Heaven, and having a God who does so protect 'em and favour 'em in their Sins, to love this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary God that suits 'em so well, and to extol him, and submit to him, and to be fierce and zealous for him. The high Affections of many are all built on the Supposition of their being eminent Saints. If that Opinion which they have of themselves were taken away, if they thought they were some of the lower Form of Saints, (tho' they should yet suppose themselves to be real Saints) their high Affections would fall to the Ground. If they only saw a little of the Sinfulness and Vileness of their own Hearts, &amp; their Deformity, in the midst of their best Duties and their best Affections, it would knock their Affections on the Head; because their Affections are built upon Self, therefore Self-knowledge would destroy them. But as to truly gracious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they are built elsewhere: they have their Foundation out of Self, in God and Jesus Christ; and therefore a Discovery of themselves, of their own Deformity, and the Meanness of their Experiences, tho' it will purify their Affections, yet it will not destroy them, but in some Respects sweeten and heighten them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:005767_0155_1027067C02913DE8"/>
III. Those Affections that are truly Holy, are primarily founded on the Loveliness of the moral Excellency of divine Things. Or, (to express it otherwise) a Love to divine Things for the Beauty and Sweetness of their moral Excellency, is the first Beginning and Spring of all holy Affections.</p>
               <p>Here, for the sake of the more illiterate Reader, I will explain what I mean by the moral Excellency of divine Things.</p>
               <p>And it may be observed that the Word Moral is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood here, according to the common and vulgar Acceptation of the Word, when Men speak of <hi>Morality,</hi> and a <hi>moral</hi> Behaviour mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an outward Conformity to the Duties of the moral Law, and especially the Duties of the second Table; or intending no more at farthest, than such seeming Vertues, as proceed from natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in Opposition to those Vertues that are more inward, spiritual, and divine; as the Honesty, Justice, Generosity, Good Nature, and publick Spirit of many of the Heathen, are called <hi>moral</hi> Vertues, in Distinction from the holy Faith, Love, Humility, and Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness of true Christians: I say the Word Moral is not to be understood thus in this Place.</p>
               <p>But in order to a right understanding what is meant, it must be observed, that Divines commonly make a Distinction between <hi>moral</hi> Good and Evil, and <hi>natural</hi> Good and Evil. By <hi>moral</hi> Evil, they mean the Evil of Sin, or that Evil which is against Duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is right and ought to be. By <hi>natural</hi> Evil, they don't mean that Evil which is properly opposed to Duty; but that which is contrary to meer Nature, without any Respect to a Rule of Duty. So the Evil of suffering is called natural Evil, such as Pain, and Torment, Disgrace, and the like: These Things are contrary to meer Nature, contrary to the Nature of both Bad and Good, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to wicked Men and Devils, as well as good Men and Angels. So likewise natural Defects are called natural Evils, as if a Child be monstrous, or a natural Fool; these are natural Evils, but are not moral Evils, because they han't properly the Nature of the Evil of Sin. On the other Hand, as by moral Evil, Divines mean the Evil of Sin, or that which is contrary to what is right; so by <hi>moral</hi> Good, they mean that which is contrary to Sin, or that Good in Beings who have Will and Choice, whereby, as voluntary Agents, they are, and act, as it becomes 'em to be and to act, or so as is most fit, and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and lovely. By <hi>natural</hi> Good they mean that Good that is entirely of a different Kind from Holiness or Vertue, <hi>viz.</hi> That which perfects or suits Nature, considering Nature abstractly from any holy or unholy Qualifications, and without any Relation to any Rule or Measure of Right and Wrong.</p>
               <p>Thus Pleasure is a natural Good; so is Honour; so is Strength; so is speculative Knowledge, human Learning, and Policy. Thus
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:005767_0156_1027068051CB82F0"/>
there is a Distinction to be made between the natural Good that Men are possessed of, and their moral Good; and also between the natural and moral Good of the Angels in Heaven: the great Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Understandings, and their great Strength, and the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumstances they are in as the great Ministers of God's Kingdom, whence they are called Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers, is the natural Good which they are possessed of; but their perfect and glorious Holiness and Goodness, their pure and flaming Love to God, and to the Saints, and one another, is their moral Good. So Divines make a Distinction between the natural and moral Perfections of God: <hi>By</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> Perfections of God, they mean those Attributes which God exercises as a moral Agent, or whereby the Heart and Will of God are good, right, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely becoming, and lovely; such as his Righteousness, Truth, Faithfulness, and Goodness; or, in one Word, his Holiness. By God's <hi>natural</hi> Attributes or Perfections, they mean those Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, wherein, according to our Way of conceiving of God, consists, not the Holiness or moral Goodness of God, but his Greatness; such as his Power, his Knowledge whereby he knows all Things, and his being eternal, from everlasting to everlasting, his Omnipresence, and his awful and terrible Majesty.</p>
               <p>The moral Excellency of an intelligent voluntary Being, is more immediately seated in the Heart or Will of moral Agents. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Being whose Will is truly right and lovely, he is morally good or excellent.</p>
               <p>This moral Excellency of an intelligent Being, when it is true and real, and not only external, or meerly Seeming and Counterfeit, is <hi>Holiness.</hi> Therefore <hi>Holiness</hi> comprehends all the true moral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of intelligent Beings: There is no other <hi>true Vertue,</hi> but <hi>real Holiness.</hi> Holiness comprehends all the true Vertue of a good Man, his Love to God, his gracious Love to Men, his Justice, his Charity, and Bowels of Mercies, his gracious Meekness and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all other true christian Vertues that he has, belong to his Holiness. So the Holiness of God in the more extensive Sense of the Word, and the Sense in which the Word is commonly, if not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally used in Scripture, is the same with the moral Excellency of the divine Nature, or his Purity and Beauty as a moral Agent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all his moral Perfections, his Righteousness, Faithfulness and Goodness. As in holy Men their Charity, christian Kindness and Mercy, belongs to their Holiness; so the Kindness and Mercy of God, belongs to his Holiness. Holiness in Man, is but the image of God's Holiness: There are not more Vertues belonging to the Image, than are in the Original: Derived Holiness has not more in it, than is in that underived Holiness, which is its Fountain: There

is no more than Grace for Grace, or Grace in the Image, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Grace in the Original.</p>
               <p>As there are two Kinds of Attributes in God, according to our Way of conceiving of him, his moral Attributes, which are sum'd up in his <hi>Holiness,</hi> and his natural Attributes, of Strength, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that constitute the <hi>Greatness</hi> of God; so there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Image of God in Man, his <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> Image, which is his Holiness, that is the Image of God's moral Excellency; (which Image was lost by the Fall) and God's <hi>natural</hi> Image, consisting in Men's Reason and Understanding, his natural Ability, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>minion over the Creatures, which is the Image of God's natural Attributes.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, it may easily be understood what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, when I say that a Love to divine Things for the Beauty of their <hi>moral Excellency,</hi> is the Beginning and Spring of all holy Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It has been already shown, under the former Head, that the first objective Ground of all holy Affections is the supream Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of divine Things as they are in themselves, or in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I now proceed further, and say more particularly, that that Kind of Excellency of the Nature of divine Things, which is the first objective Ground of all holy Affections, is their moral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or their Holiness. <hi>Holy Persons,</hi> in the Exercise of <hi>holy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> do love divine Things primarily for their <hi>Holiness:</hi> They love God, in the first Place, for the Beauty of his Holiness or moral Perfection, as being supreamly amiable in it self. Not that the Saints, in the Exercise of gracious Affections, do love God only for his Holiness; all his Attributes are amiable and glorious in their Eyes, they delight in every divine Perfection; the Contemplation of the infinite Greatness, Power, and Knowledge, and terrible Majesty of God, is pleasant to them. But their Love to God for his Holiness is what is most fundamental and essential in their Love. Here it is that true Love to God begins: All other holy Love to divine Things flows from hence: This is the most essential and distinguishing Things that belongs to a holy Love to God, with Regard to the Foundation of it. A Love to God for the Beauty of his moral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, leads to, and necessarily causes a Delight in God for all his Attributes; for his moral Attributes can't be without his natural Attributes: For infinite Holiness supposes infinite Wisdom, and an infinite Capacity and Greatness; and all the Attributes of God do as it were imply one another.</p>
               <p>The true Beauty and Loveliness of all intelligent Beings does pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and most essentially consist in their moral Excellency or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Herein consists the Loveliness of the Angels, without which, with all their natural Perfections, their Strength, and their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they would have no more Loveliness than Devils. 'Tis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Excellency alone, that is in it self, and on it's own Account, the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005767_0158_102706874E12EBA8"/>
Excellency of intelligent Beings: 'Tis this that gives Beauty to, or rather is the Beauty of their natural Perfections and Qualifications. Moral Excellency is the Excellency of natural Excellencies. Natural Qualifications are either excellent or otherwise, according as they are join'd with moral Excellency or not. Strength and Knowledge don't render any Being lovely, without Holiness; but more hateful: Tho' they render them more lovely, when join'd with Holiness. Thus the elect Angels are the more glorious for their Strength and Knowledge, because these natural Perfections of their's, are sanctified by their moral Perfection. But tho' the Devils are very strong, and of great natural Understanding, they ben't the more lovely: They are more terrible indeed, but not the more amiable; but on the contrary, the more hateful. The Holiness of an intelligent Creature, is the Beauty of all his natural Perfections. And so it is in God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Way of conceiving of the divine Being: Holiness is in a pecular Manner the Beauty of the divine Nature. Hence we often read of the Beauty of Holiness; <hi>Psal.</hi> 29. 2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 96. 9. and 110. 3. This renders all his other Attributes glorious and lovely. 'Tis the Glory of God's Wisdom, that 'tis a holy Wisdom, and not a wicked Subtilty and Craftiness. This makes his Majesty lovely, and not meerly dreadful and horrible, that it is a holy Majesty. 'Tis the Glory of God's Immutability, that it is a holy Immutability, and not an inflexible Obstinacy in Wickedness.</p>
               <p>And therefore it must needs be, that a Sight of God's Loveliness must begin here. A true Love to God must begin with a Delight in his Holiness, and not with a Delight in any other Attribute; for no other Attribute is truly lovely without this, and no otherwise than as (according to our Way of conceiving of God) it derives its Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness from this; and therefore it is impossible that other Attributes should appear lovely, in their true Loveliness, 'till this is seen; and it is impossible that any Perfection of the divine Nature should be loved with true Love, 'till this is loved. If the true Loveliness of all God's Perfections, arises from the Loveliness of his Holiness; then the true Love of all his Perfections, arises from the Love of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. They that don't see the Glory of God's Holiness, can't see any Thing of the true Glory of his Mercy and Grace: They see nothing of the Glory of those Attributes, as any Excellency of God's Nature, as it is in it self; tho' they may be affected with them, and love them, as they concern their Interest: For these Attributes are no Part of the Excellency of God's Nature, as that is excellent in it self, any otherwise than as they are included in his Holiness, more largely taken; or as they are a Part of his moral Perfection.</p>
               <p>As the Beauty of the divine Nature does primarily consist in God's Holiness, so does the Beauty of all divine Things. Herein consists the Beauty of the Saints, that they are Saints, or holy Ones: 'Tis
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:005767_0159_102706895C20F550"/>
the moral Image of God in them, which is their Beauty; and which is their Holiness. Herein consists the Beauty and Brightness of the Angels of Heaven, that they are holy Angels, and so not Devils; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 13, 17, 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. Herein consists the Beauty of the christian Religion, above all other Religions, that it is so holy a Religion. Herein consists the Excellency of the Word of God, that it is so holy; Psal. 119. 140. <hi>Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> Verse 128. <hi>I esteem all thy Precepts, concerning all Things, to be right; and I hate every false Way.</hi> Verse 138. <hi>Thy Testimonies, that thou Last command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are righteous, and very faithful.</hi> And 172. <hi>My Tongue shall speak of thy Word; for all thy Commandments are Righteousness.</hi> And Psal. 19. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul: The Testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the Simple: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the Heart: The Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the Eyes: The Fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: The Judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: More to be desired are they than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold; sweeter also than Honey, and the Honey-comb.</hi> Herein does primarily consist the Amiableness and Beauty of the Lord Jesus, whereby he is the chief among ten Thousands and altogether lovely; even in that he is <hi>the holy One of God,</hi> Acts 3. 14. and <hi> God's holy Child,</hi> Acts 4. 27. and <hi>he that is Holy, and he that is True,</hi> Rev. 3. 7. All the spiritual Beauty of his human Nature, consisting in his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Lowliness, Patience, Heavenliness, Love to God, Love to Men, Condescention to the Mean and Vile, and Compassion to the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp;c. all is sum'd up in his Holiness. And the Beauty of his divine Nature, of which the Beauty of his humane Nature is the Image and Reflection, does also primarily consist in his Holiness. Herein primarily consists the Glory of the Gospel, that it is a holy Gospel, and so bright an Emanation of the holy Beauty of God and Jesus Christ: Herein consists the spiritual Beauty of it's Doctrines, that they are holy Doctrines, or Doctrines according to Godliness. And herein does consist the spiritual Beauty of the Way of Salvation by Jesus Christ, that it so holy a Way. And herein chiefly consists the Glory of Heaven, that it is the <hi>holy City,</hi> the <hi>holy Jerusalem, the Habitation of God's Holiness,</hi> and so <hi>of his Glory;</hi> Isai. 63. 15. All the Beauties of the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as it is described in the two last Chapters of Revelation, are but various Representations of this: See Chap. 21. 2, 10, 11, 18, 21, 27. Chap. 22. 1, 3.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is primarily on Account of this Kind of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that the Saints do love all these Things. Thus they love the Word of God, <hi>because it is very pure.</hi> 'Tis on this Account they love the Saints; and on this Account chiefly it is, that Heaven is lovely to them, and those holy Tabernacles of God amiable in their
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:005767_0160_1027068CE856CC28"/>
Eyes: 'Tis on this Account that they love God; and on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count primarily it is, that they love Christ, and that their Hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Doctrines of the Gospel, and sweetly acquiesce in the Way of Salvation therein revealed <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>To the right closing with Christ's Person, this is also requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to taste the Bitterness of Sin, as the greatest Evil: Else a Man will never close with Christ, for his Holiness in him, and from him, as the greatest Good. For we told you, that that is the right Closing with Christ for himself, when it is for his Holiness. For ask a whorish Heart, what Beauty he sees in the Person of Christ; he will, after he has looked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Kingdom, his Righteousness, all his Works, see a Beauty in them, because they do serve his Turn, to comfort him only. Ask a Virgin, he will see his Happiness in all; but that which makes the Lord amiable, is his Holiness, which is in him to make him holy too. As in Marriage, it is the personal Beauty draws the Heart. And hence I have thought it Reason, that he that loves the Brethren for a little Grace, will love Christ much more</q>. <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Parable, P. I. p. 84.</note>.</p>
               <p>Under the Head of the first distinguishing Characteristick of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Affection, I observed that there is given to those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, a new supernatural Sense, that is as it were a certain divine spiritual Taste, which is in its whole Nature diverse from any former Kinds of Sensation of the Mind, as Tasting is diverse from any of the other five Senses, and that something is perceived by a true Saint in the Exercise of this new Sense of Mind, in spiritual and divine Things, as entirely different from any Thing that is perceived in them by natural Men, as the sweet Taste or Honey is diverse from the Ideas Men get of Honey by looking on it or feeling of it; now this that I have been speaking, <hi>viz.</hi> The Beauty of Holiness is that Thing in spiritual and divine Things, which is perceived by this spiritual Sense, that is so diverse from all that natural Men perceive in them: This Kind of Beauty is the Quality that is the immediate Object of this spiritual Sense: This is the Sweetness that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object of this spiritual Taste. The Scripture often represents the Beauty and Sweetness of Holiness as the grand Object of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Taste, and spiritual Appetite. This was the sweet Food of the holy Soul of Jesus Christ, John 4. 32, 34. <hi>I have Meat to eat, that ye know not of;—My Meat is to do the Will of him that sent me, and to finish his Work.</hi> I know of no Part of the holy Scriptures, where the Nature and Evidences of true and sincere Godliness, are so much of set Purpose, and so fully and largely insisted on and deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,

as the 119th Psalm; the Psalmist declares his Design in the first Verses of the Psalm, and he keeps his Eye on this Design all along, and pursues it to the End: But in this Psalm the Excellency of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is represented as the immediate Object of a spiritual Taste, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, Appetite and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ance and Rejoicing of the gracious Nature, which prizes God's Commandments <hi>above Gold, yea, the finest Gold,</hi> and to which they are <hi>sweeter than the Honey, and Honey-comb;</hi> and that upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Holiness, as I observed before. The same Psalmist de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that this is the Sweetness that a spiritual Taste relishes in God's Law, Psal. 19. 8, 9, 10. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect:—The Commandment of the Lord is pure: The Fear of the Lord is clean: The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the Heart:—The Judgments of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ra are true, and righteous altogether: More to be desired are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold; sweeter also than Honey and the Honey comb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A holy Love has a holy Object: The Holiness of Love consists especially in this that it is the Love of that which is holy, as holy, or for it's Holiness; so that 'tis the Holiness of the Object, which is the Quality whereon it fixes and terminates. An holy Nature must needs love that in holy Things chiefly, which is most agreable to itself; but surely that in divine Things, which above all others is agreeable to holy Nature, is Holiness; because Holiness must be above all other Things agreable to Holiness; for nothing can be more agreable to any Nature than itself; holy Nature must be above all Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to holy Nature: And so the holy Nature of God and Christ, and the Word of God, and other divine Things, must be above all other Things, agreable to the holy Nature that is in the Saints.</p>
               <p>And again, an holy Nature doubtless loves holy Things, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the Account of that, for which sinful Nature has Enmity against them: But that for which chiefly sinful Nature is at Enmity against holy Things, is their Holiness; it is for this, that the carnal Mind is Enmity against God, and against the Law of God, and the People of God. Now 'tis just arguing from Contraries; from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Causes, to contrary Effects; from opposite Natures, to oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Tendencies. We know that Holiness is of a directly contrary Nature to Wickedness: As therefore 'tis the Nature of Wickedness chiefly to oppose and hate Holiness; so it must be the Nature of Holiness chiefly to tend to, and delight in Holiness.</p>
               <p>The holy Nature in the Saints and Angels in Heaven (where the true Tendency of it best appears) is principally engaged by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of divine Things. This is the divine Beauty which chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005767_0162_10270692B064C758"/>
the Attention, Admiration and Praise of the bright and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Seraphim;</hi> Isai. 6. 3. <hi>One cried unto another, and said, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> And Rev. 4. 8. <hi>They rest not Day and Night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi> So the glorified Saints, Chap. 15. 4. <hi>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name, for thou only art Holy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Scriptures represent the Saints on Earth as adoring God primarily on this Account, and admiring and extolling all God's Attributes, either as deriving Loveliness from his Holiness, or as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Part of it. Thus when they praise God for his Power, his Holiness is the Beauty that engages them; Psal. 98. 1. <hi>O sing unto the Lord a new Song, for he hath done marvellous Things; his right Hand and his</hi> HOLY <hi>Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</hi> So when they praise him for his Justice and terrible Majesty; Psal. 99. 2, 3. <hi>The Lord is great in</hi> Zion, <hi>and he is high above all People: Let them praise thy great and terrible Name, for it is</hi> HOLY. Verse 5. <hi>Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his Footstool, for he is</hi> HOLY. Verse 8, 9. <hi>Thou wast a God that forgavest them, tho' thou tookest Vengeance of their Inventions. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy Hill; for the Lord our God is</hi> HOLY. So when they praise God for his Mercy and Faithfulness; Psal. 97. 11. 12. <hi>Light is soum for the Righteous, and Gladness for the Upright in Heart. Rejoice in the Lord ye Righteous, and give Thanks at the Remembrance of his</hi> HOLINESS. 1 Sam. 2. 2. <hi>There is none</hi> HOLY <hi>as the Lord; for there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side thee; neither is there any Rock like our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this therefore all may try their Affections, and particularly their Love and Joy. Various Kinds of Creatures shew the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Natures, very much, in the different Things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as their proper Good, one delighting in that which another ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors. Such a Difference is there between true Saints, and natural Men: Natural Men have no Sense of the Goodness and Excellency of holy Things; at least for their Holiness; they have no Taste of that Kind of Good; and so may be said not to know that divine Good, or not to see it; it is wholly hid from them: But the Saints, by the mighty Power of God, have it discovered to them: They have that supernatural, most noble and divine Sense given them, by which they perceive it: And it is this that captivates their Hearts, and delights them above all Things; 'tis the most amiable and sweet Thing to the Heart of a true Saint, that is to be found in Heaven or Earth; that which above all others attracts and engages his Soul; and that wherein, above all Things, he places his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and which he lots upon for Solace and Entertainment to his Mind, in this World, and full Satisfaction and Blessedness in another. By this you may examine your Love to God, and to Jesus Christ,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:005767_0163_102706960CB00430"/>
and to the Word of God, and your Joy in them, and also your Love to the People of God, and your Desires after Heaven; whether they be from a supream Delight in this Sort of Beauty, without being primarily moved from your imagined Interest in them, or Expectations from 'em. There are many high Affections, great seeming Love and rapturous Joys, which have nothing of this holy Relish belonging to 'em.</p>
               <p>Particularly, By what has been said you may try your Discoveries of the Glory of God's Grace and Love, and your Affections arising from them. The Grace of God may appear lovely two Ways; either as <hi>Bonum Utile,</hi> a profitable Good to me, that which greatly serves my Interest, and so suits my Self-Love; or as <hi>Bonum formosum,</hi> a Beautiful Good in itself, and Part of the moral and spiritual Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the divine Nature. In this latter Respect it is that the true Saints have their Hearts affected, and Love captivated by the free Grace of God in the first Place.</p>
               <p>From the Things that have been said, it appears, that if Persons have a great Sense of the <hi>natural</hi> Perfections of God, and are greatly affected with them, or have any other Sight or Sense of God, than that which consists in, or implies a Sense of the Beauty of his <hi>moral</hi> Perfections, it is no certain Sign of Grace: As particularly, Men's having a great Sense of the <hi>awful Greatness, and terrible Majesty of God;</hi> for this is only God's natural Perfection, and what Men may see, and yet be entirely blind to the Beauty of his moral Perfection, and have nothing of that spiritual Taste which relishes this divine Sweetness.</p>
               <p>It has been shown already, in what was said upon the first distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Mark of gracious Affections, that that which is spiritual, is entirely different in its Nature, from all that it is possible any grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Person should be the Subject of, while he continues graceless. But 'tis possible that those who are wholly without Grace, should have a clear Sight, and very great and affecting Sense of God's Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, his mighty Power, and awful Majesty; for this is what the Devils have, tho' they have lost the spiritual Knowledge of God, consisting in a Sense of the Amiableness of his moral Perfections; they are perfectly destitute of any Sense or Relish of that Kind of Beauty, yet they have a very great Knowledge of the natural Glory of God (if I may so speak) or his awful Greatness and Majesty; this they behold, and are affected with the Apprehensions of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tremble before him. This Glory of God all shall behold at the Day of Judgment; God will make all rational Beings to behold it to a great Degree indeed, Angels and Devils, Saints and Sinners: He will manifest his infinite Greatness, and awful Majesty to every One, in a most open, clear and convincing Manner, and in a Light that none can resist, when <hi>he shall come in the Glory of his Father, and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:005767_0164_10270698DE368328"/>
every Eye shall see him;</hi> when they shall cry to the Mountains to fall upon them, to hide them from the Face of him that sits upon the Throne, they are represented as seeing the Glory of God's Majesty, <hi>Isai.</hi> 2. 10, 19, 21. God will make all his Enemies to behold this, and to live in a most clear and affecting View of it, in Hell, to all Eternity. God hath often declared his immutable Purpose to make all his Enemies to know him in this Respect, in so often annexing these Words to the Threatnings he denounces against them, <hi>and they shall know that I am the Lord;</hi> yea, he hath sworn that all Men shall see his Glory in this Respect; Numb. 14. 21. <hi>As truly as I live, all the Earth shall be filled with the Glory of the Lord.</hi> And this Kind of Manifestation of God is very often spoken of in Scripture, as made, or to be made, in the Sight of God's Enemies in this World; <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 16. and Chap. 14. 18. and 15. 16. <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 3. and 46. 10. and other Places innumerable. This was a Manifestation which God made of himself in the Sight of that wicked Congregation at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and deeply affecting them with it; so that all the People in the Camp trembled. Wicked Men and Devils will see, and have a great Sense of every Thing that appertains to the Glory of God, but only the Beauty of his moral Perfection. They will see his infinite Greatness and Majesty, his infinite Power, and will be fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his Omniscience, and his Eternity and Immutability; and they will see and know every Thing appertaining to his moral Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes themselves, but only the Beauty and Amiableness of them: They will see and know that he is perfectly just and righteous and true; and that he is a holy God, of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, who cannot look on Iniquity, and they will see the wonderful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations of his infinite Goodness and free Grace to the Saints; and there is nothing will be hid from their Eyes, but only the <hi>Beauty</hi> of these moral Attributes, and that Beauty of the other Attributes, which arises from it. And so natural Men in this World are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having a very affecting Sense of every Thing else that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to God, but this only. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had a great and very affecting Sense of the infinite Greatness and awful Majesty of God, of his supreme and absolute Dominion, and mighty and irresistable Power, and of his Sovereignty, and that he, and all the Inhabitants of the Earth were nothing before him; and also had a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in his Conscience of his Justice, and an affecting Sense of his great Goodness; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 34, 35, 37. And the Sense that <hi>Darius</hi> had of God's Perfections, seems to be very much like his; <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 25. &amp;c. But the Saints and Angels do behold the Glory of God consisting in the <hi>Beauty of his Holiness:</hi> And 'tis this Sight only, that will melt and humble the Hearts of Men, and wean them from the World, and draw them to God, and effectually change them. A Sight of the awful Greatness of God, may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005767_0165_1027069CD40AC0A8"/>
Men's Strength, and be more than they can endure; but if the moral Beauty of God be hid, the Enmity of the Heart will remain in its full Strength, no Love will be enkindled, all will not be effectual to gain the Will, but that will remain inflexible; whereas the first Glimpse of the moral and spiritual Glory of God shining into the Heart, produces all these Effects, as it were with omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Power, which nothing can withstand.</p>
               <p>The Sense that natural Men may have of the awful Greatness of God may affect them various Ways; it may not only terrify them, but it may elevate then and raise their Joy and Praise, as their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances may be. This will be the natural Effect of it, under the real or supposed Receipt of some extraordinary Mercy from God, by the Influence of meer Principles of Nature. It has been shown already, that the Receipt of Kindness may, by the Influence of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles, affect the Heart with Gratitude and Praise to God; but if a Person, at the same Time that he receives remarkable Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from God, has a Sense of his infinite Greatness, and that he is but Nothing in Comparison of him, surely this will naturally raise his Gratitude and Praise the higher, for Kindness to one so much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. A Sense of God's Greatness had this Effect upon <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> under the Receipt of that extraordinary Favour of his Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after he had been driven from Men, and had his dwelling with the Beasts: A Sense of God's exceeding Greatness raises his Gratitude very high; so that he does, in the most lefty Terms, extol and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify God, and calls upon all the World to do it with him: And much more, if a natural Man, at the same Time that he is greatly affected with God's infinite Greatness and Majesty, entertains a strong Conceit that this great God has made him his Child and special Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and promised him eternal Glory in his highest Love; will this have a Tendency, according to the Course of Nature, to raise his Joy and Praise to a great Height.</p>
               <p>Therefore, 'tis beyond Doubt, that too much Weight has been laid, by many Persons of late, on Discoveries of God's Greatness, awful Majesty, and natural Perfection, operating after this Manner, without any real View of the holy, lovely Majesty of God. And Experience does abundantly witness to what Reason and Scripture declare as to this Matter; there having been very many Persons, who have seem'd to be overpower'd with the Greatness and awful Majesty of God, and consequentially elevated in the Manner that has been spoken of, who have been very far from having Appearances of a christian Spirit and Temper, in any Manner of Proportion, or Fruits in Practice in any wise agreeable; but their Discoveries have worked in a way contrary to the Operation of truly spiritual Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>

Not that a Sense of God's Greatness and natural Attributes is not exceeding useful and necessary. For, as I observed before, this is implied in a Manifestation of the Beauty of God's Holiness. Tho' that be something beyond it, it supposes it, as the greater supposes the less. And tho' natural Men may have a Sense of the natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God; yet undoubtedly this is more frequent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Saints, than with natural Men; and Grace tends to enable Men to see these Things in a better Manner, than natural Men do. And not only enables them to see God's natural Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, but that Beauty of those Attributes, which (according to our Way of conceiving of God) is derived from his Holiness.</p>
               <p>IV. Gracious Affections do arise from the Mind's being enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rightly and spiritually to understand or apprehend divine Things.</p>
               <p>Holy Affections are not Heat without Light; but evermore arise from some Information of the Understanding, some spiritual Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Mind receives, some Light or actual Knowledge. The Child of God is graciously affected, because he sees and understands something more of divine Things than he did before, more of God or Christ and of the glorious Things exhibited in the Gospel; he has some clearer and better View than he had before, when he has not affected; Either he receives some Understanding of divine Things that is new to him; or has his former Knowledge renewed after the View was decayed; 1 John 4. 7. <hi>Every one that loveth, knoweth God.</hi> Phil. 1. 9. <hi>I pray that your Love may abound more and more, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and in all Judgment.</hi> Rom. 10. 2. <hi>They have a Zeal of God, but not according to Knowledge.</hi> Col. 3. 10. <hi>The new Man, which is renewed in Knowledge.</hi> Psal. 43. 3, 4. <hi>O send out thy Light and thy Truth; let them lead me, let them lying me into thy holy Hill.</hi> John. 6. 45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God: Every Man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Knowledge is the Key that first opens the hard Heart and enlarges the Affections, and so opens the Way for Men into the Kingdom of Heaven; Luke 11. 52. <hi>Ye have taken away the Key of Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are many Affections which don't arise from any Light in the Understanding. And when it is thus, it is a sure Evidence that these Affections are not spiritual, let them be ever so high <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Many that have had mighty strong Affections at first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, afterwards become dry, and wither, and consume, and pine, and die away: And now their Hypocrisy is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; if not to all the World, by open Prophaneness; yet to the discerning Eye of living Christians, by the formal, barren, unfavoury, unfruitful Heart and Course; because they never had Light to Conviction enough as yet.—'Tis strange to see some People carried with mighty Affection against Sin and Hell, and after Christ. And what is the Hell you Fear? A dreadful Place. What is Christ? They scarce know so much as Devils do; but that is all. Oh truth them not! Many <hi>Love,</hi> and these <hi>will</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>all away to some Lust, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or Pride, or World; and the Reason is, they never had Light enough, John 5. 35. John <hi>was a burning and shining Light, and they did joy in him for a Season;</hi> yet glorious as it was, they saw not Christ by it, especially not with divine Light. Its rare to see Christians full both of Light and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore consider of this; many a Man has been well brought up, and is of a sweet loving Nature, mild and gentle, and harmless, likes and loves the best Things, and his Meaning, and Mind, and Heart is good, and has more in Heart than is Shew; and so hopes all shall go well with him. I say there may lie greatest Hypocrisy under greatest Affections; especially if they want Light. You shall be hardened in your Hypocrisy by them. I never liked violent Affections and Pangs, but only such as were drop'd in by Light; because those come from an external Principle, and last not, but these do. Men are not affrighted by the Light of the Sun, tho' clearer than the Lightning,</q>

Indeed they have some new Apprehensions which they had not before. Such is the Nature of Man, that it is impossible his Mind should be affected, unless it be by something that he apprehends, or that his Mind conceives of. But in many Persons these Apprehensions or Conceptions that they have, where with they are affected, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nature of Knowledge or Instruction in them. As for Instance; when a Person is affected with a lively Idea, suddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in his Mind, of some Shape, or very beautiful pleasant Form of Countenance, or some shining Light, or other glorious outward Appearance: Here is something apprehended or conceived by the Mind; but there is nothing of the Nature of Instruction in it: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons become never the wiser by such Things, or more knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout God, or a Mediator between God and Man, or the Way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Salvation by Christ, or any Thing contained in any of the Doctrines of the Gospel. Persons by these external Ideas have no further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, as to any of the Attributes or Perfections of

his Natures; nor have they any further Understanding of his Word, or any of his Ways or Works. Truly spiritual and gracious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not raised after this Manner: These arise from the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Understanding to understand the Things that are taught of God and Christ, in a new Manner, the coming to a new Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the excellent Nature of God, and his wonderful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, some new View of Christ in his spiritual Excellencies and Fulness, or Things open'd to him in a new Manner, that appertain to the Way of Salvation by Christ, whereby he now sees how it is, and understands those divine and spiritual Doctrines which once were Foolishness to him. Such Enlightnings of the Understanding as these, are Things entirely different in their Nature, from strong Ideas of Shapes and Colours, and outward Brightness and Glory, or Sounds and Voices. That all gracious Affections do arise from some Instruction or Enlightning of the Understanding, is therefore a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof, that Affections which arise from such Impression <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on the Imagination, are not gracious Affections, besides the Things obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, which make this evident.</p>
               <p>Hence also it appears, that Affections arising from Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture coming to the Mind are vain, when no Instruction received in the Understanding from those Texts, or any Thing taught in those Texts, is the Ground of the Affection, but the Manner of their coming to the Mind. When Christ makes the Scripture a Means of the Heart's burning with gracious Affection, 'tis <hi>by opening the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their Understandings;</hi> Luke 24. 32. <hi>Did not our Heart burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, while he talked with us by the Way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> It appears also that the Affection which is occasioned by the coming of a Text of Scripture must be vain, when the Affection is founded on something that is supposed to be taught by it, which really is not contained in it, nor in any other Scripture; because such supposed Instruction is not real Instruction, but a Mistake, and Misapprehension of the Mind. As for Instance, when Persons sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that they are expresly taught by some Scripture coming to their Minds, that they in particular are beloved of God, or that their Sins are forgiven, that God is their Father, and the like: This is a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take or Misapprehension; for the Scripture no where reveals the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Persons who are beloved, expresly; but only by Consequence, by revealing the Qualifications of Persons that are beloved of God: And therefore this Matter is not to be learn'd from Scripture any other Way than by Consequence, and from these Qualifications: For Things ben't to be <hi>learn'd from</hi> the Scripture any other Way than they are <hi>taught in</hi> the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Affections really arise from Ignorance, rather than Instruction, in these Instances which have been mention'd; as likewise in some others that might be mention'd. As some when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:005767_0169_102706AC15CFC168"/>
free of Speech in Prayer, they call it God's being with them; and this affects them more; and so their Affections are set a going and increased: When they look not into the Cause of this Freedom of Speech; which may arise many other Ways besides God's spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Presence. So some are much affected with some apt Thoughts that come into their Minds about the Scripture, and call it the Spirit of God teaching them. So they ascribe many of the Workings of their own Minds, which they have a high Opinion of, and are pleased and taken with, to the special immediate Influences of God's Spirit; and so are mightily affected with their Priviledge. And there are some Instances of Persons, in whom it seems manifest that the first Ground of their Affection is some bodily Sensation. The animal Spirits, by some Cause, (&amp; probably sometimes by the Devil) are suddenly and unaccountably put into a very agreable Motion, causing Person to feel pleasantly in their Bodies; the animal Spirits are put into such a Motion as is won't to be connected with the Exhileration of the Mind: and the Soul, by the Laws of the Union of Soul and Body, hence feels Pleasure. The Motion of the animal Spirits don't first arise from any Affection or Apprehension of the Mind whatsoever; but the very first Thing that is felt, is an Exhileration of the animal Spirits, and a pleasant external Sensation, it may be in their Breasts. Hence, through Ignorance, the Person being surprized, begins to think, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the Holy Ghost coming into him. And then the Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be affected and raised: There is first great Joy; and then many other Affections, in a very tumultuous Manner, putting all Nature, both Body and Mind, into a mighty Ruffle: For though, as I observed before, 'tis the Soul only that is <hi>the Seat of the Affections;</hi> yet this hinders not but that bodily Sensations, may in this Manner, be <hi>an Occasion of Affections</hi> in the Mind.</p>
               <p>And if Men's religions Affections do truly arise from some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or Light in the Understanding; yet the Affection is not gracious, unless the Light which is the Ground of it be spiritual. Affections may be excited by that Understanding of Things, which they obtain meerly by humane Teaching, with the common Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Faculties of the Mind. Men may be much affected by Knowledge of Things of, Religion that they obtain this Way; as some Philosophers have been mightily affected, &amp; almost carried beyond themselves, by the Discoveries they have made in Mathematicks and natural Philosophy. So Men may be much affected from common Illuminations of the Spirit of God, in which God assists Men's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to a greater Degree of that Kind of Understanding of religious Matters, which they have in some Degree, by only the ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and Improvement of their own Faculties. Such Illuminations may much affect the Mind; as in many whom we read of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>that were once enlightened:</hi> But these Affections are not spiritual.</p>

There is such a Thing, if the Scriptures are of any Use to teach us any Thing, as a spiritual, supernatural Understanding of divine Things, that is peculiar to the Saints, and which those who are not Saints have nothing of. 'Tis certainly a Kind of Understanding, apprehending or discerning or divine Things, that natural Men have nothing of, which the Apostle speaks of, 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>But the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can be know them, because they are spiritualy dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>He that doth Evil hath not seen God.</hi> And John 6. 40. <hi>This is the Will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting Life.</hi> Chap. 14. 10. <hi>The World seeth me us more; but ye see me.</hi> Chap. 17. 3. <hi>This is eternal Life, that that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> Matth. 11. 27. <hi>No Man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father, but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> John 12. 45. <hi>He that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</hi> Psal. 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their Truly in thee.</hi> Phil. 3. 8. <hi>I count all Things but Loss, for the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.</hi>—. Ver. 10. <hi>That I may know Him</hi>—. And innumerable other Places there are, all over the Bible, which shew the same. And that there is such a Thing as an Understanding of divine Things, which in it's Nature and Kind is wholly different from all Knowledge that natural Men have, is evident from this, that there is an Understanding of divine Things, which the Scripture calls spiritual Understanding; Col. 1. 9. <hi>We do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you may be filled with the Knowledge of his Will, in all Wisdom, and spiritual Understanding.</hi> It has been already shown, that that which is <hi>spiritual,</hi> in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Use of the Word in the New-Testament, is entirely different in Nature and Kind, from all which natural Men are, or can be the Subjects of.</p>
               <p>From hence it may be surely infer'd, wherein spiritual Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding consists. For if there be in the Saints a Kind of Apprehension or Perception, which is in its Nature, perfectly diverse from all that natural Men have, or that it is possible they should have, 'till they have a new Nature; it must consist in their having a certain Kind of Ideas or Sensations of Mind, which are simply diverse from all that is or can be in the Minds of natural Men. And that is the same Thing as to say, that it consists in the Sensations of a new spiritual Sense, which the Souls of natural Men have not; as is evident by what has been before, once and again observed. But I have already shown what that new spiritual Sense is, which the Saints have given them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:005767_0171_102706B7AAB4ADA0"/>
and what is the Object of it. I have shown that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object of it is the supream Beauty and Excellency of the Nature of divine Things, as they are in themselves. And this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the Scripture: The Apostle very plainly teaches that the great Thing discovered by spiritual Light, and understood by spiritual Knowledge, is the Glory of divine Things, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. <hi>But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not, lost the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them:</hi> together with Ver. 6. <hi>For God who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ:</hi> And Chap. 3. 18. preceeding, <hi>But we all, with open Face, beholding as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> And it must needs be so, for as has been before observed, the Scripture often teaches that all true Religion summarily consists in the Love of divine Things. And therefore that Kind of Understanding or Knowledge, which is the proper Foundation of true Religion, must be the Knowledge of the <hi>Loveliness of divine Things.</hi> For doubtless, that Knowledge which is the proper Foundation of <hi>Love,</hi> is the Knowledge of <hi>Loveliness.</hi> What that Beauty or Loveliness of divine Things is, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and immediate Object of a spiritual Sense of Mind, was shewed under the last Head insisted on, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the Beauty of their moral Perfection. Therefore it is in the View or Sense of this, that spiritual Understanding does more immediately and primarily consist. And indeed it is plain it can be nothing else; for (as has been shewn) there is nothing pertaining to divine Things besides the Beauty of their moral Excellency, and those Properties and Qualities of divine Things which this Beauty is the Foundation of, but what natural Men and Devils can see and know, and will know fully and clearly to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, therefore, we come necessarily to this Conclusion, concerning that wherein spiritual Understanding consists; <hi>viz.</hi> That it consists in <hi>a Sense of the Heart, of the supream Beauty and Sweetness of the Holiness or moral Perfection of divine Things, together with all that Discerning and Knowledge of Things of Religion, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon, and flows from such a Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Spiritual Understanding consists primarily in <hi>a Sense of Heart of that spiritual Beauty.</hi> I say, a <hi>Sense of Heart;</hi> for it is not Speculation meerly that is concerned in this Kind of Understanding: Nor can there be a clear Distinction made between the two Faculties of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Will, as acting distinctly and separately, in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When the Mind is sensible of the sweet Beauty and Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Thing, That implies a Sensibleness of Sweetness and Delight in
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:005767_0172_102706BCBAF790D8"/>
the Presence of the Idea of it: And this Sensibleness of the Amiableness or Delightfulness of Beauty, carries in the very Nature of it, <hi>the Sense of the Heart;</hi> or an Effect and Impression the Soul is the Subject of, as a Substance possessed of Taste, Inclination and Will.</p>
               <p>There is a Distinction to be made between a meer <hi>national Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> wherein the Mind only beholds Things in the Exercise of a speculative Faculty; and <hi>the Sense of the Heart,</hi> wherein the Mind don't only <hi>speculate</hi> and <hi>behold,</hi> but <hi>

The one is meer speculative Knowledge; the other sensible Knowledge, in which more than the meer Intellect is concerned; the Heart is the proper Subject of it, or the Soul as a Being that not only Beholds, but has Inclination, and is pleased or displeased. And yet there is the Nature of Instruction in it; as he that has perceived the sweet Taste of Honey, knows much more about it, than he who has only looked upon and felt of it.</p>
               <p>The Apostle seems to make a Distinction between meer specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knowledge of the Things of Religion, and spiritual Knowledge, in calling that <hi>the Form of Knowledge, and of the Truth;</hi> Rom. 2. 20. <hi>Which hast the Form of Knowledge, and of the Truth in the Law.</hi> The Letter is often represented by relishing, smelling, or tasting; 2 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>Now Thanks be to God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and maketh manifest the Savour of his Knowledge, in every Place.</hi> Matth. 16. 23. <hi>Thou favourest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Spiritual Understanding primarily consists in this <hi>Sense, or Taste of the moral Beauty of divine Things;</hi> so that no Knowledge can be called Spiritual, any further than it arises from this, and has this in it. But <hi>secondarily,</hi> it includes <hi>all that Discerning and Knowledge of Things of Religion, which depends upon, and flows from such a Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the true Beauty and Amiableness of the Holiness or true moral Good that is in divine Things, is discovered to the Soul, it as it were opens a new World to it's View. This shews the Glory of all the Perfections of God, and of every Thing appertaining to the divine Being: For, as was observed before, the Beauty of all arises from God's moral Perfection. This shews the Glory of all God's Works, both of Creation and Providence: For 'tis the special Glory of them, that God's Holiness, Righteousness, Faithfulness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:005767_0173_102706BE5E875690"/>
are so manifested in them; and without these moral Perfections, there would be no Glory in that Power and Skill with which they are wrought. The glorifying of God's moral Perfections, is the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial End of all the Works of God's Hands. By this Sense of the, moral Beauty of divine Things, is understood the Sufficiency of Christ as a Mediator: For 'tis only by the Discovery of the Beauty of the moral Perfection of Christ, that the Believer is lot into the Knowledge of the Excellency of his Person, so as to know any Thing more of it than the Devils do: And 'tis only by the Knowledge of the Excellency of Christ's Person, that any know his Sufficiency as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. 'Tis by seeing the Excellency of Christ's Person, that the Saints are made sensible of the Preciousness of his Blood, and it's Sufficiency to attone for Sin: For therein consists the Preciousness of Christ. Blood, that 'tis the Blood of so excellent and amiable a Person. And on this depends the Meritoriousness of his Obedience, and Sufficiency and Prevalence of his Intercession. By this Sight of the moral Beauty of divine Things, is seen the Beauty of the Way of Salvation by Christ: For that consists in the Beauty of the moral Perfections of God, which wonderfully shines forth in every Step of this Method of Salvation, from Beginning to End. By this is seen the Fitness and Suitableness of this Way: For this wholly consults in its Tendency to deliver us from Sin and Hell, and to bring us to the Happiness which consists in the Possession and Enjoyment of moral Good, in a Way sweetly agreeing with God's moral Perfections. And in the Way's being contrived so as to attain these Ends, consists the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Wisdom of that Way. By this is seen the Excellency of the Word of God: Take away all the moral Beauty and Sweetness in the Word, and the Bible is left wholly a dead Letter, a dry, lifeless, tasteless Thing. By this is seen the true Foundation of our Duty; the Worthiness of God to be so esteem'd, honour'd, lov'd, submitted to, and serv'd, as he requires of us, and the Amiableness of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselves that are required of us. And by this is seen the true Evil of Sin: For he who sees the Beauty of Holiness, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily see the Hatefulness of Sin, its Contrary. By this Men understand the true Glory of Heaven, which consists in the Beauty and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that is in Holiness. By this is seen the Amiableness and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of both Saints and Angels. He that sees the Beauty of Holiness, or true moral Good, sees the greatest and most important Thing in the World, which is the Fulness of all Things, without which all the World is empty, no better than nothing, yea, worse than nothing. Unless this is seen, nothing is seen, that is worth the Seeing: For there is no other true Excellency or Beauty. Unless this be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, nothing is understood, that is worthy of the Exercise of the noble Faculty of Understanding. This is the Beauty of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:005767_0174_102706C62455CDB8"/>
head, and the Divinity of Divinity, (if I may so speak) the Good of the infinite Fountain of Good; without which God himself (if that were possible to be) would be an infinite Evil: Without which, we our selves had better never have been; and without which there had better have been no Being. He therefore in Effect knows nothing, that knows not this: His Knowledge is but the Shadow of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or the Form of Knowledge, as the Apostle calls it. Well therefore may the Scripture represent those who are destitute of that spiritual Sense, by which is perceived the Beauty of Holiness, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally blind, deaf and senseless, yea dead. And well may Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which this divine Sense is given to the Soul by its Creator, be represented as opening the blind Eyes, and raising the Dead, and bringing a Person into a new World. For if what has been said be consider'd, it will be manifest, that when a Person has this Sense and Knowledge given him, he will view nothing as he did before; tho' before he <hi>knew</hi> all Things <hi>after the Flesh, yet henceforth he will know them so no more;</hi> and <hi>he is become a new Creature, old Things are past away, behold all Things are become new;</hi> agreeable to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>And besides the Things that have been already mentioned, there arises from this Sense of spiritual Beauty, all true experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Religion; which is of itself, as is were a new World of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. He that sees not the Beauty of Holiness, knows not what one of the Graces of God's Spirit is; he is destitute of any Idea or Conception of all gracious Exercise of Soul, and all holy Comforts and Delights, and all Effects of the saving Influences of the Spirit of God on the Heart: And so is ignorant of the greatest Works of God, the most important and glorious Effects of his Power upon the Creature: And also is wholly ignorant of the Saints as Saints; he knows not what they are: And in Effect is ignorant of the whole spiritual World.</p>
               <p>Things being thus, it plainly appears, that God's implanting that spiritual supernatural Sense which has been spoken of, makes a great Change in a Man. And were it not for the very imperfect Degree, in which this Sense is commonly given at first, or the small Degree of this glorious Light that first dawns upon the Soul; the Change made by this spiritual Opening of the Eyes in Conversion, would be much greater, and more remarkable, every Way than if a Man, who had been born Blind, and with only the other four Senses, should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue so a long Time, and then at once should have the Sense of seeing imparted to him, in the midst of the clear Light of the Sun, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a World of visible Objects. For tho' Sight be more noble than any of the other external Senses; yet this spiritual Sense which has been spoken of, is infinitely more noble than that, or any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Discerning that a Man naturally has, and the Object of this Sense infinitely greater and more important.</p>

This Sort of Understanding or Knowledge is that Knowledge of divine Things from whence all truly gracious Affections do proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By which therefore all Affections are to be tried.

No; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want much. And therefore content not your selves with every Knowledge. There is some Knowledge which Men have by the Light of Nature, (which leaves them without Excuse) from the Book of Creation; some by Power of Education; some by the Light of the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men know their Sin and Evils; some by the Letter or the Gospel; and so Men may know much, and speak well; and so in seeing, see not; some by the Spirit, and may see much, so as to prophecy in Christ's Name, and yet bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.

God will never write his Law in your Minds, 'till all the Scribblings of it are blotted out. Account all your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Loss for the Gaining of this.

               <p>From what has been said may be learn'd wherein the most essential Difference lies between that Light or Understanding which is given by the common Influences of the Spirit of God, on the Hearts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men, and that saving Instruction which is given to the Saints.

                  </gap> Beauty that is in divine Things; which is the only <hi>true</hi> moral Good, and which the Soul of fallen Man is by Nature totally blind to. The

Former consists only in a further Understanding, thro' the Assistance of natural Principles, of those Things which Men may know, in some Measure, by the alone ordinary Exercise of their Faculties. And this Knowledge consists only in the Knowledge of those Things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Religion, which are <hi>natural.</hi> Thus for Instance, In those Awakenings and Convictions of Conscience, that natural Men are often subject to, the Spirit of God gives no Knowledge of the true <hi>moral</hi> Beauty which is in divine Things; but only assists the Mind to a clearer Idea of the Guilt of Sin, or it's Relation to a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Connection with the <hi>Evil of Suffering</hi> (without any Sight of it's true <hi>moral</hi> Evil, or Odiousness as Sin) and a clearer Idea of the <hi>natural</hi> Perfections of God, wherein consists, not his holy Beauty and Glory, but his awful and terrible Greatness. 'Tis a clear Sight of this, that will fully awaken the Consciences of wicked Men at the Day of Judgment, <hi>without any spiritual Light.</hi> And 'tis a lesser De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the same, that awakens the Consciences of natural Men, <hi>without spiritual Light,</hi> in this World. The same Discoveries are in some Measure given in the Conscience of an awakened Sinner in this World, which will be given more fully in the Consciences of Sinners at the Day of Judgment. The same Kind of Sight or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of God, in a lesser Degree, makes awakened Sinners in this World, sensible of the dreadful Guilt of Sin; against so great and terrible a God, and sensible of it's amazing Punishment, and fills 'em with fearful Apprehensions of divine Wrath; that will thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince all wicked Men, of the infinitely dreadful Nature &amp; Guilt of Sin, and astonish 'em with Apprehensions of Wrath, when Christ shall come in the Glory of his Power and Majesty, and every Eye shall see him, and all the Kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him. And in those common Illuminations, which are sometimes given to natural Men, exciting in them some Kind of religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, Love and Joy, the Mind is only assisted to a clearer Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>natural Good</hi>

Thus in that great Goodness of God to Sinners, and the wonderful dying Love of Christ, there is a natural Good, which all Men love, as they love themselves; as well as a spiritual and holy Beauty, which is seen only by the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. Therefore there are many Things appertaining to the Word of God's Grace delivered in the Gospel, which may cause natural Men, when they hear it, <hi>anon with Joy to receive it.</hi> All
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:005767_0177_102706D76258FBE8"/>
that Love which natural Men have to God, and Christ, and christian Vertues, and good Men, is not from any Sight of the Amiableness of the Holiness, or true <hi>moral</hi> Excellency of these Things; but only for the sake of the <hi>natural</hi> Good there is in them. All natural Men's Hatred of Sin, is as much from Principles of Nature, as Men's Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of a Tyger for his Rapaciousness, or their Aversion to a Serpent for his Poison and Hurtfulness: And all their Love of christian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is from no higher Principle than their Love of a Man's good Nature, which appears amiable to natural Men; but no otherwise than Silver and Gold appears amiable in the Eyes of a Merchant, or than the Blackness of the Soil is beautiful in the Eyes of the Farmer.</p>
               <p>From what has been said of the Nature of spiritual Understanding, it appears that spiritual Understanding does not consist in any new doctrinal Knowledge, or in having suggested to the Mind any new Proposition, not before read or heard of: For 'tis plain that this sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting of new Propositions, is a Thing entirely diverse from giving the Mind a new Taste or Relish of Beauty and Sweetness. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Calvin,</hi> in his Institutions, Book I. Chap. ix. § 1. says, <q>It is not the Office of the Spirit that is promised us, to make new and before unheard of Revelations, or to coin some new Kind of Doctrine, which tends to draw us away from the received Doctrine of the Gospel; but to seal and confirm to us that very Doctrine which is by the Gospel.</q> And in the same Place he speaks of some, that in those Days maintain'd the contrary Notion, <hi>pretending to be immediately led by the Spirit, as Persons that were governed by a most haughty Self-conceit; and not so properly to be looked upon as only labouring under a Mistake, as driven by a Sort of raving Madness.</hi>
                  </note> 'Tis also evident that spiritual Knowledge does not consist in any new doctrinal Explanation of any Part of the Scripture; for still, this is but doctrinal Knowledge, or the Knowledge of Propositions; the doctrinal explaining of any Part of Scripture, is only giving us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, what are the Propositions contain'd or taught in that Part of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that the <hi>spiritual Understanding</hi> of the Scripture, don't consist in opening to the Mind the mystical Meaning of the Scripture, in it's Parables, Types and Allegories; for this is only a doctrinal Explication of the Scripture. He that explains what is meant by the stony Ground, and the Seed's springing up suddenly, and quickly withering away, only explains what Propositions or Doctrines are taught in it. So he that explains what is typified by <hi>Jacob'</hi>s Ladder, and the Angels of God ascending and descending on it, or what was typified by <hi>Joshua'</hi>s leading <hi>Israel</hi> through <hi>Jordan,</hi> only
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005767_0178_102706D95507CDE8"/>
shews what Propositions are hid in these Passages. And many Men can explain these Types, who have no spiritual Knowledge. 'Tis possible that a Man might know how to interpret all the Types, Parables, Enigmas, and Allegories in the Bible and not have one Beam of spiritual Light in his Mind; because he mayn't have the least Degree of that spiritual Sense of the holy Beauty of divine Things which has been spoken of, and may see nothing of this Kind of Glory in any Thing contained in any of these Mysteries, or any other Part of the Scripture. 'Tis plain, by what the Apostle says, that a Man might understand all such Mysteries, and have no saving Grace: 1 Cor. 13. 2. <hi>And tho' I have the Gift of Prophecy, and understand all Mysteries, and all Knowledge, and have not Charity, it profiteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> They therefore are very foolish, who are exalted in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their own spiritual Attainments, from Notions that come into their Minds, of the mythical Meaning of these and those Passages of Scripture, as tho' it was a spiritual Understanding of these Passages, immediately given 'em by the Spirit of God, and hence have their Affections highly raised: And what has been said shews the Vanity of such Affections.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, it is also evident, that it is not spiritual Knowledge, for Persons to be informed of their Duty, by having it immediately suggested to their Minds, that such and such outward Actions or Deeds are the Will of God. If we suppose that it is truly God's Manner thus to signify his Will to his People, by immediate inward Suggestions, such Suggestions have nothing of the Nature of spiritual Light. Such Kind of Knowledge would only be one Kind of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal Knowledge: A Proposition concerning the Will of God, is as properly a Doctrine of Religion, as a Proposition concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, or a Work of God: And an having either of these Kinds of Propositions, or any other Proposition, declared to a Man, either by Speech, or inward Suggestion, differs vastly from an having the holy Beauty of divine Things manifested to the Soul, wherein spiritual Knowledge does most essentially consist. Thus there was no spiritual Light in <hi>Balaam;</hi> tho' he had the Will of God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately suggested to him by the Spirit of God from Time to Time, concerning the Way that he should go, and what he should do and say.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifest therefore, that a being led and directed in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is not that holy and spiritual <hi>Leading of the Spirit of God,</hi> which is peculiar to the Saints, and a distinguishing Mark of the Sons of God, spoken of Rom. 8. 14. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi> Gal. 5. 18. <hi>But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="171" facs="unknown:005767_0179_102706DD83CC9860"/>
And if Persons have the Will of God concerning their Actions, suggested to them by some Text of Scripture, suddenly and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily brought to their Minds, which Text, as the Words lay in the Bible before they came to their Minds, related to the Action and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of some other Person, but they suppose, as God sent the Words to them, he intended something further by them, and meant such a particular Action of their's; I say, if Persons should have the Will of God thus suggested to 'em with Texts of Scripture, it alters not the Case. The Suggestion being accompanied with an apt Text of Scripture, don't make the Suggestion to be of the Nature of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Instruction. As for Instance, If a Person in <hi>New-England,</hi> on some Occasion, were at a Loss whether it was his Duty to go into some popish or heathenish Land, where he was like to be exposed to many Difficulties and Dangers, and should pray to God that he would shew him the Way of his Duty; and after earnest Prayer, should have those Words which God spake to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 46. sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and extraordinarily brought to his Mind, as it they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him; <hi>Fear not to go down into</hi> Egypt; <hi>and I will go with thee; and I will also surely bring thee up again.</hi> In which Words, tho' as they lay in the Bible before they came to his Mind, they related only to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Behaviour; yet he supposes that God has a further Meaning, as they were brought and applied to him; that thus they are to be understood in a new Sense, that by <hi>Egypt</hi> is to be understood this particular Country he has in his Mind, and that the Action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is his going thither, and that the Meaning of the Promise is that God would bring him back into <hi>New-England</hi> again. There is nothing of the Nature of a spiritual or gracious Leading of the Spirit in this; for there is nothing of the Nature of spiritual Understanding in it. Thus to understand Texts of Scripture, is not to have a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Understanding of them. Spiritually to understand the Scripture, is rightly to understand what <hi>is in</hi> the Scripture, and what <hi>was in</hi> it before it was understood: 'Tis to understand rightly, what <hi>used to be contained in</hi> the Meaning of it; and not the making a new Meaning. When the Mind is enlighten'd spiritually and rightly to understand the Scripture, it is enabled to see That in the Scripture, which before was not seen, <hi>by Reason of Blindness.</hi> But if it was by Reason of Blindness; that is an Evidence that the same Meaning was in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; otherwise it would have been no Blindness not to see it: 'Tis no Blindness not to see a Meaning which is not there. Spiritually enlightening the Eyes to understand the Scripture, is <hi>to open the Eyes,</hi> Psal. 119. 18. <hi>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may behold wondrous Things out of thy Law;</hi> which argues that the Reason why the same was not seen in the Scripture before, was that the Eyes were <hi>shut;</hi> which would not be the Case, if the Meaning that is now understood was not there before, but is now newly added to the Scripture, by the
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:005767_0180_102706E1B7EECD48"/>
Manner of the Scripture's coming to my Mind. This making a new Meaning to the Scripture, is the same Thing as making a new Scripture: It is properly adding to the Word; which is threatned with to dreadful a Curse. Spiritually to understand the Scripture, is to have the Eyes of the Mind open'd, to behold thy wonderful spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Excellency of the glorious Things contain'd in the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and that always were contain'd in it, ever once it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; to behold the amiable and bright Manifestation of the divine Perfections, and of the Excellency and Sufficiency of Christ, and the Excellency and Suitableness of the Way of Salvation by Christ, and the spiritual Glory of the Precepts and Promises of the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Things are, and always were in the Bible, and would have been seen before, if it had not been for Blindness, without having any now Sense added by the Words being sent by God to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Person, and spoken a new to him, with a new Meaning.</p>
               <p>And as to a gracious <hi>Leading of the Spirit,</hi> it consists in two Things; partly in <hi>instructing</hi> a Person in his Duty by the Spirit, and partly in powerfully <hi>inducing</hi> him to comply with that Instruction. But so far as the gracious Leading of the Spirit lies in Instruction, it consists in a Person's being guided by a spiritual and distinguishing Taste of that which has in it true moral Beauty. I have shewn that spiritual Knowledge primarily consists in a Taste or Relish of the Amiableness and Beauty of that which is truly good and holy: This holy Relish is a Thing that discerns and distinguishes between Good and Evil, between holy and unholy, without being at the Trouble of a Train of Reasoning. As he who has a true Relish of external Beauty, knows what is beautiful by looking upon it: He stands in no need of a Train of Reasoning about the Proportion of the Features, in order to determine whether that which he sees be a beautiful Countenance or no: He needs nothing, but only the Glance of his Eye. He who has a rectified musical Ear, knows whether the Sound he hears be true Harmony: He don't need first to be at the Trouble of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings of a Mathematician, about the Proportion of the Notes. He that has a rectified Palate, knows what is good Food, as soon as he tastes it, without the Reasoning of a Physician about it. There is a holy Beauty and Sweetness in Words and Actions, as well as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beauty in Countenances and Sounds, and Sweetness in Food; Job 12. 11. <hi>Doth not the Ear try Words, and the Mouth taste his Meat.</hi> When a holy and amiable Action is suggested to the Tho'ts of a holy Soul; that Soul, if in the lively Exercise of it's spiritual Taste, at once sees a Beauty in it, and so inclines to it, and closes with it. On the Contrary, if an unworthy unholy Action be sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to it, it's sanctified Eye fees no Beauty in it, and is not pleased with it; it's sanctified Taste relishes no Sweetness in it, but on the contrary, it is nauseous to it. Yea it's holy Taste and Appetite leads
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005767_0181_102706E358B43800"/>
it to think of That which is truly lovely, and naturally suggests it; as a healthy Taste and Appetite naturally suggests the Idea of it's proper Object. Thus a holy Person is led by the Spirit, as he is instructed and led by his holy Taste, and Disposition of Heart; whereby, in the lively Exercise of Grace, he easily distinguishes Good and Evil, and knows at once, what is a suitable amiable Behaviour towards God, and towards Man, in this Case and the other; and judges what is right as it were spontaneously, and of himself, without a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, by any other Arguments than the Beauty that is seen, and Goodness that is tasted. Thus Christ blames the <hi>Pha<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">

The Apostle seems plainly to have Respect to this Way of judging of spiritual Beauty, in Rom. 12. 2. <hi>Be ye transformed by the Renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and perfect, and acceptable Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is such a Thing as <hi>good Taste</hi> of <hi>natural</hi> Beauty, (which learned Men often speak of) that is exercised about <hi>temporal</hi> Things, in judging of them; as about the Justness of a Speech, the Goodness of Style, the Beauty of a Poem, the Gracefulness of Deportment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A late great Philosopher of our Nation, writes thus upon it; <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chambers'</hi>s Dictionary, under the Word TASTE.</note>. <q>To have <hi>a Taste,</hi> is to give Things their real Value, to be touch'd with the Good, to be shock'd with the Ill; not to be dazzled with false Lustres, but in Spight of all Colours, and every Thing that might deceive or amuse, to judge soundly. <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> then, should be the same Thing; and yet 'tis easy to discern a Difference. The <hi>Judgment</hi> forms it's Opinions from Reflection: The Reason on this Occasion fetches a Kind of Circuit, to arrive at it's End; it supposes Principles, it draws Consequences, and it judges; but not without a thorough Knowledge of the Case; so that after it has pronounced, it is ready to render a Reason of it's Decrees. <hi>Good Taste</hi> observes none of these Formalities; e'er it has Time to consult, it has taken it's Side; as soon as ever the Object is presented it, the Impression is made, the Sentiment formed, ask no more of it. As the Ear is wounded with a harsh Sound, as the Smell is sooth'd with an agreable Odour, before ever the Reason have meddled with those Objects to judge of them, so the <hi>Taste</hi> opens itself at once, and prevents all Reflection. They may come afterwards to confirm it, and discover the secret Reasons of it's Conduct; but it was not in it's Power to wait for them. Frequently it happens not to know them at all, and what Pains soever it uses, cannot discover what it was determin'd it to think as it did. This Conduct is very different from That the

And thus <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>A holy Disposition and spiritual Taste, where Grace is strong and lively, will enable a Soul to determine what Actions are right and becoming Christians, not only more speedily, but far more exactly, than the greatest Abilities without it. This may be illustrated by the Manner in which some Habits of Mind, and Dispositions of Heart, of a Nature inferiour to true Grace, will teach and guide a Man in his Actions. As for Instance, if a Man be a very good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Man, his good Nature will teach him better how to act bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volently amongst Mankind, and will direct him, on every Occasion, to these Speeches and Actions, which are agreeable to Rules of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than the strongest Reason will a Man of a morose Temper. So if a Man's Heart be under the Influence of an entire Friendship, and most endeared Affection to another; tho' he be a Man of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Capacity, yet this Habit of his Mind will direct him, for more readily and exactly, to a Speech and Deportment, or Manner of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which shall in all Respects be sweet and Kind, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a benevolent Disposition of Heart, than the greatest Capacity without it. He has as it were a Spirit within him, that guides him: The Habit of his Mind is attended with a Taste, by which he immediately relishes that Air and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Saints in thus judging of Actions by a spiritual Taste, have not a particular Recourse to the express Rules of God's Word, with Respect to every Word and Action that is before them, the Good or Evil of which they thus judge of: But yet their Taste it self in General, is Subject to the Rule of God's Word, and must be tried by that, and a right Reasoning upon it. As a Man of a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Palate judges of particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by his Taste: But yet his Palate it self must be judged of, whether it be right or no, by certain Rules and Reasons. But a spiritual Taste of Soul, mightily helps the Soul, in its Reasonings on the Word of God, and in judging of the true Meaning of its Rules; as it removes the Prejudices of a depraved Appetite, and naturally leads the Thoughts in the right Channel, casts a Light on the Word of God, and causes the true Meaning, most naturally to come to Mind, thro' the Harmony there is between the Disposition and Relish of a sanctified Soul, and the true Meaning of the Rules of God's Word. Yea, this Harmony tends to bring the Texts themselves to Mind, on proper Occasions; as the particular State of the Stomach and Palate, tends to bring such particular Meats and Drinks to Mind, as are agreeable to that State. Thus <hi>the Children of God are led by, the Spirit of God</hi> in judging of Actions themselves, and in their Meditations upon, and judging of,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005767_0184_102706ECBB2071B0"/>
and applying the Rules of God's holy Word: And so God <hi>teaches them his Statutes, and causes them to understand the Way of his Precepts;</hi> which the Psalmist so often prays for.</p>
               <p>But this Leading of the Spirit is a Thing exceeding diverse from that which some call so; which consists not in teaching them God's Statutes and Precepts, that he has already given; but in giving them new Precepts, by immediate inward Speech or Suggestion; and has in it no Tasting the true Excellency of Things, or judging or discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of Things at all. They don't determine what is the Will of God by any Taste or Relish, or any Manner of Judgment of the Nature of Things, but by an immediate Dictate concerning the Thing to be done: There is no such Thing as any Judgment or Wisdom in the Case. Whereas in that Leading of the Spirit which is peculiar to God's Children, is imparted that true Wisdom, and holy Discretion, so often spoken of in the Word of God; which is high above the other Way, as the Stars are higher than a Glow-Worm; and that which <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> (who sometimes were led by the Spirit in that other Way) never had, and no natural Man can have, without a Change of Nature.</p>
               <p>What has been said of the Nature of spiritual Understanding, as consisting most essentially in a divine supernatural Sense and Relish of the Heart, not only shews that there is nothing of it in this falsiy supposed <hi>Leading of the Spirit,</hi> which has been now spoken of; but also shows the Difference between spiritual Understanding, and all Kinds and Forms of Enthusiasm, all imaginary Sights of God and Christ and Heaven, all supposed Witnessing of the Spirit, and Testimonies of the Love of God by immediate inward Suggestion; and all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of future Events, and immediate Revelations of any secret Facts whatsoever; all enthusiastical Impressions and Applications of Words of Scripture, as tho' they were Words now immediately spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by God to a particular Person, in a new Meaning, and carrying something more in them, than the Words contain as they lie in the Bible; and all Interpretations of the mystical Meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by supposed immediate Revelation. None of these Things consist in a divine Sense and Relish of the <hi>Heart,</hi> of the holy Beauty and Excellency of divine Things; nor have they any Thing to do with such a Sense; but all consist in Impressions in the <hi>Head;</hi> all are to be refer'd to the Head of <hi>Impressions on the Imagination,</hi> and consist in the exciting external Ideas in the Mind, either in Ideas of outward Shapes and Colours, or Words spoken, or Letters written, or Ideas of Things external and sensible, belonging to Actions done, or Events accomplished, or to be Accomplished. An enthusiastical supposed Manifestation of the Love of God, is made by the exciting an Idea of a smiling Countenance, or some other pleasant outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or by the Idea of pleasant Words spoken, or written,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:005767_0185_102706F28DEE3D08"/>
excited in the Imagination, or some pleasant bodily Sensation. So when Persons have an imaginary Revelation of some secret Fact, 'tis by exciting external Ideas; either of some Words, implying a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of that Fact, or some visible or sensible Circumstances of such a Fact. So the supposed Leading of the Spirit, to do the Will of God, in outward Behaviour, is either by exciting the Idea of Words (which are outward Things) in their Minds, either the Words of Scripture, or other Words, which they look upon as an immediate Command of God; or else by exciting and impressing strongly the Ideas of the outward Actions themselves. So when an Interpretation of a Scripture Type or Allegory, is immediately, in an extraordinary Way, strongly suggested, it is by suggesting Words, as tho' one secretly whisper'd, and told the Meaning; or by exciting other Ideas in the Imagination.</p>
               <p>Such Sort of Experiences and Discoveries as these commonly raise the Affections of such as are deluded by them, to a great Height, and make a mighty Uproar in both Soul and Body. And a very great Part of the false Religion that has been in the World, from one Age to another, consists in such Discoveries as these, and in the Affections that flow from them. In such Things consisted the Experiences of the ancient <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> among the Heathen, and many others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who had strange Extasys and Raptures, and pretended to a divine <hi>Afflatus,</hi> and immediate Revelations from Heaven. In such Things as these seem to have consisted the Experiences of the <hi>Essenes,</hi> an ancient Sect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> at, and after the Times of the Apostles. In such Things as these consisted the Experiences of many of the ancient <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and the <hi>Montanists,</hi> and many other Sects of ancient Hereticks, in the primitive Ages of the Christian Church. And in such Things as these consisted the pretended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Converse, with God and Christ, and Saints and Angels of Heaven, of the <hi>Monks, Anchorites,</hi> and <hi>Recluses,</hi> that formerly aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In such Things consisted the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded high Experiences, and great Spirituality of many Sects of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts, that swarm'd in the World after the Reformation; such as the <hi>Anabaptists, Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Familists,</hi> the Followers of <hi>N. Stork, Th. Muncer, Jo. Becold, Henry Pfeifer, David George, Casper Swenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Henry Nicolas, Johannes Agricola Eislebius;</hi> and the many wild Enthusiasts that were in <hi>England</hi> in the Days of <hi>Oliver Cromwell;</hi> and the Followers of Mrs. <hi>Hutchinson,</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> as appears by the particular and large Accounts given of all these Sects, by that eminently holy Man, Mr. <hi>Samuel Rutherford,</hi> in his <hi>Display of the spiritual Antichrist.</hi> And in such Things as these consisted the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of the late <hi>French Prophets,</hi> and their Followers. And in these Things seems to lie the Religion of the many Kinds of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts of the present Day. 'Tis by such Sort of Religion as this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:005767_0186_102706F9B3B5EE28"/>
that <hi>Satan</hi> transforms himself into an Angel of Light: And it is that which he has ever most successfully made use of to confound hopeful and happy Revivals of Religion, from the Beginning of the christian Church to this Day. When the Spirit of God is poured out, to begin a glorious Work, then the old Serpent, as fast as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by all Means introduces this Bastard Religion, and mingles it with the true; which has from Time to Time soon brought all Things into Confusion. The pernicious Consequence of it is not easily imagined or conceived of, 'till we see and are amazed with the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects of it, and the dismal Desolation it has made. If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of true Religion be very great in it's Beginning, yet if this Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard comes in, there is Danger of it's doing as <hi>Gideon'</hi>s Bastard <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> did, who never left 'till he had slain all his Threescore and ten true born Sons, excepting one, that was forced to flee. Great and strict therefore should be the Watch and Guard that Ministers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain against such Things, especially at a Time of great Awakening: For Men, especially the common People, are easily bewitched with such Things; they having such a glaring and glistering Shew of high Religion; and the Devil hiding his own Shape, and appearing as an Angel of Light, that Men may not to be afraid of him, but many adore him.</p>

Here is the Devil's grand Lurking-Place, the very Nest of soul and delusive Spirits. 'Tis very much to be doubted whether the Devil can come at the Soul of Man, at all to affect it, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite any Thought or Motion, or produce any Effect whatsoever in it, any other Way, than by the Phantasy; which is that Power of the Soul, by which it receives, and is the Subject of the Species, or Ideas of outward and sensible Things. As to the Laws and Means which the Creator has established, for the Intercourse and Communication of unbodied Spirits, we know nothing about them; we don't know by what Medium they manifest their Thoughts to each other, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Thoughts in each other. But as to Spirits that are united to Bodies, those Bodies God has united 'em to, are their Medium of Communication: They have no other Medium of acting on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, or being acted on by them, than the Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be supposed that <hi>Satan</hi> can excite any Thought, or produce any Effect in the Soul of Man, any otherwise, than by some Motion of the animal Spirits, or by causing some Motion or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in something which appertains to the Body.

But it is not likely that the Devil can <hi>immediately produce</hi> an Effect which is out of the Reach of his <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate View.</hi> It seems unreasonable to suppose that his immediate Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, should be out of his own Sight, or that it should be impossible for him to see what he himself immediately does. Is it not unreasonable to suppose that any Spirit or intelligent Agent, should by the Act of his Will, produce Effects, according to his Understanding, or agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his own Thoughts, and that immediately; and yet the Effects produced, be beyond the Reach of his Understanding, or where he can have no immediate Perception or Discerning at all. But if this be so, that the Devil can't produce Thoughts in the Soul immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or any other Way than by the animal Spirits, or by the Body; then it follows, that he never brings to pass any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Soul, but by the Imagination or Phantasy, or by exciting external Ideas. For we know that Alterations in the Body, do immediately excite no other Sort of Ideas in the Mind, but external Ideas, or Ideas of the outward Senses, or Ideas which are of the same outward Nature. As to Reflection, Abstraction, Reasoning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and those Thoughts and inward Motions which are the Fruits of these Acts of the Mind, they are not the next Effects of Impressions on the Body. So that it must be only by the Imagination, that <hi>Satan</hi> has Access to the Soul, to tempt and delude it, or suggest any Thing to it. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <q>The Imagination is that Room of the Soul, wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth often appear. Indeed (to speak exactly) the Devil hath no efficient Power over the rational Part of a Man: He cannot change the Will; he cannot alter the Heart of a Man. So that the utmost he can do, in tempting a Man to Sin, is by Swasion and Suggestion only. But then how doth the Devil do this? Even by working upon the Imagination. He observeth the Temper, and bodily Constitution of a Man; and thereupon suggests to his Fancy, and injects his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Devil then, tho' he hath no imperious Efficacy over thy Will, yet because he can thus stir and move thy Imagination, and thou being naturally destitute of Grace, canst not withstand these Suggestions; hence it is that any Sin in thy Imagination, tho' but in the outward Works of the Soul, yet doth quickly lay hold on all. And indeed, by this Means do arise those horrible Delusions, that are in many erroneous Ways of Religion: All is because their Imaginations are corrupted. Yea, how often are these diabolical Delusions of the Imagination, taken for the gracious Operations of God's Spirit?—it is from hence that many have pretended to Enthusiams;—They leave the Scriptures, and wholly attend to what they perceive and feel within them.</q>

seems to be the Reason why Persons that are under the Disease of Melancholy, are commonly so visibly and remarkably subject to the Suggestions and Temptations of <hi>Satan:</hi> That being a Disease which peculiarly affects the animal Spirits, and is attended with Weakness of that Part of the Body which is the Fountain of the animal Spirits, even the Brain, which is, as it were, the Seat of the Phantasy. 'Tis by Impressions made on the Brain, that any Ideas are excited in the Mind, by the Motion of the animal Spirits, or any Changes made in the Body. The Brain being thus weaken'd and diseased, 'tis less under the Command of the higher Faculties of the Soul, and yields the more easily to extrinsick Impressions, and is over-power'd by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd Motions of the animal Spirits; and so the Devil has greater Advantage to affect the Mind, by working on the Imagination. And thus <hi>Satan,</hi> when he casts in those horrid Suggestions into the Minds of many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> imaginary Ideas, either of some dreadful Words or Sentences, or other horrid outward Ideas. And when he tempts other Persons who are not melancholly, he does it by presenting to the Imagination, in a lively and alluring Manner, the Objects of their Lusts, or by exciting Ideas of Words, and so by them exciting Thoughts; or by promoting an Imagination of outward Actions, Events, Circumstances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Innumerable are the Ways by which the Mind might be led on to all Kind of evil Thoughts, by exciting external Ideas in the Imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:005767_0189_10270707DA2FE738"/>
If Persons keep no Guard at these Avenues of <hi>Satan,</hi> by which he has Access to the Soul, to tempt and delude it, they will be likely to have enough of him. And especially, if instead of guarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, they lay themselves open to him, and seek and invite him, because he appears as an Angel of Light, and counterfeits the Illuminations and Graces of the Spirit of God, by inward Whispers, and immediate Suggestions of Facts and Events, pleasant Voices, beautiful Images, and other Impressions on the Imagination. There are many who are deluded by such Things, and are lifted up with them, and seek after them, that have a continued Course of them, and can have 'em almost when they will; and especially when their Pride and Vain-glory has most Occasion for 'em, to make a Shew of 'em before Company. 'Tis with them, something as 'tis with those who are Professors of the Art of telling where lost Things are to be found, by Impressions made on their Imaginations; they laying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves open to the Devil, he is always at Hand to give them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Impression.</p>
               <p>Before I finish what I would say on this Head of Imaginations, counterfeiting spiritual Light, and Affections arising from them, I would renewedly (to prevent Misunderstanding of what has been said) desire it may be observed, that I am far from determining that no Affections are spiritual which are attended with imaginary Ideas. Such is the Nature of Man, that he can scarcely think of any Thing intensely, without some Kind of outward Ideas. They arise and interpose themselves unavoidably, in the Course of a Man's Thoughts; tho' oftentimes they are very confused, and are not what the Mind regards. When the Mind is much engaged, and the Thoughts intense, oftentimes the Imagination is more strong, and the outward Idea more lively; especially in Persons of some Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Body. But there is a great Difference between these two Things, <hi>viz. Lively Imaginations arising from strong Affections,</hi> and <hi>Strong Affections arising from lively Imaginations.</hi> The former may be, and doubtless often is, in Case of truly gracious Affections. The Affections don't arise from the Imagination, nor have any Dependance upon it; but on the contrary, the Imagination is only the accidental Effect, or Consequent of the Affection, thro' the Infirmity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. But when the latter is the Case, as it often is, that the Affection arises from the Imagination, and is built upon it, as its Foundation, instead of a spiritual Illumination or Discovery; then is the Affection, however elevated, worthless and vain. And this is the Drift of what has been now said, of Impressions on the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Having observed this, I proceed to another Mark of gracious Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:005767_0190_1027070C7A552E88"/>
V. Truly gracious Affections are attended with a reasonable and spiritual Conviction of the Judgment, of the Reality and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of divine Things.</p>
               <p>This seems to be implied in the Text that was laid as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Discourse, <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, tho' now ye see him not, yet</hi> BELIEVING, <hi>ye rejoice with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All those who are truly gracious Persons have a solid, full, thoro' and effectual Conviction of the Truth of the great Things of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. I mean that they no longer halt between two Opinions, the great Doctrines of the Gospel cease to be any longer doubtful Things, or Matters of Opinion, which, tho' probable, are yet disputable; but with them, they are Points settled and determined, as undoubted and indisputable; so that they are not afraid to venture their All upon their Truth. Their Conviction is an <hi>effectual</hi> Conviction; so that the great, spiritual, mysterious, and invisible Things of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, have the <hi>Influence</hi> of real and certain Things upon them; they have the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of real Things in their Hearts; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly rule in their Affections, and govern them thro' the Course of their Lives. With Respect to Christ's being the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, and the great Things he has revealed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Himself, and his Father, and another World, they han't only a predominating Opinion that these Things are true, and so yield their Assent, as they do in many other Matters of doubtful Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they <hi>see that it is really so:</hi> Their Eyes are open'd, so that they see that really Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. And as to the Things which Christ has revealed, of God's eternal Purposes and Designs, concerning fallen Man, and the glorious and everlasting Things prepared for the Saints in another World, they see that they are so indeed: And therefore these Things are of great Weight with them, and have a mighty Power upon their Hearts, and Influence over their Practice, in some Measure answerable to their infinite Importance.</p>
               <p>That all true Christians have such a Kind of Conviction of the Truth of the Things of the Gospel, is abundantly manifest from the holy Scriptures. I will mention a few Places of many; Matth. 16. 15, 16, 17. <hi>But whom say ye that I am?</hi> Simon Peter <hi>answered and said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered, and said unto him, blessed art thou</hi> Simon Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee; and they have believed that thou didst send me.</hi> Acts. 8. 37. <hi>If thou believest with all thy Heart, thou mayest.</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>We which live, are always delivered unto Death, for Jesus sake:—Death worketh in us;—we having the Spirit of Faith; according as it is written, I believed, &amp; therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak: Knowing that be which raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise us up also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with Ver. 16. <hi>For which Cause, we faint not.</hi> And Ver. 18. <hi>while we look not at the Things which are seen,</hi> &amp;c. And Chap. 5. 1. <hi>For we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God,</hi>—And Ver. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Therefore we are always confident; knowing that whilst we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord: For we walk by Faith, not by Sight; we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. <hi>For the which Cause, I also suffer these Things: Nevertheless, I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed; and I am perswaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that Day.</hi> Heb. 3. 6. <hi>Whose House are we, if we hold fast the Confidence, and the Rejoycing of the Hope, firm unto the End.</hi> Heb. 11. 1. <hi>Now Faith is the Substance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not seen:</hi> Together with that whole Chapter. 1 John 4. 13. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and be in us; because he hath given us of his Spirit; and we have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the World. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the Love that God hath to us.</hi> Chap. 5. 4, 5. <hi>For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the World: And this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith. Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore truly gracious Affections are attended with such a Kind of Conviction and Perswasion of the Truth of the Things of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Sight of their Evidence and Reality, as these and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures speak of.</p>
               <p>There are many religious Affections, which are not attended with such a Conviction of the Judgment. There are many Apprehensions and Ideas which some have, that they call divine Discoveries, which are affecting, but not convincing. Tho' for a little while, they may seem to be more perswaded of the Truth of the Things of Religion, than they used to be, and may yield a forward Assent, like many of Christ's Hearers, who believed for a while; yet they have no thoro' and effectual Conviction; nor is there any great abiding Change in them, in this Respect, that whereas formerly they did not realize the great Things of the Gospel, now these Things, with Regard to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:005767_0192_10270714D115F278"/>
and Certainty, appear new to them, and they behold 'em quite in another View than they used to do. There are many Persons who have been exceedingly raised with religious Affections, and think they have been converted, they don't go about the World any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth of the Gospel, than they used to be; or at least, there is no remarkable Alteration: They are not Men who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence and Power of a realizing Conviction of the infinite and eternal Things which the Gospel reveals: If they were, it would be impossible for 'em to live as they do. Because their Affections are not attended with a thorough Conviction of the Mind, they are not at all to be depended on; however great a Snow and Noise they make, 'tis like the Blaze of Tow, or Crackling of Thorns, or like the forward flourishing Blade on stony Ground, that has no Root, nor Deepness of Earth to maintain it's Life.</p>
               <p>Some Persons, under high Affections, and a confident Perswasion of their good Estate, have that, which they very ignorantly call a Seeing the Truth of the Word of God, and which is very far from it, after this Manner; they have some Text of Scripture coming to their Minds, in a sudden and extraordinary Manner, immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to them (as they suppose) that their Sins are forgiven or that God loves them, and will save them; and it may be have a Chain of Scriptures coming one after another, to the same Purpose; and they are convinced that it is Truth; <hi>i. e.</hi> they are confident that it is certainly so, that their Sins are forgiven, and God does love them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—; they say they know it is so; and when the Words of Scripture are suggested to 'em, and as they suppose immediately spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to 'em by God, in this Meaning, they are ready to cry out, <hi>Truth, Truth! 'Tis certainly so! The Word of God is true!</hi> And this they call a Seeing the Truth of the Word of God. Whereas the Whole of their Faith amounts to no more, than only a strong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their own good Estate, and so a Confidence that those Words are true, which they suppose tell 'em they are in a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: When indeed (as was shown before) there is no Scripture which declares that any Person is in a good Estate directly, or any other Way than by Consequence. So that this, instead of being a real Sight of the Word of God, is a Sight of nothing but a Phantom, and is all over a Delusion. Truly to see the Truth of the Word of God, is to see the Truth of the Gospel; which is the glorious Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine the Word of God contains, concerning God, and Jesus Christ, and the Way of Salvation by him, and the World of Glory that he is entered into, and purchased for all them who believe; and not a Revelation that such and such particular Persons are true Christians, and shall go to Heaven. Therefore those Affections which arise from no other Perswasion of the Truth of the Word of God than this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:005767_0193_1027071673033C10"/>
from Delusion, and not true Conviction; and conseqently are themselves delusive and vain.</p>
               <p>But if the religious Affections that Persons have, do indeed arise from a strong Perswasion of the Truth of the christian Religion; their Affections are not the better, unless their Perswasion be a <hi>reasonable</hi> Perswasion or Conviction. By a reasonable Conviction, I mean a Conviction founded on real Evidence, or upon that which is a good Reason, or just Ground of Conviction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Men may have a strong Perswasion that the christian Religion is true, when their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is not at all built on Evidence, but altogether on Education, and the Opinion of others; as many <hi>Mahometans</hi> are strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the Truth of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, because their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Neighbours, and Nation believe it. That Belief of the Truth of the christian Religion which is built on the very same Grounds, with <hi>Mahometans</hi> Belief of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, is the same Sort of Belief. And tho' the Thing believed happens to be better; yet That don't make the Belief it self, to be of a better Sort: For tho' the Thing believed happens to be true; yet the Belief of it is not owing to this Truth, but to Education. So that as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is no better than the <hi>Mahometans</hi> Conviction; so the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that flow from it, are no better, in themselves, than the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Affections of <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if that Belief of christian Doctrines, which Persons Affections arise from, be not meerly from Education, but indeed from Reasons and Arguments which are offered, it will not from thence necessarily follow, that their Affections are truly gracious: For in order to that, it is requisite, not only that the Belief which their Affections arise from, should be a <hi>reasonable,</hi> but also a <hi>spiritual</hi> Belief or Conviction. I suppose none will doubt but that some natural Men do yield a Kind of Assent of their Judgments to the Truth of the christian Religion, from the rational Proofs or Arguments that are offered to evince it. <hi>Judas,</hi> without Doubt, thought <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> from the Things which he saw and heard; but yet all along was a Devil. So in <hi>John</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25. we read of <hi>many that believed in Christ's Name, when they saw the Miracles that he did;</hi> whom yet Christ knew had not that within them, which was to be depended on. So <hi>Simon the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer</hi> believed, when he beheld the Miracles and Signs which were done; but yet remained <hi>in the Gall of Bitterness, and Bond of Iniquity,</hi> Acts 8. 13, 23. And if there is such a Belief or Assent of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in some natural Men, none can doubt but that religious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may arise from that Assent or Belief; as we read of some who <hi>believed for a while,</hi> that were greatly affected, and <hi>anox, with Joy received the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis evident that there is such a Thing as a <hi>spiritual</hi> Belief or Conviction of the Truth of the Things of the Gospel, or a Belief
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:005767_0194_10270719732450D0"/>
that is peculiar to those who are spiritual, or who are regenerated, and have the Spirit of God, in his holy Communications, and dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them as a vital Principle. So that the Conviction they have, don't only differ from that which natural Men have, in its Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raicants, in that it is accompanied with good Works; but the Belief it self is diverse, the Assent and Conviction of the Judgment is of a Kind peculiar to those who are spiritual, and that which natural Men are wholly destitute of. This is evident by the Scripture, if any Thing at all is so; John 17. 8. <hi>They have believed that thou didst send me.</hi> Tit. 1. 1. <hi>According to the Faith of God's Elect, and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth which is after Godliness.</hi> John 16. 27. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi> 1 John 4. 15. <hi>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> Chap. 5. 1. <hi>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a <hi>spiritual Conviction</hi> of the Judgment is, we are naturally led to determine from what has been said already, under the former Head of a <hi>spiritual Understanding.</hi> The Conviction of the Judgment arises from the Illumination of the Understanding: The passing of a right Judgment on Things, depends on an having a right Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Idea of Things. And therefore it follows, that a spiritual Conviction of the Truth of the great Things of the Gospel, is such a Conviction, as arises from having a spiritual View or Apprehension of those Things in the Mind. And this is also evident from the Scripture, which often represents, that a saving Belief of the Reality and Divinity of the Things propos'd and exhibited to us in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is from the Spirit of God's enlightening the Mind, to have right Apprehensions of the Nature of those Things, and so as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiling Things, or revealing them, and enabling the Mind to view them and see them as they are: Luke 10. 21, 22. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast</hi> HID <hi>these Things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast</hi> REVEALED <hi>them unto Babes: Even so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, for so it seemed good in thy Sight. All Things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto me of my Father; and no Man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son will</hi> REVEAL <hi>him.</hi> John 6. 40. <hi>And this is the Will of him that sent me; that every one that</hi> SEETH <hi>the Son, and</hi> BELIEVETH <hi>on him, may have everlasting Life.</hi> Where it is plain, that true Faith arises from a spiritual Sign of Christ. And John 17. 6, 7, 8. <hi>I have</hi> MANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FESTED <hi>thy Name unto the Men which thou gavest me out of the World—Now they have known that all Things whatsoever thou hast given me, are of thee; for I have given unto them the Words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and known surely that I came out from thee, and they have deserved this thou didst send me.</hi> Where Christ's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing

God's Name to the Disciples, or giving them a true Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and View of divine Things, was that whereby they knew that Christ's Doctrine was of God, and that Christ himself was of him, and was sent by him. Matth. 16. 16, 17. Simon Peter <hi>said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered, and said unto him, Blessed art thou,</hi> Simon Bar-jona, <hi>for Flesh and Blood hath not</hi> REVEALED <hi>it unto thee, but my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 1 John 5. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in himself.</hi> Gal. 1. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Being mere exceedingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Traditions of my Fathers. But when it pleased God, who separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me from my Mother's Womb, and called me by his Grace, to</hi> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEAL <hi>his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Heathen, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately I conferred not with Flesh and Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be so, that That is a spiritual Conviction of the Divinity and Reality of the Things exhibited in the Gospel, which arises from a spiritual Understanding of those Things; I have shown already what that is, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sense and Taste of the divine, supream and holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Beauty of those Things. So that then is the Mind spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually convinced of the Divinity and Truth of the great Things of the Gospel, when that Conviction arises, either directly or remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from such a Sense or View of their divine Excellency and Glory as is there exhibited. This clearly follows from Things that have been already said; and for this the Scripture is very plain and express. 2 Cor. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that</hi> BELIEVE <hi>not, best the Light of the</hi> GLORIOUS GOSPEL <hi>of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and our selves your Servants for Jesus Sake. For God, who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give the</hi> LIGHT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY OF GOD, <hi>in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi> Together with the last Verse of the foregoing Chapter, which introduces this, <hi>But we all with open Face, beholding as in a Glass, the</hi> GLORY OF THE LORD <hi>are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Nothing can be more evident then that a saving Belief of the Gospel, is here spoken of, by the Apostle, as arising from the Mind's being enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to behold the divine Glory of the Things it exhibits.</p>
               <p>This View or Sense of the divine Glory, and unparallel'd Beauty of the Things exhibited to us in the Gospel, has a Tendency to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Mind of their Divinity, two Ways; <hi>directly;</hi> and more <hi>indirectly,</hi> and <hi>remotely.</hi> 1. A View of this divine Glory <hi>directly,</hi> convinces the Mind of the Divinity of these Things, as this Glory is in it self a direct, clear, and all-conquering Evidence of it; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005767_0196_1027071E81D33D48"/>
when clearly discovered, or when this supernatural Sense is given in a good Degree.</p>
               <p>He that has his Judgment thus <hi>directly</hi> convinced and assured of the Divinity of the Things of the Gospel, by a clear View of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Glory, has a <hi>reasonable</hi> Conviction; his Belief and Assurance is altogether agreable to Reason; because the divine Glory and Beauty of divine Things is in it self, real Evidence of their Divinity, and the most direct and strong Evidence. He that truly sees the divine, transcendent, supream Glory of those Things which are divine, does as it were know their Divinity intuitively; he not only argues that they are divine, but he sees that they are divine; he sees That in them wherein Divinity chiefly consists; for in this Glory, which is so vastly and inexpressibly distinguished from the Glory of artificial Things, and all other Glory, does mainly consist the true Notion of Divinity: God is God, and distinguished from all other Beings, and exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 'em, chiefly by his divine Beauty, which is infinitely diverse from all other Beauty. They therefore that see the Stamp of this Glory in divine Things, they see Divinity in them, they see God in them, and so see 'em to be divine; because they see that in them wherein the truest Idea of Divinity does consist. Thus a Soul may have a Kind of intuitive Knowledge of the Divinity of the Things exhibited in the Gospel; not that he judges the Doctrines of the Gospel to be from God, without any Argument or Deduction at all; but it is without any long Chain of Arguments; the Argument is but one, and the Evidence direct; the Mind ascends to the Truth of the Gospel but by one Step, and that is its divine Glory.</p>
               <p>It would be very strange, if any professing Christian should deny it to be possible that there should be an Excellency in divine Things, which is so transcendent, and exceedingly different from what is in other Things, that if it were seen, would evidently distinguish them. We can't rationally doubt, but that Things that are <hi>divine,</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the supream Being, are vastly different from Things that are <hi>humane;</hi> that there is a god-like, high, and glorious Excellency in them, that does so distinguish them from the Things which are of Men, that the Difference is ineffable; and therefore such, as, if seen, will have a most convincing, satisfying Influence upon any one, that they are what they are, <hi>viz.</hi> divine. Doubtless there is that Glory and Excellency in the divine Being, by which he is so infinitely distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all other Beings, that if it were seen, he might be known by it. It would therefore be very unreasonable to deny that it is possible for God, to give Manifestations of this distinguishing Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, in Things by which he is pleased to make himself known; and that this distinguishing Excellency may be clearly seen in them. There are <hi>natural</hi> Excellencies that are very evidently distinguishing of the Subjects or Authors, to any one who beholds them. How
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:005767_0197_1027072038BCDF30"/>
is the Speech of an understanding Man different from that of a little Child! And how greatly distinguished is the Speech of some Men of great Genius, as <hi>Homer, Cicero, Milton, Locke, Addison,</hi> and others, from that of many other understanding Men! There are no Limits to be set to the Degrees of Manifestation of mental Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that there may be in Speech. But the Appearances of the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Perfections of God, in the Manifestations he makes of himself, may doubtless be unspeakably more evidently distinguishing, than the Appearances of those Excellencies of Worms of the Dust, in which they differ one from another. He that is well acquainted with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and their Works, by viewing the Sun, may know it is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Work. And 'tis reasonable to suppose, that when Christ comes at the End of the World, in the Glory of his Father, it will be with such ineffable Appearances of Divinity, as will leave no Doubt to the Inhabitants of the World, even the most obstinate Infidels, that he who appears is a divine Person. But above all, do the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations of the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Glory of the divine Being (which is the proper Beauty of the Divinity) bring their own Evidence, and tend to assure the Heart. Thus the Disciples were assured that Jesus was the Son of God, for <hi>they beheld his Glory, as the Glory of the only Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</hi> John 1. 14. When Christ appeared in the Glory of his Transfiguration to his Disciples, with that outward Glory, to their bodily Eyes, which was a sweet and admirable Symbol and Semblance of his spiritual Glory, together with his spiritual Glory it self, manifested to their Minds; the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of Glory was such, as did perfectly, and with good Reason, assure them of his Divinity; as appears by what one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> says concerning it, 2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18. <hi>For we have not followed cunningly devised Fables, when we made known unto you the Power and Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his Majesty: For he received from God the Father, Honour and Glory; when there came such a Voice to him from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. And this Voice which came from Heaven, we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount.</hi> The Apostle calls that Mount, <hi>the holy Mount,</hi> because the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ which were there made to their Minds, and which their Minds were especially impress'd and ravished with, was the Glory of his <hi>Holiness,</hi> or the Beauty of his <hi>moral Excellency;</hi> or, as another of these Disciples, who saw it, expresses it, <hi>His Glory,</hi> as <hi>full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this distinguishing Glory of the divine Being has it's brightest Appearance and Manifestation, in the Things proposed and exhibited to us in the Gospel, the Doctrines there taught, the Word there spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the divine Counsels, Acts and Works there revealed. These Things have the clearest, most admirable, and distinguishing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:005767_0198_102707249C7EEFE8"/>
presentations and Exhibitions of the Glory of God's moral Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ever were made to the World. And if there be such a distinguishing, evidential Manifestation of divine Glory in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, 'tis reasonable to suppose that there may be such a Thing as Seeing it: What should hinder but that it may be seen? 'Tis no Argument that it can't be seen, that some don't see it; tho' they may be discerning Men in temporal Matters. If there be such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable, distinguishing, evidential Excellencies in the Gospel, 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to suppose that they are such as are not to be discerned, but by the special Influence and Enlightnings of the Spirit of God. There is need of uncommon Force of Mind to discern the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Excellencies of the Works of Authors of great Genius: Those Things in <hi>Milton,</hi> which to mean Judges, appear tasteless and Imperfections, are his inimitable Excellencies in the Eyes of those who are of greater Discerning, and better Taste. And if there be a Book, which God is the Author of, 'tis most reasonable to suppose that the distinguishing Glories of his Word are of such a Kind, as that the Sin and Corruption of Men's Hearts, which above all Things alienates Men from the Deity, and makes the Heart dull and stupid to any Sense or Taste of those Things wherein the moral Glory of the divine Perfections consists; I say, 'tis but reasonable to suppose, that this would blind Men from discerning the Beauties of such a Book; and that therefore they will not see them, but as God is pleased to enlighten them, and restore an holy Taste, to discern and relish divine Beauties.</p>
               <p>This Sense of the spiritual Excellency and Beauty of divine Things, does also tend <hi>directly</hi> to convince the Mind of the Truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as there are very many of the most important Things declared in the Gospel, that are hid from the Eves of natural Men, the Truth of which does in Effect consist in this Excellency, or does so immediately depend upon it and result from it; that in this Excellency's being seen, the Truth of those Things is seen. As soon as ever the Eyes are opened to behold the holy Beauty and Amiableness that is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, a Multitude of most important Doctrines of the Gospel, that depend upon it, (which all appear strange and dark to natural Men) are at once seen to be true. As for Instance, hereby appears the Truth of what the Word of God declares concerning the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil of Sin; for the same Eye that discerns the transcendent Beauty of Holiness, necessarily therein sees the exceeding Odiousness of Sin: The same Taste which relishes the Sweetness of true moral Good, tastes the Bitterness of moral Evil. And by this Means a Man sees his own Sinfulness and Loathsomness; for he has now a Sense to discern Objects of this Nature; and so sees the Truth of what the Word of God declares concerning the exceeding Sinfulness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which before he did not see. He now sees the dreadful Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:005767_0199_102707278F65E500"/>
of his Heart, and the desperate Depravity of his Nature, in a new Manner; for his Soul has now a Sense given it to feel the Pain of such a Disease: And this shows him the Truth of what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reveals concerning the Corruption of Man's Nature, his original Sin, and the ruinous undone Condition Man is in, and his need of a Saviour, his need of the mighty Power of God to renew his Heart and change his Nature. Men by seeing the true Excellency of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, do see the Glory of all those Things, which both Reason and Scripture shew to be in the divine Being; for it has been shown that the Glory of them depend on this: And hereby they see the Truth of all that the Scripture declares concerning God's glorious Excellency and Majesty, his being the Fountain of all Good, the only Happiness of the Creature, &amp;c. And this again shews the Mind the Truth of what the Scripture teaches concerning the Evil of Sin against so glorious a God; and also the Truth of what it teaches concerning Sin's just Desert of that dreadful Punishment which it reveals; and also concerning the Impossibility of our offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Satisfaction, or sufficient Attonement, for that which is so infinitely evil and heinous. And this again shews the Truth of what the Scripture reveals concerning the Necessity of a Saviour, to offer an Attonement of infinite Value for Sin. And this Sense of spiritual Beauty that has been spoken of, enables the Soul to see the Glory of those Things which the Gospel reveals concerning the Person of Christ; and so enables to see the exceeding Beauty and Dignity of his Person, appearing in what the Gospel exhibits of his Word, Works, Acts and Life: And this Apprehension of the superlative Dignity of his Person, shews the Truth of what the Gospel declares concerning the Value of his Blood and Righteousness, and so the infinite Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Offering he has made to God for us, and so its Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to attone for our Sins, and recommend us to God. And thus the Spirit of God discovers the Way of Salvation by Christ: Thus the Soul sees the Fitness and Suitableness of this Way of Salvation, the admirable Wisdom of the Contrivance, and the perfect Answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the Provision that the Gospel exhibits, (as made for us) to our Necessities. A Sense of true divine Beauty being given to the Soul, the Soul discerns the Beauty of every Part of the Gospel Scheme. This also shews the Soul the Truth of what the Word of God declares concerning Man's chief Happiness, as consisting in holy Exercises and Enjoyments. This shews the Truth of what the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel declares concerning the unspeakable Glory of the heavenly State. And what the Prophecies of the old Testament, and the Writings of the Apostles declare concerning the Glory of the Messiah's Kingdom, is now all plain; and also what the Scripture teaches concerning the Reasons and Grounds of our Duty. The Truth of all these Things revealed in the Scripture, and many more that might be mention'd,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:005767_0200_102707292A88CF28"/>
appear to the Soul, only by imparting that spiritual Taste of divine Beauty, which has been spoken of. They being hidden Things to the Soul before.</p>
               <p>And besides all this, the Truth of all those Things which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture says about experimental Religion, is hereby known; for they are now experienced. And this convinces the Soul that one who knew the Heart of Man, better than we know our own Hearts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew the Nature of Vertue and Holiness, was the Author of the Scriptures. And the opening to View, with such Clearness, such a World of wonderful and glorious Truth in the Gospel, that before was unknown, being quite above the View of a natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but now appearing so clear and bright, has a powerful and invincible Influence on the Soul, to perswade of the Divinity of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Unless Men may come to a reasonable solid Perswasion &amp; Conviction of the Truth of the Gospel, by the internal Evidences of it, in the Way that has been spoken, <hi>viz.</hi> By a Sight of it's Glory; 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that those who are illiterate, and unacquainted with History, should have any thorough and effectual Conviction of it at all. They may without this, see a great deal of Probability of it; it may be reasonable for them to give much Credit to what learned Men, and Historians tell 'em; and they may tell them so much, that it may look very probable and rational to them, that the christian Religion is true; and so much that they would be very unreasonable not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain this Opinion. But to have a Conviction, so clear, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and assuring, as to be sufficient to induce them, with Boldness, to fell all, confidently and fearlessly to run the Venture of the Loss of all Things, and of enduring the most exquisite and long-continued Torments, and to trample the World under Foot, and count all Things but Dung, for Christ; the Evidence they can have from His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, cannot be sufficient. It is impossible that Men, who have not something of a general View of the historical World, or the Series of History from Age to Age, should come at the Force of Arguments for the Truth of Christianity, drawn from History, to that Degree, as effectually to induce them to venture their all upon it. After all that learned Men have said to them, there will remain innumerable Doubts on their Minds: They will be ready, when pinched with some great Trial of their Faith, to say, <q>How do I know this, or that? How do I know when these Histories were written? Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men tell me these Histories were so and so attested in the Day of them; but how do I know that there were such Attestations then? They tell me there is equal Reason to believe these Facts, as any whatsoever that are related at such a Distance; but how do I know that other Facts which are related of those Ages, ever were?</q> Those who have not something of a general View of the Series of historical Events, and of the State of Mankind from

Age to Age, cannot see the clear Evidence from History, of the Truth of Facts, in distant Ages; but there will endless Doubts and Scruples remain.</p>
               <p>But the Gospel was not given only for learned Men. There are at least Nineteen in Twenty, if not Ninety-nine in an Hundred, of those for whom the Scriptures were written, that are not capable of any certain or effectual Conviction of the divine Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by such Arguments as learned Men make use of.

               <p>'Tis unreasonable to suppose, that God has provided for his People, no more than probable Evidences of the Truth of the Gospel. He has with great Care, abundantly provided, and given them, the most convincing, assuring, satisfying and manifold Evidence of his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in the Covenant of Grace; and as <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all Things and sure.</hi> Therefore it is rational to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that at the same Time, he would not fail of ordering the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so, that there should not be wanting, as great, and clear Evidence, <hi>that this is his Covenant,</hi> and that these Promises are his Promises; or which is the same Thing, that the christian Religion is true, and that the Gospel is his Word. Otherwise in vain are those great Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances he has given of his Faithfulness in his Covenant, by confirming it with his Oath, and so variously establishing it by Seals and Pledges. For the Evidence that it is his Covenant, is properly the Foundation on which all the Force and Effect of those other Assurances do stand. We may therefore undoubtedly suppose and conclude, that there is some Sort of Evidence which God has given, that this Covenant, and these Promises are his, beyond all meer Probability; that there are some Grounds of Assurance of it held forth, which, if we are not blind to them, tend to give an higher Perswasion, than any arguing from History, humane Tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Illiterate, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with History, are capable of; yea, that which is good Ground of the highest and most perfect Assurance, that Mankind have in any Case whatsoever; agreable to those high Expressions which the Apostle uses, Heb. 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw near in</hi> FULL ASSURANCE OF FAITH.

               <p>And if we come to Fact and Experience, there is not the least Reason to suppose, that One in an Hundred of those who have been sincere Christians, and have had a Heart to sell all for Christ, have come by their Conviction of the Truth of the Gospel, this Way. If we read over the Histories of the many Thousands that died Martyrs so; Christ, since the Beginning of the Reformation, and have chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully undergone extream Tortures, in a Confidence of the Truth of the Gospel, and consider their Circumstances and Advantages; how low of them were there, that we can reasonably suppose, ever came by their assured Perswasion, this Way; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Many of them were weak Women and Children, and the greater Part of them illiterate Persons, many of whom had been brought up in popish Ignorance and Darkness, and were but newly come out of it, and lived and died in Times, wherein those Arguments for the Truth or Christianity from Antiquity and History, been but very imperfectly handled. And indeed, 'tis but very lately that these Arguments have been set in a clear and convincing Light, even by learned Men themselves: And since it has been done, there never were fewer thorough Believers, among those who have been educated in the true Religion: Infidelity never prevailed so much, in any Age, as in this, wherein these Arguments are handled to the greatest Advantage.</p>
               <p>The true Martyrs of Jesus Christ, are not those who have only been strong in Opinion that the Gospel of Christ is true, but <hi>those that have seen the Truth of it;</hi> as the very Name of Martyrs or Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed (by which they are called in Scripture) implies.

And so all Nations will be ready positively to say this, when they shall behold his Glory at the Day of Judgment; tho' what will be universally seen, will be only his natural Glory, and not his moral and spiritual Glory, which is much more distinguishing. But yet, it must be noted, that among those who have a spiritual Sight of the divine Glory of the Gospel, there is a great Variety of Degrees of Strength of Faith, as there is a vast Variety of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Clearness of Views of this Glory: But there is no true and saving Faith, or spiritual Conviction of the Judgment, of the Truth of the Gospel, that has nothing in it, of this Manifestation of it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Evidence, in some Degree. The Gospel of the blessed God don't go abroad a begging for it's Evidence, so much as some think; it has its highest and most proper Evidence in it self. Tho' great Use may be made of external Arguments, they are not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but highly prized and valued; for they may be greatly service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to awaken Unbelievers, and bring them to serious Consideration, and to confirm the Faith of true Saints: Yea they may be in some Respects subservient <hi>to the begetting</hi> of a saving Faith in Men. Tho' what was said before remains true, that there is no spiritual Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Judgment, but what arises from an Apprehension of the spiritual Beauty and Glory of divine Things: For, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, this Apprehension or View has a Tendency to convince the Mind of the Truth of the Gospel, two Ways, either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly. Having therefore already observed how it does this directly, I proceed now</p>

2. To observe how a View of this divine Glory does convince the Mind of the Truth of Christianity, more indirectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It doth so as the Prejudices of the Heart against the Truth of divine Things are hereby removed, so that the Mind thereby has open to the Force of the Reasons which are offer'd. The Mind of Man is naturally full of Enmity against the Doctrines of the Gospel; which is a Disadvantage to those Arguments that prove their Truth, and causes them to loose their Force upon the Mind: But when a Person has discovered to him the divine Excellency of Christian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, this destroys that Enmity, and removes the Prejudices, and sanctifies the Reason, and causes it to be open and free. Hence is a vast Difference, as to the Force that Arguments have to convince the Mind. Hence was the very different Effect, which Christ's Miracles had to convince the <hi>Disciples,</hi> from what they had to convince the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:</hi> Not that they had a stronger Reason, or had their Reason more improved; but their Reason was sanctified, and those blinding Prejudices, which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> were under, were removed, by the Sense they had of the Excellency of Christ and his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It not only removes the Hindrances of Reason, but posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively helps Reason. It makes even the speculative Notions more lively. It assists and engages the Attention of the Mind to that Kind of Objects which causes it to have a clearer View of them, and more clearly to see their mutual Relations. The Ideas themselves, which otherwise are dim and obscure, by this Means have a Light cast upon them, and are impress'd with greater Strength; so that the Mind can better judge of them, as he that beholds the Objects on the Face of the Earth, when the Light of the Sun is cast upon them, is under grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Advantage to discern them, in their true Forms, and mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to see the Evidences of divine Wisdom and Skill in their Contrivance, than he that sees them in a dim Star light, or Twilight.</p>
               <p>What has been said, may serve in some Measure to shew the Nature of a spiritual Conviction of the Judgment of the Truth and Reality of divine Things; and so to distinguish truly gracious Affections from others; for gracious Affections are evermore attended with such a Conviction of the Judgment.</p>
               <p>But before I dismiss this Head, it will be needful to observe the Ways whereby some are deceived, with respect to this Matter; and take Notice of several Things, that are sometimes taken for a spiritual and saving Belief of the Truth of the Things of Religion, which are indeed very diverse from it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:005767_0205_1027073AED4084B8"/>
1. There is a Degree of Conviction of the Truth of the great Things of Religion, that arises from the common Enlightnings of the Spirit of God. That more lively and sensible Apprehension of the Things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with Respect to what is <hi>natural</hi> in them, such as natural Men have who are under Awakenings and common Illuminations, will give some Degree of Conviction of the Truth of divine Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they had before they were thus enlighten'd. For hereby they see the Manifestations there are, in the Revelation made in the holy Scriptures, and things exhibited in that Revelation, of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perfections of God, such as his Greatness, Power, and awful Majesty; which tends to convince the Mind, that this is the Word of a great and terrible God. From the Tokens there are of God's Greatness and Majesty in his Word and Works, which they have a great Sense of, from the common Influence of the Spirit of God, they may have a much greater Conviction that these are indeed the Word and Works of a very great invisible Being. And the lively Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Greatness of God, which natural Men may have, tends to make 'em sensible of the great Guilt, which Sin against such a God brings, and the Dreadfulness of his Wrath for Sin. And this tends to cause them more easily and fully to believe the Revelation the Scripture makes of another World, and of the extream Misery it threatens, there to be inflicted on Sinners. And so from that Sense of the great natural Good there is in the Things of Religion, which is sometimes given in common Illuminations, Men may be the more induced to believe the Truth of Religion. These Things Persons may have, and yet have no Sense of the Beauty and Amiableness of the moral and holy Excellency that is in the Things of Religion; and therefore no spiritual Conviction of their Truth. But yet such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions are sometimes mistaken, for saving Convictions, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections flowing from 'em, for saving Affections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The extraordinary Impressions which are made on the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of some Persons, in the Visions, and immediate strong Impulses and Suggestions that they have, as tho' they saw Sights, and had Words spoken to 'em, may, and often do beget a strong Perswasion of the Truth of invisible Things. Tho' the general Tendency of such Things, in their final Issue, is to draw Men off from the Word of God, and to cause 'em to reject the Gospel, and to establish Unbelief and Atheism; yet for the present, they may, and often do beget a confident Perswasion of the Truth of some Things that are revealed in the Scriptures; however their Confidence is founded in Delusion, and so nothing worth. As for Instance, if a Person has by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Agent, immediately and strongly impressed on his Imagination, the Appearance of a bright Light, and glorious Form of a Person seated on a Throne, with great external Majesty and Beauty, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:005767_0206_1027073D1D233E68"/>
some remarkable Words, with great Force and Energy; The Person who is the Subject of such an Operation, may be from hence confident, that there are invisible Agents, spiritual Beings from what he has experienced, knowing that he had no Hand himself in this extraordinary Effect, which he has experienced: And he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be confident that this is Christ, whom he saw and heard speaking: And this may make him confident that there is a Christ, and that Christ reigns on a Throne in Heaven, as he saw him; and may be confident that the Words which he heard him speak are true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—In the same Manner, as the lying Miracles of the Papists, may for the present, beget in the Minds of the ignorant deluded People, a strong Perswasion of the Truth of many Things declared in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus when the Images of Christ, in popish Churches, are on some extraordinary Occasions, made by Priest-craft to appear to the People as if they wept, and shed fresh Blood, and moved, and uttered such and such Words; the People may be verily perswaded that it is a Miracle wrought by Christ himself; and from thence may be confident there is a Christ, and that what they are told of his Death and Sufferings, and Resurrection, and Ascention, and present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World is true; for they may look upon this Miracle, as a certain Evidence of all these Things, and a Kind of occular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of them. This may be the Influence of of these lying Wonders for the present; tho' the general Tendency of them is not to convince that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, but finally to promote Atheism. Even the Intercourse which <hi>Satan</hi> has with Witches, and their often experiencing his immediate Power, has a Tendency to convince 'em of the Truth of some of the Doctrines of Religion; as particularly the Reality of an invisible World, or World of Spirits, contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Sadduces.</hi> The general Tendency of <hi>Satan'</hi>s Influences is Delusion: But yet he may mix some Truth with his Lies, that his Lies mayn't be so easily discover'd.</p>
               <p>There are multitudes that are deluded with a counterfeit Faith, from Impressions on their Imagination, in the Manner which has been now spoken of. They say they know that there is a God, for they have seen him; they know that Christ is the Son of God, for they have seen him in his Glory; they know that Christ died for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for they have seen him hanging on the Cross, and his Blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from his Wounds; they know there is a Heaven and a Hell, for they have seen the Misery of the damned Souls in Hell, and the Glory of Saints and Angels in Heaven, (meaning some external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, strongly impress'd on their Imagination;) they know that the Scriptures are the Word of God, &amp; that such &amp; such Promises in particular, are his Word, for they have heard him speak 'em to them, they came to their Minds suddenly and immediately from God, without their having any Hand in it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="199" facs="unknown:005767_0207_102707407415B5B0"/>
3. Persons may seem to have their Belief of the Truth of the Things of Religion greatly increased, when the Foundation of it is only a Perswasion they have received, of their Interest in 'em. They first, by some Means or other, take up a Confidence that, if there be a Christ and Heaven, they are their's; and this prejudices 'em more in favour of the Truth of 'em. When they hear of the great and glorious Things of Religion, 'tis with this Notion, that all these Things belong to them; and hence easily become confident that they are true: They look upon it to be greatly for their Interest that they should be true. 'Tis very obvious what a strong Influence Men's Interest and Inclinations have on their Judgments. While a natural Man thinks that, if there be a Heaven and Hell; the Latter, and not the Former, belongs to him; then he'll be hardly perswaded that there is a Heaven or Hell: But when he comes to be perswaded, that Hell belongs only to other Folks, and not to him; then he can easily allow the Reality of Hell, and cry out of others Senselessness and Sottishness in neglecting Means of Escape from it: And being confident that he is a Child of God, and that God has promised Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, he may seem strong in the Faith of it's Reality, and may have a great Zeal against that Infidelity which denies it.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to another distinguishing Sign of gracious Affections.</p>
               <p>VI. Gracious Affections are attended with <hi>evangelical Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Evangelical Humiliation is a Sense that a Christian has of his own utter Insufficiency, Despicableness, and Odiousness, with an answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Frame of Heart.</p>
               <p>There is a Distinction to be made between a <hi>legal</hi> &amp; <hi>evangelical</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. The Former is what Men may be the Subjects of, while they are yet in a State of Nature, and have no gracious Affection; the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is peculiar to true Saints: The Former is from the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Spirit of God, assisting natural Principles, and especially natural Conscience; the Latter is from the special Influences of the Spirit of God, implanting and exercizing supernatural and divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: The Former is from the Mind's being assisted to a greater Sense of the Things of Religion, as to their natural Properties and Qualities, and particularly of the natural Perfections of God, such as his Greatness, terrible Majesty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were manifested to the Congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> in giving the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> the Latter is from a Sense of the transcendent Beauty of divine Things in their moral Qualities: In the Former a Sense of the awful Greatness, and natural Perfections of God, and of the Strictness of his Law, convinces Men that they are exceeding sinful, and guilty, and exposed to the Wrath of God, as it will wicked Men and Devils at the Day of Judgment; but they don't see their own <hi>Odiousness</hi> on the Account
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:005767_0208_1027074575E32E68"/>
of Sin; they don't see the hateful Nature of Sin; a Sense of this is given in <hi>evangelical Humiliation,</hi> by a Discovery of the Beauty of God's Holiness and moral Perfection. In a <hi>legal Humiliation,</hi> Men are made sensible that they are little and nothing before the great and terrible God, and that they are undone, and wholly insufficient to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; as wicked Men will be at the Day of Judgment: But they have not <hi>an answerable Frame of Heart,</hi> consisting in a Disposition to abase themselves, and exalt God alone: This Disposition is given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in evangelical Humiliation, by overcoming the Heart, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's Inclination, by a Discovery of God's holy Beauty: In a legal Humiliation, the Conscience is convinced; as the Consciences of all will be most perfectly at the Day of Judgment: but because there is no spiritual Understanding, the Will is not bowed, nor the Inclination altered: This is done only in evangelical Humiliation. In legal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation Men are brought to despair of helping themselves; in Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, they are brought voluntarily to deny and renounce themselves: In the Former they are subdued and forced to the Ground; in the Latter, they are brought sweetly to yield, and freely and with Delight to prostrate themselves at the Feet of God.</p>
               <p>Legal Humiliation has in it no spiritual Good, nothing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true Vertue; whereas evangelical Humiliation is that wherein the excellent Beauty of christian Grace does very much consist. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Humiliation is useful, as a Means in order to Evangelical; as a common Knowledge of the Things of Religion is a Means requisite in order to spiritual Knowledge. Men may be legally humbled and have no <hi>Humility;</hi> as the Wicked at the Day of Judgment will be thoroughly convinced that they have no Righteousness, but are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether sinful, and exceeding guilty, and justly exposed to eternal Damnation, and be fully sensible of their own Helplessness, without the least Mortification of the Pride of their Hearts: But the Essence of evangelical Humiliation consists in such <hi>Humility,</hi> as becomes a Creature, in itself exceeding sinful, under a Dispensation of Grace; consisting in a mean Esteem of himself, as in himself nothing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contemptible and odious; attended with a Mortification of a Disposition to exalt himself, and a free Renunciation of his own Glory.</p>
               <p>This is a great and most essential Thing in true Religion. The whole Frame of the Gospel, and every Thing appertaining to the new Covenant, and all God's Dispensations towards fallen Man, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to bring to pass this Effect in the Hearts of Men. They that are destitute of this, have no true Religion, whatever Profession they may make, &amp; how high soever their religious Affections may be; Hab. 2. 4. <hi>Behold, his Soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him; but the Just shall live by his Faith: i. e.</hi> He shall live by his Faith on God's Righteousness and Grace, and not his own Goodness and Excellency.

               <p>As we would therefore make the holy Scriptures our Rule, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nature of true Religion, and judging of our own religious Qualifications and State; it concerns us greatly to look at this Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, as one of the most essential Things pertaining to true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Institutions, Book II. Chap. 2. § 11. says, <q>I was always exceedingly pleased with that Saying of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> The Foundation of our Philosophy is Humility,</q> and yet more pleased with that of <hi>Augustine,</hi> 
                     <q>As, says he, the Rhoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician, being asked, what was the first Thing in the Rules of Eloquence, he answered, Pronunciation; what was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Pronunciation; what was the third, still be answered, Pronunciation. So if you should ask me concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the christian Religion, I would answer, firstly, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, and thirdly, and forever, Humility.</q>
                  </note> This is the principal Part of the great christian Duty of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> That Duty consists in two Things, <hi>viz. First,</hi> In a Man's denying his worldly Inclinations, and in forsaking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all worldly Objects and Enjoyments; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his natural Self-exaltation, and renouncing his own Dignity and Glory, and in being emptied of himself; so that he does freely, and from his very Heart, as it were renounce himself, and annihilate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Thus the Christian doth, in evangelical Humiliation. And this Latter is the greatest and most difficult Part of Self-denial: Altho' they always go together, and one never truly is, where the other is
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:005767_0211_1027074D43CE8490"/>
not; yet natural Men can come much nearer to the Former than the Latter. Many <hi>Anchorites</hi> and <hi>Realases</hi> have abandon'd (tho' without any true Mortification) the Wealth, and Pleasures, and common En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the World, who were far from renouncing their own Dignity and Righteousness; they never denied themselves for Christ, but only sold one Lust to feed another, sold a beastly Lust to pamper a devilish One; and so were never the better, but their latter End was worse than their Beginning; they turn'd out one black Devil, to let in seven white ones, that were worse than the first, tho' of a fairer Countenance. 'Tis inexpressible, and almost inconceivable, how strong a self-righteous, self-exalting Disposition is naturally in Man; and what he will not do and suffer, to feed and gratify it; and what Lengths have been gone in a seeming Self-denial in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, by <hi>Essenes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by <hi>Papists,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects of Hereticks, and Enthusiasts, among professing Christians; and by many <hi>Mehometans;</hi> and by <hi>Phythagorean</hi> Philosophers, and others, among the Heathen: And all to do Sacrifice to this <hi>Meitch</hi> of spiritual Pride or Self-righteousness; and that they may have Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein to exalt themselves before God, and above their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures.</p>
               <p>That Humiliation which has been spoken of, is what all the most glorious Hypocrites, who make the most splendid Shew of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the World, and high religious Affection, do grosly fail in. Were it not that this is so much insisted on in Scripture, as a most essential Thing in true Grace; one would be tempted to think that many of the Heathen Philosophers were truly gracious, in whom was so bright an Appearance of many Vertues, and also great Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and inward Fervours and Elevations of Mind, as tho' they were truly the Subjects of divine Illapses and heavenly Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. <note n="*" place="bottom">Albeit the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> were thus famous for <hi>Judoic</hi> mysterious <q>Wisdom, and many moral, as well as natural Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet were they not exempted from Boasting and Pride.

Yea those of them that seem'd most modest, as the <hi>Academicks,</hi> who posess'd they knew nothing, and the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi> who greatly decried, both in Words and Habits, the Pride of others, yet even they abounded in the most notorious and visible Pride.

Whence <hi>Austin</hi> rightly judged all these philosophic Vertues, to be but splended Sins.</q>

'Tis true that many Hypocrites make great Pretences to Humility, as well as other Graces; and very often there is nothing whatsoever which they make a higher Profession of. They endeavour to make a great Shew of Humility in Speech and Behaviour; but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make bungling Work of it; tho' glorious Work in their own Eyes. They can't find out what a humble Speech and Behaviour is, or how to speak and act so that there may indeed be a Savour of christian Humility in what they say and do: That sweet humble Air and Mien is beyond their Art, being not <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> or naturally guided to a Behaviour becoming holy Humility, by the Vigour of a lowly Spirit within them. And therefore they have no other Way, many of them, but only to be much in declaring that they be humble, and telling how they were humbled to the Dust at such and such Times, and abounding in very bad Expressions which they use about themselves; such as, <hi>I am the least of all Saints, I am a poor vile Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I am not worthy of the least Mercy, or that God should look upon me! Oh, I have a dreadful wicked Heart! my Heart is worse than the Devil! Oh, this cursed Heart of mine,</hi> &amp;c. Such Expressions are very often used, not with a Heart that is broken, not with spiritual Mourning, not with the Tears of her that washed Jesus's Feet with her Tears, not as <hi>remembring and being confounded, and never opening their Mouth more, because of their Shame, when God is pacified,</hi> as the Expression is, Ezek. 16. 63. But with a light Air, with Smiles in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

There are many that are full of Expressions of their own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who yet expect to be looked upon as eminent and bright Saints by others, as their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>; and 'tis dangerous for any, so much as to hint the Contrary, or to carry it towards them any otherwise, than as if we looked upon 'em some of the chief of Christians. There are many that are much in crying out of their wicked Hearts, and then great Short-comings, and Unprofitableness, and speaking as tho' they looked on themselves as the meanest of the Saints; who yet, if a Minister should feriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and Unprofitableness, and falling so much short of many others; it would be more than they could digest: they would think themselves highly injured; and there would be Danger of a rooted Prejudice in 'em against such a Minister.</p>
               <p>There are some that are abundant in talking against <hi>legal Doctrines, legal Preaching,</hi> and a <hi>legal Spirit,</hi> who do but little understand the Thing they talk against. A <hi>legal Spirit</hi> is a more subtil Thing than they imagine, it is too subtil for them. It lurks, and operates, and prevails in their Hearts, and they are most notoriously guilty of it, at the same Time, when they are inveighing against it. So far as a Man is not emptied of himself, and of his own Righteousness and Goodness, in whatever Form or Shape, so far he is of a <hi>legal Spirit.</hi> A Spirit of Pride of a Man's own Righteousness, Morality, Holiness, Affection, Experience, Faith, Humiliation, or any Goodness whatsoever, is a legal Spirit. It was no Pride in <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, to be or a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Spirit: Because of his Circumstances, he might seek Acceptance by his own Righteousness. But a legal Spirit in a fallen sinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can be nothing else but spiritual Price; and reciprocally, a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually proud Spirit is a legal Spirit. There is no Man living that is lifted up with a Conceit of his own Experiences and Discoveries, and upon the Account of them glisters in his own Eyes, but what trusts in his Experiences, and makes a Righteousness of 'em; however he may use humble Terms, and speak of his Experiences as of the <hi>great Things God has done for him,</hi> and it may be calls upon others to glorify God for them; yet he that is proud of his Experiences, arrogates something to himself, as tho' his Experiences were some Dignity of his. And if he looks on them as his own Dignity, he necessarily thinks that God looks on 'em so too; for he necessarily Thinks his own Opinion of 'em to be true; and consequently judges that God looks on them as he does; and so unavoidably imagines that God
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:005767_0214_10270755904FACA8"/>
looks on his Experiences as a Dignity in him, as he looks on 'em himself; and that he glisters as much in God's Eyes, as he does in his own. And thus he trusts in what is inherent in him, to make him shine in God's Sight, and recommend him to God: and with this Encouragement he goes before God in Prayer; and this makes him expect much from God; and this makes him think that Christ loves him, and that he is willing to cloath him with his Righteousness; because he supposes that he is taken with his Experiences and Graces. And this is a high Degree of living on his own Righteousness; and such Persons are in the high Road to Hell. Poor deluded Wretches, who think they look so glistering in God's Eyes, when they are a Smoke in his Nose, and are many of 'em more odious to him, than the most impure Beast in <hi>Sed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m,</hi> that makes no Pretence to Religion! To do as these do, is to <hi>live upon Experiences,</hi> according to the true Notion of it; and not to do as those, who only make use of spiritual Experiences, as Evidences of a State of Grace, and in that Way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Hope and Comfort from 'em.</p>
               <p>There is a Sort of Men, who indeed abundantly cry down Works, and cry up Faith in Opposition to Works, and set up themselves very much as evangelical Persons, in Opposition to those that are of a legal Spirit, and make a fair Shew of advancing Christ and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Way of free Grace; who are indeed some of the greatest Enemies to the Gospel Way of free Grace, and the most dangerous Opposers of pure humble Christianity. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Take not every Opinion and Doctrine from Men or Angels, that bears a fair Shew of advancing Christ; for they may be but the Fruits of evangelical Hypocrisy and Deceit; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received themselves, may deceive others too; Matth. 7. 15. <hi>Beware of them, that came in Sheep's Cloathing;</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, Purity and Meekness of Christ and his People, <hi>but inwardly are Wolves,</hi> proud, cruel, censorious, <hi>speaking Evil of what they know not.

And do you think these Delusions will come out of the popish Pack, whose Inventions smell above Ground here? No, he must come, and will come with more evangelical, fine-spun Devices. It's a Rule observed amongst <hi>Jesuits,</hi> at this Day, if they would conquer Religion by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, never oppose Religion with a cross Religion; but set it against itself: So oppose the Gospel by the Gospel. And look, as Churches pleading for Works, had new invented de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Works; so when Faith is preached, Men will have their new Inventions of Faith. I speak not this against the Doctrine of Faith, where it is preached; but am glad of it: Nor that I would have Men content themselves with every Form of Faith; for I believe that most men's Faith needs confirming or trying. But I speak to prevent Danger on that Hand.</q>

There is a pretended great Humiliation, and being dead to the Law, and emptied of Self, which is one of the biggest and most elated Things in the World. Some there are, who have made great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Experience of a thoro' Work of the Law on their own Hearts, and of being brought fully off from Works; whose Conversation has favoured most of a Self-righteous Spirit, of any that ever I had Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to observe. And some who think themselves quite emptied of themselves, and are confident that they are abased in the Dust, are full as they can hold with the Glory of their own Humility, and lifted up to Heaven with an high Opinion of their Abasement. Their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is a swelling, self-conceited, confident, showy, noisy, assuming Humility. It seems to be the Nature of spiritual Pride to make Men conceited and ostentatious of their Humility. This appears in that first-born of Pride, among the Children of Men, that would be called <hi>His Holiness,</hi> even the Man of Sin, that exalts himself above all that is called God or is worshipped; he styles himself <hi>Servant of Servants;</hi> and to make a Shew of Humility, washes the Feet of a Number of poor Men at his Inauguration.</p>
               <p>For Persons to be truly emptied of themselves, and to be poor in Spirit, and broken in Heart, is quite another Thing, and has other Effects, than many imagine. 'Tis astonishing how greatly many are deceived about themselves as to this Matter, imagining themselves most humble, when they are most proud, and their Behaviour is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the most haughty. The Deceitfulness of the Heart of Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in no one Thing so much, as this of spiritual Pride and Self-Righteousness. The Subtilty of Satan appears in it's Height in his managing of Persons with Respect to this Sin. And perhaps one Reason may be, that here he has most Experience: He knows the Way of it's coming in; he is acquainted with the secret Springs of it; it was his own Sin.—Experience gives vast Advantage in leading Souls, either in Good or Evil.</p>
               <p>But tho' spiritual Pride be so subtil and secret and Iniquity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly appears under a Pretext of great Humility; yet there are two Things by which it may (perhaps universally and surely) be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and distinguished.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Thing is this; He that is under the Prevalence of this Distemper, is apt to think highly of his Attainments in Religion, as

               <p>But he whose Heart is under the Power of christian Humility, is of a contrary Disposition. If the Scriptures are at all to be relied on, such an one is apt to think his Attainments in Religion to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively mean, and to esteem himself low among the Saints, and one of the least of Saints. Humility, or true Lowliness of Mind, disposes Persons to think others better than themselves: Psal. 2. 3. <hi>In Lowliness of Mind, let each esteem others better than themselves.</hi> Hence they are apt to think the lowest Room belongs to them: and their inward Disposition naturally leads them to obey that Precept of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 10.

the Grace of God, that they are holier than other Saints, don't hinder their Forwardness to think so highly of their Holiness, being a sure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Pride and Vanity of their Minds. If they were under the Influence of an humble Spirit, their Attainments in Religion would not be so apt to shine in their own Eyes, nor would they be so much in admiring their own Beauty. The Christians that are really the most eminent Saints, and therefore have the most excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, <hi>and are greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, humble themselves as a little Child,</hi> Matth. 18. 4. Because they look on themselves as but little Children in Grace, and their Attainments to be but the Attainments of Babes in Christ, and are astonished at, and ashamed of the low Degrees of their Love, and their Thankfulness, and their little Knowledge of God. <hi>Moses</hi> when he had been conversing with God in the Mount, and his Face shone so bright in the Eyes of others, as to dazzle their Eyes, <hi>wist not that his Face shone.</hi> There are some Persons that go by the Name of high Professors, and some will own themselves to be high Professors; but eminently humble Saints, that will shine brightest in Heaven, are not at all apt to profess high. I don't believe there is an eminent Saint in the World that is a high Professor. Such will be much more likely to profess themselves to be the least of all Saints, and to think that every Saint's Attainments and Experiences are higher than his. <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luther,</hi> as his Words are cited by <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in his <hi>Display of the spiritual Antichrist,</hi> p. 143, 144. says thus, <q>So is the Life of a Christian, that he that has begun, seems to himself to have nothing; but strives and presses forward, that he may apprehend. Whence <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>I count not my self to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</hi> For indeed nothing is more pernicious to a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, than that Presumption, that he has already apprehended, and has no further Need of seeking. Hence also many fall back, and pine away in spiritual Security and Slothfulness. So <hi>Bernard</hi> says, <hi>To stand still in God's Way, is to go back.</hi> Wherefore this remains to him that has begun to be a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, to think that he is not yet a Christian, but to seek that he may be a Christian, that he may glory with <hi>Paul, I am not, but I desire to be;</hi> a Christian not yet finished, but only in his Beginnings. Therefore he is not a Christian, that is a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that is, He that thinks himself a finished Christian, and is not sensible how he falls short. We reach after Heaven, but are not in Heaven. Woe to him that is wholly renewed that is, that thinks himself to be so. That Man, without Doubt, has never so much as begun to be renewed, nor did he ever taste what it is to be a Christian.</q>

Such is the Nature of Grace, and of true spiritual Light, that they naturally dispose the Saints in the present State, to look upon their Grace and Goodness little, and their Deformity great. And they that have the most Grace and spiritual Light, of any in this World, have most of this Disposition. As will appear most clear and evident to any one that soberly and thoroughly weighs the Nature and Reason of Things, and considers the Things following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Grace and Holiness is worthy to be called little, that is, little in Comparison of what it ought to be. And so it seems to one that is truly gracious: For such an one has his Eye upon the Rule of his Duty; a Conformity to that is what he aims at; it is what his Soul strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and reaches after; and it is by that that he estimates and judges of what he does, and what he has. To a gracious Soul, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to one eminently gracious, <hi>that</hi> Holiness appears little, which is little of what it should be; little of what he sees infinite Reason for, and Obligation to. If his Holiness appears to him to be at a vast Distance from this, it naturally appears despicable in his Eyes, and not worthy to be mentioned as any Beauty or Amiableness in him. For the like Reason as a hungry Man naturally accounts that which is set before him, but a little Food, a small Matter, not worth mentioning, that is nothing in Comparison of his Appetite. Or as the Child of a great Prince, that is jealous for the Honour of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and beholds the Respect which Men shew him, naturally looks on that Honour and Respect very little, and not worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, which is nothing in Comparison of that, which the Dignity of his Father requires.</p>
               <p>But that is the Nature of true Grace and spiritual Light, that it opens to a Person's View the infinite Reason there is that he should be holy in a high Degree. And the more Grace he has, the more this is open'd to View, the greater Sense he has of the infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Glory of the divine Being, and of the infinite Dignity of the Person of Christ, and the boundless Length and Breadth, and Depth and Height, of the Love of Christ to Sinners. And as Grace encreases, the Field opens more and more to a distant View, 'till the Soul is swallowed up with the Vastness of the Object, and the Person is astonished to think how much it becomes him to love this God, and this glorious Redeemer, that has so loved Man, and how little he does love. And so the more he apprehends, the more the Smallness of his Grace and Love appears strange and wonderful: And therefore is more ready to think that others are beyond him. For wondring at the Littleness of his own Grace, he can scarcely believe that so strange a Thing happens to other Saints: 'Tis amazing to him, that one that is really a Child of God, and that has actually received the saving Benefits of that unspeakable Love of Christ, should love no more: And he is apt to look upon it as a Thing peculiar to himself, a strange
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:005767_0220_1027076B83310058"/>
and exempt Instance; for he sees only the outside of other Christians, but he sees his own inside.</p>
               <p>Here the Reader may possibly object, that Love to God is really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, in Proportion as the Knowledge of God is increased; and therefore how should an Increase of Knowledge in a Saint, make his Love apear less, in Comparison of what is known? To which I answer, that altho' Grace and the Love of God in the Saints, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the Degree of Knowledge or Sight of God; yet it is not in Proportion to the Object seen &amp; known. The Soul of a Saint, by having something of God open'd to Sight, is convinced of much more than is seen. There is something that is seen, that is wonderful; and that Sight, brings with it a strong Conviction of something vastly beyond, that is not immediately seen. So that the Soul, at the same Time, is astonished at it's Ignorance, and that it knows so little, as well as that it loves so little. And as the Soul, in a spiritual View, is convinced of infinitely more in the Object, yet beyond Sight; so it is convinced of the Capacity of the Soul, of knowing vastly more, if Clouds and Darkness were but removed. Which causes the Soul, in the Enjoyment of a spiritual View, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain greatly of spiritual Ignorance, and Want of Love, and long and reach after more Knowledge, and more Love.</p>
               <p>Grace and the Love of God in the most eminent Saints in this World, is truly very little in Comparison of what it ought to be. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the highest Love, that ever any attain to in this Life, is poor, cold, exceeding low, and not worthy to be named in Comparison of what our Obligations appear to be, from the joint Consideration of these two Things; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Reason God has given us to love him, in the Manifestations he has made of his infinite Glory, in his Word, and in his Works; and particularly in the Gospel of his Son, and what he has done for sinful Man by him. And 2. The Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is in the Soul of Man, by those intellectual Faculties which God has given it, of seeing and understanding these Reasons, which God has given us to love him. How small indeed is the Love of the most eminent Saint on Earth, in Comparison of what these Things jointly considered do require! And this Grace tends to convince Men of; and especially eminent Grace: for Grace is of the Nature of Light, and brings Truth to View. And therefore, he that has much Grace, apprehends much more than others, that great Height to which his Love ought to ascend; and he sees better than others, how little a Way he has risen towards that Height. And therefore, estimating his Love by the whole Height of his Duty, hence it appears astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly little and low in his Eyes.</p>
               <p>And the eminent Saint, having such a Conviction of the high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which he ought to love God, this shews him, not only the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ttleness of his Grace, but the Greatness of his remaining Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:005767_0221_1027076F114EE880"/>
In order to judge how much Corruption or Sin we have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us, we must take our Measure from that Height to which the Rule of our Duty extends: The whole of the Distance we are at from that Height, is Sin: For failing of Duty is Sin; otherwise our Duty is not our Duty; and by how much the more we fall short of our Duty, so much the more Sin have we. Sin is no other than Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greableness, in a moral Agent, to the Law, or Rule of his Duty. And therefore the Degree of Sin is to be judged of by the Rule: So much Disagreableness to the Rule, so much Sin, whether it be in <hi>Defect</hi> or <hi>Excess.</hi> Therefore if Men, in their Love to God, don't come up half way to that Height which Duty requires, then they have more Corruption in their Hearts than Grace; because there is more Goodness wanting, than is there; and all that is wanting is Sin: it is an abominable Defect; and appears so to the Saints, especially those that are eminent; it appears exceeding abominable to them, that Christ should be loved so little, and thanked so little for his dying Love; it is in their Eyes hateful Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>And then the Increase of Grace has a Tendency another Way, to cause the Saints to think their Deformity vastly more than their Goodness: It not only tends to convince them that their Corruption is much greater than their Goodness; which is indeed the Case: But it also tends to cause the Deformity that there is in the least Sin, or the least Degree of Corruption, to appear so great, as vastly to out-weigh all the Beauty there is in their greatest Holiness: For this also is indeed the Case. For the least Sin against an infinite God, has an infinite Hatefulness or Deformity in it; but the highest Degree of Holiness in a Creature, has not an infinite Loveliness in it: And therefore the Loveliness of it is as nothing, in Comparison of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the least Sin. That every Sin has infinite Deformity and Hatefulness in it, is most demonstrably evident; because what the Evil, or Iniquity, or Hatefulness of Sin consists in, is the violating of an Obligation, or the being or doing contrary to what we should be or do, or are obliged to. And therefore by how much the greater the Obligation is that is violated, so much the greater is the Iniquity and Hatefulness of the Violation. But certainly our Obligation to love and honour any Being, is in some Proportion to his Loveliness and Honourableness, or to his Worthiness to be loved and honoured by us; which is the same Thing. We are surely under greater Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to love a more lovely Being, than a less lovely: And if a Being be infinitely lovely or worthy to be loved by us, then our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to love him, are infinitely great: And therefore, whatever is contrary to this Love, has in it infinite Iniquity, Deformity and Unworthiness. But on the other Hand, with Respect to our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Love to God, there is not an infinite Worthiness in that. The Sin of the Creature against God, is ill-deserving and hateful in
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:005767_0222_10270775ECBFEAD8"/>
Proportion to the Distance there is between God and the Creature: The Greatness of the Object, and the Meanness and Inferiority of the Subject, aggravates it. But 'tis the reverse with Regard to the Worthiness of the Respect of the Creature to God; 'tis <hi>worthless,</hi> and not worthy, in Proportion to the Meanness of the Subject. So much the greater the Distance between God and the Creature, so much the less is the Creature's Respect worthy of God's Notice or Regard. The great Degree of Superiority, increases the Obligation on the Inferiour to regard the Superiour; and so makes the Want of Regard more hateful: But the great Degree of Inferiority dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes the Worth of the Regard of the Inferiour; because the more he is inferiour, the less is he worthy of Notice, the less he is, the less is what he can offer worth; for he can offer no more than himself, in offering his best Respect; and therefore as he is little, and little worth, so is his Respect little worth. And the more a Person has of true Grace and spiritual Light, the more will it appear thus to him; the more will he appear to himself infinitely deformed by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Sin, and the less will the Goodness that is in his Grace, or good Experience, appear in Proportion to it. For indeed it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it: It is less than a Drop to the Ocean: For finite bears no Proportion at all to that which is infinite. But the more a Person has of spiritual Light, the more do Things appear to him, in this Respect, as they are indeed. Hence it most demonstrably appears, that true Grace is of that Nature, that the more a Person has of it, with remaining Corruption, the less does his Goodness and Holiness appear, in Proportion to his Deformity; and not only to his past Deformity, but to his present Deformity, in the Sin that now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his Heart, and in the abominable Defects of his highest and most Affections, and brightest Experiences.</p>
               <p>The Nature of many high religious Affections, and great Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries (as they are called) in many Persons that I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, is to hide and cover over the Corruption of their Hearts, and to make it seem to them as if all their Sin was gone, and to leave them without Complaints of any hateful Evil left in them; (tho' it may be they cry out much of their past Unworthiness) a sure and certain Evidence that their Discoveries (as they call them) are Darkness and not Light. 'Tis Darkness that hides Men's Pollution and Deformity; but Light let into the Heart discovers it, searches it out in its secret Corners, and makes it plainly to appear; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that penetrating, all-searching Light of God's Holiness and Glory. 'Tis true that saving Discoveries may for the present hide Corruption in one Sense; they restrain the <hi>positive Exercises</hi> of it, such as Malice, Envy, Coveteousness, Lasciviousness, Murmuring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they bring Corruption to Light, in that which is privative, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no more Love, no more Humility, no more Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:005767_0223_1027077CE225F568"/>
Which Defects appear most hateful, in the Eyes of those who have the most eminent Exercises of Grace; and are very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome, and cause the Saints to cry out of their Leanness, and odious Pride and Ingratitude. And whatever positive Exercises of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at any Time arise, and mingle themselves with eminent acting of Grace, Grace will exceedingly magnify the View of them, and render their Appearance far more heinous and horrible.</p>
               <p>The more eminent Saints are, and the more they have of the Light <hi>of Heaven</hi> in their Souls, the more do they appear to themselves, at the most eminent Saints in this World do, to the Saints and Angel <hi>in Heaven.</hi> How can we rationally suppose the most eminent Saints on Earth appear to them, if beheld any otherwise, than covered over with the Righteousness of Christ, and their Deformities swallowed up and hid in the Coruscation of the Beams of his abundant Glory and Love? How can we suppose our most ardent Love and Praise appear to them, that do behold the Beauty and Glory of God with out a Veil? How does our highest Thankfulness for the dying Love of Christ appear to them, who see Christ as he is, who know? they are known, and see the Glory of the Person of him that died, and the Wonders of his dying Love, without any Cloud or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And how do they look on the deepest Reverence and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with which Worms of the Dust on Earth approach that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majesty, which they behold? Do they appear great to them, or so much as worthy of the Name of Reverence and Humility, in those that they see to be at such an infinite Distance from that great and holy God, in whose glorious Presence they are? The Reason why the highest Attainments of the Saints on Earth appear so mean to them, is because they dwell in the Light of God's Glory, and see God as he is. And it is in this Respect with the Saints on Earth, as it is with the Saints in Heaven, in Proportion as they are more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Grace.</p>
               <p>I would not be understood that the Saints on Earth have, in all Respects, the worst Opinion of themselves, when they have most of the Exercise of Grace. In many Respects 'tis otherwise. With Respect to the positive Exercises of Corruption, they may appear to themselves freest and best when Grace is most in Exercise, and worst when the Actings of Grace are lowest. And when they compare themselves with themselves, at different Times, they may know, when Grace is in lively Exercise, that 'tis better with them than it was before, (tho' before, in the Time of it, they did not see so much Badness as they see now); and when afterwards they sink again in the Frame of their Minds, they may know that they sink, and have a new Argument of their great remaining Corruption, and a <hi>rational</hi> Conviction of a greater Vileness than they saw before; and may have more of a Sense of Guilt, and a kind of <hi>legal</hi> Sense of their
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:005767_0224_10270781029D9610"/>
Sinfulness, by far, than when in the lively Exercise of Grace. But yet it is true, and demonstrable from the foremention'd Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Children of God never have so much of a <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Conviction of their Deformity; and so great and quick and abusing a Sense of their present Vileness and Odiousness, as when they are highest in the Exercise of true and pure Grace; and never are they so much disposed to set themselves low among Christians as then. And thus <hi>be that is greatest in the Kingdom,</hi> or most eminent in the Church of Christ, is the same <hi>that humbles himself,</hi> as the least Infant among them; agreeable to that great Saying of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
               <p>A true Saint may know that he has some true Grace: And the more Grace there is, the more easily is it known; as was observed and proved before. But yet it does not follow, that an eminent Saint is easily sensible that he is an eminent Saint, when compared with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.—I will not deny that it is possible, that he that has much Grace, and is an eminent Saint, may know it. But he won't be apt to know it: It won't be a Thing obvious to him: That he is better than others, and has higher Experiences and Attainments, is not a foremost Thought; nor is it That which, from Time to Time, readily offers it self: It is a Thing that is not in his Way, but lies far out of Sight: He must take Pains to convince himself of it: There will be need of a great Command of Reason, and a high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Strictness and Care in arguing, to convince himself. And if he be rationally convinced, by a very strict Consideration of his own Experiences, compared with the great Appearances of low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace in some other Saints, it will hardly seem real to him, that he has more Grace than they: And he'll be apt to lose the Conviction, that he has by Pains obtained: Nor will it seem at all natural to him to act upon that Supposition. And this may be laid down as an infallible Thing, <hi>That the Person who is apt to think that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as compared with others, is a very eminent Saint, much distinguished in christian Experience, in whom this is a first Thought, that rises of it self, and naturally offers it self; he is certainly mistaken; he is no emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint; but under the great Prevailings of a proud and self-righteous Spirit.</hi> And if this be habitual with the Man, and is statedly the prevailing Temper of his Mind, he is no Saint at all; he has not the least Degree of any true christian Experience; so surely as the Word of God is true.</p>
               <p>And that Sort of Experiences that appears to be of that Tendency, and is found from Time to Time to have that Effect, to elevate the Subject of them with a great Conceit of those Experiences, is certainly vain and delusive. Those supposed Discoveries that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally blow up the Person with an Admiration of the Eminency of his Discoveries, and fill him with Conceit, that now he has seen, and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:005767_0225_102707846B76B198"/>
knows more than most other Christians, have nothing of the Nature of true spiritual Light in them. All true spiritual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is of that Nature, 'that the more a Person has of it, the more is he sensible of his own Ignorance; as is evident by 1 Cor. 8. 2. <hi>He that thinketh he knoweth any Thing, he knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w. Agur</hi> when he had a great Discovery of God, and Sense of the wonderful Height of his Glory, and of his marvellous Works, and cries out of his Greatness and Incomprehensibleness; at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Time, had the deepest Sense of his bruitish Ignorance, and look a upon himself the most ignorant of all the Saints; Prov. 30. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Surely I am more brutish than any Man, and have not the Understanding of a Man: I neither learned Wisdom, nor have the Knowledge of the Holy. Who hath ascended up into Heaven, or descended? Who hath gathered the Wind in his Fists? Who hath bound the Waters in a Garment? Who hath established all the Ends of the Earth?</hi> What is his Name? <hi>And what is his Son's Name?</hi> If thou canst tell.</p>
               <p>For a Man to be highly conceited of his spiritual and divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is for him to be wise in his own Eyes, if any Thing is. And therefore it comes under those Prohibitions, Prov. 3. 7. <hi>Be not wise in thine own Eyes.</hi> Rom. 12. 16. <hi>Be not wise in your own Conceits.</hi> And brings Men under that Wo, Isai. 5. 21. <hi>Wo unto them that are wise in their own Eyes, and prudent in their own Sight.</hi> Those that are thus wise in their own Eyes, are some of the least likely to get Good of any in the World. Experience shews the Truth of that, Prov. 26. 12. <hi>Seest thou a Man wise in his own Conceit? There is more Hope of a Fool than of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this some may object, That the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> when we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he was in a holy Frame, speaks of his Knowledge as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently great, and far greater than that of other Saints, Psal. 119. 99, 100. <hi>I have more Understanding than all my Teachers: For thy Testimonies are my Meditation. I understand more than the Ancients: Because I keep thy Precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer two Things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is no Restraint to be laid upon the Spirit of God, (as to what he shall reveal to a <hi>Prophet,</hi> for the Benefit of his Church) who is speaking or writing under <hi>immediate Inspiration.</hi> The Spirit of God may reveal to such an one, and dictate to him, to declare to others, secret Things, that otherwise would be hard, yea impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to find out. As he may reveal to him Mysteries, that otherwise would be above the Reach of his Reason; or Things in a distant Place, that he can't see; or future Events, that it would be impossible for him to know and declare, if they were not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily revealed to him. So the Spirit of God might reveal to <hi>David</hi> this distinguishing Benefit he had received, by conversing much with God's Testimonies; and use him as his Instrument to record it for
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:005767_0226_1027078893405840"/>
the Benefit of others, to excite them to the like Duty, and to use the same Means to gain Knowledge. Nothing can be gathered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the natural Tendency of the <hi>ordinary</hi> gracious Influences of the Spirit of God, from that, that <hi>David</hi> declares of his distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge under the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Influences of God's Spirit, immediately dictating to him the divine Mind by Inspiration, and using <hi>David</hi> as his Instrument to write what he pleased for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Church; any more than we can reasonably argue, that it is the natural Tendency of Grace to incline Men to curse others, and wish the most dreadful Misery to 'em that can be thought of because <hi>David,</hi> under Inspiration, often curses others, and pray that such Misery may come upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not certain that the Knowledge <hi>David</hi> here speak of, is spiritual Knowledge, wherein Holiness does fundamentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. But it may be that greater Revelation which God made to him of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the Things of his future Kingdom, and the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more clear and extensive Knowledge that he had of the Mysteries and Doctrines of the Gospel, than others; as a Reward for his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Testimonies. In this, it is apparent by the Book of Psalms, that <hi>David</hi> far exceeded all that had gone before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Thing that is an infallible Sign of spiritual Pride, is Persons being apt to think highly of their Humility. False Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences are commonly attended with a counterfeit Humility. And it is the very Nature of a counterfeit Humility, to be highly conceited of it self. False religious Affections have generally that Tendency, especially when raised to a great Height, to make Persons think that their Humility is great, and accordingly to take much Notice of their great Attainments in this Respect, and admire them. But eminently gracious Affections (I scruple not to say it) are evermore of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tendency, and have universally a contrary Effect, in those that have them. They indeed make them very sensible what Reason there is that they should be deeply humbled, and cause 'em earnestly to thirst and long after it; but they make their present Humility, or that which they have already attain'd to, to appear small; and their remaining Pride great, and exceedingly abominable.</p>
               <p>The Reason why a proud Person should be apt to think his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility great, and why a very humble Person should think his Humility small, may be easily seen, if it be considered, That it is natural for Persons, in judging of the Degree of their own Humiliation, to take their Measure from that which they esteem their proper Height, or the Dignity wherein they properly stand. That may be great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in one, that is no Humiliation at all in another: Because the Degree of Honourableness or Considerableness, wherein each does
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:005767_0227_1027078BD0C17D60"/>
properly stand, is very different. For some great Man, to stoop to loose the Latchet of the Shoes of another great Man, his Equal, or to wash his Feet, would be taken Notice of as an Act of Abasement in him; and he being sensible of his own Dignity, would look upon it so himself. But if a poor Slave is seen stooping to unloose the Shoes of a great Prince, no body will take any Notice of this, as any Act of Humiliation in him, or Token of any great Degree of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Nor would the Slave himself, unless he be horribly proud, and ridiculously conceited of himself: And if he after he had done it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> should, in his Talk and Behaviour, shew that he thought his Abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment great in it, and had his Mind much upon it, as an Evidence of his being very humble; would not every Body cry out upon him, <q>Who do you think your self to be, that you should think this that you have done, such a deep Humiliation?</q> This would make it plain to a Demonstration, that this Slave was swolen with a high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Pride and Vanity of Mind, as much as if he declared in plain Terms, <hi>I think my self to be same great one.</hi> And the Matter is no less plain and certain, when worthless, vile and loathsome Worms of the Dust, are apt to put such a Construction on their Acts of Abasement before God, and to think it a Token of great Humility in them that they, under their Affections, can find themselves so willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themselves to be so and so mean and unworthy, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves as those that are so inferiour. The very Reason way such outward Acts, and such inward Exercises, look like great Abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such an one, is because he has a high Conceit of himself. Whereas if he thought of himself more justly, these Things would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear nothing to him, and his Humility in them worthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Regard; but would rather be astonished at his Pride, that one so infinitely des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable and vile, is brought no lower before God.—When he says in his Heart, <q>This is a great Act of Humiliation: It is certainly a Sign of great Humility in me, that I should feel thus, and do so;</q> his Meaning is, <q>This is great Humility for me, for such a one as I, that am so considerable and worthy.</q> He considers how low he is now brought, &amp; compares this with the Height of Dignity, on which, he in his Heart thinks he properly stands, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance appears very great, and he calls it all meer Humility, and as such admires it. Whereas, in him that is truly humble, and really sees his own Vileness and Loathsomness before God, the Distance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the other Way. When he is brought lowest of all, it does not appear to him, that he is brought below his proper Station; but that he is not come to it: He appears to himself, yet vastly above it: He longs to get lower, that he may come to it; but appears at a great Distance from it. And this Distance he calls Pride. And therefore his Pride appears great to him, and not his Humility. For altho' he is brought much lower than he used to be; yet it don't appear to
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:005767_0228_1027078EAE3963A8"/>
him worthy of the Name of Humiliation, for him that is so infinitely mean and detestable, to come down to a Place, which tho' it be lower than what he used to assume, is yet vastly higher than what is proper for him. As Men would hardly count it worthy of the Name of Humility, in a contemptible Slave, that formerly affected to be a Prince, to have his Spirit so far brought down, as to take the Place of a Nobleman; when this is still so far above his proper Station.</p>
               <p>All Men in the World, in judging of the Degree of their own and others Humility, as appearing in any Act of theirs, consider two Things; <hi>viz.</hi> the real Degree of Dignity they stand in; and the Degree of Abasement, and the Relation it bears to that real Dignity. Thus the complying with the same low Place, or low Act, may be an Evidence of great Humility in one, that evidences but little or no Humility in another. But truly humble Christians have so mean an Opinion of their own real Dignity, that all their Self-abasement, when consider'd with Relation to that, and compar'd with that, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very small to them. It don't seem to them to be any great Humility, or any Abasement to be made much of, for such poor, vile, abject Creatures as they, to lie at the Foot of God.</p>
               <p>The Degree of Humility is to be judged of by the Degree of <hi>Abasement,</hi> and the Degree of the <hi>Cause for Abasement:</hi> But he that is truly and eminently humble, never thinks his Humility great, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Cause. The Cause why he should be abased appears so great, and the Abasement of the Frame of his Heart so greatly short of it, that he takes much more Notice of his Pride than his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Every One that has been conversant with Souls under Convictions of Sin, knows that those who are greatly convinced of Sin, are not apt to think themselves greatly convinced. And the Reason is this: That Men judge of the Degree of their own Convictions of Sin by two Things jointly considered; <hi>viz.</hi> the Degree of Sense which they have of Guilt and Pollution, and the Degree of Cause they have for such a Sense, in the Degree of their real Sinfulness. 'Tis really no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of any great Conviction of Sin, for some Men to think themselves to be very sinful, beyond most others in the World; because they are so indeed, very plainly and notoriously. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a far less Conviction of Sin may incline such an one to think so than another: He must be very blind indeed not to be sensible of it. But he that is truly under great Convictions of Sin, naturally thinks this to be his Case. It appears to him that the Cause he has to be sensible of Guilt and Pollution, is greater than others have; and therefore he ascribes his Sensibleness of this, to the Greatness of his Sin, and not to the Greatness of his Sensibility. 'Tis natural for one under great Convictions to think himself one of the greatest of Sinners in Reality, and also that it is so very plainly and evidently;
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:005767_0229_10270793FA0CFE10"/>
for the greater his Convictions are, the more plain and evident it seems to be to him. And therefore it necessarily seems to him so plain and so easy to him to see it, that it may be seen without much Conviction. <hi>That</hi> Man is under great Convictions, whose Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is great in Proportion to his Sin. But no Man that is truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Convictions, thinks his Conviction great in Proportion to his Sin. For if he does, 'tis a certain Sign that he inwardly thinks his Sins small. And if that be the Case, <hi>that</hi> is a certain Evidence that his Conviction is small. And this, by the Way, is the main Reason, that Persons when under a Work of Humiliation, are not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it, in the Time of it.</p>
               <p>And as it is with Conviction of Sin, just so it is, by Parity of Reason, with Respect to Person's Conviction or Sensibleness of their own Meanness and Vileness, their own Blindness, their own Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and all that low Sense that a Christian has of himself, in the Exercise of <hi>evangelical Humiliation.</hi> So that in a high Degree of this, the Saints are never disposed to think their Sensibleness of their own Meanness, Filthiness, Impotence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be great; because it never appears great to them, considering the Cause.</p>
               <p>An eminent Saint is not apt to think himself eminent in any Thing; all his Graces and Experiences are ready to appear to him to be comparatively small; but especially his Humility. There is nothing that appertains to christian Experience, and true Piety, that is so much out of his Sight as his Humility. He is a thousand Times more quick-sighted to discern his Pride, than his Humility: <hi>That</hi> he easily discerns, and is apt to take much Notice of, but hardly discerns his Humility. On the contrary, the deluded Hypocrite, that is under the Power of spiritual Pride, is so blind to nothing as his Pride; and so quick-sighted to nothing, as the Shews of Humility that are in him.</p>
               <p>The humble Christian is more apt to find Fault with his own Pride than with other Mens. He is apt to put the best Construction on other's Words and Behaviour, and to think that none are so proud as himself. But the proud Hypocrite is quick to discern the Mote in his Brother's Eye, in this Respect; while he sees nothing of the Beam in his own. He is very often much in crying out of other's Pride, finding Fault with other's Apparel and Way of Living; and is affected ten Times as much with his Neighbour's Ring or Ribband, as with all the Filthiness of his own Heart.</p>
               <p>From the Disposition there is in Hypocrites to think highly of their Humility, it comes to pass that counterfeit Humility is forward to put forth it self to view. Those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

tells us it was with the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> Matth. 6. 16. But it is contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with true Humility: They that have it, are not apt to display their Eloquence in setting of it forth, or to speak of the Degree of their Abasement in strong Terms. <note n="‡" place="bottom">It is an Observation of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> in his excellent Treatise of the Canon of the new Testament, that the Evangelist <hi>Mark,</hi> who was the Companion of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and is supposed to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Gospel under the Direction of that Apostle: when he mentions <hi>Peter'</hi>s Repentance after his denying his Master, he don't use such strong Terms to set it forth as the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, He only uses these Words, <hi>When he thought thereon he wept,</hi> Mark 15. 72. whereas the other Evangelists say thus. <hi>He went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Math. 26. 75.

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have particularly and largely shewn the Nature of that true Humility that attends holy Affections, as it appears in it's Tendency to cause Persons to think meanly of their Attainments in Religion, as compared with the Attainments of others, and particularly, of their Attainments in Humility: And have shewn the contray Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of spiritual Pride, to dispose Persons to think their Attainments in these Respects to be great. I have insisted the longer on this Matter, because I look upon it a Matter of great Importance, as it affords a certain Distinction between true and counterfeit Humility; and also as this Disposition of Hypocrites to look on themselves better than others, is what God has declared to be very hateful to him, <hi>a Smoke in his Nose, and a Fire that burneth all the Day,</hi> Isai. 65. 5.

               <p>Let not the Reader lightly pass over these Things in Application to himself. If you once have taken it in, that it is a bad Sign for a Person to be apt to think himself a better Saint than others, there will arise a blinding Prejudice in your own Favour; and there will probably be need of a great Strictness of Self-Examination, in order to determine whether it be so with you. If on the Proposal of the Question, you answer, <hi>No, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you don't think yourself better than others on this very Account, because you imagine you think so meanly of your self. Han't you an high Opinion of this Humility? And if you answer again, <hi>No; I have not an high Opinion of my Humility; It seems to me I am proud as the Devil;</hi> Yet examine again, whether Self-conceit don't rise up under this Cover; whether on this very Account, that you think your self as proud as the Devil, you don't think your self to be very humble.</p>
               <p>From this Opposition that there is between the Nature of a true, and of a counterfeit Humility, as to the Esteem that the Subjects of them have of themselves, arises a manifold Contrariety of Temper and Behaviour.</p>
               <p>A truly humble Person, having such a mean Opinion of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Holiness, is <hi>poor in Spirit.</hi> For a Person to be poor in Spirit, is to be in his own Sense and Apprehension poor, as to what is in him, and to be of an answerable Disposition. Therefore a truly humble Person, especially one eminently humble, naturally behaves himself in many Respects as a poor Man. <hi>The Poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but the Rich answereth roughly.</hi> A poor Man is not disposed to quick and high Resentment when he is among the Rich: He is apt to yield to others, for he knows others are above him; he is not stiff and self-willed; he is patient with hard Fare; he expects no other than to be despised, and takes it patiently; he don't take it heinously that he is overlook'd, and but little regarded; he is prepar'd to be in low Place; he readily honours his Superiours; he takes Reproofs quietly; he readily honours others as above him; he easily yields to be taught, and don't claim much to his Understanding and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he is not over nice or humoursome, and has his Spirit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to hard Things; he is not assuming, nor apt to take much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but 'tis natural for him to be subject to others. Thus it is with the humble Christian. Humility is (as the great <hi>Mastricht</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it) <hi>a kind of holy Pusillanimity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man that is very poor is a Beggar; so is he that is poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. This is a great Difference between those Affections that are gracious, and those that are false: Under the former, the Person continues still a poor Beggar at God's Gates, exceeding empty and

                     </gap>,</hi> when he was in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Frame, having just been wrestling all Night with God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Blessing, honoured <hi>Esau,</hi> his false and persecuting Brother; Gen. 33. 14, 15.

So he called him <hi>Lord;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his Family to honour him in like Manner.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to describe the Heart and Behaviour of one that is governed by a truly gracious Humility, as exactly agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Scriptures, as I am able.</p>
               <p>Now it is out of such a Heart as this, that all truly holy Affections do flow. Christian Affections are like <hi>Mary'</hi>s precious Ointment, that she poured on Christ's Head, that filled the whole House with a sweet Odour. <hi>That</hi> was poured out of an <hi>Alabaster-Box;</hi> so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Affections flow out to Christ out of a <hi>pure Heart.</hi> That was poured out of a <hi>broken Box;</hi> 'till the Box was broken the Ointment
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:005767_0234_102707AA2CB8A390"/>
could not flow, nor diffuse it's Odour: So gracious Affections flow out of a <hi>broken Heart.</hi> Gracious Affections are also like those of <hi>Mary Magdaline</hi> (Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> at the latter End) who also pours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ointment on Christ, out of an Alabaster broken Box, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith the Feet of Jesus, when she had wash'd 'em with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head. All gracious Affections, that are a sweet Odour to Christ, and that fill the Soul of a Christian with an heavenly Sweetness and Fragrancy, are broken-hearted Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A truly Christian Love, either to God or Men, is a humble broken-hearted Love. The Desires of the Saints, however earnest, are humble Desires: Their Hope is an humble Hope; and their Joy, even when it is <hi>unspeakable, and full of Glory,</hi> is a humble, broken-hearted Joy, and leaves the Christian more poor in Spirit, and more like a little Child, and more disposed to an universal Lowliness of Behaviour.</p>
               <p>VII. Another Thing, wherein gracious Affections are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from others, is, that <hi>they are attended with a Change of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All gracious Affections do arise from a spiritual Understanding, in which the Soul has the Excellency and Glory of divine Things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to it, as was shewn before. But all spiritual Discoveries are transforming; and not only make an Alteration of the present Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, Sensation and Frame of the Soul; but such Power and Efficacy have they, that they make an Alteration in the very Nature of the Soul: 2 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>But we all, with open Face, beholding as in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Such Power as this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly divine Power, and is peculiar to <hi>the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> Other Power may make a great Alteration in Men's present Frames and Feelings; but 'tis the Power of a Creator only that can change the Nature, or give a new Nature. And no Discoveries or Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but those that are divine and supernatural, will have this supernatural Effect. But this Effect all those Discoveries have, that are truly divine. The Soul is deeply affected by these Discoveries, and so affected as to be transformed.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with those Affections that the Soul is the Subject of in its Conversion. The Scripture Representations of Conversion do strongly imply and signify a Change of Nature: such as <hi>being born again; becoming new Creatures; rising from the Dead; being renewed in the Spirit of the Mind; dying to Sin, and living to Righteousness; putting off the old Man, and putting on the new Man; a being ingrafted into a new Stock; a having a divine Seed implanted in the Heart; a being made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:005767_0235_102707B0974EACC0"/>
Therefore if there be no great and remarkable, abiding Change in Persons, that think they have experienced a Work of Conversion, vain are all their Imaginations and Pretences, however they have been affected. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>I would not judge of the whole Soul's coming to Christ, so much by sudden Pangs, as by an inward Bent. For the whole Soul, in affectionate Expressions and Actions, may be carried to Christ; but being without this Bent, and Change of Affections, is unfound.</q>

Indeed Allowances must be made for the natural Temper: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version don't entirely root out the natural Temper: These Sins which a Man by his natural Constitution was most inclined to before his Conversion, he may be most apt to fall into still.

               <p>As it is with spiritual Discoveries and Affections given at first Conversion, so it is in all Illuminations and Affections of that Kind, that Persons are the Subjects of afterwards; they are all <hi>transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> There is a like divine Power and Energy in them, as in the first Discoveries: And they still reach the Bottom of the Heart, and affect and alter the very Nature of the Soul, in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Degree in which they are given. And a Transformation of Nature is continued and carried on by them, to the End of Life, 'till it is brought to Perfection in Glory. Hence the Progress of the Work of Grace in the Hearts of the Saints, is represented in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a continued Conversion and Renovation of Nature. So the Apostle exhorts those that were at <hi>Rome, beloved of God, called to be Saints,</hi> and that were the Subjects of God's redeeming <hi>Mercies,</hi> to be <hi>transformed by the renewing of their Mind;</hi> Rom. 12. 1, 2. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you therefore by the Mercies of God, that ye present your Bodies, a living Sacrifice;—and be not conformed to this World; but be ye trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by the renewing of your Mind.</hi> Compared with Chap. 1. 7. So the Apostle writing to the <hi>Saints and Faithful in Christ Jesus,</hi> that were at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> (Eph. 1. 1.) and those who <hi>were once dead in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and Sins,</hi> but were now <hi>quickened, and raised up, and made to sit together in heavenly Places in Christ, and created in Christ Jesus unto good

Works, that were once far off, but were now made nigh by the Blood of Christ, and that were no more Strangers and Foreigners, but Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens with the Saints, and of the Houshold of God, and that were built together for an Habitation of God through the Spirit;</hi> I say, the Apostle writing to these, tells them, <hi>that he ceased not to pray for them, that God would give them the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ; the Eyes of their Understanding being enlightened, that they might know,</hi> or Experience, <hi>what was the exceeding Greatness of God's Power towards them that believe; according to the Working of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igher Power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead, and set him at his own right Hand in the heavenly Places,</hi> Eph. 1. 16, to the End. In this the Apostle has Respect to the glorious Power and Work of God in converting and renewing the Soul: As is most plain by the Sequel. So the Apostle exhorts the same Persons <hi>to put off the old Man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful Lusts; and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Spirit of their Minds; and put on the new Man, which after God, is created in Righteousness and true Holiness,</hi> Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>There is a Sort of high Affections that some have from Time to Time, that leave them without any Manner of Appearance of an abiding Effect. They go off suddenly; so that from the very Height of their Emotion, and seeming Rapture, they pass at once to be quite dead, and void of all Sense and Activity. It surely is not wont to be thus with high gracious Affections; <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Do you think the holy Ghost comes on a Man, as on <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> by immediate acting, and then leaves him; and then he has nothing?</q> 
                     <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Par. Part I. p. 126.</note> they leave a sweet Savour and Relish of divine Things on the Heart, and a stronger Bent of Soul towards God and Holiness. As <hi>Moses'</hi>s Face not only shone while he was in the Mount, extraordinarily conversing with God; but it continued to shine after he came down from the Mount. When Men have been conversing with Christ in an extraordinary Manner, there is a sensible Effect of it remains upon them; there is something remarkable in their Disposition and Frame, which if we take Knowledge of, and trace to its Cause, we shall find it is because they have been with Jesus; <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>VIII. Truly gracious Affections differ from those Affections that are false and delusive, in that they tend <hi>to,</hi> and are attended <hi>with</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Evidence of this in the Scripture, is very abundant. If we judge of the Nature of Christianity, and the proper Spirit of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by the Word of God, this Spirit is what may by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency be called <hi>the christian Spirit;</hi> and may be looked upon as the true, and distinguishing Disposition of the Hearts of Christians, as Christians. When some of the Disciples of Christ said something, thro' Inconsideration and Infirmity, that was not agreeable to such a Spirit, Christ told them that 'they knew not what Manner of Spirit they were of, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 55. implying that this Spirit that I am speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, is the proper Spirit of his Religion and Kingdom. All that are truly Godly, and real Disciples of Christ, have this Spirit in them; and not only so but they <hi>are of</hi> this Spirit; it is the Spirit by which they are so possess'd and govern'd, that it is their true and proper Character. This is evident by what the wise Man says, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 27. (having Respect plainly to such a Spirit as this) 'A Man of Understanding is of an excellent Spirit'; and by the particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription Christ gives of the Qualities and Temper of such as are truly Blessed, that shall obtain Mercy, and are God's Children and Heirs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 'Blessed are the Meek: For they shall inherit the Earth. Blessed are the Merciful: For they shall obtain Mercy. Blessed are the Peace-makers: For they shall be called the Children of God.' And that this Spirit is the special Character of the Elect of God, is manifest by <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12, 13. 'Put on therefore, as the Elect of God, holy and beloved, Bowels of Mercies, Kindness, Humbleness of Mind, Meekness, Long-suffering; forbearing one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another.' And the Apostle speaking of that Temper and Disposition which he speaks of as the most excellent and essential Thing in Christianity, and <hi>that</hi> without which none are true Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and the most glorious Profession and Gifts are nothing (calling this Spirit by the Name of Charity) he describes it thus; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5.) 'Charity suffereth long and is kind: Charity envieth not: Charity vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up; doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have it self unseemly; seeketh not her own; is not easily provoked; thinketh no Evil.' And the same Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. designedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the distinguishing Marks and Fruits of true christian Grace, chiefly insists on the Things that appertain to such a Temper and Spirit as I am speaking of, Verse 22, 23. 'The Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance.' And so does the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing true Grace, or <hi>that Wisdom that is from above,</hi> with that declared Design, that others who are of a contrary Spirit may not deceive themselves, and lie against the Truth, in professing to be Christians, when they are not, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 14,—17. 'If ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not against the Truth: This Wisdom descendeth not from above; but
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:005767_0240_102707C537666B38"/>
is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where Envying and Strife is, there is Confusion and every evil Work. But the Wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits.'</p>
               <p>Every Thing that appertains to Holiness of Heart, does indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Nature of true Christianity, and the Character of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; but a Spirit of Holiness as appearing in some particular Graces, may more especially be called the Christian Spirit or Temper. There are some amiable Qualities and Vertues, that do more especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Nature of the Gospel Constitution, and Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; because there is a special Agreeableness in them, with those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes which God has more remarkably manifested and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the Work of Redemption by Jesus Christ, that is the grand Subject of the Christian Revelation; and also a special Agreeableness with these Vertues that were so wonderfully exercised by Jesus Christ towards us in that Affair, and the blessed Example he hath therein set us: and likewise because they are peculiarly agreable to the special Drift and Design of the Work of Redemption, and the Benefits we thereby receive, and the Relation that it brings us into, to God and one another. And these Vertues are such as Humility, Meekness, Love, Forgiveness, and Mercy. These Things therefore especially belong to the Character of Christians, as such.</p>
               <p>These Things are spoken of as what are especially the Character of Jesus Christ himself, the great Head of the Christian Church. They are so spoken of in the Prophecies of the old Testament; as in that cited <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 5. 'Tell ye the Daughter of Sion, behold thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and fitting upon an Ass, and a Colt the Fole of an Ass.' So Christ himself speaks of 'em, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. 'Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in Heart.' The same appears by the Name by which Christ is so often called in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> THE LAMB. And as these Things are especially the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Christ; so they are also especially the Character of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Christians are Christlike: None deserve the Name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that are not so, in their prevailing Character. 'The new Man is renewed, after the Image of him that creates him, Col. 3. 10.' All true Christians 'behold as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same Image, by his Spirit, 2 Cor. 3. 18.' The Elect are all 'predestinated to be conformed to the Image of the Son of God, that he might be the First-born among many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,' Rom. 8. 29. 'As we have born the Image of the first Man, that is earthly, so we must also bear the Image of the heavenly: For as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly, 1 Cor. 15. 47, 48, 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

answering to Grace in Christ, such an Answerableness as there is between the Wax and the Seal; there is Character for Character: Such Kind of Graces, such a Spirit and Temper, the same Things that belong to Christ's Character, belong to their's. That Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition wherein Christ's Character does in a special Manner consist, therein does his Image in a special Manner consist. Christians that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by reflecting the Light of the Sun of Righteousness, do shine with the same Sort or Brightness, the same mild, sweet and pleasant Beams. These Lamps of the spiritual Temple, that are enkindled by Fire from Heaven, burn with the same sort of Flame. The Branch is of the same Nature with the Stock and Root, has the same Sap, and bears the same Sort of Fruit. The Members have the same Kind of Life with the Head. It would be strange if Christians should not be of the same Temper and Spirit that Christ is of; when 'they are his Flesh and his Bone, yea are one Spirit, 1 Cor. 6. 17. and live so, that it is not they that live, but Christ that lives in them.' A christian Spirit is Christ's Mark, that he sets upon the Souls of his People; his Seal in their Foreheads, bearing his Image and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. Christians are the Followers of Christ: And they are so, as they are obedient to that Call of Christ, 'Matth. 11. 28, 29. Come to me, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of Heart. They follow him as the Lamb; 'Rev. 14. 4. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.' True Christians are as it were cloathed with the meek, quiet, and loving Temper of Christ; for <hi>as many as are in Christ, have put on Christ.</hi> And in this Respect <hi>the Church is cloathed with the Sun,</hi> not only by being cloathed with his imputed Righteousness, but also by being adorned with his Graces; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. Christ the great Shepherd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Redemption of the Church by Christ from the Power of the Devil was typified of old, by <hi>David'</hi>s delivering the <hi>Lomb,</hi> out of the Mouth of the Lion and the Bear.</p>
               <p>That such Manner of Vertue as has been spoken of is the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Christian Spirit, or the Spirit that worketh in Christ and in his Members, and the distinguishing Nature of it, is evident by this, that <hi>the Dove</hi> is the very Symbol or Emblem, chosen of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it. Those Things are fittest Emblems of other Things, which do best represent <hi>that</hi> which is most distinguishing in their Nature. The Spirit that descended on Christ, when he was anointed of the Father, descended on him <hi>like a Dove.</hi> The Dove is a noted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Meekness, Harmlessness, Peace and Love. But the same Spirit that descended on the Head of the Church, descends to the Members. 'God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into their

Hearts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And if any Man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, Rom. 8. 9.' There is but one Spirit to the whole mystical Body, Head and Members, 1 Cor. 6. 17. Eph. 4. 4. Christ breathes his own Spirit on his Disciples, John 20. 22. As Christ was anointed with the holy Ghost, descending on him like a Dove, so Christians also 'have an Anointing from the holy One, 1 Joh. 2. 20, 27. And they are anointed with the same Oil; 'tis the same 'precious Ointment on the Head, that goes down to the Skirts of the Garments:' And on both it is a Spirit of Peace and Love: Psal. 133. 1, 2. 'Behold how good, and how pleasant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in Unity! It is like the precious Ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even <hi>Aaron'</hi>s Beard; that went down to the Skirts of his Garments.' The Oil on <hi>Aaron'</hi>s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had the same sweet and inimitable Odour, with that on his Head; the Smell of the same sweet Spices. Christian Affections, and a christian Behaviour, is but the flowing out of the Savour of Christ's sweet Ointments. Because the Church has a dove-like Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Disposition, therefore it is said of her that she has Dove's Eyes, Cant. 1. 15. 'Behold thou art fair, my Love; behold thou art fair: Thou hast Dove's Eyes.' And Chap. 4. 1. 'Behold thou art fair, my Love; behold thou art fair: Thou hast Dove's Eyes within thy Locks.' The same that is said of Christ, Chap. 6. 12. 'His Eyes are as the Eyes of Doves.' And the Church is frequently compared to a Dove in Scripture, Cant. 2. 14. 'O my Dove, that art in the Clefts of the Rock—.' Chap. 5. 2. 
'Open to me my Love, my Dove.' And Chap. 6. 9. 'My Dove, my Undefiled, is but one.' Psal. 68. 13. 'Ye shall be as the Wings of a Dove, cover'd with Silver, and her Feathers with yellow Gold.' And 74. 13. 'O deliver not the Soul of thy Turtle-Dove unto the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Wicked.' The Dove that <hi>Neah</hi> sent out of the Ark, that could find no Rest for the Sole of her Foot, 'till she returned, was a Type of a true Saint.</p>
               <p>Meekness is so much the Character of the Saints, that <hi>the Meek</hi> and <hi>the Godly,</hi> are used as synonymous Terms in Scripture: So Psal. 37. 10, 11. the Wicked and the Meek are set in Opposition one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Wicked and Godly. 'Yet a little While, and the Wicked shall not be—but the Meek shall inherit the Earth.' So Psal. 147. 6. 'The Lord lifteth up the Meek: He casteth the Wicked down to the Ground.'</p>
               <p>'Tis doubtless very much on this Account, that Christ represents all his Disciples, all the Heirs of Heaven, as little Children, Matth. 19. 14. 'Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.' Matth. 10. 42. 'Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones, a Cup of cold Water, in the Name of a Disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise loose his Reward.' Matth. 18. 6. 'Whoso shall
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:005767_0243_102707D3D4B7D928"/>
offend one of these little ones, &amp;c. Ver. 10. Take heed that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise not one of these little ones. Ver. 14. It is not the Will of your Father which is in Heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.' John 13. 33. 'Little Children, yet a little while am I with you.' Little Children are innocent and harmless: They don't do a great deal of Mischief in the World: Men need not be afraid of them: They are no dangerous Sort of Persons: Their Anger don't last long: They don't lay up Injuries in high Resentment, entertaining deep and rooted Malice. So Christians, in Malice, are Children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. Little Children are not guileful and deceitful; but plain and simple: They are not versed in the Arts of Fiction and Deceit; and are Strangers to artful Disguises. They are yieldable and flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not wilful and obstinate; don't trust to their own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but rely on the Instructions of Parents, and others of superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Understanding. Here is therefore a fit and lively Emblem of the Followers of the Lamb. Persons being thus like little Children, is not only a Thing highly commendable, and what Christians approve of, and aim at, and which some of extraordinary Proficiency do attain to; but it is their universal Character, and absolutely necessary in order to entring into the Kingdom of Heaven; unless Christ was mistaken; Matth. 18. 3. 'Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.' Mark 10. 15. 'Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he shall not enter therein.</p>
               <p>But here some may be ready to say, Is there no such Thing as christian Fortitude, and Boldness for Christ, being good Soldiers in the christian Warfare, and coming out bold against the Enemies of Christ and his People?</p>
               <p>To which I answer, There doubtless is such a Thing. The whole christian Life is compared to a Warfare, and fitly so. And the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Christians are the best Soldiers, endowed with the greatest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of christian Fortitude. And it is the Duty of God's People to be stedfast, and vigorous in their Opposition to the Designs and Ways of such, as are endeavouring to overthrow the Kingdom of Christ, and the Interest of Religion. But yet many Persons seem to be quite mistaken concerning the Nature of christian Fortitude. 'Tis an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diverse Thing from a brutal Fierceness, or the Boldness of Beasts of Prey. True christian Fortitude consists in Strength of Mind, through Grace, exerted in two Things; In ruling and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the <hi>evil,</hi> and unruly Passions and Affections of the Mind; and in stedfastly and freely exerting, and following <hi>good</hi> Affections and Dispositions, without being hindred by sinful Fear, or the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Enemies. But the Passions that are restrained and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the Exercise of this christian Strength and Fortitude, are those
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:005767_0244_102707DAB80E6EF0"/>
very Passions that are vigorously and violently exerted, in a false Boldness for Christ. And those Affections that are vigorously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in true Fortitude, are those christian holy Affections, that are directly contrary to 'em. Tho' christian Fortitude appears, in withstanding and counteracting the Enemies that are without us; yet it much more appears, in resisting and suppressing the Enemies that are within us; because they are our worst and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Enemies, and have greatest Advantage against us. The Strength of the good Soldier of Jesus Christ, appears in nothing more, than in stedfastly maintaining the holy Calm, Meekness, Sweetness, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of his Mind, amidst all the Storms, Injuries, strange Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and surprizing Acts and Events of this evil and unreasonable World. The Scripture seems to intimate that true Fortitude consists chiefly in this, Prov. 16. 32. 'He that is flow to Anger, is better than the Mighty; and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.'</p>
               <p>The directest and surest Way in the World, to make a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what a holy Fortitude is, in fighting with God's Enemies; is to look to the Captain of all God's Hosts, and our great Leader and Example; and see wherein his Fortitude &amp; Valour appeared, in his chief Conflict, and in the Time of the greatest Battle that ever was, or ever will be fought with these Enemies, when he fought with them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and of the People there was none with him, and exercised his Fortitude in the highest Degree that ever he did, and got that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victory that will be celebrated in the Praises and Triumphs of all the Hosts of Heaven, throughout all Eternity: even to Jesus Christ in the Time of his last Sufferings; when his Enemies in Earth and Hell made their most violent Attack upon him, compassing him round on every Side, like renting and roaring Lions. Doubtless here we shall see the Fortitude of a holy Warriour and Champion in the Cause of God, in it's highest Perfection and greatest Lustre, and an Example fit for the Soldiers to follow, that fight under this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But how did he show his holy Boldness and Valour at that Time? Not in the Exercise of any fiery Passions; not in fierce and violent Speeches, and vehemently declaiming against, and crying out of the intolerable Wickedness of Opposers, giving 'em their own in plain Terms; but in not opening his Mouth when afflicted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, in going as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before his Shearers, is dumb, not opening his Mouth; praying that the Father would forgive his cruel Enemies, because they knew not what they did; not shedding others Blood; but with all-conquering Patience and Love, shedding his own. Indeed one of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that made a forward Pretence to <hi>Boldness for Christ,</hi> and confidently declared he would sooner die with Christ than deny him, began to lay about him with a Sword: But Christ meekly rebukes him, and heals the Wound he gives. And never was

was the Patience, Meekness, Love, and Forgiveness of Christ, in so glorious a Manifestation, as at that Time. Never did he appear so much a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and never did he shew so much of the <hi>dove-like</hi> Spirit, as at that Time. If therefore we see any of the Followers of Christ, in the midst of the most violent, unreasonable and wicked Opposition, of God's and his own Enemies, maintaining under all this Temptation, the Humility. Quietness, and Gentleness of a Lamb, and the Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness, and Love, and Sweetness of a Dove, we may well judge that here is a good Soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>When Persons are fierce and violent, and exert their sharp and bitter Passions, it shows Weakness, instead of Strength and Fortitude. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. at the Beginning, 'And I Brethren, could not speak unto you, as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, even as unto Babes in Christ.—For ye are yet Carnal: For whereas there is among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. Envying and Strife, and Divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk to Men?.'</p>
               <p>There is a pretended Boldness for Christ that arises from no better Principle than Pride. A Man may be forward to expose himself to the Dislike of the World, and even to provoke their Displeasure, out of Pride. For 'tis the Nature of spiritual Pride to cause Men to seek Distinction and Singularity; and so oftentimes to set themselves at War with those that they call carnal, that they may be more highly exalted among their Party. True Boldness for Christ is universal, and overcomes all, and carries 'em above the Displeasure of Friends and Foes; so that they will forsake all rather than Christ; and will rather offend all Parties, and be thought meanly of by all, than offend Christ. And that Duty which tries whether a Man is willing to be despised by them that are of his own Party, and thought the least worthy to be regarded by them, is a much more proper Trial of his Boldness for Christ, than his being forward to expose himself to the Reproach of Opposers. The Apostle sought not Glory, not only of Heathens and <hi>Jews,</hi> but of Christians; as he declares, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 26. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> speaking of Hypocrites affecting Applause, says; 'hence Men forsake their Friends, and trample under Foot the Scorns of the World: They have Credit elsewhere. To maintain their Interest in the Love of godly Men, they will suffer much.' Parable of the ten Virgins, Part I. p. 180.</note> He is bold for Christ, that has christian Fortitude enough, to confess his Fault openly, when he has committed one that requires it, and as it were to come down upon his Knees before Opposers. Such Things as these are a vastly greater Evidence of holy Boldness, than resolutely and fiercely confronting Opposers.</p>

As some are much mistaken concerning the Nature of true <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for Christ, so they are concerning christian <hi>Zeal.</hi> 'Tis indeed a Flame, but a sweet One: Or rather it is the Heat and Fervour of a sweet Flame. For the Flame of which it is the Heat, is no other than that of divine Love, or christian Charity; which is the sweetest and most benevolent Thing that is, or can be, in the Heart of Man or Angel. Zeal is the Fervour of this Flame, as it ardently and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously goes out towards the Good that is it. Object, in Desires of it, and Pursuit after it; and so consequentially, in Opposition to the Evil that is contrary to it, and impedes it. There is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vigorous Opposition, that is a Part of it, or rather as an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of it; but it is against <hi>Things,</hi> and not <hi>Persons.</hi> Bitterness against the <hi>Persons</hi> of Men is no Part of it, but is very contrary to it; insomuch that so much the warmer true Zeal is, and the higher it is raised, so much the further are Persons from such Bitterness, and so much fuller of Love, both to the Evil and to the Good. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what has been just now observed, that it is no other, in its very Nature and Essence, than the Fervour of a Spirit of christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And as to what Opposition there is in it, to <hi>Things,</hi> it is firstly and chiefly against the <hi>evil Things</hi> in the Person himself, who has this Zeal; against the Enemies of God and Holiness, that are in his own Heart; (as these are most in his View, and what he is most to do with;) and but secondarily against the Sins of others. And therefore there is nothing in a true christian Zeal, that is contrary to that Spirit of Meekness, Gentleness and Love, that Spirit of a little Child, a Lamb and Dove, that has been spoken of; but it is entirely agreeable to it, and tends to promote it.</p>
               <p>But to say something particularly concerning this christian Spirit I have been speaking of, as exercised in these three Things, <hi>Forgiveness, Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> I would observe that the Scripture is very clear and express concerning the absolute Necessity of each of these, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temper and Character of every Christian.</p>
               <p>It is so as to a <hi>forgiving Spirit,</hi> or a Disposition to overlook and forgive Injuries. Christ gives it to us both as a negative and positive Evidence; and is express in teaching us, that if we are of such a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 'tis a Sign we are in a State of Forgiveness and Favour our selves; and that if we are not of such a Spirit, we are not forgiven of God; and seems to take special Care that we should take good Notice of it, and always bear it on our Minds. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 12, 14, 15. 'For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors.—For if ye forgive Men their Trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not Men their Trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your Trespasses.' Christ expresses the same again at another Time, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 25, 26. and again in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 22, to the End, in the Parable of the Servant that owed his Lord ten thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:005767_0247_102707E847E0FF90"/>
that would not forgive his fellow Servant an hundred Pence; and therefore was delivered to the Tormentors. In the Application of the Parable Christ says, Verse 35. 'So likewise shall my heavenly Father do, if ye from your Heart forgive not every one his Brother their Trespasses.</p>
               <p>And that all true Saints are of a <hi>loving,</hi> benevolent and beneficent Temper, the Scripture is very plain and abundant. Without it the Apostle tells us, 'Tho' we should speak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, we are as a sounding Brass or a tinkling Cymbal: And that tho' we have the Gift of Prophecy, and understand all Mysteries, and all Knowledge; yet without this Spirit we are nothing.' And there is no one Virtue or Disposition of the Mind, that is so often, and so expresly insisted on, in the Marks that are lain down in the new Testament, whereby to know true Christians. 'Tis often given as a Sign that is peculiarly distinguishing, by which all may know Christ's Disciples, and by which they may know themselves: And is often laid down, both as a negative and positive Evidence. Christ calls the Law of Love, by way of Eminency, <hi>his Commandment,</hi> John 13. 34. 'A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. And Chap. 15. 12. 'This is <hi>my Commandment,</hi> that ye love one another as I have loved you.' And Verse 17. 'These Things I command you, that ye love one another.' And says, Chap. 13. 35. 'By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.' And Chap. 14. 21. (still with a special Reference to this which he calls <hi>his</hi> Commandment) 'He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.' The beloved Disciple, who had so much of this sweet Temper himself, abundantly insists on it, in his Episties. There is none of the Apostles, is so much in laying down express Signs of Grace, for Professors to try themselves by, as he; and in his Signs, he insists scarcely on any Thing else, but a Spirit of christian Love, and an agreable Practice; 1 John 2. 9, 10. 'He that saith he is in the Light, and hateth his Brother, is in Darkness even until now. He that loveth his Brother abideth in the Light, and there is none Occasion of Stumbling in him.' Chap. 3. 14. 'We know that we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother abideth in Death.' Verse 18, 19. 'My little Children, let us not love in Word and in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth. And hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts before him.' Verse 23, 24. 'This is his Commandment, that we should love one another. And he that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him: And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. Chap. 4. 7, 8. 'Beloved, let us love one another; for Love is of God; and every one that
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:005767_0248_102707ED04F0F420"/>
loveth is born of God, and knoweth God: He that loveth not, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God; for God is Love.' Verse 12, 13. 'No Man hath seen God at any Time: If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his Love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, because he hath given us of his Spirit.' Verse 16. 'God is Love: And he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.' Verse 20. 'If a Man say, I love God, and hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a Liar: For he that loveth not his Brother that he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?'</p>
               <p>And the Scripture is as plain as it is possible it should be, that none are true Saints, but those whose true Character it is, that they are of a Disposition to <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> their Fellow-creatures, that are poor, indigent and afflicted; Psal. 37. 21. 'The Righteous sheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and giveth.' Ver. 26. 'He is ever merciful, and lendeth.' Psal. 112. 5. 'A good Man sheweth Favour, and lendeth.' V. 9. 'He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the Poor.' Prov. 14. 31. 'He that honoureth God, hath Mercy on the Poor.' Prov. 21. 26. 'The Righteous giveth, and spareth not.' Jer. 22. 16. 'He judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cause of the Poor and Needy: Then it was well with him: Was not this to know me, saith the Lord?' Jam. 1. 27. 'Pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction, &amp;c.' Hos. 6. 6. 'For I desired Mercy, and not Sacrifice; and the Knowledge of God, more than Burnt-Offerings.' Matth. 5. 7. 'Blessed are the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, for they shall obtain Mercy.' 2 Cor. 8. 8. 'I speak not by Commandment, but by Occasion of the Forwardness of others, and to prove the Sincerity of your Love.' Jam. 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. 'For he shall have Judgment without Mercy, that hath shewed no Mercy.—What doth it profit my Brethren, tho' a Man faith he hath Faith, and have not Works? Can Faith save him? If a Brother or Sister be naked, and destitute of daily Food, and one of you say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, depart in Peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those Things which are needful for the Body; what doth it profit?' 1 John 3. 17. 'Whoso hath this Worlds Goods, and seeth his Brother have Need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? Christ in that Description he gives us of the Day of Judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. (which is the most particular that we have in all the Bible) represents that Judgment will be pass'd at that Day, according as Men have been found to have been of a merciful Spirit and Practice, or otherwise. Christ's Design in giving such a Description of the Process of that Day, is plainly to possess all his Followers with that Apprehension, that unless this was their Spirit and Practice, there was no Hope of their being accepted and own'd by him, at that Day. Therefore this is an Apprehension that we ought to be possess'd with. We find
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:005767_0249_102707F2615752F8"/>
in Scripture that a <hi>righteous Man,</hi> and a <hi>merciful Man</hi> are synonimous Expressions; Isai. 57. 1. 'The <hi>Righteous</hi> perisheth, and no Man layeth it to Heart; and the <hi>merciful Men</hi> are taken away, none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the <hi>Righteous</hi> is taken away from the Evil to come.'</p>
               <p>Thus we see how full, clear and abundant, the Evidence from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, that those who are truly gracious, are under the Government of that lamb-like, dove-like Spirit of Jesus Christ. And that this is essentially &amp; eminently the Nature of the saving Grace of the Gospel, and the proper Spirit of true Christianity. We may therefore undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine that all truly christian Affections are attended with such a Spirit; and that this is the natural Tendency of the Fear and Hope, the Sorrow and the Joy, the Confidence and the Zeal of true Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
               <p>None will understand me that true Christians have no Remains of a contrary Spirit, and can never, in any Instances, be guilty of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour disagreable to such a Spirit. But this I affirm, and shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm 'till I deny the Bible to be any Thing worth, that every Thing in Christians that belongs to true Christianity, is of this Tendency, and works this Way; and that there is no true Christian upon Earth, but is so under the prevailing Power of such a Spirit, that he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly denominated from it, and it is truly and justly his Character: And that therefore Ministers, and others have no Warrant from Christ to encourage Persons, that are of a contrary Character &amp; Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to think they are converted, because they tell a fair Story of Illuminations and Discoveries. In so doing they would set up their own Wisdom against Christ's, and judge without, and against that Role by which Christ has declared all Men should know his Disciples. Some Persons place Religion so much in certain transient Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Impressions (especially if they are in such a particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Order) and so little in the Spirit and Temper Persons are of, that they greatly deform Religion, and form Notions of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity quite different from what it is, as delineated in the Scriptures. The Scripture knows of no such true Christians, as are of a fordid, selfish, cross and contentious Spirit. Nothing can be invented that is a greater Absurdity, than a morose, hard, close, high-spirited, spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful true Christian. We must learn the Way of bringing Men to Rules, and not Rules to Men, and so strain and stretch the Rules of God's Word, to take in our selves, and some of our Neighbours, 'till we make them wholly of none Effect.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that Allowances must be made for Men's natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with Regard to these Things, as well as others. But not such Allowances, as to allow Men, that once were Wolves and Serpents, to be now converted, without any remarkable Change in the Spirit of their Mind. The Change made by true Conversion, is wont to be most remarkable and sensible, with Respect to that which before
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:005767_0250_102707F6B42A0CB8"/>
was the Wickedness the Person was most notoriously guilty of. Grace has as great a Tendency to restrain and mortify such Sins, as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit that has been spoken of, as it has to mortify Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness or Lasciviousness. Yea the Scripture represents the Change wrought by Gospel Grace, as especially appearing in an Alteration of the former Sort; Isai. 11. 6,—9. 'The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb; and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid; and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling together; and a little Child shall lead them. And the Cow, and the Bear shall feed; their young ones shall he down together: And the Lion shall eat Straw like the Ox: And the sucking Child shall play on the Hole of the Asp; and the weaned Child shall put his Hand on the Cockatrice Den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain. For the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sea.' And to the same Purpose is <hi>Isai</hi> 65. 25. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find, that in the primitive Times of the christian Church. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were remarkably changed in this Respect: Tit. 3. 3, &amp;c. 'For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers Lusts and Pleasures; living in Malice and Envy, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and hating one another. But after that the Kindness and Love of God our Saviour, toward Men, appeared,—He saved us, by the Washing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghost.' And Col. 2. 7, 8. 'In the which ye also walked, some Time, when ye lived in them. But now you also put off all these; Anger, Wrath, Malice, Blasphemy, filthy Communication out of your Mouth.'</p>
               <p>IX. Gracious Affections soften the Heart, and are attended and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a christian Tenderness of Spirit.</p>
               <p>False Affections, however Persons may seem to be melted by them while they are new, yet have a Tendency in the End to harden the Heart. A Disposition to some Kind of Passions may be established; such as imply Self-seeking, Self-Exaltation, and Opposition to others. But false Affections, with the Delusion that attends them, finally tend to stupify the Mind, and shut it up against those Affections wherein Tenderness of Heart consists: And the Effect of 'em at last is, that Persons in the settled Frame of their Minds, become less af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with their present and past Sins, and less conscientious with Respect to future Sins, less moved with the Warnings and Cautions of God's Word, or God's Chastisements in his Providence, more careless of the Frame of their Hearts, and the Manner and Tendency of their Behaviour, less quick-sighted to discern what is sinful, less afraid of the Appearance of Evil, than they were while they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legal Awakenings and Fears of Hell. Now they have been the Subjects of such and such Impressions and Affections, and have a high
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:005767_0251_102707FA05AA1A90"/>
Opinion of themselves, and look on their State to be safe; they can be much more easy than before, in living in the Neglect of Duties that are troublesome and inconvenient; and are much more flow and partial in complying with difficult Commands; are in no Measure so alarmed at the Appearance of their own Defects and Transgressions; are embolden'd to favour themselves more, with Respect to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and painful Care and Exactness in their Walk, and more easily yield to Temptations, and the Sollicitations of their Lusts; and have far less Care of their Behaviour, when they come into the holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, in the Time of publick or private Worship. Formerly it may be, under legal Convictions they took much Pains in Religion, and denied themselves in many Things: But now they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of Danger of Hell, they very much put off the Burden of the Cross, and save themselves the Trouble of difficult Duties, and allow themselves more of the Comfort and the Enjoyment of their Ease and their Lusts.</p>
               <p>Such Persons as these, instead of embracing Christ as their <hi>Saviour from Sin,</hi> they trust in him as the <hi>Saviour of their Sins:</hi> Instead of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as their Refuge <hi>from their spiritual Enemies,</hi> they make Use of him as the Defence <hi>of their spiritual Enemies, from God,</hi> and to strengthen them against him. They make Christ the Minister of Sin, and great Officer and Vicegerent of the Devil, to strengthen his Interest, and make him above all Things in the World strong against JEHOVAH; so that they may sin against him with good Courage, and without any Fear, being effectually secured from Restraints by his most solemn Warnings and most awful Threatnings. They trust in Christ to preserve to 'em the quiet Enjoyment of their Sins, and to be their Shield to defend 'em from God's Displeasure; while they come close to him, even to his Bosom, the Place of his Children, to fight against him, with their mortal Weapons, hid under their Skirts. <note n="†" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Gracious Affections are of a quite contrary Tendency; they turn a Heart of Stone more and more into a Heart of Flesh. An holy Love and Hope are Principles that are vastly more efficacious upon the Heart, to make it tender, and to fill it with a Dread of Sin, or whatever might displease and offend God, and to engage it to Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Care and Strictness, than a slavish Fear of Hell. Gracious Affections, as was observed before, flow out of a contrite Heart, or (as the Word signifys) a bruised Heart, bruised and broken with godly Sorrow; which makes the Heart tender, as bruised Flesh is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and easily hurt. Godly Sorrow has much greater Influence to make the Heart tender, than meer legal Sorrow from selfish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>The Tenderness of the Heart of a true Christian, is elegantly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Saviour, in his comparing such a one to a little Child. The Flesh of a little Child is very tender: so is the Heart of one that is new-born. This is represented in what we are told of <hi>Naaman'</hi>s Cure of his Leprosy, by his washing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> by the Direction of the Prophet; which was undoubtedly a Type of the renewing of the Soul, by washing in the Laver of Regeneration. We are told, 2 Kings 5. 14. That <hi>he went down, and dipped himself seven Times in</hi> Jordan, <hi>according to the Saying of the Man of God; and his Flesh came again, like unto the Flesh of a little Child.</hi> Not only is the Flesh of a little Child tender, but his Mind is tender. A little Child has his Heart easily moved, wrought upon and bowed: So is a Christian in spiritual Things. A little Child is apt to be affected with Sympathy, to weep with them that weep, and can't well bear to see others in Distress: So it is with a Christian; <hi>John</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26. A little Child is easily won by Kindness: So is a Christian. A little Child is easily affected with Grief at temporal Evils, and has his Heart melted, and he falls a weeping: Thus tender is the Heart of a Christian, with Regard to the Evil of Sin. A little Child is easily affrighted at the Appearance of outward Evils, or any thing that threatens it's Hurt: So is a Christian apt to be alarmed at the Appearance of moral Evil, and any thing that threatens the Hurt of the Soul. A little Child, when it meets Enemies, or fierce Beasts, is not apt to trust it's own Strength, but flies to it's Parents for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: So a Saint is not self-confident in engaging spiritual Enemies,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:005767_0254_102708079C97CB30"/>
but flies to Christ. A little Child is apt to be suspicious of Evil in Places of Danger, afraid in the Dark, afraid when left alone, or far from Home: So is a Saint apt to be sensible of his spiritual Dangers, jealous of himself, full of Fear when he can't see his Way plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, afraid to be left alone, and to be at a Distance from God; Prov. 28. 14. <hi>Happy is the Man that feareth alway; but he that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Heart shall fall into Mischief.</hi> A little Child is apt to be afraid of Superiours, and to dread their Anger, and tremble at their Frowns and Threatnings: So is a true Saint with Respect to God; Psal. 119. 120. <hi>My Flesh trembleth for Fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Isai. 66. 2. <hi>To this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and trembleth at my Word.</hi> Verse 5. <hi>Hear ye the Word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his Word.</hi> Ezra 9. 4. <hi>Then were assembled unto me, every one that trembled at the Words of the God of</hi> Israel. Chap. 10. 3. <hi>According to the Counsel of my Lord, and of those that tremble at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of our God.</hi> A little Child approaches Superiours with Awe: So do the Saints approach God with holy Awe and Reverence. Job 13. 11. <hi>Shall not his Excellency make you afraid, and his Dread fall upon you.</hi> Holy Fear is so much the Nature of true Godliness, that it is called in Scripture by no other Name more frequently, than the <hi>Fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence gracious Affections don't tend to make Men bold, forward, noisy and boisterous; but rather to <hi>speak trembling;</hi> (Hos. 13. 1. <hi>When</hi> Ephraim <hi>spake trembling, he exalted himself in</hi> Israel; <hi>but when he offended in</hi> Baal, <hi>he died.</hi>) and to cloath with a Kind of holy Fear in all their Behaviour towards God and Man; agreable to <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 11. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20.</p>
               <p>But here some may object and say, Is there no such Thing as a holy Boldness in Prayer, and the Duties of divine Worship? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, There is doubtless such a Thing; and it is chiefly to be found in eminent Saints, Persons of great Degrees of Faith and Love. But this holy Boldness is not in the least opposite to <hi>Reverence;</hi> tho' it be to <hi>Disunion</hi> and <hi>Servility.</hi> It abolishes or lessens that Disposition which arises from <hi>moral Distance</hi> or <hi>Alienation;</hi> and also <hi>Distance of Relation,</hi> as that of a Slave: But not at all, that which becomes the <hi>natural Distance,</hi> whereby we are infinitely inferiour. No Boldness in poor sinful Worms of the Dust, that have a right Sight of God and themselves, will prompt 'em to approach to God with less Fear and Reverence, than spotless and glorious Angels in Heaven; who cover their Faces before his Throne; <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. at the Beginning. <hi>Rebecca,</hi> (who in her Marriage with <hi>Isaac,</hi> in almost all it's Circumstances, was manifestly a great Type of the Church, the Spouse of Christ) when she meets <hi>Isaac,</hi> lights off from her Camel, and takes a Veil, and covers herself; altho' she was brought to him as his Bride, to be
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:005767_0255_1027080CE88D4D48"/>
with him, in the nearest Relation, and most intimate Union, that Mankind are ever united one to another in. <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> in his Cases of Conscience, Book III. Chap. iv. speaks of an holy Modesty in the Worship of God, as one Sign of true Humility.</note>
                  <hi>Elijah,</hi> that great Prophet, who had so much holy Familiarity with God, at a Time of special Nearness to God, even when he conversed with him in the Mount, wraped his Face in his Mantle. Which was not because he was terrified with any servile Fear, by the terrible <hi>Wind,</hi> and <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> and <hi>Fire;</hi> but after these were all over, and God spake to him as a Friend, <hi>in a still small Voice;</hi> 1 Kings 19. 12, 13. <hi>And after the Fire, a still small Voice: And it was so, when</hi> Elijah <hi>heard it, he wrapped his Face in his Mantle.</hi> And <hi>Moses,</hi> with whom God spake Face to Face, as a Man speaks with his Friend, and was distinguished from all the Prophets, in the Familiarity with God that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to; at a Time when he was brought nearest of all, when God shewed him his Glory in that same Mount, where he afterwards spake to <hi>Elijah; He made Haste, and bowed his Head towards the Earth, and worshipped,</hi> Exod. 34. 8. There is in some Persons, a most unsui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unsufferable Boldness, in their Addresses to the great JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, in an Affectation of an holy Boldness, and Ostentation of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Nearness and Familiarity; the very Thoughts of which would make 'em shrink into Nothing, with Horror and Confusion, if they saw the Distance that is between God and them. They are like the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> that boldly came up near, in a Confidence of his own Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in Holiness. Whereas, if they saw their Vileness, they woulid be more like the <hi>Publican,</hi> that <hi>stood afar off, and durst not so much as lift up his Eyes to Heaven; but smote upon his Breast, saying, God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> It becomes such sinful Creatures as we, to approach a holy God (altho' with Faith, and without Terror, yet) with Contrition, and penitent Shame and Confusion of Face. It is foretold that this should be the Disposition of the Church, in the Time of her highest Priviledges on Earth, in her latter Day of Glory, when God should remarkably comfort her, by revealing his Covenant-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to her; Ezek. 16. 60, to the End. <hi>I will establish unto thee an everlasting Covenant. Then thou shalt remember thy Ways, and be ashamed.—And I will establish my Covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy Mouth any more, because of thy Shame, when I am pacified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee, for all that thou hast done; saith the Lord God.</hi> The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that we read of in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> that was an eminent Saint, and had much of that true Love which casts out Fear, by Christ's own Testimony, Verse 47. she approached Christ in an amiable,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:005767_0256_1027080E98DEF180"/>
and acceptable Manner, when she came with that humble Modesty, Reverence and Shame, when she stood at his Feet, weeping <hi>behind him,</hi> as not being fit to appear before his Face, and washed his Feet with her Tears.</p>
               <p>One Reason why gracious Affections are attended with this Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Spirit which has been spoken of, is that true Grace tends to promote Convictions of Conscience. Persons are wont to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Conscience before they have any Grace: And if afterwards they are truly converted, and have true Repentance, and Joy, and Peace in Believing; this has a Tendency to put an End to <hi>Terrors,</hi> but has no Tendency to put an End to <hi>Convictions of Sin,</hi> but to increase them. It don't stupify a Man's Conscience; but makes it more sensible, more easily and thoroughly discerning the Sinfulness of that which is sinful, and receiving a greater Conviction of the heinous and dreadful Nature of Sin, susceptive of a quicker and deeper Sense of it, and more convinced of his own Sinfulness, and Wickedness of his Heart; and consequently it has a Tendency to make him more jealous of his Heart. Grace tends to give the Soul a further and better <hi>Conviction</hi> of the same Things concerning Sin, that it was <hi>convinced</hi> of under a legal Work of the Spirit of God; <hi>viz.</hi> It's great Contrariety to the Will and Law and Honour of God, the Greatness of God's Hatred of it, and Displeasure against it, and the dreadful Punishment it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to and deserves. And not only so, but it <hi>convinces</hi> the Soul of some thing further concerning Sin, that it saw nothing of, while only under legal <hi>Convictions;</hi> and that is the infinitely hateful Nature of Sin, and it's Dreadfulness upon that Account. And this makes the Heart tender with Respect to Sin; like <hi>David'</hi>s Heart, that smote him, when he had cut off <hi>Saul'</hi>s Skirt. The Heart of a true Penitent is like a burnt Child, that dreads the Fire. Whereas on the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he that has had a counterfeit Repentance, and false Comforts and Joys, is like Iron that has been suddenly heat and quenched; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes much harder than before. A false Conversion puts an End to Convictions of Conscience; and so either takes away, or much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishes that Conscientiousness, which was manifested under a Work of the Law.</p>
               <p>All gracious Affections have a Tendency to promote this christian Tenderness of Heart, that has been spoken of: Not only a godly Sorrow; but also a gracious Joy; Psal. 2. 11. 'Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with Trembling.' As also a gracious Hope; Psal. 33. 18. 'Behold the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him; upon them that hope in his Mercy.' And Psal. 147. 11. 'The Lord taketh Pleasure in them that fear him, and in them that hope in his Mercy.' Yea the most confident and assured Hope, that is truly gracious, has this Tendency. The higher an holy Hope is raised, the more there is of this christian Tenderness. The banishing of a
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:005767_0257_10270813E886A628"/>
servile Fear, by a holy Assurance, is attended with a proportionable Increase of a reverential Fear. The diminishing of the Fear of the Fruits of God's Displeasure in future Punishment, is attended with a proportionable Increase of Fear of his Displeasure it self: The dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the Fear of Hell, with an Increase of the Fear of Sin. The vanishing of Jealousies of the Person's State, is attended with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Increase of Jealousy of his Heart, in a Distrust of it's Strength, Wisdom, Stability, Faithfulness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The less apt he is to be afraid of natural Evil, having 'his Heart fixed trusting in God, and so, not afraid of evil Tidings;' the more apt is he to be alarmed with the Appearance of moral Evil, or the Evil of Sin. As he has more holy Boldness, so he has less of Self-Confidence, and a forward assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Boldness, and more Modesty. As he is more sure than others of Deliverance from Hell, so he has more of a Sense of the Desert of it. He is less apt than others to be shaken in Faith; but more apt than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be moved with solemn Warnings, and with God's Frowns, and with the Calamities of others. He has the firmest Comfort, but the softest Heart: Richer than others, but poorest of all in Spirit: The tallest &amp; strongest Saint, but the least &amp; tenderest Child amongst them.</p>
               <p>X. Another Thing wherein those Affections that are truly gracious and holy, differ from those that are false, is <hi>beautiful Symmetry and Proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that the Symmetry of the Vertues, and gracious Affections of the Saints, in this Life, is perfect: It oftentimes, is in many Things defective, thro' the Imperfection of Grace, for want of proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, through Errors in Judgment, or some particular Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of natural Temper, or Defects in Education, and many other Disadvantages that might be mentioned. But yet there is, in no wise, that monstrous Disproportion in gracious Affections, and the various Parts of true Religion in the Saints, that is very commonly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, in the false Religion, and counterfeit Graces of Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>In the truly holy Affections of the Saints is found that Proportion, which is the natural Consequence of the Universality of their Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. They have the whole Image of Christ upon them: They have 'put off the old Man, and have put on the new Man' entire in all his Parts and Members. 'It hath pleased the Father that in Christ all Fulness should dwell:' there is in him every Grace; 'He is full of Grace and Truth: And they that are Christ's, do 'of his Fullness receive, and Grace for Grace;' (<hi>John</hi> 1. 14, 16.) i. e. there is every Grace in them, which is in Christ: 'Grace for Grace;' that is, Grace answerable to Grace: There is no Grace in Christ, but there is it's Image <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Believers to answer it: The Image is a true Image; and there is something of the same beautiful Proportion in the Image, which is in the Original; there is Feature for Feature, and
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:005767_0258_10270816D257FBE0"/>
Member for Member. There is Symmetry and Beauty in God's Workmanship. The natural Body, which God hath made consists of many Members; and all are in a beautiful Proportion: So it is in the new Man, consisting of various Graces and Affections. The Body of one that was born a perfect Child, may fail of exact Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Distemper, and the Weakness and Wounds of some of it's Members; yet the Disproportion is in no Measure like that of those that are born Monsters.</p>
               <p>It is with Hypocrites, as it was with <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, at a Time when God greatly complains of their Hypocrisy; Hos. 7. 'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim is a Cake not turned,' half roasted and half raw: There is commonly no Manner of Uniformity in their Affections.</p>
               <p>There is in many of them a great Partiality, with Regard to the several Kinds of religious Affections: Great Affections in some Things, and no manner of Proportion in others. An holy Hope and holy Fear go together in the Saints, as has been observed from. <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 18. and 147. 11. But in some of these is the most confident Hope, while they are void of Reverence, Self-jealousy and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion, and to a great Degree cast off Fear. In the Saints, Joy and holy Fear go together, tho' the Joy be never so great; as it was with the Disciples, in that joyful Morning of Christ's Resurrection, Matth. 28. 8. 'And they departed quickly from the Sepulchre, with Fear and GREAT Joy. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Renewed Care and Diligence follows the Sealings of the Spirit. Now is the Soul at the Foot of Christ, as <hi>Mary</hi> was at the Sepulchre, <hi>with Fear and great Joy.</hi> He that travels the Road with a rich Treasure about him, is afraid of a Thief in every Bush.</q> 
                     <hi>Flavel'</hi>s Sacramental Meditations, Medi. 4.</note> But many of these rejoyce without trembling: Their Joy is of that Sort, that is truly opposite to godly Fear.</p>
               <p>But particularly, one great Difference between Saints and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites is this, that the Joy and Comfort of the Former is attended with godly Sorrow and Mourning for Sin. They have not only Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to prepare 'em for their first Comfort, but after they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and their Joy established. As it is foretold of the Church of God, that they should mourn and loath themselves for their Sins, after they were returned from the Captivity, and were settled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Rest, and the Land that flows with Milk and Honey, Ezek. 20. 42, 43. 'And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the which I lifted up mine Hand, to give it to your Fathers. And there shall ye remember your Ways, and all your Doings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye have been defiled; and ye shall loath yourselves in your own
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:005767_0259_1027081D4DF1DAD0"/>
Sight, for all your Evils that ye have committed.' As also in Ezek. 16. 61, 62, 63. A true Saint is like a little Child in this Respect; he never had any godly Sorrow before he was born again; but since has it often in exercise: As a little Child, before it is born, and while it remains in Darkness, never cries; but as soon as ever it sees the Light, it begins to cry; and thenceforward is often crying. Altho' Christ hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows, so that we are freed from the <hi>Sorrow of Punishment,</hi> and may now sweetly feed upon the Comforts Christ hath purchased for us; yet that hinders not but that our feeding on these Comforts should be attended with the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Repentance.</hi> As of old, the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, evermore to feed upon the paschal Lamb, with bitter Herbs. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>If Repentance accompanies Faith, 'tis no Presumption to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Many know the Sin; and hence believe in Christ, trust in Christ; and there is an End of their Faith. But what Confession and Sorrow for Sin? What more Love to Christ follows this Faith? Truly none. Nay, their Faith is the Cause why they have none. For they think, if I trust in Christ to forgive me, he will do it; and there is an End of the Business. Verily this Hedge-Faith, this Bramble-Faith, that catches hold on Christ, and pricks and scratches Christ, by more Impenitency, more Contempt of him, is meer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; which shall one Day be burnt up and destroyed by the Fire of God's Jealousy. Fie upon that Faith, that serves only to keep a Man from being tormented before his Time! Your Sins would be your Sorrows, but that your Faith quiets you. But if Faith be accompanied with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Mourning for Sin, more Esteem of God's Grace in Christ; so that nothing breaks thy Heart more than the Thoughts of Christ's unchangeable Love to one so vile, and this Love makes thee love much, and love him the more; as thy Sin increaseth, so thou desirest thy Love's Increase; and now the Stream of thy Thoughts run, how thou mayst live to him that died for thee: This was <hi>Mary'</hi>s Faith, who sat at Christ's Feet weeping, washing them with her Tears, and loving much, because much was forgiven.</q> 
                        <hi>Shepard'</hi>s Sound Believer. p. 128, 129.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>You shall know godly Sorrow (says Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on <hi>Paul'</hi>s Conversion) by the Continuance of it: It is constant; but worldly Sorrow is but a Passion of the Mind; it changes, it lasts not. Tho' for the present it may be violent and strong, and work much outwardly; yet it comes but by Fits, and continues not: like a Land Flood, which violently, for the present, overflows the Banks; but it will away again; it is not always thus. But godly Sorrow is like a Spring, that still keeps his Running both Winter and Summer, Wet and Dry, in Heat and Cold, early and late. So this godly Sorrow is the same in a regenerate Man still; take him when you will, he is still sorrowing for Sin. This godly Sorrow stands like the Centre of the Earth, which removes not, but still remains.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I am perswaded, many a Man's Heart is kept from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning, because of this. He saith (it may be) that he is a vile Sinner; but I trust in Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they do go to Christ to destroy their Sin, this makes 'em more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their Sin. For (say they) I cannot help it, and Christ must do all. Whereas Faith makes the Soul mourn after the Lord the more.</q>

True Saints are spoken of in Scripture, not only as those that have mourn'd for Sin, but as those that do mourn, whose Manner it is still to mourn; Matth. 5. 4. 'Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.'</p>
               <p>Not only is there often in Hypocrites, an essential Deficiency, as to the various Kinds of religious Affections; but also a strange Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Disproportion, in the same Affections, with Regard to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Objects.</p>
               <p>Thus as to the Affection of <hi>Love,</hi> some make high Pretences, and a great Shew of Love to God and Christ, and it may be have been greatly affected with what they have heard or thought concerning them: But they han't a Spirit of Love and Benevolence towards Men, but are disposed to Contention, Envy, Revenge, and Evil-spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and will, it may be, suffer an old Grudge to rest in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms towards a Neighbour, for seven Years together, if not twice se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years; living in real Ill-will and Bitterness of Spirit towards him: And it may be in their Dealings with their Neighbours, are not very strict and conscientious in observing the Rule of <hi>doing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they would that they should do to them:</hi> 1 John 4. 20. <hi>If a Man say, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar: For he that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath seen, how can be love God whom be hath not seen?</hi> And on the other Hand, there are others, that appear as if they had a great deal of Benevolence to Men, are very good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd and generous in their Way; but have no Love to God.</p>
               <p>And as to Love to Men, there are some that have flowing Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to some; but their Love is far from being of so extensive and

universal a Nature, as a truly christian Love is. They are full of dear Affections to some, and full of Bitterness towards others. They are knit to their own Party, them that approve of 'em, love 'em and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire 'em; but are fierce against those that oppose and dislike 'em.

Not that I suppose it to be at all strange, that Pity to the perishing Souls of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners should be to a Degree of Agony, if other Things are answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or that a truly gracious Compassion to Souls should be exercised much more to some Persons than others that are equally miserable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially on some particular Occasions: There may many Things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fix the Mind, and affect the Heart, with Respect to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Person, at such a Juncture; and without Doubt some Saints have been in great Distress for the Souls of particular Persons, so as to be as it were in Travail for them: But when Persons appear, at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Times, in wracking Agonies for the Soul of some single Person, far beyond what has been usually heard or read of in eminent Saints, but appear to be Persons that have a Spirit of meek and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as there is a monstrous Disproportion in the Love of some, in it's Exercises towards different Persons, so there is in their seeming Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Love towards the same Persons. Some Men shew a Love to others as to their outward Man, they are liberal of their worldly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and often give to the Poor; but have no Love to, or Concern for the Souls of Men. Others pretend a great Love to Men's Souls, that are not compassionate and charitable towards their Bodies. The making a great Shew of Love, Pity, and Distress for Souls, costs 'em nothing; but in order to shew Mercy to Men's Bodies, they must part with Money out of their Pockets. But a true christian
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:005767_0262_1027082B6A062208"/>
Love to our Brethren, extends both to their Souls and Bodies. And herein is like the Love and Compassion of Jesus Christ. He shewed Mercy to Men's Souls, by labouring for them in preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to 'em; and shewed Mercy to their Bodies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> among the People. We have a remarkable Instance of Christ's having Compassion at once both to Men's Souls and Bodies, and shewing Compassion by feeding both, in Mark 6. 34, &amp;c. <hi>And Jesus, when he came out, saw much People, and was moved with Compassion towards them; because they were as Sheep not having a Shepherd: And he began to teach them many Things.</hi> Here was his Compassion to their Souls. And in the Sequel, we have an Account of his Compassion to their Bodies, because they had been a long While <hi>having nothing to eat:</hi> He fed save thousand of 'em with five Loaves and two Fishes. And if the Compassion of professing Christians towards others don't work in the same Ways, it is a Sign that it is no true christian Compassion.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, 'tis a Sign that Affections are not of the right Sort, if Persons seem to be much affected with the bad Qualities of their Fellow-Christians, as the Coldness and Lifelessness of other Saints, but are in no Proportion affected with their own Defects and Corruptions. A true Christian may be affected with the Coldness and Unsavouriness of other Saints, and may mourn much over it. But at the same Time he is not so apt to be affected with the Badness of any B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dy's Heart, as his own. This is most in his Uiew: This he is most quick-sighted to discern: This he sees most of the Aggravations of, and is most ready to cry out of. And a lesser Degree of Vertue will bring him to pity himself, and be concerned at his own Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than rightly to be affected with others Calamities. And if Men han't attain'd to the Less, we may determine they never attain'd to the Greater.</p>
               <p>And here by the Way, I would observe, that it may be laid down as a general Rule, That if Persons pretend that they come to high Attainments in Religion, but have never yet arrived to the lesser At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, 'tis a Sign of a vain Pretence. As if Persons pretend that they have got beyond meer <hi>Morality,</hi> to live a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Life; but really han't come to be so much as <hi>moral</hi> Persons. Or pretend to be greatly affected with the Wickedness of their Hearts, and are not affected with the palpable Violations of God's Commands in their Practice, which is a lesser Attainment. Or if they pretend to be brought to be even willing to be damned for the Glory of God, but have no Forwardness to suffer a little in their Estates and Names and worldly Convenience, for the sake of their Duty. Or pretend that they are not afraid to venture their Souls upon Christ, and commit their All to God, trusting to his bare Word, and the Faithfulness of his Promises, for their eternal Welfare; but at the same Time, han't
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:005767_0263_1027082D0927F2C8"/>
Confidence enough in God, to dare to trust him with a little of their Estates, bestowed to pious and charitable Uses: I say, when it is thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with Persons, their Pretences are manifestly vain. He that is in a Journey, and imagines he has got far beyond such a Place in his Road, and never yet came to it, must be mistaken; and he is not yet arrived to the Top of the Hill, that never yet got half-way thither. But this by the Way.</p>
               <p>The same that has been observed of the Affection of <hi>Love,</hi> is also to be observed of <hi>other</hi> religious Affections. Those that are true, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in some Proportion, to the various Things that are their due and proper Objects: But when they are false, are commonly strangely disproportionate. So it is with religious <hi>Desires</hi> and Longings: These in the Saints, are to those Things that are spiritual and excellent in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that in some Proportion to their Excellency, Importance or Necessity, or their near Concern in them: But in false Longings, 'tis often far otherwise. They will strangely run, with an impatient Vehemence, after something of less Importance, when other Things of greater Importance are neglected. Thus for Instance. Some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, from Time to Time, are attended with a vehement Inclination, and unaccountably violent Pressure, to declare to others what they experience, and to exhort others; when there is at the same Time, no Inclination, in any Measure equal to it, to other Things, that true Christianity has as great, yea, a greater Tendency to; as the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Soul before God in secret earnest Prayer and Praise to him, and more Conformity to him, and living more to his Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We read in Scripture of <hi>Groanings that cannot be uttered,</hi> and <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings for the Longing it hath,</hi> and <hi>Longings, Thirstings,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pantings,</hi> much more frequently to these latter Things, than the former.</p>
               <p>And so as to <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Zeal;</hi> when these are from right Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they are against Sin in general, in some Proportion to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sinfulness; Psal. 119, 104. <hi>I hate every false Way.</hi> So Ver. 128. But a false Hatred and Zeal against Sin, is against some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sin only. Thus some seem to be very zealous against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, and Pride in Apparel, who themselves are notorious for Coveteousness, Closeness, and it may be Backbiting, Envy towards Superiours, Turbulency of Spirit towards Rulers, and rooted Ill-will to them that have injured them. False Zeal is against the Sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, while Men have no Zeal against their own Sins. But he that has true Zeal, exercises it chiefly against his own Sins: Tho' he shews also a proper Zeal against prevailing and dangerous Iniquity in others. And some pretend to have a great Abhorrence of their own Sins of Heart, and cry out much of their inward Corruption; and yet make light of Sins in Practice, and seem to commit them without much Restraint or Remorse; tho' these imply Sin, both in Heart and Life.</p>

As there is a much greater Disproportion in the Exercises of false Affections, than of true, as to different Objects; so there is also, as to different Times.

It is required that our Affections be fixed on heavenly and spiritual Things: And true Grace will effect it; Col. 3. 1, 2. <hi>If ye be risen</hi> with <hi>Christ, seek those Things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right Hand of God.

Sometimes they are hot, and sometimes cold; sometimes up, and sometimes down; sometimes all Heaven, and sometimes all World; without Equality, without Stability. But true Grace fixeth the Affections on spiritual Things.

For he shall be as a Tree planted by the Waters, and that spreadeth out her Roots by the River; and shall not see when Heat cometh; but her Leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the Year of Drought; neither shall cease from yielding Fruit.' Many Hypocrites are like Comets, that appear for a While with a mighty Blaze; but are very unsteady and irregular in their Motion, (and are therefore called wandering Stars, <hi>Jude</hi> 13.) and their Blaze soon disappears, and they appear but once in a great While. But the true Saints are like the fixed Stars, which, tho' they rise and set, and are often clouded, yet are stedfast in their Orb, and may truly be said to shine with a constant Light. Hypocritical Affections are like a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motion; like that of the Air that is moved with Winds. (<hi>Jude</hi> 12.) But gracious Affections are more a natural Motion, like the Stream of a River; which tho' it has many Turns hither and thither, and may meet with Obstacles, and run more freely and swiftly in some Places than others; yet in the general, with a steady and constant Course, tends the same Way, 'till it gets to the Ocean.</p>

And this also has it's peculiar Advantages for fixing his Heart, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging it's Affections.

The Saints Pains and Travailing for the Souls of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is chiefly in secret Places; Jer. 13. 17.

'My Soul shall be satisfied as with Marrow and Fatness, and my Mouth shall praise thee with joyful Lips; when I remember thee upon my Bed, and meditate upon thee in the Night Watches.' Christ calls forth his Spouse, away from the World, into retired Places, that he may give her his sweetest Love; Cant. 7. 11, 12. 'Come my Beloved, let us go forth into the Field, let us lodge in the Villages:—There will I give thee my Love.'

               <p>The more a true Saint loves God with a gracious Love, the more he desires to love him, and the more uneasy is he at his Want of Love to him: The more he hates Sin, the more he desires to hate it, and laments that he has so much remaining Love to it: The more he mourns for Sin, the more he longs to mourn for Sin: The more his Heart is broke, the more he desires it should be broken: The more he thirsts and longs after God and Holiness, the more he longs to long, and breathe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the higher it is raised, the more ardent it is; and the more it burns, the more vehemently does it tend and seek to burn. So that the spiritual Appetite after Holiness, and an Increase of holy Affections, is much more lively and keen in those that are eminent in Holiness, than others; and more when Grace and holy Affections are in their most lively Exercise, than at other Times. 'Tis as much the Nature of one that is spiritually new-born, to thirst after Growth in Holiness, as 'tis the Nature of a new-born Babe, to thirst after the Mother's Breast; who has the sharpest Appetite, when best in Health; 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3. <hi>As new-born Babes, desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that ye may gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The greatest Eminency and Perfection, that the Saints arrive to in this World, has no Tendency to Satiety, or to abate their Desires after more; but on the contrary, makes 'em more eager to press forwards; as is evident by the Apostle's Words, Phil. 3. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Forgetting those Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those Things which are before, I press toward the Mark.—Let us therefore, as many as be</hi> PERFECT, <hi>be thus minded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reasons of it are, that the more Persons have of holy Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the more they have of that spiritual Taste which I have spoken of elsewhere; whereby they perceive the Excellency, and relish the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sweetness of Holiness. And the more Grace they have, while in this State of Imperfection, the more they see their Imperfection and Emptiness, and Distance from what ought to be; and so the more do they see their Need of Grace; as I shewed at large before, when speaking of the Nature of evangelical Humiliation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Grace, as long as it is imperfect, is of a growing Nature, and in a growing State. And we see it to be so with all living Things, that while they are in a State of Imperfection, and in their growing State, their Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

But here some may object and say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How is this consistent with what all allow, That spiritual Enjoyments are of a Soul-satisfying Nature?</p>
               <p>I answer, It's being so, will appear to be not at all inconsistent with what has been said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be considered in what Manner spiritual Enjoyments are said to be of a Soul-satisfying Nature. Certainly they are not so in that Sense, that they are of so cloying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Nature, that he who has any Thing of them, tho' but in a very imperfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, desires no more. But spiritual Enjoyments are of a Soul-satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature in the following Respects, 1. They in their Kind and Nature, are fully adapted to the Nature, Capacity and Need of the Soul of Man. So that those who find them, desire <hi>as other Kind</hi> of Enjoyments; they sit down fully contented with that Kind of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which they have, desiring no Change, nor inclining to wander about any more, saying who will shew us any Good? The Soul is never cloyed, never weary; but perpetually giving up it self, with all it's Powers, to this Happiness. But not that those who have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Happiness, desire no more of the same. 2. They are satisfying also in this Respect, that they answer the Expectation of the Appetite. When the Appetite is high to any Thing, the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is consequently so. Appetite to a particular Object implies Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in it's Nature. This Expectation is not satisfied by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments, the Man expected to have a great Accession of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, but he is disappointed. But it is not so with spiritual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They fully answer and satisfy the Expectation. 3. The Gratification and Pleasure of spiritual Enjoyments is permanent. 'Tis not so with worldly Enjoyments. They in a Sense satisfy particular Appetites; but the Appetite in being satisfied, is glutted, and then the Pleasure is over: And as soon as that is over, the general Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of human Nature after Happiness returns; but is empty, and without any Thing to satisfy it. So that the glutting of a particular Appetite, does but take away from, and leave empty, the general Thirst of Nature. 4. Spiritual Good is satisfying, as there is enough in it, to satisfy the Soul, as to Degree, if Obstacles were but removed, and the enjoying Faculty duly applied. There is Room enough here for the Soul to extend it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is an infinite Ocean of it. If Men ben't satisfied here, in Degree of Happiness, the Cause is with themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis because they don't open their Mouths wide enough.</p>

                  </gap>hings don't argue that a Soul has no Appetite excited after more of the same, that has tasted a little; or that his Appetite will not increase, the more he tastes, 'till he comes to Fulness of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment: As Bodies that are attracted to the Globe of the Earth, tend to it more strongly, the nearer they come to the attracting Body, and are not at Rest out of the Centre. Spiritual Good is of a satisfying Nature; and for that very Reason, the Soul that tastes, and knows
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:005767_0272_10270853C82A4D30"/>
it's Nature, will thirst after it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Fulness of it, that it may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. And the more he experiences, and the more he knows this excellent, unparrallel'd, exquisite, and satisfying Sweetness, the more earnestly will he hunger and thirst for more, 'till he comes to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And therefore this is the Nature of spiritual Affections, that the greater they be, the greater the Appetite and Longing is, after Grace and Holiness.</p>
               <p>But with those Joys, and other religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Affections, that are false and counterfeit, it is otherwise. If before, there was a great Desire, of some Sort, after Grace; as these Affections rise, <hi>that</hi> Desire ceases, or is abated. It may be before, while the Man was under legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and much afraid of Hell, he earnestly longed that he might obtain spiritual Light in his Understanding, and Faith in Christ, and Love to God: But now, when these false Affections are risen, that deceive him, and make him confident that he is converted, and his State good, there are no more earnest Longings after Light and Grace: For his End is answer'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is confident that his Sins are forgiven him, and that he shall go to Heaven; and so he is satisfied. And especially when false Affections are raised very high, do they put an End to Longings after Grace and Holiness. The Man now is far from appearing to himself, a poor empty Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the Contrary, he is rich, and encreased with Goods; and hardly conceives of any Thing more excellent, than what he has already attain'd to.</p>
               <p>Hence there is an End to many Persons Earnestness in Seeking, after they have once obtain'd that which they call their Conversion: or at least, after they have had those high Affections, that make them fully confident of it. Before, while they looked upon themselves as in a State of Nature, they were engaged in seeking after God and Christ, and cried earnestly for Grace, and strove in the Use of Means: But now they act as tho' they thought their Work was done: They live upon their first Work, or some high Experiences that are past; and there is an End to their crying, and striving after God and Grace. <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>It is usual to see a false Heart most diligent in seeking the Lord, when he has been worst, and most careless when 'tis best. Hence many at first Conversion; sought the Lord earnestly: Afterwards Affections and Endeavours die; that now they are as good as the Word can make 'em.—An Hypocrite's last End is to satisfy himself: Hence he has enough.

For Saints that do look for him, tho' they have not that Holiness and Grace they would have, yet they rest not satisfied with any Measure; 1 John 3. 3. <hi>He that hath this Hope, purifieth himself as he is pure.</hi>—The Saints content not themselves with any Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, 'till made glorious; and so fit for Fellowship with that Spouse.—When a Man leaves not, 'till he gets such a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Faith and Grace, and now when he has got this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himself with this, as a good Sign that he shall be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he looks not for Christ.

                     <p>Again, p. 109. <q>There is never a Hypocrite living, but closeth with Christ for his own Ends: For he cannot work beyond his Principle. Now when Men have served their own Turns out of another Man, away they go, and keep that which they have. An Hypocrite closeth with Christ, as a Man with a rich Shop: He will not be at Cost to buy all the Shop, but so much as serves his Turn. Commonly Men in Horror, seek so much of Christ as will ease them; and hence profess, and hence seek for so much of Christ as will credit them; and hence their Desires after Christ are soon Satisfied. <hi>Appetitus Finis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And almost all that is said in the new Testament, of Men's watching, giving earnest Heed to themselves, running the Race that is set before them, striving and agonizing, wrestling not with Flesh and Blood, but Principalities and Powers, fighting, putting on the whole Armour of God, and standing, having done all to stand, pressing forward, reaching forth, continuing instant in Prayer, crying to God Day and Night; I say, almost all that is said in the new Testament of these Things, is spoken of, and directed to the Saints.

But such Things as these are far different from the natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it were necessary Appetite and Thirsting of the new Man, after God &amp; Holiness.

There is a holy Breathing and Panting after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to increase Holiness, as natural to a holy Nature, as breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to a living Body. And Holiness or Sanctification is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the Object of it, than any Manifestation of God's Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.

I have shewn before that Holiness is that Good which is the immediate Object of a spiritual Taste. But undoubtedly the same Sweetness that is the chief Object of a spiritual Taste, is also the chief Object of a spiritual Appetite.

If Men live in the Neglect of known Duties, or in the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of known Evils, that will be their Condemnation; let the Sin be what it will; let it be Prophaness, Uncleaness, Lying or Injustice.—If Men allow themselves in Malice, Envy, wanton Thoughts, prophane Thoughts, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; though those Corruptions don't break out in any scandalous Way. These Thoughts are an Evidence of a rotten Heart; Tit. 3. 3. <hi>We ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers Lusts and Pleasures, living in Malice, and Envy, hateful, and hating one another.</hi> If a Man allows himself, tho' he thinks he doth not, in Malice and Envy, he is an Hypocrite: Tho' his Conscience disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, yet if his Heart allows it, he is no Saint.—Some make Pretences to Godliness, whereby they do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, but (which is a great deal worse) deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also: But this will condemn them, that they live in a Course of Sin, and so must go with ungodly Men; Psal. 125. 5. <hi>As for such as turn aside unto their crooked Ways, the Lord will lead them forth with the Workers of Iniquity.</hi> If there be a gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

There be a great many Commands, and if there be one of them that a Man has not Respect unto, he will be put to Shame another Day. If a Man lives in one evil Way, he is not subject to God's Authority: but then he lives in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and that will take off all his Pleas, and at once cut off all his Pretences; and he will be condemned in the Day of Judgment.—One Way of Sin is Exception enough against the Man's Salvation. Tho' the Sin that he lives in be but small: Such Persons won't be guilty of Perjury, Stealing, Drunkenness, Fornication; they look upon them to be hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Things, and they are afraid of them; but they do not much matter it, if they oppress a little in a Bargain, if they commend a Thing too much which they are about to sell, if they break a Promise, if they spend the Sabbath unprofitably, if they neglect secret Prayer, if they talk rud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But indeed all the Commands of God are established by divine Authority: A small Shot may kill a Man, as well as a Cannon Bullet: A small Leak may sink a Ship. If a Man lives in small Sins, that shews he has no Love to God, no sincere Care to please and honour God. Little Sins are of a damning Nature, as well as great: If they don't deserve so much Punishment as greater, yet they do deserve Damnation. There is a Contempt of God in all Sins; Matth. 5. 19. <hi>He that shall break one of the least of these Commands, and shall teach Men so, shall be called the least in the Kingdom of God.</hi> Prov. 19. 16. <hi>He that keepeth the Commandment, keepeth his own Soul; but he that despiseth his Way, shall die.</hi> If a Man says, this is a great Command, and so lays Weight on <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>it, and another is a little Commandment, and so don't regard it, but will allow himself to break it, he is in a perishing Condition.</q>

All true Christians comply with this Call, (as is implied in its being an effectual Call) and do the Work of Christians; which is every where in the new Testament compared to those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, wherein Men are wont to exert their Strength, with the greatest Earnestness, as Running, Wrestling, Fighting.

their Falling away be into their former Sins, or into some new Kind of Wickedness; having the Corruption of Nature only turned into a new Channel, instead of it's being mortified. As when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that think themselves converted, tho' they do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

When it is thus with Men, however far they may seem to be from their former evil Practices, this alone is enough to condemn 'em, &amp; may render their last State far worse than the first. For this seems to be the very Case of the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Generation that Christ speaks of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45. who having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by <hi>John the Baptist'</hi>s Preaching, and brought to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their former licentious Courses, whereby the unclean Spirit was as it were turned out, and the House swept and garnish'd; yet being <hi>empty</hi> of God and of Grace, became full of themselves, and were exalted in an exceeding high Opinion of their own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and eminent Holiness, and became habituated to an answerably Self-exalting Behaviour; so changing the Sins of Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, for those of the Phar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ees; and in the Issue, had seven Devils, worse than the first.</p>
               <p>Thus I have explain'd what Exercise and Fruit I mean, when I say that gracious Affections have their Exercise and Fruit in christian Practice.</p>
               <p>The Reason why gracious Affections have such a Tendency and Effect, appears from many Things that have already been observed, in the preceeding Parts of this Discourse.</p>
               <p>The Reason of it appears from this, that <hi>gracious Affections do arise from those Operations &amp; Influences which are spiritual,</hi> and that the inward
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:005767_0286_1027088346E67AC0"/>
Principle from whence they flow, is something <hi>divine,</hi> a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, a Participation of the divine Nature, Christ living in the Heart, the holy Spirit dwelling there, in Union with the Faculties of the Soul, as an internal vital Principle, exerting his own proper Nature, in the Exercise of those Faculties. This is sufficient to shew us why true Grace should have such Activity, Power and Efficacy. No Wonder that which is divine, is powerful and effectual; for it has Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence on it's Side. If God dwells in the Heart, and be vitally u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to it, he will shew that he is a God, by the Efficacy of his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Christ is not in the Heart of a Saint, as in a Sepulchre, or as a dead Saviour, that does nothing; but as in his Temple, and as one that is alive from the Dead. For in the Heart where Christ savingly is, there he lives, and exerts himself after the Power of that endless Life, that he received at his Resurrection. Thus every Saint that is the Subject of the Benefit of Christ's Sufferings, is made to know and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Power of his Resurrection. The Spirit of Christ, which is the immediate Spring of Grace in the Heart, is all Life, all Power, all Act; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4.—<hi>In Demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 5. <hi>Our Gospel came not unto you in Word only, but also in Power, and in the holy Ghost.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 20. <hi>The Kingdom of God it not in Word, but in Power.</hi> Hence saving Affections, tho' oftentimes they don't make so great a Noise and Show as others; yet have in them a secret Solidity, Life and Strength, whereby they take hold of, and carry away the Heart, leading it into a Kind of Captivity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. gaining a full and stedfast Determination of the Will for God and Holiness; Psal. 110. 3. <hi>Thy People shall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</hi> And thus it is that holy Affections have a governing Power in the Course of a Man's Life. A Statue may look very much like a real Man, and a beautiful Man; yea it may have, in it's Appearance to the Eye, the Resemblance of a very lively, strong and active Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Principle of Life and Strength is wanting; and therefore it does nothing, it brings nothing to pass, there is no Action or Operation to answer the Shew. False Discoveries and Affections don't go deep enough, to reach and govern the Spring of Men's Actions and Practice. The Seed in stony Ground had not Deepness of Earth, and the Root did not go deep enough to bring forth Fruit. But gracious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections go to the very Bottom of the Heart, and take hold of the very inmost Springs of Life and Activity. Herein chiefly appears the Power of true Godliness, <hi>viz.</hi> in it's being effectual in Practice. And the Efficacy of Godliness in this Respect, is what the Apostle has Respect to when he speaks of the Power of Godliness, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. as is very plain; for he there is particularly declaring, how some Professors of Religion would notoriously fail in the Practice of it; and then in the 5th Verse observes, that in being thus of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:005767_0287_10270888CDD9AF50"/>
Practice, they deny the Power of Godliness, tho' they have the Form of it. Indeed the Power of Godliness is exerted in the first Place within the Soul, in the sensible, lively Exercise of gracious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections there. Yet the principal Evidence of this Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is in those Exercises of holy Affections that are practical, and in their being practical; in conquering the Will, and conquering the Lusts and Corruptions of Men, and carrying Men on in the Way of Holiness, thro' all Temptation, Difficulty and Opposition.</p>
               <p>Again, The Reason why gracious Affections have their Exercise and Effect in christian Practice, appears from this (which has also been before observed) that <hi>the first objective Ground of gracious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the transcendently excellent and amiable Nature of divine Things, as they are in themselves, and not any conceived Relation they bear to Self, or Self-Interest.</hi> This shews why holy Affections will cause Men to be holy in their Practice universally. What makes Men partial in Religion is, that they seek themselves, and not God, in their Religion, and close with Religion, not for its own excellent Nature, but only to serve a Turn. He that closes with Religion only to serve a Turn, will close with no more of it than he imagines serves that Turn: But he that closes with Religion for its own excellent and lovely Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, closes with all that has that Nature: He that embraces Religion for its own Sake, embraces the Whole of Religion. This also shews why gracious Affections will cause Men to practice Religion perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veringly, and at all Times. Religion may alter greatly in Process of Time, as to its Consistence with Men's private Interest, in many Respects; and therefore he that complies with it only from selfish Views, is liable, in Change of Times, to forsake it: But the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Nature of Religion, as it is in it self, is invariable; it is always the same, at all Times, and thro' all Changes; it never alters in any Respect.</p>
               <p>The Reason why gracious Affections issue in holy Practice, also further appears from the Kind of Excellency of divine Things, that it has been observed is the Foundation of all holy Affection, <hi>viz. their moral Excellency, or the Beauty of their Holiness.</hi> No wonder that a Love to Holiness, for Holiness Sake, inclines Persons to practice Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to practice every Thing that is holy. Seeing Holiness is the main Thing that excites, draws &amp; governs all gracious Affections, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all such Affections tend to Holiness. That which Men love, they desire to have and to be united to, and possessed of. That Beauty which Men delight in, they desire to be adorned with. Those Acts which Men delight in, they necessarily incline to do.</p>
               <p>And what has been observed of that <hi>divine Teaching and Leading of the Spirit of God,</hi> which there is in gracious Affections, shews the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this Tendency of such Affections to an universally holy Practice. For as has been observed, the Spirit of God in this his divine Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:005767_0288_1027088A80BDC220"/>
and Leading, gives the Soul a natural Relish of the Sweetness of that which is holy, and of every Thing that is holy, so far as it comes in View, and excites a Disrelish and Disgust of every Thing that is unholy.</p>
               <p>The same also appears from what has been observed of the Nature of that <hi>spiritual Knowledge,</hi> which is the Foundation of all holy Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as consisting in <hi>a Sense and View of that Excellency in divine Things, which is supream and transcendent.</hi> For hereby these Things appear above all others, worthy to be chosen and adhered to. By the Sight of the transcendent Glory of Christ, true Christians see him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be followed; and so are powerfully drawn after him: They see him worthy that they should forsake all for him: By the Sight of that superlative Amiableness, they are thoroughly disposed to be subject to him, and engaged to labour with Earnestness and Activity in his Service, and made willing to go thro' all Difficulties for his Sake. And 'tis the Discovery of this divine Excellency of Christ, that makes 'em constant to him: For it makes a deep Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon their Minds, that they cannot forget him; and they will follow him whithersoever he goes, and it is in vain for any to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw them away from him.</p>
               <p>The Reason of this practical Tendency and Issue of gracious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, further appears, from what has been observed of such Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being <hi>attended with a thorough Conviction of the Judgment, of the Reality and Certainty of divine Things.</hi> No wonder that they who were never thoroughly convinced that there is any Reality in the Things of Religion, will never be at the Labour and Trouble of such an earnest, universal and persevering Practice of Religion, thro' all Difficulties, Self-denials and Sufferings, in a Dependance on that, which they are not convinced of. But on the other Hand, they who are thoroughly convinced of the certain Truth of those Things, must needs be govern'd by them in their Practice; for the Things revealed in the Word of God are so great, and so infinitely more important, than all other Things, that it is inconsistent with the human Nature, that a Man should fully believe the Truth of them, and not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by them above all Things, in his Practice.</p>
               <p>Again, The Reason of this Expression and Effect of holy Affections in the Practice, appears from what has been observed of <hi>a Change of Nature, accompanying such Affections.</hi> Without a Change of Nature, Men's Practice will not be thoroughly changed. 'Till the Tree be made good, the Fruit will not be good. Men don't gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thistles. The Swine may be washed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear clean for a little while, but yet, without a Change of Nature, he will still wallow in the Mire. Nature is a more powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Action, than any Thing that opposes it: Tho' it may be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently restrain'd for a while, it will finally overcome that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:005767_0289_1027088D64F3F9E8"/>
it: 'Tis like the Stream of a River, it may be stopp'd a while with a Dam, but if nothing be done to dry the Fountain, it won't be stop'd always; It will have a Course, either in its old Channel, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a new one. Nature is a Thing more constant and permanent, than any of those Things that are the Foundation of carnal Men's Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Righteousness. When a natural Man denies his Lust, and lives a strict, religious Life, and seems humble, painful and earnest in Religion, 'tis not natural, 'tis all a Force against Nature; as when a Stone is violently thrown upwards; but that Force will be gradually spent; yet Nature will remain in its full Strength, and so prevails again, and the Stone returns downwards. As long as corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not mortified, but the Principle left whole in a Man, 'tis a vain Thing to expect that it should not govern. But if the old Nature be indeed mortified, and a new and heavenly Nature infused; then may it well be expected, that Men will walk in Newness of Life, and continue to do so to the End of their Days.</p>
               <p>The Reason of this practical Exercise and Effect of holy Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may also be partly seen, from what has been said of that <hi>Spirit of Hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ty, which attends them.</hi> Humility is that wherein a Spirit of Obedience does much consist. A proud Spirit is a rebellious Spirit, but a humble Spirit is a yieldable, subject, obediential Spirit. We see among Men, that the Servant who is of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aughty Spirit, is not apt in every Thing to be submissive and obedient to the Will of his Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but it is otherwise with that Servant who is of a lowly Spirit.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Lamblike, Dovelike Spirit,</hi> that has been spoken of, which accompanies all gracious Affections, fulfills (as the Apostle observes, Rom. 13, 8, 9, 10. and Gal. 5. 14.) all the Duties of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table of the Law; wherein christian Practice does very much consist, and wherein the external Practice of Christianity chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
               <p>And the Reason why gracious Affections are attended with that strict, universal and constant Obedience which has been spoken of, further appears, from what has been observed of that <hi>Tenderness of Spirit,</hi> which accompanies the Affections of true Saints, causing in them so quick and lively a Sense of Pain, thro' the Presence of moral Evil, and such a Dread of the Appearance of Evil.</p>
               <p>And one great Reason why the christian Practice which flows from gracious Affections, is universal, and constant, and persevering, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what has been observed of those Affections themselves, from whence this Practice flows, being universal and constant, in all Kinds of holy Exercises, and towards all Objects, and in all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and at all Seasons, <hi>in a beautiful Symmetry and Proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And much of the Reason why holy Affections are express'd and manifested in such an Earnestness, Activity, and Engagedness and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in holy Practice, as has been spoken of, appears from what
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:005767_0290_102709DBB5514EA8"/>
has been observed, of the spiritual Appetite and Longing after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attainments in Religion, which evermore attends true Affection, and don't decay, but increases, as those Affections increase.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how the Tendency of holy Affections to such a chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Practice as has been explained, appears from each of those Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristicks of holy Affection, that have been before spoken of.</p>
               <p>And this Point may be further illustrated and confirmed, if it be considered, that the holy Scriptures do abundantly place Sincerity and Soundness in Religion, in making a full Choice of God as our only Lord and Portion, forsaking all for him, and in a full Determination of the Will for God and Christ, on counting the Cost; in our Hearts closing and complying with the Religion of Jesus Christ, with all that belongs to it, embracing it with all it's Difficulties, as it were hating our dearest earthly Enjoyments, and even our own Lives, for Christ; giving up our selves, with all that we have, wholly and forever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, without keeping back any Thing or making any Reserve; or in one Word, in the great Duty of <hi>Self-denial</hi> for Christ; or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, <hi>i. e.</hi> as it were disowning and renouncing ourselves for him, making ourselves nothing that he may be all.

An having an Heart to deny ourselves for Christ, tends to a denying our selves in Deed, when Christ and Self-Interest stand in Competition. A giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our selves, with all that we have in our Hearts, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Reserve there, tends to our behaving ourselves universally as his, as subject to his Will, and devoted to his Ends. Our Hearts entirely closing with the Religion of Jesus, with all that belongs to it, and as attended with all it's Difficulties, upon a deliberate counting the Cost, tends to an universal closing with the same in Act and Deed, and actually going through all the Difficulties that we meet with in

the Way of Religion, and so holding out with Patience and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>The Tendency of Grace in the Heart to holy Practice, is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and the Connection most natural close and necessary. True Grace is not an unactive Thing; there is nothing in Heaven or Earth of a more active Nature; for 'tis Life it self, and the most active Kind of Life, even spiritual and divine Life. 'Tis no barren Thing; there is nothing in the Universe that in it's Nature has a greater Tendency to Fruit. Godliness in the Heart has as direct a Relation to Practice, as a Fountain has to a Stream, or as the luminous Nature of the Sun has to Beams sent forth, or as Life has to Breathing, or the Beating of the Pulse, or any other vital Act; or as a Habit or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Action has to Action: For 'tis the very Nature and Notion of Grace, that 'tis a Principle of holy Action or Practice.

                     <q>What is the End of every Grace, but to mollify the Heart, and make it pliable to some Command or other? Look, how many Commandments, so many Graces there are in Virtue and Efficacy, altho' not so many several Names are given them. The End of every such Grace is to make us obedient: As the End of Temperance is Chastity, to bow the Heart to these Commands, <hi>Be ye sober,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not in Chambering and Wantonness,</hi> &amp;c. When the Lord commandeth us not to be angry with our Brother, the End of Meekness, and why the Lord infuseth it, is to keep us from unadvised rash Anger. So Faith, the End of it is to take Jesus Christ, to make us obedient to the Command of the Gospel, which commands us to believe in him. So as all Graces do join together, but to Frame and Fashion the Soul to Obedience; then so much Obedience as is in your Lives, so much Grace in your Hearts, and no more. Therefore ask your Hearts, how subject you are to the Lord in your Lives? It was the Counsel that <hi>Francis Spira</hi> gave to them about him, saith he, Learn all of me to take Heed of severing Faith and Obedience; I taught Justification by Faith, but neglected Obedience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this befallen me.

The constant and indissoluble Connection that there is between a christian Principle and Profession in the true Saints, and the Fruit of holy Practice in their Lives, was typified of Old in the Frame of the golden Candlestick in the Temple. 'Tis beyond Doubt that that golden Candlestick, with its seven Branches and seven Lamps, was a Type of the Church of Christ.

So it is in the Church of Christ: There is the Principle of Fruit in Grace in the Heart; and there is an amiable Profession, signified by the open Flowers of the Candlestick; and there is answerable Fruit, in holy Practice, constantly attending this Principle and Profession. Every Branch of the golden Candlestick, thus compos'd of golden Apples and Flowers, was crown'd with a burning, shining Lamp on the Top of it. For 'tis by this Means that the Saints shine as Lights in the World, by making a fair and good Profession of Religion, and having their Profession evermore join'd with answerable Fruit in Practice: Agreeable to that of our Saviour, Matth. 5. 15, 16. <hi>Neither do Men light a Candle, and put it under a Bushel, but on a Candlestick; and it

Therefore we find that Apples and Flowers were not only the Ornaments of the Candlestick in the Temple, but of the Temple it self, which is a Type of the Church; which the Apostle tells us <hi>is the Temple of the living God.</hi> See 1 Kings 6. 18. <hi>And the Cedar of the House within, was carved with Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ps and open Flowers.</hi> The Ornaments and Crown of the Pillars, at the Entrance of the Temple, were of the same Sort: They were Lillies and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, or Flowers and Fruits mix'd together: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 18, 19. So it is with all those that are <hi>as Pillars in the Temple of God, who shall go no more out,</hi> or never be ejected as Intruders; as it is with all true Saints; Rev. 3. 12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much the same Thing seems to be signified by the Ornaments on the Skirt of the Ephod, the Garment of <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Priest; which were golden Bells and Pomegranates. That these Skirts of <hi>Aaron'</hi>s Garment represent the Church, or the Saints (that are as it were the Garment of Christ) is manifest; for they are evidently so spoken of, Psal. 133. 1, 2. <hi>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity! It is like the precious Ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even</hi> Aaron'<hi>s Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Garments.</hi> That Ephod of <hi>Aaron</hi> signified the same with the seamless Coat of Christ our great high Priest. As Christ's Coat had no Seam, but was woven from the Top throughout, so it was with the Ephod, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 22. As God took Care in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that Christ's Coat should not be rent; so God took special Care that the Ephod should not be rent; <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 32. and Chap. 39. 23. The golden Bells on this Ephod, by their precious Matter and pleasant Sound, do well represent the good Profession that the Saints make; and the Pomegranates, the Fruit they bring forth. And as in the Hem of the Ephod, Bells and Pomegranates were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly connected, as is once and again observed, there was <hi>a golden Bell and a Pomegranate, a golden Bell and a Pomegranate,</hi> Exod. 28. 34. and Chap. 39. 26. So it is in the true Saints; their good Profession and their good Fruit, do constantly accompany one another: The Fruit they bring forth in Life, evermore answers the pleasant Sound of their Profession.</p>
               <p>Again, The very same Thing is represented by Christ, in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of his Spouse, Cant. 7. 2. <hi>Thy Belly is like an Heap of Wheat, set about with Lillies.</hi> Here again are beautiful Flowers, and good Fruit, accompanying one another. The Lillies were fair and beautiful Flowers, and the Wheat was good Fruit.</p>

As this Fruit of christian Practice is evermore sound in true Saints, according as they have Opportunity and Trial, so it is found in them only; none but true Christians do live such an obedient Life, so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally devoted to their Duty, and given up to the Business of a Christian, as has been explain'd.

Many natural Men, under the Means that are used with them, and God's Strivings with them to bring them to forsake their Sins, do by their Sins, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did by his Pride and Coveteousness, which he gratified by keeping the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in Bondage, when God strove with him to bring him to let the People go. When God's Hand pressed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sore, and he was exercised with Fears of God's future Wrath, he entertain'd some Thoughts of letting the People go, and promised he would do it; But from Time to Time he broke his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, when he saw there was Respit. When God fill'd <hi>Egypt</hi> with Thunder and Lightning, and the Fire ran along the Ground, then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is brought to confess his Sin with seeming Humility, and to have a great Resolution to let the People go, Exod. 9. 27, 28. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>sent and called for</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and said unto them, I have sinned this Time; the Lord is Righteous, and I and my People are wicked: Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty Thunderings and Hail, and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.</hi> So Sinners are sometimes, by Thunders and Lightnings, and great Terrors of the Law, brought to a seeming Work of Humiliation, and to Appearance to part with their Sins; but are no more thoroughly brought to a Disposition to dismiss them, than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to let the People go. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Struggle that was between his Conscience and his Lusts, was for contriving that God might be served, and he enjoy his Lusts that were gratified by the Slavery of the People, too. <hi>Moses</hi> insisted that <hi>Israel'</hi>s God should be served and sacrificed to: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was willing to consent to that; but would have it done without his parting with the People: <hi>Go sacrifice to your God in the Land,</hi> says he, Exod. 8. 25. So many Sinners are for contriving to serve God, and enjoy their Lusts too. <hi>Moses</hi> objected against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s Proposal, that serving God, and yet continuing in <hi>Egypt</hi> under their Task-masters, did not agree together, and were inconsistent one with another; (there is no serving God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Slaves to such Enemies of God at the same Time.) After this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> consented to let the People go, provided they would not go far away: He was not willing to part with them finally, and therefore would have them within Reach. So do many Hypocrites with Respect to their Sins. Afterwards <hi>Pharoah</hi> consented to let the <hi>Men</hi> go, if they would leave the <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> Exod. 10. 8, 9, 10. And then after that, when God's Hand was yet harder upon him, he consented that they should go, even <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> as well as <hi>Men,</hi> provided they would leave their <hi>Cattle</hi> behind: But he was not willing to let them go, and all that they had; <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 24. So it oftentimes is with Sinners: They are willing to part with some of their Sins; but not all: They are brought to part with the more gross Acts of Sin; but not to part with their Lusts, in lesser Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of 'em. Whereas we must part with all our Sins, little and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They must all be let go, with <hi>their Young, and with their Old, with their Sons, and with their Daughters, with their Flocks, and with their Herds; there must not be an Hoof left behind:</hi> As <hi>Moses</hi> told <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> with Respect to the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> At last, when it came to Extremity, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> consented to let the People all go, and all that they had; but he was not stedfastly of that Mind: He soon repented, and pursued after them again: And the Reason was, that those Lusts of Pride and Coveteousness, that were gratfied by <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the People, and the Gains of their Service, were never really mortified in him, but only violently restrained. And thus, he being guilty of backsliding, after his seeming Compliance with God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands was destroyed without Remedy. Thus there may be a forced parting with Ways of Disobedience to the Commands of God, that may seem to be universal, as to what appears, for a little Season: But because 'tis a meer Force, without the Mortification of the inward Principle of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will not persevere in it; but will return as the Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There were many false Disciples in Christ's Time, that followed him for a while; but none of them followed him to the End; but some on one Occasion, and some on another, went back and walked no more with him. <note n="†" place="bottom">

From what has been said it is manifest, that christian Practice or a holy Life is <hi>a great and distinguishing Sign</hi> of true and saving Grace. But I may go further, and assert, that it is <hi>the chief</hi> of all the Signs of Grace, both as an Evidence of the Sincerity of Professors unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and also to their own Consciences.</p>
               <p>But then it is necessary that this be rightly taken, and that it be well understood and observed, in what Sense and Manner christian Practice is the <hi>greatest Sign</hi> of Grace. Therefore, to set this Matter in a clear Light, I will endeavour particularly and distinctly to prove, that christian Practice is the <hi>principal Sign</hi> by which Christians are to judge, both of their own and others Sincerity of Godliness; withal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving some Things that are needful to be particularly noted, in order to a right understanding of this Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I shall consider christian Practice and an holy Life, as a Manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Sign of the Sincerity of a professing Christian, <hi>to the Eye of his Neighbours</hi> and Brethren.</p>
               <p>And that this is the <hi>chief Sign</hi> of Grace in this Respect, is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Word of God. Christ, who knew best how to give us Rules to judge of others, has repeated it and inculcated it, that we should know them by their Fruits; Matth. 7. 16. <hi>Ye shall know them by their Fruits.</hi> And then after arguing the Point, and giving clear Reasons why it must needs be, that Men's Fruits must be the chief Evidence of what Sort they are, in the following Verses, he
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:005767_0301_102708AAB4B47268"/>
closes by repeating the Assertion: Verse 20. <hi>Wherefore by their Fruits ye shall knew them.</hi> Again, Chap. 12. 33. <hi>Either make the Tree good, and his Fruit good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </gap> make the Tree corrupt, and his Fruit corrupt.</hi>—As much as to say, 'tis a very absurd Thing, for any to suppose that the Tree is good, and yet the Fruit bad, that the Tree is of one Sort, and the Fruit of another; for the proper Evidence of the Nature of the Tree is it's Fruit. Nothing else can be intended by that last Clause in the Verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>For the Tree is known by it's Fruit,</hi> than that the Tree is chiefly known by its Fruit, that this is the main &amp; most proper Diagnostick by which one Tree is distinguished from another. So Luke 6. 44. <hi>Every Tree is known by his own Fruit.</hi> Christ no where says, Ye shall know the Tree by it's Leaves or Flowers, or ye shall know Men by their Talk, or ye shall know them by the good Story they tell of their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, or ye shall know them by the Manner and Air of their speaking, and Emphasis and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Fruit.</hi> And as this is the Evidence that Christ has directed us mainly to look at in others, in judging of them, so it is the Evidence that Christ has mainly directed us to give to others, whereby they may judge of us; Matth. 5. 10. <hi>Let your Light so shine before Men, that others seeing your good Works, may glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Here Christ directs us to manifest our Godliness to others. Godliness is as it were a Light that shines in the Soul: Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that this Light should not only shine within, but that it should <hi>shine</hi> out <hi>before Men,</hi> that they may see it. But which Way shall this be? 'Tis by our good Works. Christ don't say, that others hearing your good Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your good Story, or your pathetical Expressions; but <hi>that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> your good Works, may glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Doubtless when Christ gives us a Rule how to make our Light shine, that others may have Evidence of it, his Rule is the best that is to be found. And the Apostles do mention a christian Practice, as the principal Ground of their Esteem of Persons as true Christians. As the Apostle <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>,</hi> in the 6th Chapter of <hi>Hebrews.</hi> There the Apostle in the Beginning of the Chapter, speaks of them that have great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illuminations, that have <hi>been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly Gift, and were made Partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the good Word of God and the Powers of the World to come, that afterwards fall away,</hi> and are like barren Ground, <hi>that is nigh unto cursing, whose End is to be burned:</hi> And then immediately adds in the 9th Verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (expressing his Charity for the Christian <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as having that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, which is better than all these common Illuminations) <hi>But beloved, we are pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Salvation; tho' we thus speak.</hi> And then in the next Verse, he tells 'em what was the Reason he had such good Thoughts of 'em: He don't say, that it was because they had given him a good Account of a Work of God upon their Souls, and talked very experimentally; but it was their Work, and Labour of Love; <hi>For God is not unrighteous, to forget your Work, and Labour of Love, which ye have shewed towards his Name, in that ye have ministred to the Saints, and do minister.</hi> And the same Apostle speaks of a faithful serving God in Practice, as the proper Proof to others of Men's loving Christ above all, and preferring his Honour to their private Interest. Phil. 2. 21, 22. <hi>For all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they testified that he had given 'em a good Account of the Steps of his Experiences, and talk'd like one that felt what he said, and had the very Language of a Christian; but they testified, <hi>that he walked in the Truth;</hi> as it follows, <hi>even as thou walkest in the Truth. I have no greater Joy, than to hear that my Children walk in the Truth. Beloved, thou dost faithfully, whatsoever thou dost to the Brethren and to Strangers; which have born Witness of thy Charity before the Church.</hi> Thus the Apostle explains what the Brethren had born Witness of, when they <hi>came and testified of his walking in the Truth.</hi> And the Apostle seems in this same Place, to give it as a Rule to <hi>Gains</hi> how he should judge of others; in Verse 10, he mentions one <hi>Distrephes,</hi> that did not carry himself well, and led away others after him; and then in the 11th Verse he directs <hi>Gains</hi> to beware of such, and not to follow them; and gives him a Rule whereby he may know them, exactly agreable to that Rule Christ had given before, <hi>By their Fruits ye shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not seen God.</hi> And I would further observe that the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> expresly comparing that Way of shewing others our Faith and Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity by our Practice or Works, with other Ways of shewing our Faith without Works, or not by Works, does plainly and abundantly prefer the Former; Jam. 2. 18. <hi>Yea a Man may say, thou hast Faith and I have Works: Shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will shew thee my Faith by my Works.</hi> A Manifestation of our Faith <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works,</hi> or in a Way diverse from Works, is a Manifestation of it in <hi>Words,</hi> whereby a Man professes Faith. As the Apostle says, Ver. 14. <hi>What doth it profit, my Brethren, tho' a Man</hi> SAY <hi>he hath Faith?</hi>—Therefore here are two Ways of manifesting to our Neighbour
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:005767_0303_102708AF06704508"/>
what is in our Hearts; one by what we <hi>say,</hi> and the other by what we <hi>do.</hi> But the Apostle abundantly prefers the Latter as the best Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now certainly all Accounts we give of ourselves in Words, our saying that we have Faith, and that we are converted, and telling the Manner how we came to have Faith, and the Steps by which it was wrought, and the Discoveries and Experiences that accompanied it, are still but manifesting our Faith by what we <hi>say;</hi> 'tis but shewing our Faith by our <hi>Words;</hi> which the Apostle speaks of as falling vastly short of manifesting of it by what we do, and shewing our Faith by our <hi>Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Scripture plainly teaches that Practice is the best Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Sincerity of professing Christians; so Reason teaches the same Thing. Reason shews that Men's Deeds are better and more faithful Interpreters of their Minds, than their Words. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense of all Mankind, thro' all Ages and Nations, teaches 'em to judge of Men's Hearts chiefly by their Practice, in other Matters: As whether a Man be a loyal Subject, a true Lover, a dutiful Child, or a faithful Servant. If a Man professes a great deal of Love and Friendship to another, Reason teaches all Men, that such a Profession is not so great an Evidence of his being a real and hearty Friend, as his appearing a Friend in Deeds; being faithful and constant to his Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Prosperity and Adversity, ready to lay out himself, and deny himself, and suffer in his personal Interest, to do him a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. A wise Man will trust to such Evidences of the Sincerity of Friendship, further than a thousand earnest Professors and solemn Declarations, and most affectionate Expressions of Friendship in Words. And there is equal Reason why Practice should also be looked upon as the best Evidence of Friendship towards Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reason says the same that Christ said, in John 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>veth me.</hi> Thus if we see a Man, who in the Course of his Life, seems to follow and imitate Christ, and greatly to exert and deny himself for the Honour of Christ and to promote his Kingdom and Interest in the World; Reason teaches that this is an Evidence of Love to Christ, more to be depended on, than if a Man only says he has Love to Christ, and tells of the inward Experiences he has had of Love to him, what strong Love he felt, and how his Heart was drawn out in Love at such and such a Time, when it may be there appears but little Imitation of Christ in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and he seems backward to do any great Matter for him, or to put himself out of his Way for the promoting of his Kingdom, but seems to be apt to excuse himself, whenever he is called to deny himself for Christ. So if a Man in declaring his Experiences, tells how he found his Heart weaned from the World, and saw the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it, so that all looked as nothing to him, at such and such Times, and professes that he gives up all to God, and calls Heaven and Earth
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:005767_0304_102708B56C7A94D8"/>
to witness to it; but yet in his Practice is violent in pursuing the World, and what he gets he keeps close, is exceeding loth to part with much of it to charitable and pious Uses, it comes from him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most like his Heart's Blood. But there is another professing Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that says not a great deal, yet in his Behaviour appears ready at all Times to forsake the World, whenever it stands in the Way of his Duty, and is free to part with it at any Time, to promote Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Good of his Fellow Creatures; Reason teaches that the Latter gives far the most cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

And if a Man appears to walk humbly before God and Men, and to be of a Conversation that favours of a broken Heart, appearing patient and resign'd to God under Affection, and meek in his Behaviour amongst Men; this is a better Evidence of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than if a Person only tells how great a Sense he had of his own Unworthiness, how he was brought to lie in the Dust, and was quite emptied of himself, and see himself nothing and all ever fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="297" facs="unknown:005767_0305_102708B868865FD8"/>
Thus it is plain that christian Practice is the best Sign or Manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the true Godliness of a professing Christian, to the Eye of his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>But then the following Things should be well observed, that this Matter may be rightly understood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It must be observed, that when the Scripture speaks of chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Practice, as the best Evidence to others, of Sincerity and Truth of Grace, <hi>a Profession of Christianity</hi> is not excluded, but supposed. The Rules mention'd were Rules given to the Followers of Christ, to guide them in their Thoughts of <hi>professing Christians,</hi> and those that offered themselves as some of their Society, whereby they might judge of the Truth of their <hi>Pretences,</hi> and the Sincerity of the <hi>Profession</hi> they made; and not for the Trial of Heathens, or those that made no Pretence to Christianity, and that Christians had nothing to do with. This is as plain as is possible in that great Rule which Christ gives in the 7th of Matthew, <hi>By their Fruits ye shall know them.</hi> He there gives a Rule how to judge of those that professed to be Christians, yea that made a very high Profession, <hi>false Prophets, who come in Sheep's C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>thing,</hi> as Verse 15. So it is also with that of the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2. 18. <hi>Shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will shew thee my Faith by my Works.</hi> 'Tis evident that both these Sorts of Persons, offering to give these diverse Evidences of their Faith, are Professors of Faith: This is implied in their offering each of them to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Faith they professed. And 'tis evident by the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verses, that the Apostle is speaking of Professors of Faith in Jesus Christ. So it is very plain that the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> in those Passages that have been observed in his third Epistle, is speaking of professing Christians. Tho' in these Rules, the christian Practice of Professors be spoken of as the greatest and most distinguishing Sign of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in their Profession, much more evidential than their Profession it self; yet a Profession of Christianity is plainly presupposed: It is not the main Thing in the Evidence, nor any Thing distinguishing in it; yet 'tis a Thing requisite and necessary in it. As the having an animal Body, is not any Thing distinguishing of a Man, from other Creatures, and is not the main Thing in the Evidence of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet 'tis a Thing requisite and necessary in the Evidence. So that if any Man should say plainly that he was not a Christian, and did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God, or a Person sent of God; these Rules of Christ and his Apostles don't at all oblige us to look upon him as a sincere Christian, let his visible Practice and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, be what they will. And not only do these Rules take no place with Respect to a Man that explicitly denies Christianity, and is a profess'd Deist, Jew, Heathen, or open Infidel; but also with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to a Man that only forbears to make a Profession of Christianity:
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:005767_0306_102708BCB8406018"/>
Because these Rules were given us only to judge of professing Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: Fruits must be join'd with open Flowers; Bells and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates go together.</p>
               <p>But here will naturally arise this Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> when a Man may be said to profess Christianity, or what Profession may properly be called a Profession of Christianity?</p>
               <p>I answer in two Things;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In order to a Man's being properly said to make a Profession of Christianity, there must undoubtedly be a Profession of all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to his being a Christian, or of so much as belongs to the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christianity. Whatsoever is essential in Christianity it self, the Profession of that is essential in the Profession of Christianity. The Profession must be of the Thing professed. For a Man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Christianity, is for him to declare that he has it. And therefore so much as belongs to a Thing, so as to be necessary in order to its being truly denominated <hi>that</hi> Thing; so much is essential to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of <hi>that</hi> Thing, in order to its being truly denominated a Declaration of <hi>that</hi> Thing. If we take only a Part of Christianity, and leave out a Part that is essential to it, what we take is not Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity; because something that is of the Essence of it is wanting. So if we profess only a Part, and leave out a Part that is essential, that which we profess is not Christianity. Thus in order to a Profession of Christianity, we must profess that we believe that <hi>Jesus</hi> is the <hi>Messiah;</hi> for this Reason, because such a Belief is essential to Christianity. And so we must profess, either expresly or implicitly, that <hi>Jesus</hi> satisfied for our Sins, and other essential Doctrines of the Gospel; because a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of these Things also are essential to Christianity. But there are other Things as essential to Religion, as an orthodox Belief; which it is therefore as necessary that we should profess, in order to our being truly said to profess Christianity. Thus it is essential to Christianity that we repent of our Sins, that we be convinced of our own Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that we are sensible we have justly exposed our selves to God's Wrath, and that our Hearts do renounce all Sin, and that we do with our whole Hearts embrace Christ as our only Saviour, &amp; that we love him above all, and are willing for his Sake to forsake all, and that we do give up our selves to be entirely and forever his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Things as these do as much belong to the Essence of Christianity, as the Belief of any of the Doctrines of the Gospel: And therefore the Profession of them does as much belong to a christian Profession. Not that in order to a being professing Christians, 'tis necessary that there should be an explicit Profession of every individual Things that belongs to christian Grace or Vertue: But certainly, there must be a Profession, either express <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> implicit, of what is of the Essence of Religion. And as to those Things that Christians should <hi>express</hi> in their Profession, we ought to be guided by the Precepts of God's Word,
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:005767_0307_102708C2160878F0"/>
or by Scripture Examples of publick Professions of Religion, God's People have made from Time to Time. Thus they ought to profess their Repentance of Sin: As of Old, when Persons were initiated as Professors, they came confessing their Sins, manifesting their Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6. And the Baptism they were baptized with, was called <hi>the Baptism of Repentance,</hi> Mark 1. 3. And <hi>John,</hi> when he had baptized them, exhorted them <hi>to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> Matth. 3. 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> agreeable to that Repentance which they had professed; encouraging them, that if they did so, they should escape the Wrath to come, and be gather'd as Wheat into God's Garner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. So the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> says to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 2. 38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized:</hi> Which shews that Repentance is a Qualification that must be visible in order to Baptism; and therefore ought to be publickly professed. So when the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> that returned from Captivity, entred publickly into Covenant, it was with Confession, or publick Profession of Repentance of their Sins, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. This Profession of Repentance should include or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mply a Profession of Conviction that God would be just in our Damnation: See <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 33. together with Verse 35. and the Beginning of the next Chapter. They should profess their Faith in Jesus Christ, and that they embrace Christ, and rely upon him as their Saviour, with their whole Hearts, and that they do joyfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Gospel of Christ. Thus <hi>Philip,</hi> in order to baptizing the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ch, required that he should profess that he <hi>believed with all his Heart:</hi> And they that were received as visible Christians, at that great Outpouring of the Spirit, which began at the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd <hi>gladly to receive the Gospel;</hi> Acts 2. 4. <hi>Then they that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word, were baptized, and the same Day there were added unto them about three Thousand Souls.</hi> They should profess that they rely only on Christ's Righteousness and Strength, and that they are devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, as their only Lord and Saviour, and that they rejoice in him as their only Righteousness and Portion. It is foretold that all Nations should be brought publickly to make this Profession, Isai. 45. 22, to the End; <hi>Look to me, and be ye saved, all the Ends of the Earth; for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by my self, the Word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every Knee shall how, every Tongue shall swear. Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I Righteousness and Strength. Even to him shall Men come: And all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. In the Lord shall all the Seed of</hi> Israel <hi>be justified, and shall glory.</hi> They should profess to give up themselves entirely to Christ, and to God thro' him; as the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized their Covenant with God; Deut. 26. 17. <hi>Thou hast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched the Lord this Day to be thy God, and to walk in his Ways, and to keep his Statutes, and his Commandments, and his Judgments, and to
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:005767_0308_102708C3B20A8818"/>
hearken unto his Voice.</hi> They ought to profess a Willingness of Heart to embrace Religion with all its Difficulties, and to walk in a Way of Obedience to God universally and perseveringly; Exod. 19. 8. and 24. 3, 7. Deut. 26. 16, 17, 18. 2 Kings 23. 3. Nehem. 10. 28, 29. Psal. 119. 57, 106. They ought to profess that all their Hearts and Souls are in these Engagements to be the Lord's, and for ever to serve him; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 12, 13, 14. God's People's swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and swearing <hi>by</hi> his Name, or <hi>to</hi> his Name, as it might be render'd, (by which seems to be signified their solemnly giving up themselves to him in Covenant, and vowing to receive him as their God, and to be entirely his, to obey and serve him) is spoken of as a Duty to be performed by all God's visible <hi>Israel;</hi> Deut. 6. 13. and 10. 20. Psal. 63. 11. Isai. 19. 18. Chap. 45. 23, 24. compared with Rom. 14. 11. and Phil. 2. 10, 11. Isai. 48. 1, 2. and 65. 15, 16. Jer. 4. 2. and 5. 7. and 12. 16. Hos. 4. 15. and 10. 4. Therefore, in order to Persons being entitled to full Esteem and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with their Neighbours, as being sincere Professors of Christianity; by those foremention'd Rules of Christ and his Apostles, there must be a visibly holy Life, with a Profession, either expressing, or plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying such Things as those which have been now mention'd. We are to <hi>know them by their Fruits;</hi> that is, we are by their Fruits to know whether they be what they profess to be; not that we are to know by their Fruits, that they have something in them, which they don't so much as pretend to.</p>
               <p>And moreover,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Profession of these Things, which is properly called a chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Profession, and which must be joined with christian Practice, in order to Person's being entitled to the Benefit of those Rules, must be made (as to what appears) understandingly: that is, they must be Persons that appear to have been so far instructed in the Principles of Religion, as to be in an ordinary Capacity to understand the proper Import of what is express'd in their Profession. For Sounds are no Significations or Declarations of any Thing, any further than Men understand the Meaning of their own Sounds.</p>
               <p>But in order to Persons making a proper Profession of Christianity, such as the Scripture directs to, and such as the Followers of Christ should require, in order to the Acceptance of the Professors with full Charity, as of their Society; 'tis not necessary they should give an Account of the particular Steps and Method, by which the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, sensibly to them, wrought and brought about those great essential Things of Christianity in their Hearts. There is no Footstep in the Scripture of any such Way of the Apostles, or primitive Ministers and Christians requiring any such Relation, in order to their receiving and treating others, as their christian Brethren, to all Intents and Purposes,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:005767_0309_102708CA37E8D208"/>
or of their first examining them, concerning the particular Method and Order of their Experiences. They required of them a Profession of the Things wrought; but no Account of the Manner of Working was required of them. Nor is there the least Shadow in the Scripture of any such Custom in the Church of God, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Death of the Apostle <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am far from saying that it is not requisite that Persons should give any Sort of Account of their Experiences to their Brethren. For Persons to profess those Things wherein the Essence of Christianity lies, is the same Thing as to profess that they <hi>experience</hi> those Things Thus for Persons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> Rejection and eternal Wrath, without Mercy, and the utter Insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their own Righteousness, or any thing in them, to satisfy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice, or recommend 'em to God's Favour, they do only and entirely depend on the Lord Jesus Christ and his Satisfaction and Righteousness; that they do with all their Hearts believe the Truth of the Gospel of Christ; and that in a full Conviction and Sense of his Sufficiency and perfect Excellency as a Saviour, as exhibited in the Gospel, they do with their whole Souls cleave to him, and acquiesce in him, as the Refuge and Rest of their Souls, and Fountain of their Comfort; that they repent of their Sins, and utterly renounce all Sin, and give up themselves wholly to Christ, willingly subjecting themselves to him as their King; that they give him their Hearts and their whole Man; and are willing and resolved to have God for their whole and everlasting Portion; and in a Dependance on his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of a future eternal Enjoyment of him in Heaven, to renounce all the Enjoyments of this vain World, selling all for this great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and future Inheritance, and to comply with every Command of God, even the most difficult and self-denying, and devote their whole Lives to God's Service; and that in Forgiveness of those that have injured them, and a general Benevol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ce to Mankind, their Hearts are united to the People of Jesus Christ as their People, to cleave to them and love them as their Brethren, and worship and serve God and follow Christ in Union and Fellowship with them, being willing and resolved to perform all those Duties that belong to them, as Members of the same Family of God and mystical Body of Christ; I say, for Persons solemnly to profess such Things as these, as in the Presence of God, is the same Thing, as to profess that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to, or do <hi>experience</hi> such Things in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Nor is it what I suppose, that Persons giving an Account of their Experience of particular Exercises of Grace, with the Times and Circumstances, gives no Advantage to others in forming a Judgment of their State; or that Persons may not fitly be enquired of concerning
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:005767_0310_102708CCE8DA38B0"/>
these in some Cases, especially Cases of great Importance, where all possible Satisfaction concerning Persons Piety is especially to be desired and sought after, as in the Case of Ordination or Approbation of a Minister. It may give Advantage in forming a Judgment, in several Respects; and among others, in this, That hereby we may be better satisfied that the Professor speaks honestly and understandingly, in what he professes; and that he don't make the Profession in meer Formality. In order to a Profession of Christianity being accepted to any Purpose, there ought to be good Reason, from the Circumstances of the Profession, to think that the Professor don't make such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession out of a meer customary Compliance with a prescribed Form, using Words without any distinct Meaning, or in a very lax and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Manner, as Confessions of Faith are often subscribed; but that the Professor understandingly and honestly signifies what he is conscious of in his own Heart; otherwise his Profession can be of no Significance, and no more to be regarded than the Sound of Things without Life. But indeed (whatever Advantage an Account of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Exercises may give in judging of this) it must be own'd that the Professor having been previously thoroughly instructed by his Teachers, and giving good Proof of his sufficient Knowledge, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Practice agreable to his Profession, is the best Evidence of this.</p>
               <p>Nor do I suppose, but that, if a Person that is enquired of about particular Passages, Times and Circumstances of his christian Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, among other Things, seems to be able to give a distinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Manner of his first Conversion, in such a Method as has been frequently observable in true Conversion, so that Things seem sensibly and distinctly to follow one another, in the Order of Time, according to the Order of Nature; it is an illustrating Circumstance, that among other Things, adds Lustre to the Evidence he gives his Brethren of the Truth of his Experiences.</p>
               <p>But the Thing that I speak of as unscriptural, is the insisting on a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of the distinct Method and Steps, wherein the Spirit of God did sensibly proceed, in first bringing the Soul into a State of Salvation, as a Thing requisite in order to receiving a Professor into full Charity as a real Christian; or so, as for the Want of such Relation, to disregard other Things in the Evidence Persons give to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of their Christianity, that are vastly more important and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we may rightly understand how christian Practice is the greatest Evidence that others can have of the Sincerity of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christian, 'tis needful that what was said before, shewing what christian Practice is, should be borne in Mind; and that it should be consider'd how far this may be visible to others. Meerly that a
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:005767_0311_102708D2180B6158"/>
Professor of Christianity is what is commonly called an honest Man, and a moral Man, (<hi>i. e.</hi> we have no special Transgression or Iniquity to charge him with, that might bring a Blot on his Character) is no great Evidence of the Sincerity of his Profession. This is not <hi>making his Light shine before Men.</hi> This is not that <hi>Work and Labour of Love shewed towards Christ's Name,</hi> which gave the Apostle such Perswasion of the Sincerity of the professing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 6. 9, 10. It may be so, that we may see nothing in a Man, <hi>but that he may be</hi> a good Man, there may appear nothing in his Life and Conversation incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with his being godly, and yet neither may there be any great positive Evidence <hi>that he is</hi> so. But there may be great positive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liness in Men's visible Behaviour: Their Life may appear to be a Life of the Service of God: They may appear to follow the Example of Jesus Christ, and come up in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to those excellent Rules in the 5th, 6th, and 7th Chapters of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and 12th of <hi>Romans,</hi> and many other Parts of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament: There may be a great Appearance of their being univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal in their Obedience to Christ's Commands and the Rules of the Gospel. They may appear to be universal in the Performance of the Duties of the first Table, manifesting the Fear and Love of God: and also universal in fulfilling Rules of Love to Men, Love to Saints, and Love to Enemies; Rules of Meekness and Forgiveness, Rules of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Charity, and looking not only at our own Things, but also at the Things of others; Rules of doing Good to Men's Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to particular Persons and to the Publick; Rules of Temperance and Mortification, and of an humble Conversation; Rules of bridling the Tongue, and improving it to glorify God and bless Men, shewing that in their Tongues is the Law of Kindness. They may appear to walk as Christians in all Places, and at all Seasons, in the House of God, and in their Families, and among their Neighbours, on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Days, and every Day, in Business and in Conversation, towards Friends and Enemies, towards Superiours, Interiours and Equals. Persons in their visible Walk may appear to be very earnestly engaged in the Service of God and Mankind, much to labour and lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this Work of a Christian, and to be very constant and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in it, under all Circumstances and Temptations. There may be great Manifestations of a Spirit to deny themselves, and suffer for God and Christ, and the Interest of Religion, and the Benefit of their Brethren. There may be great Appearances in a Man's Walk, of a Disposition to forsake any Thing, rather than to forsake Christ, and to make every Thing give Place to his Honour. There may be great Manifestations in a Man's Behaviour of such Religion as this being his Element, and of his placing the Delight and Happiness of his Life in it: And his Conversation may be such, that he may carry with him a sweet Odour of christian Graces and heavenly Dispositions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes. And when it is thus in the Professors of Christianity,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:005767_0312_102708D6C2E9D1B0"/>
here is an Evidence to others of their Sincerity in their Profession, to which all other Manifestations are not worthy to be compared.</p>
               <p>There is doubtless a great Variety in the Degrees of Evidence that Professors do exhibit of their Sincerity, in their Life and Practice; as there is a Variety in the Fairness and Clearness of Accounts Persons give of the Manner and Method of their Experiences: But undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly such a Manifestation as has been described, of a christian Spirit in Practice, is vastly beyond the fairest and brightest Story of particular Steps and Passages of Experience, that ever was told. And in general a Manifestation of the Sincerity of a christian Profession in Practice, is far better than a Relation of Experiences.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It must be noted, agreeable to what was formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That no external Manifestations and outward Appearances whatsoever, that are visible to the World, are infallible Evidences of Grace. These Manifestations that have been mention'd, are the best that Mankind can have; and they are such as do oblige Christians entirely to embrace Professors as Saints, and love 'em and rejoice in 'em as the Children of God, and are sufficient to give them as great Satisfaction concerning them, as ever is needful to guide them in their Conduct, or for any Intent &amp; Purpose that needs to be answered in this World. But nothing that appears to them in their Neighbour, can be sufficient to beget an absolute Certainty concerning the State of his Soul: For they see not his Heart, nor can they see all his external Behaviour; for much of it is in secret, and hid from the Eye of the World: And 'tis impossible certainly to determine, how far a Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay go in many external Appearances and Imitations of Grace, from other Principles. Tho' undoubtedly, if others could see so much of what belongs to Men's Practice, as their own Consciences may see of it, it might be an infallible Evidence of their State, as will appear from what follows.</p>
               <p>Having thus consider'd christian Practice as the <hi>best Evidence</hi> of the Sincerity of Professors <hi>to others,</hi> I now proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To observe that the Scripture also speaks of christian Practice as a distinguishing and sure Evidence of Grace to <hi>Persons own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi> This is very plain in 1 John 2. 3. <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</hi> And the Testimony of our Consciences, with Respect to our good Deeds, is spoken of as that which may give us Assurance of our own Godliness; 1 John 3. 18, 19. <hi>My little Children, let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed</hi> (in the Original it is EPTO <hi>in Work</hi>) <hi>and in Truth. And hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

him.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in Heb. 6. speaks of <hi>the Work, and Labour of Love,</hi> of the christian <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as that which both gave him a Perswasion that they had something above the highest common Illuminations, and also as that Evidence which tended to give them the highest Assurance of Hope concerning themselves; Ver. 9. &amp;c. <hi>But Beloved, we are perswaded better Things of you, and Things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation, tho' we thus speak. For God is not unrighteous, to forget your Work, and Labour of Love, which ye have shewed towards his Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that ye have ministred to his Saints, and do minister. And we desire that every one of you do shew the same Diligence, to the full Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Hope, unto the End.</hi> So the Apostle directs the <hi>Galatians</hi> to examine their Behaviour or Practice, that they might have Rejoicing in themselves in their own happy State: Gal. 6. 4. <hi>Let every Man prove his own Work; so shall he have Rejoicing in himself, and not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> And the Psalmist says, Psal. 119. 6. <hi>Then shall I not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed, when I have Respect to all thy Commandments. i. e.</hi> Then shall I be bold and assured and stedfast in my Hope.

               <p>But for the greater Clearness in this Matter, I would <hi>First,</hi> Shew how christian Practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doing good Works, or keeping Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is to be taken, when the Scripture represents it as a sure Sign to our own Consciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we are real Christians. And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> will prove that this is the Chief of all Evidences that Men can have of their own sincere Godliness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I would shew how christian Practice, or keeping Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is to be taken, when the Scripture represents it as a sure Evidence to our own Consciences, that we are sincere Christians.</p>
               <p>And here I would observe, that we can't reasonably suppose that when the Scripture in this Case speaks of good Works, good Fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keeping Christ's Commandments; that it has Respect meerly to
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:005767_0314_102708DF8268E5C8"/>
what is external, or the Motion and Action of the Body, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding any thing else, having no Respect to any Aim or Intention of the Agent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any Act of his Understanding or Will. For consider Men's Actions so, and they are no more good Works or Acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, than the regular Motions of a Clock; nor are they consider'd as the Actions of the Men, or any human Actions at all. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Body, taken thus, are neither Acts of Obedience, nor Disobedience; any more than the Motions of the Body in a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But the Obedience &amp; Fruit that is spoken of, is the Obedience &amp; Fruit of the Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore not only the Acts of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Soul, consisting in the Acts and Practice of the Soul. Not that I suppose that when the Scripture speaks, in this Case of gracious Works and Fruit and Practice, that in these Expressions is included all inward Piety and Holiness of Heart, both Principle and Exercise, both Spirit and Practice: Because then, in these Things being given as Signs of a gracious Principle in the Heart, the same Thing would be given as a Sign of it self, and there would be no Distinction between Root and Fruit. But only the gracious Exercise, and holy Act of the Soul is meant, and given as the Sign of the holy Principle, and good Estate. Neither is every Kind of inward Exercise of Grace meant; but the practical Exercise, that Exercise of the Soul, and Exertion of inward Holiness, which there is in an obediential Act; or that Exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind, and Act of Grace, which issues and terminates in what they call the imperate Acts of the Will; in which something is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and commanded by the Soul to be done, and brought to pass in Practice.</p>
               <p>Here for a clearer Understanding, I would observe, that there are two Kinds of Exercises of Grace. 1. There are those that some call <hi>immanent</hi> Acts: That is, those Exercises of Grace that remain within the Soul, that begin &amp; are terminated there, without any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Relation to any Thing to be done outwardly, or to be brought to pass in Practice. Such are the Exercises of Grace, which the Saints often have in <hi>Contemplation:</hi> When the Exercise that is in the Heart, don't directly proceed <hi>to,</hi> or terminate <hi>in</hi> any Thing beyond the Thoughts of the Mind; however they may tend to Practice (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. There is another Kind of Acts of Grace, that are more strictly called <hi>practical,</hi> or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Exercises; because they immediately respect something to be done. They are the Exertions of Grace in the commanding Acts of the Will, directing the outward Actions. As when a Saint gives a Cup of cold Water to a Disciple, in and from the Exercise of the Grace of Charity; or voluntarily endures Persecution, in the Way of his Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immediately from the Exercise of a supream Love to Christ. Here is the Exertion of Grace producing it's Effect in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Such effective Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Grace as these that I have now described, many of the Martyrs have experienc'd in a high Degree. And all true Saints live a Life of such Acts of Grace as these; as they all live a Life of gracious Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which these operative Exertions of Grace are the Life and Soul. And this is the Obedience and Fruit that God mainly looks at, as he looks at the Soul, more than the Body; as much as the Soul, in the Constitution of the human Nature, is the superiour Part. As God looks at the Obedience and Practice of the Man, he looks at the Practice of the Soul: for the Soul is the Man in God's Sight; <hi>For the Lord seeth not as Man seeth, for He looketh on the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it is, that Obedience, good Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good Fruit, are to be taken, when given in Scripture as a sure Evidence to our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of a true Principle of Grace; even as including the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Practice of the Soul, as preceeding and governing the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Body.

Evidence of our true Christianity to others, then is meant that in our Practice which is visible to them, even our outward Actions: But when Practice is given as a sure Evidence of our real Christianity to our own Consciences, then is meant that in our Practice which is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our own Consciences; which is not only the Motion of our Bodies, but the Exertion and Exercise of the Soul, which directs and commands that Motion; which is more directly and immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the View of our own Consciences, than the Act of the Body. And that this is the Intent of the Scripture, not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Argument</hi> I. Reason plainly shews that those Things which put it to the Proof what Men will actually cleave to and prefer in their Practice, when left to follow their own Choice and Inclinations, are the proper Trial what they do really prefer in their Hearts. Sincerity in Religion, as has been observed already, consists in setting God highest in the Heart, in chusing him before other Things, in having a Heart to sell all for Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—. But a Man's Actions are the proper Trial what a Man's Heart prefers. As for Instance, when it is so that God and others Things come to stand in Competition, God is as it were set before a Man on one Hand, and his worldly Interest or Pleasure on the other, (as it often is so in the Course of a Man's Life) his Behaviour in such Case, in actually cleaving to the one and forsaking the other, is the proper Trial which he prefers. Sincerity consists in forsaking all for Christ in Heart; but to forsake all for Christ in Heart, is the very same Thing as to have an Heart to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all for Christ: But certainly the proper Trial whether a Man
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:005767_0319_102708F74FC1B4E8"/>
has an Heart to forsake all for Christ, is his being actually put to it, the having Christ and other Things coming in Competition, that he must actually or practically cleave to one and forsake the other. To forsake all for Christ in Heart, is the same Thing as to have a Heart to forsake all for Christ when called to it: But the highest Proof to our selves and others, that we have an Heart to forsake all for Christ when called to it, is actually doing it when called to it, or so far a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> called to it. To follow Christ in Heart, is to have an Heart to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. To deny our selves in Heart for Christ, is the same Thing as to have an Heart to deny ourselves for him in Fact. The main and most proper Proof of a Man's having an Heart to any Thing, concerning which he is at Liberty to follow his own Inclinations, and either to do or not to do as he pleases, is his doing of it. When a Man is at Liberty whether to speak or keep Silence, the most proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his having an Heart to speak, is his speaking. When a Man is at Liberty whether to walk or fit still, the proper Proof of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Heart to walk, is his walking. Godliness consists not in an Heart to intend to do the Will of God, but in an Heart to do it. The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness had the former, of whom we read, Deut. 5. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it and do it. And the Lord heard the Voice of your Words, when ye spake unto me; and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the Voice of the Words of this People, which they have spoken unto thee: They have well said all that they have spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O that there were such an</hi> HEART <hi>in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever.</hi> The People manifested that they had <hi>a Heart to intend to keep God's Commandments,</hi> and to be very forward in those Intentions; but God manifests that this was far from being the Thing that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, wherein true Godliness consists, even <hi>an Heart actually to keep them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis therefore exceeding absurd, and even ridiculous, for any to pretend that they have a good Heart, while they live a wicked Life, or don't bring forth the Fruit of universal Holiness in their Practice. For 'tis proved in Fact, that such Men don't love God above all. 'Tis foolish to dispute against plain Fact and Experience. Men that live in Ways of Sin, and yet flatter themselves that they shall go to Heaven, or expect to be received hereafter as holy Persons, without a holy Life and Practice, act as tho' they expected to make a Fool of their Judge. Which is implied in what the Apostle says (speaking of Mens doing good Works, and living an holy Life, thereby exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Evidence of their Title to everlasting Life) Gal. 6. 7. <hi>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: For whatsoever a Man soweth, that shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He seem'd as one that would make a Game of them, as tho' they were such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Fools as to regard such Bugbears. But the great Judge, whose Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, will not be mocked or baffled with any Pretences, without a holy Life. It in his Name Men have prophecy'd and wrought Miracles, and have had Faith, so that they could remove Mountains, and cast out Devils, and however high their religious Affections have been, however great Resemblances they have had of Grace, and tho' their hiding Place has been so dark and deep, that no human Skill nor Search could find them out; yet if they are <hi>Workers</hi> or <hi>Practicers of Iniquity,</hi> they can't hide their Hypocrisy from their Judge; Job 34. 22. <hi>There is no Darkness, nor Shadow of Death, where the</hi> WORKERS OF INIQUITY <hi>may hide themselves.</hi> Would a wise Prince suffer himself to be fool'd and baffled by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who should pretend that he was a loyal Subject, and should tell his Prince that he had an entire Affection to him, and that at such and such a Time he had Experience of it, and felt his Affections strongly working towards him, and should come expecting to be accepted and rewarded by his Prince, as one of his best Friends on that Account, tho' he lived in Rebellion against him, following some Pretender to his Crown, and from Time to Time stirring up Sedition against him? Or would a Master suffer himself to be sham'd and gull'd by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that should pretend to great Experiences of Love and Honour towards him in his Heart, and a great Sense of his Worthiness and Kindness to him, when at the same Time he refused to obey him, and he could get no Service done by him?</p>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And from what has been now observed, 'tis evident that they are the most proper Trial or Proof of their Sincerity; Inasmuch as the very Meaning of the Word <hi>Trial,</hi> as it is ordinarily used in Scripture, is the Difficulty occurring in the Way of a Professor's Duty, as the Trial or Experiment of his Sincerity. If <hi>Trial of Sincerity</hi> be the proper Name of these Difficulties of Religion, then doubtless these Difficulties of Religion are <hi>properly and eminently</hi> the Trial of Sincerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they are doubtless eminently what they are called by the holy Ghost: God gives Things their Name from that which is eminently their Nature. And if it be so, that these Things are the proper and eminent Trial, Proof or Experiment of the Sincerity of Professors; then certainly the Result of the Trial or Experiment (that is Persons Behaviour or Practice under such Trials) is the proper and eminent Evidence of their Sincerity. For they are called Trials or Proofs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only with Regard to the Result, and because the Effect is eminently the <hi>Proof,</hi> or <hi>Evidence.</hi> And this is the most proper Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Conscience of those that are the Subjects of these Trials. For when God is said by these Things to <hi>try Men, and prove them, to see what is in their Hearts, and whether they will keep his Commandments or no;</hi> we are not to understand, that it is for his own Information, or that he may obtain Evidence himself of their Sincerity; (for he needs no Trials for his Information) but chiefly for their Conviction, and to exhibit Evidence to their Consciences. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <q>I am perswaded, as <hi>Calvin</hi> is, That all the several Trials of Men, are to shew them to themselves, and to the World, that they be but Counterfeits; and to make Saints known to themselves, the better—Rom. 5. 5. <hi>Tribulation works Trial, and that Hope.</hi> Prov. 17. 3. If you will know whether it will hold Weight, the Trial will tell you.</q>

said to prove <hi>Israel</hi> by the Difficulties they met with in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and by the Difficulties they met with from their Enemies in <hi>Canaan,</hi> to know what was in their Hearts, whether they would keep his Commandments or no; it must be understood that it was to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to themselves, that they might know what was in their own Hearts. So when God tempted or tried <hi>Abraham</hi> with that difficult Command of offering up his Son, it was not for his Satisfaction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he fear'd God or no, but for <hi>Abraham'</hi>s own greater Satisfaction and Comfort, and the more clear Manifestation of the Favour of God to him. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had proved faithful under this Trial, God says to him, <hi>Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld thy Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thine only Son from me.</hi> Which plainly implies that in this practical Exercise of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Grace under this Trial, was a clearer Evidence of the Truth of his Grace, than ever was before; and the greatest Evidence to <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Conscience; because God himself gives it to <hi>Abraham</hi> as such, for his Comfort and Rejoycing; and speaks of it to him, as what might be the greatest Evidence to his Conscience, of his being upright in the Sight of his Judge. Which proves what I say, that holy Practice under Trials is the highest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Sincerity of Professors to their own Consciences. And we find that Christ from Time to Time took the same Method to convince the Consciences of those that pretended Friendship to him, and to shew them what they were. This was the Method he took with the rich young Man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He seem'd to shew a great Respect to Christ; he came kneeling to him, and called him <hi>Good Master,</hi> and made a great Profession of Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; but Christ tried him by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dding him <hi>go and sell all that he had, and give to the Poor, and come and take up his Cross, and follow him;</hi> telling him <hi>that then he should have Treasure in Heaven.</hi> So he tried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that we read of <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 20. He made a great Profession of Respect to Christ: Says he, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</hi> Christ immediately puts his Friendship to the Proof, by telling him that <hi>the Foxes had Holes, and the Birds of the Air had Nests, but that the Son of Man had not where to lay his Head.</hi> And thus Christ is wont still to try professed Disciples in general, in his Providence. So the Seed sown in every Kind of Ground, stony Ground, thorny Ground, and good Ground, which in all appears alike, when it first springs up; yet is tried, and the Difference made to appear, by the burning Heart of the Sun.</p>

Seeing therefore that these are the Things that God makes use of to try us, 'tis undoubtedly the surest Way for us to pass a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on our selves, to try our selves by the same Things. These Trials of his are not for his Information, but for ours; therefore we ought to receive our Information from thence. The surest Way to know our Gold, is to look upon it and examine it in God's Furnace, where he tries it for that End that we may see what it is. If we have a Mind to know whether a Building stands strong or no, we must look upon it when the Wind blows. If we would know whether that which appears in the Form of Wheat, has the real Substance of Wheat, or be only Chaff, we must observe it when it is winnowed. If we would know whether a Staff be strong, or a rotten broken Reed, we must observe it when it is leaned on, and Weight is borne upon it. If we would weigh our selves justly, we must weigh our selves in God's Scales, that he makes use of to weigh us. <note n="*" place="bottom">

the Seed, and in its putting forth Root and Sprout; nor is it perfected when it comes up out of the Ground; nor is it perfected in bringing forth Leaves; nor yet in putting forth Blossoms: But when it has brought forth good ripe Fruit, then it is perfected, therein it reaches its End, the Design of the Tree is finished: All that belongs to the Tree is compleated and brought to its proper Effect in the Fruit: So is Grace in its practical Exercises.

               <p>Now certainly if it be so, if Grace be in this Manner made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in it's Fruit, if these practical Exercises of Grace are those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises wherein Grace is brought to it's proper Effect and End, and the Exercises wherein whatsoever belongs to it's Design, Tendency and Operation is compleated and crown'd; then these Exercises must be the highest Evidences of Grace, above all other Exercises.

If we would see the proper Nature of any Thing whatsoever, and see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it in it's full Distinction from other Things; let us look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in the finishing of it. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> says, <hi>by Works is Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> perfect;</hi> and introduces this as an Argument to prove that Works are the chief Evidence of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby the Sincerity of the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Faith is justified, Jam. 2. And the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> after he had once and again told us, that Love was made perfect in keeping Christ's Commandments, observes 1 John 4. 18, <hi>That perfect Love casteth out Fear.</hi> Meaning (at least in Part) Love made perfect in this Sense; agreable to what he had said in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>That by loving in Deed, or Work, we know that we are of the Truth, and shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our Hearts,</hi> Ver. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> IV. Another Thing which makes it evident that holy Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is the principal Evidence that we ought to make use of in judging both of our own and other's Sincerity, is, That this Evidence is above all others insisted on in Scripture. A common Acquaintance with the Scripture, together with a little Attention and Observation, will
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:005767_0328_1027091E4D122D18"/>
be sufficient to shew to any one, that this is ten times more insisted on as a Note of true Piety, throughout the Scripture, from the Beginning of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enesis</hi> to the End of <hi>Revelations,</hi> than any Thing else. And in the new Testament, where Christ and his Apostles do expresly, and of declared Purpose, lay down Signs of true Godliness, this is almost wholly insisted on. It may be observed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Christ and his Apostles do not only often say those Things, in their Discoursing on the great Doctrines of Religion, which do shew what the Nature of true Godliness must be, or from whence the Nature and Signs of it may be inferr'd by just Consequence, and often occasionally mention many Things which do appertain to Godliness; but they do also often, of set Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, give Signs and Marks for the Trial of Professors, putting them upon trying themselves by the Signs they give, introducing what they say with such like Expressions as these; <hi>By this you shall know that you know God; By this are manifest the Children of God and the Children of the Devil; He that hath this, builds on a good Foundation; He that hath it not, builds on the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd; Hereby we shall assure our Hearts; He is the Man that loveth Christ, &amp;c.</hi> But I can find no Place, where either Christ or his Apostles do in this Manner give Signs of Godliness, (tho' the Places are many) but where christian Practice is almost the only Thing insisted on. Indeed in many of these Places, <hi>Love to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> is spoken of as a Sign of Godliness; and (as I have observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) there is no one vertuous Affection or Disposition so often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly spoken of as a Sign of true Grace, as our having Love one to another: But then the Scriptures explain themselves to intend chiefly this Love as exercis'd and express'd in Practice, or in Deeds of Love. So does the Apostle <hi>John</hi> (who above all others insists on Love to the Brethren as a Sign of Godliness) most expressly explain himself, in that 1 John 3. 14,  'We know that we have passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother abideth in Death.—Whoso hath this World's Good, and seeth his Brother have Need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? My little Children, let us love, not in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed (i. e. in Deeds of Love) and in Truth, and hereby we know that we are of the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall assure our Hearts before him.' So that when the Scripture so much insists on our Loving one another, as a great Sign of Godliness, we are not thereby to understand the immanent Workings of Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Men feel one to another, so much as the Soul's practising all the Duties of the Second Table of the Law; all which the new Testament tells us again and again, a true Love one to another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, and 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 39, 40. So that really, there is no Place in the new Testament, where the declared Design is to give Signs of Godliness, but that holy Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and keeping Christ's Commandments, is the Mark chosen out
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:005767_0329_1027092060C4C370"/>
from all others to be insisted on. Which is an invincible Argument that it is the Chief of all the Evidences of Godliness: Unless we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that when Christ and his Apostles on Design, set themselves about this Business of giving Signs, by which professing Christians in all Ages might determine their State, they did not know how to choose Signs so well as we could have chosen for 'em. But if we make the Word of Christ our Rule, then undoubtedly those Marks which Christ and his Apostles did chiefly lay down, and give to us, that we might try ourselves by them, those same Marks we ought especially to receive, and chiefly to make use of, in the Trial of ourselves. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <q>It is a sure Rule, (says Dr. <hi>Preston</hi>) that what the Scriptures bestow much Words on, we should have much Tho'ts on; and what the holy Ghost urgeth most, we should prize most.</q> 
                     <hi>Churches Carriage.</hi>
                  </note> And surely those Things which Christ and his Apostles chiefly insisted on in the Rules they gave, Ministers ought chiefly to insist on in the Rules they give. To insist much on those Things that the Scripture insists little on, and to insist very little on those Things on which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture insists much, is a dangerous Thing; because it is going out of God's Way, and is to judge ourselves, and guide others, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural Manner. God knew which Way of leading and guiding Souls was safest and best for them: He insisted so much on some Things, because he knew it to be needful that they should be insisted on; and let other Things more alone, as a wise God, because he knew it was not best for us, so much to lay the Weight of the Trial there. As the Sabbath was made for Man, so the Scriptures were made for Man; and they are by infinite Wisdom fitted for our Use and Benefit. We should therefore make them our Guide in all Things, in our Thoughts of Religion, and of ourselves. And for us to make that great which the Scripture makes little, and that little which the Scripture makes great, tends to give us a monstrous Idea of Religion; and (at least indirectly and gradually) to lead us wholly away from the right Rule, and from a right Opinion of ourselves, and to establish Delusion and Hypocrisy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> V. Christian Practice <hi>is plainly spoken of</hi> in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as the main Evidence of the Truth of Grace, not only to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but to Men's own Consciences. It is not only more spoken of and insisted on than other Signs, but in many Places where it is spoken of, it is represented as the Chief of all Evidences. This is plain in the Manner of Expression from Time to Time. If God were now to speak from Heaven to resolve our Doubts concerning Signs of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and should give some particular Sign, that by it all might know
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:005767_0330_10270926E5DAC008"/>
whether they were sincerely Godly or not, with such emphatical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions as these, The Man that has such a Qualification or Mark, <hi>That is the Man that is a true Saint, that is the very Man, by this you may know, this is the Thing by which it is manifest who are Saints and who are Sinners, such Men as these are Saints indeed;</hi> Should not we look upon it as a Thing beyond Doubt, that this was given as a special, and eminently distinguishing Note of true Godliness? But this is the very Case with Respect to the Sign of Grace I am speaking of; God has again and again utter'd himself in his Word in this very Manner, concerning christian Practice; as John 14. <hi>He that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and keepeth them,</hi> HE IT IS THAT LOVETH ME. This Christ in this Place gives to the Disciples, not so much to guide 'em in judging of others, but to apply to themselves for their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort after his Departure, as appears by every Word of the Context. And by the Way I would observe, that not only the Emphasis with which Christ utters himself is remarkable, but also his so much insisting on, and repeating the Matter, as he does in the Context; Ver. 15. 'If ye love me, keep my Commandments.' Ver. 23. 'If a Man love me, he will keep my Words.' And Ver. 24. 'He that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me not, keepeth not my Sayings.' And in the next Chapter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over; Ver. 2. 'Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away; and every Branch that beareth Fruit, he purgeth.' Ver. 8. 'Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much Fruit, so shall ye be my Disciples.' Ver. 14. 'Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.' We have this Mark laid down with the same Emphasis again John 8. 31. 'If ye continue in my Word, THEN are ye my Disciples INDEED.' And again, 1 John 2, 3. 'HEREBY we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.' And Ver. 5. 'Whoso keepeth his Word, IN HIM VERILY is the Love of God perfected; HEREBY know we that we are in him. And Chap. 3. 18, 19. 'Let us love in Deed and in Truth, HEREBY we know that we are of the Truth.' What is translated <hi>hereby,</hi> would have been a little more emphatical, if it had been render'd more literally from the Original, BY THIS <hi>we do know</hi>—. And how evidently is holy Practice spoken of as the grand Note of Distinction between the Children of God and the Children of the Devil, in Ver. 10. of the same Chapter? 'IN THIS the Children of God are manifest, and the Children of the Devil.' Speaking of a holy, and a wicked Practice, as may be seen in all the Context: as Ver. 3. 'Every Man that hath this Hope in him, purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself, even as he is pure.' Ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 'Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abideth in him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen him nor known him. Little Children, let no Man deceive you; he that doth Righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous; he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Sin is of the Devil.—Whosoever is born of God sinneth not.
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:005767_0331_10270929D5B3F820"/>
—Whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od.' So we have the like Emphasis 2 John 6. 'THIS IS LOVE, that we walk after his Commandments.' That is (as we must understand it) <hi>This is the proper Evidence of Love.</hi> So 1 John 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 'THIS IS THE LOVE OF GOD, that we keep his Commandments.' So the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> speaking of the proper Evidences of true and pure Religion, says, Jam. 1. 27. 'Pure Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, IS THIS, to visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to keep himself unspotted from the World.' We have the like emphatical Expressions used about the same Thing in the old Testament; Job 28. 28. 'And unto Man he said, Behold the Fear of the Lord, that is Wisdom, and to depart from Evil is Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Jer. 22. 15, 16. 'Did not thy Father eat and drink, and do Judgment and Justice?—He judged the Cause of the Poor and Needy: Was not this to know me? faith the Lord.' Psal. 34. 11, &amp;c. 'Come ye Children unto me, and I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.—Keep thy Tongue from Evil, and thy Lips from speaking Guile; depart from Evil, and do Good, seek Peace, and pursue it.' Psal. 15 at the Beginning, 'Who shall abide in thy Tabernacle? Who shall dwell in his holy Hill? He that walketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, &amp;c.' Psal. 24. 3, 4. 'Who shall ascend into the Hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in thy holy Place? He that hath clean Hands, and a pure Heart, &amp;c.' Psal. 119. 1. 'Blessed are the Undefiled in the Way, who walk in the Law of the Lord.' Ver. 6. 'Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have Respect to all thy Commandments.' Prov. 8. 13. 'The Fear of the Lord is to hate Evil.</p>
               <p>So the Scripture never uses such emphatical Expressions concerning any other Signs of Hypocrisy, and Unsoundness of Heart, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unholy Practice. So Gal. 6. 7. "Be not deceived, God is not mocked: For whatsoever a Man soweth, that shall he also reap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. 'Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, &amp;c. shall inherit the Kingdom of God.' Eph. 5. 5, 6. 'For this know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean Person, &amp;c. hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God: Let no Man deceive you with vain Words.' 1 John 3. 7, 8. 'Little Children, let no Man deceive you; he that doth Righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.' Chap. 2. 4. 'He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar, and the Truth is not in him.' And Chap. 1. 6. 'If we say we have Fellowship with him, and walk in Darkness, we lie, and do not the Truth.' Jam. 1. 27. 'If any Man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this Man's Religion is vain.' Chap. 3. 14, 15. 'If ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts,
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:005767_0332_1027092C0AF18F38"/>
glory not, and lie not against the Truth: This Wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.' Psal. 125. 5.</p>
               <p>'As for such as turn aside to their crooked Ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the Workers of Iniquity.' Isai. 35. 8. 'An high Way shall be there, and it shall be called the Way of Holiness; the Unclean shall not pass over it.' Rev. 21. 27. 'And there shall in no wise enter into it, whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a Lie:' And in many Places. 'Depart from ye, I know you not, ye that work Iniquity.'</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> VI. Another Thing which makes it evident, that holy Practice is the chief of all the Signs of the Sincerity of Professors, not only to the World, but to their own Consciences, is, that this is the grand Evidence which will hereafter be made use of, before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of God; according to which his Judgment will be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the State of every Professor of Religion unalterably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. In the future Judgment, there will be an open Trial of Professors; and Evidences will be made use of in the Judgment. For God's future judging of Men, in order to their eternal Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will not be his trying, and finding out, and passing a Judgment upon the State of Men's Hearts, in his own Mind; but it will be a declarative Judgment: And the End of it will be, not God's forming a Judgment within himself, but the Manifestation of his Judgment, and the Righteousness of it, to Men's own Consciences, and to the World. And therefore the Day of Judgment is called <hi>the Day of the</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of the righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. And the End of God's future Trial and Judgment of Men, as to the Part that each one in particular is to have in the Judgment, will be especially the clear Manifestation of God's righteous Judgment, with Respect to him, to his Conscience: As is manifest by <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 31, to the End. Chap. 20. 8,—15. Chap. 22. 11, 12, 13. Chap. 25. 19,—30. and Verse 35, to the End. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 15,—23. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' God needs no Medium, whereby to make the Truth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to himself, yet Evidences will be made use of in his future judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men. And doubtless the Evidences that will be made use of in their Trial, will be such as will be best fitted to serve the Ends of the Judgment; <hi>viz.</hi> the Manifestation of the righteous Judgment of God, not only to the World, but to Men's own Consciences. But the Scriptures do abundantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each us, that the grand Evidences which the Judge will make use in the Trial, for these Ends, according to which the Judgment of every one shall be regulated, and the irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sentence pass'd, will be Men's Works, or Practice, here in this World: Rev. 20. 12. 'And I saw the Dead, small and great, stand before God; and the Books were opened—And the Dead were judged out of those Things which were written in the Books, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:005767_0333_1027092F651DE078"/>
to their Works.' So Verse 13. 'And the Sea gave up the Dead which were in it, and Death and Hell gave up the Dead which were in them; and they were judged, every Man, according to their Works.' 2 Cor. 5. 10. 'For we must all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the Things done in the Body, whether it be good or bad.' So Men's Practice is the only Evidence, that Christ represents the future Judgment as regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by, in that most particular Description of the Day of Judgment, which we have in the holy Bible, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25, at the latter End. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

'For God will bring every Work into Judgment, with every secret Thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.' In the Trial that Professors shall be the Subjects of, in the future Judgment. God will make use of the same Evidences, to manifest 'em to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and to the World, which he makes use of to manifest them, in the Temptations or Trials of his Providence here, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in Cases wherein Christ and other Things come into actual and immediate Competition.

               <p>Hence we may undoubtedly infer, that Men's Works (taken in the Sense that has been explain'd) are the highest Evidences, by which they ought to try themselves.

               <p>Now from all that has been said, I think it to be abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that christian Practice is the most proper Evidence of the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sincerity of Professors, to themselves and others; and the chief of all the Marks of Grace, the Sign of Signs, and Evidence of Evidences, that which seals and crowns all other Signs.—I had rather have the Testimony of my Conscience, that I have such a Saying of my su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge on my Side, as that, John 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me;</hi> than the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fullest Approbation, of all the wise, found and experienced Divines, that have lived this thousand Years, on the most exact and critical Examination of my Experiences, as to the Manner of my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

There may be other Exercises of Grace, besides these efficient Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, which the Saints may have in Contemplation, that may be very satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to them: But yet this is the chief and most proper Evidence. There may be several good Evidences that a Tree is a Fig-Tree; But the highest and most proper Evidence of it, is that it actually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Christian Practice is the Sign of Signs, in this Sense that it is the great Evidence, which confirms and crowns all other Signs of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

So it is with a Bow, a Sword, an Ax, a Saw, a Cord, a Chain, a Staff, a Foot, a Tooth, &amp;c. And they that are so weak, as not to bear the Strain or Pressure we need to put them to, are good for nothing. So it is with all the Vertues of the Mind. The proper Trial and Proof of them, is in being exercised under those Temptations and Trials that God brings us under, in the Course of his Providence, and in being put to such Service as strains hard upon the Principles of Nature.</p>

So he that on the Credit of what he hears of a future World, and in a Dependance on the Report of the Gospel, concerning Life and Immortality, forsakes all, or does so at least so far as there is Occasion, making every Thing entirely give Place to his eternal Interest; he, and he only, may properly be said to venture himself on the Report of the Gospel.

               <p>And as the Fruit of holy Practice is the chief Evidence of the Truth of Grace; so the Degree in which Experiences have Influence on a Person's Practice, is the surest Evidence of the Degree of that which is spiritual and divine in his Experiences. Whatever Pretences Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may make to great Discoveries, great Love and Joys, they are no further to be regarded, than they have Influence on their Practice. Not but that Allowances must be made for the natural Temper. But that don't hinder, but that the Degree of Grace is justly measured, by the Degree of the Effect in Practice. For the Effect of Grace is as great, and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eration as remarkable, in a Person of a very ill natural Temper, as another. Altho' a Person of such a Temper, will not behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so well, with the same Degree of Grace, as another; the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity from what was before Conversion, may be as great; because a Person of a good natural Temper, did not behave himself so ill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conversion.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to represent the Evidence there is, that christian Practice is <hi>the Chief</hi> of all the Signs of saving Grace. And before I conclude this Discourse, I would say something briefly, in Answer to two Objections, that may possibly be made by some, against what has been said upon this Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Some may be ready to say, This seems to be contrary to that Opinion, so much received among good People; that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors should judge of their State, chiefly by their inward Experience, and that spiritual Experiences are the main Evidences of true Grace.</p>
               <p>I answer, 'Tis doubtless a true Opinion, and justly much received among good People, that Professors should chiefly judge of their State by their Experience. But it is a great Mistake, that what has been said is at all contrary to that Opinion. The chief Sign of Grace to the Consciences of Christians, being christian Practice, in the Sense that has been explain'd, and according to what has been shewn to be the true Notion of christian Practice, is not at all inconsistent with christian Experience being the chief Evidence of Grace. Christian or holy Practice is spiritual Practice; and that is not the Motion of a Body, that knows not how, nor when, nor wherefore it moves: But spiritual Practice in Man, is the Practice of a Spirit and Body jointly, or the Practice of a Spirit, animating, commanding and actuating a Body, to which it is united, and over which it has Power given it by the Creator. And therefore the main Thing in this holy Practice, is
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:005767_0341_1027094C4AA3DC98"/>
the holy Acts of the Mind, directing and governing the Motions of the Body. And the Motions of the Body are to be looked upon as belonging to christian Practice, only secondarily, and as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and consequent on the Acts of the Soul. The Exercises of Grace that Christians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind, or are conscious to, within themselves, are what they <hi>experience</hi> within themselves; and herein therefore lies christian Experience: And this christian Experience, consists as much in those operative Exercises of Grace in the Will, that are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the Management of the Behaviour of the Body, as in other Exercises. These inward Exercises, are not the less a Part of christian Experience, because they have outward Behaviour imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately connected with them. A strong Act of Love to God, is not the less a Part of spiritual Experience, because it is the Act that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately produces and effects some self-denying and expensive outward Action, which is much to the Honour and Glory of God.</p>
               <p>To speak of christian Experience and Practice, as if they were two Things, properly and entirely distinct, is to make a Distinction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Consideration or Reason. Indeed all christian Experience is not properly called Practice; but all christian Practice is properly Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. And the Distinction that is made between them, is not only an unreasonable, but an unscriptural Distinction. Holy Practice is one Kind or Part of christian Experience; and both Reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture represent it as the chief, and most important, and most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Part of it. So it is represented in Jer. 22. 15, 16. 'Did not thy Father eat and drink, and do Justice and Judgment?—He judged the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se of the Poor and Needy:—Was not this to know me? saith the Lord.' Our inward Acquaintance with God, surely belongs to the Head of experimental Religion; but this God repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, as consisting chiefly in that Experience which there is in holy Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. So the Exercises of those Graces of the Love of God, and the Fear of God, are a Part of experimental Religion; but these the Scripture represents as consisting chiefly in Practice, in those foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Texts. 1 John 5. 3. 'This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments.' 2 John 6. 'This is Love, that we walk after his Commandments.' Psal. 34. 11, &amp;c. 'Come, ye Children, and I will teach you the Fear of the Lord:—Depart from Evil, and do Good.' Such Experiences as these <hi>Hezekiah</hi> took Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in chiefly, on his sick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> such Experiences as these, the Psalmist chiefly insists upon, in the 119th Psalm, and elsewhere. Such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences as these, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> mainly insists upon, when he speaks of his Experiences in his Epistles; as Rom. 1. 9. 'God is my Witness, whom I serve with my Spirit, in the Gospel of his Son—2 Cor. 1. 12. 'For our rejoicing is this, the Testimony of our

               <p>And not only does the most important and distinguishing Part of christian Experience, ly in spiritual Practice; but such is the Nature of that Sort of Exercises of Grace, wherein spiritual Practice consists, that nothing is so properly called by the Name of <hi>experimental Religion.</hi> For that Experience which is in these Exercises of Grace, that are found, and prove effectually, at the very Point of Trial, wherein God proves which we will actually cleave to, whether Christ or our Lusts, are as has been shown already, the proper <hi>Experiment</hi> of the Truth and Power of our Godliness; wherein it's victorious Power and Efficacy, in producing it's proper Effect, and reaching it's End, is found <hi>by Experience.</hi> This is properly christian Experience, wherein the Saints have. Opportunity to see, by actual <hi>Experience and Trial,</hi> whether they have a Heart to do the Will of God, and to forsake other Things for Christ, or no. As that is called experimental Philosophy, which
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:005767_0343_102709530B84D658"/>
brings Opinions and Notions to the Test of Fact; so is that properly called experimental Religion, which brings religious Affections and Intentions, to the like Test.</p>
               <p>There is a sort of external religious Practice, wherein is no inward Experience; which no Account is made of in the Sight of God; but it is esteemed good for nothing. And there is what is called Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is without Practice, being neither accompanied, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a christian Behaviour; and this is worse than nothing. Many Persons seem to have very wrong Notions of christian Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and spiritual Light and Discoveries. Whenever a Person finds within him, an Heart to treat God as God, at the Time that he has the Trial, and finds his Disposition effectual in the Experiment, That is the most proper, and most distinguishing Experience. And to have at such a Time that Sense of divine Things, that Apprehension of the Truth, Importance and Excellency of the Things of Religion, which then sways and prevails, and governs his Heart and Hands; this is the most excellent spiritual Light, and these are the most distinguishing Discoveries. Religion consists much in holy Affection; but those Exercises of Affection which are most distinguishing of true Religion, are these practical Exercises. Friendship between earthly Friends consists much in Affection; but yet those strong Exercises of Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that actually carry them through Fire and Water for each other, are the highest Evidences of true Friendship.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in what has been said, contrary to what is asserted by some sound Divines; when they say, That there are no sure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Grace, but the Acts of Grace. For that don't hinder but that these operative, productive Acts, those Exercises of Grace that are effectual in Practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be the highest Evidences, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kinds of Acts of Grace. Nor does it hinder but that, when there are many of these Acts and Exercises, following one another in a Course, under various Trials, of every Kind, the Evidence is still heighten'd; as one Act confirms another. A Man by once seeing his Neighbour, may have good Evidence of his Presence: But by seeing him from Day to Day, and conversing with him in a Course, in various Circumstances, the Evidence is established. The Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when they first saw Christ, after his Resurrection, had good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he was alive: But by conversing with him for forty Days, and his <hi>shewing himself to 'em alive, by many infallible Proofs,</hi> they had yet higher Evidence. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>The more these visible Exercises of Grace are renewed, the more certain you will be. The more frequently these Actings are renewed, the more abiding and confirmed your Assurance will be. A Man that has been assured of such visible Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Grace, may quickly after be in Doubt, whether he was not mistaken. But when such Actings are renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, he grows more settled and established about his good Estate. If a Man see a Thing once, that makes him sure: But if afterwards he fear he was deceived, when he comes to see it again, he is more sure he was not mistaken. If a Man read such Passages in a Book, he is sure it is so. Some Months after, some may bear him down, that he was mistaken, so as to make him question it himself: But when he looks, and reads it again, he is abundantly confirmed. The more Men's Grace is multiplied, the more their Peace is multiplied; 2 Pet. 1. 2. <hi>Grace and Peace be multiplied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, through the Knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.</hi>

The Witness or Seal of the Spirit that we read of, doubtless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Effect of the Spirit of God in the Heart, in the Implantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Exercises of Grace there, and so consists in Experience. And it is also beyond Doubt, that this Seal of the Spirit, is the highest Kind of Evidence of the Saints Adoption, that ever they obtain. But in these Exercises of Grace in Practice, that have been spoken of, God gives Witness, and sets to his Seal, in the most conspicuous emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and evident Manner. It has been abundantly found to be true in Fact, by the Experience of the christian Church; that Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly gives, by his Spirit, the greatest, and most joyful Evidences to his Saints, of their Sonship, in those effectual Exercises of Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Trials, which have been spoken of; as is manifest in the full Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unspeakable Joys of many of the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And when the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> in my Text, speaks of the <hi>Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory,</hi> which the Christians to whom he wrote, experienc'd; he has Respect to what they found under Persecution, as appears by the Context. Christ's thus manifesting himself, as the Friend and Saviour of his Saints, cleaving to him under Trials, seems to have been represented of old, by his coming and manifesting himself, to <hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> in the Furnace. And when the Apostle speaks of the Witness of the Spirit, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16, 17; he has a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Respect to what the Christians experienced, in their Exercises of Love to God, in suffering Persecution; as is plain by the Context.

He is, in the foregoing Verses, encouraging, the christian <hi>Romans</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Sufferings, that tho' their Bodies be dead, because of Sin, yet they should be raised to Life again. But it is more especially plain by the Verse immediately following, Ver. 18. <hi>For I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ufferings of this present Time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that shall be revealed in us.</hi> So the Apostle has evidently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their Persecutions, in all that he says to the End of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So when the Apostle speaks of the <hi>Earnest of the Spirit,</hi> which God had given to him, in 2 Cor. 5. 5; the Context shews plainly that he has Respect to what was given him in his great Trials and Sufferings.

                  </gap>; 'tis evident Christ has a special Respect to a Benefit that Christians should obtain, by overcoming, in the Trial they had, in that Day of Persecution. This appears by Ver. 13, and many other Passages in this Epistle to the seven Churches of <hi>

Some also may be ready to object against what has been said of christian Practice being the chief Evidence of the Truth of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this is a <hi>legal</hi> Doctrine; and that this making Practice a Thing of such great Importance in Religion, magnifies <hi>Works,</hi> and tends to lead Men to make too much of their <hi>own Doings,</hi> to the Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Glory of free Grace, and does not seem well to consist with that great Gospel Doctrine of <hi>Justification by Faith alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Objection is altogether without Reason. Which Way is it inconsistent with the Freeness of God's Grace, that holy Practice should be a Sign of God's Grace? 'Tis our Works being the <hi>Price</hi> of God's Favour, and not their being the <hi>Sign</hi> of it, that is the Thing which is inconsistent with the Freeness of that Favour. Surely the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar's looking on the Money he has in his Hands, as a <hi>Sign</hi> of the Kindness of him who gave it to him, is in no Respect, inconsistent with the Freeness of that Kindness. 'Tis his having Money in his Hand as the Price of a Benefit, that is the Thing which is inconsistent with the free Kindness of the Giver. The Notion of the Freeness of the Grace of God to Sinners, as that is revealed and taught in the Gospel, is not that no holy and amiable Qualifications or Actions in us shall be a Fruit, and so a Sign of that Grace; but that it is not the Worthiness or Loveliness of any Qualification or Action of ours which recommends us to that Grace; that Kindness is shown to the Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Unlovely; that there is great Excellency in the Benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, and no Excellency in the Subject as the Price of it; that Goodness goes forth and flows out, from the Fulness of God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Fulness of the Fountain of Good, without any Amiableness in the Object to draw it. And this is the Notion of Justification without Works (as this Doctrine is taught in the Scripture) that it is

It would be legal to suppose that holy Practice justifies by bringing us to a Title to Christ's Benefits, as the Price of it, or as recommending to it by its Precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Excellence; but it is not legal to suppose, that holy Practice justifies the Sincerity of a Believer, as the proper Evidence of it.

                     </gap> Justified by Works</hi> in this Sense. The Spirit that indited the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not think the great Importance and absolute Necessity of holy Practice, in this Respect, to be inconsistent with the Freeness of Grace; for it commonly teaches 'em both together; as in Rev. 21. 6, 7. God says, <hi>I will give unto him that is Athirst, of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely:</hi> And then adds, in the very next Words, <hi>He that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
