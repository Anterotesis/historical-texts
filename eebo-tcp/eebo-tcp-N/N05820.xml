            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the profeſſed Deſign of the following Obſervations is to ſhow the great Value and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> and the unjuſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the <hi>French</hi> upon his Majeſty's Territories there, they can be
<pb facs="unknown:007389_0003_102B8E606874BC38"/>addreſſed to no One with ſo much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety as to your EXCELLENCY, who hath ſo largely contributed to explain and enforce the one, and to oppoſe and prevent the other.</p>
            <p>With your Views fixed to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Intereſt in theſe Reſpects, it would be extreamly difficult, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to deſcribe the inceſſant Labours, you have gone thro', while you had the Weight of three Expeditions at once upon you; that of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> twice before relieved and maintained by your Succours &amp; Vigilance; of <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> ſo abſolutely neceſſary to ſecure the Friendſhip and Fidelity of the <hi>Six Nations;</hi> and of <hi>Niagara,</hi> the Key of the Entrance into the great Lakes, and
<pb facs="unknown:007389_0004_102B8E6269793000"/>of the <hi>French</hi> Communication with the <hi>Miſſiſippi;</hi> for the ſucceſsful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which laſt Expedition, you are now hazarding your Perſon.</p>
            <p>You will permit me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to ſay, that it is very much owing to your Repreſentations, that the Intereſt of theſe Plantations is made the great Object of the Attention of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country, and that Spirit raiſed, which ſo happily prevails in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for their Preſervation from the deſtructive Schemes of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wiſdom of your Councils, and the Integrity of your Conduct, always employed for the general Welfare of theſe Colonies, have gained you a
<pb facs="unknown:007389_0005_102B8E63F1459A08"/>Confidence thro' them all; without which the beſt concerted Plans would be ineffectual in our preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. In Conſequence of this, the <hi>Northern</hi> Governments ſo ſpeedily raiſed the large Number of Troops now gone upon the Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Crown-Point;</hi> and your own Province thoſe Troops, which in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with a Number of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Forces there, have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> of all their Forts in that Province, having again exerted that noble Spirit, which heretofore called forth by you, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> to ſurrender, and gave Peace to <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb facs="unknown:007389_0006_102B8E66ADD87340"/>
I might add, as a Reaſon of this Addreſs, my Perſonal Attachment, founded upon a long Knowledge of your ſuperiour Abilities, your Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Humanity and Politeneſs, and every benevolent Affection, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your private Character amiable; but I wave this for publick Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, your Regard to which you eſteem your firſt Felicity, and think none of your Talents deſerving of any Eſtimation, in Compariſon with thoſe, which you employ for the Benefit of Mankind.</p>
            <p>May Succeſs, under the Protection of the Divine Providence, attend your Enterprize upon <hi>Niagara,</hi> by reducing which, and ſecuring that important
<pb facs="unknown:007389_0007_102B8E688B9D6F38"/>Paſs, may you be the Inſtrument of ſecuring to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Lakes and rich Countries beyond the <hi>Apalachian Mountains:</hi> And by cutting off the <hi>French</hi> from their ambituous Schemes, may you lay the Foundation of a laſting Peace.

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Obſervations on the late and preſent Conduct of the <hi>French</hi> &amp;c. were wrote towards the latter End of the laſt Year; but the Publication of them hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably deferred 'till this Time; they might have been more ſeaſonable when they were firſt wrote, but it is hoped that even now they will not be entirely without their Uſe.</p>
            <p>The Author's Deſign did not lead him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the preciſe Boundaries of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Territories in <hi>North-America,</hi> nor yet to lay any Plan for driving the <hi>French</hi> from their late and preſent Encroachments upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ones, much leſs to make any long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from the Facts he hath laid down.</p>
            <p>His only View was, in the moſt conciſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conſiſtent with Perſpicuity, to ſhow, that the <hi>French</hi> had made many unwarrantable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Territories in
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:007389_0009_102B8E6BED4F6168"/>
               <hi>North-America,</hi> contrary to the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht &amp; Aix-la-Chapelle;</hi> that if they were ſuffered to go on, or but feebly oppoſed, they would greatly diſtreſs the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, and in Time become abſolute Maſters of them all; and finally to ſhow from the State of the Colonies with Relation to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> how far ſhe her ſelf would be affected by ſuch a Change of Dominion in <hi>North-America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Armament the <hi>French</hi> have fitted out ſince that Time, and ſent hither at ſuch a vaſt Expence, confirm the Obſervations upon the Plan of the <hi>French</hi> Court with Regard to this Part of the World, and the near Approaches they have made to the actual Execution of a great Part of it, and are a convincing Proof of the Danger, to which theſe Colonies muſt be always expoſed, from the boundleſs Ambition of that Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a watchful and conſtant Attention be given to all their Motions by the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Attention had not been given at this Juncture, <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> now more than ever ſecured to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> would before this Time have been in the Hands of the <hi>French.</hi> Of what fatal Conſequence that would have been not only to the reſt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> but to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>

Neither is it to be imagined, that we are altogether free from Danger from that Part of the Squadron that hath eſcaped the Vigilance of Admiral <hi>BO<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Great Part of theſe Obſervations are taken from Memorials and other Papers of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Governour <hi>SHIRLEY,</hi> which he was ſo kind as to put into the Author's Hands; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he made leſs free with any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers he could get into his Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The firſt Part of a Treatiſe upon the preſent State of <hi>North-America,</hi> lately publiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> wrote with the greateſt Perſpicuity, Judgment and Spirit, (for which every <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi> is greatly obliged to the ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) did not come into my Hands, till the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of this was printed off.

But tho' the Author hath greatly ſuperſeded me, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly aſcertaining the Boundaries of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Territories in <hi>North-America,</hi> and by giving an Account of the more early En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi>

            <p>The Obſervations concerning the <hi>Increaſe of Mankind, Peopling of Countries</hi> &amp;c. were wrote ſome Years ago, but the ingenious Author would never ſuffer them to be made publick till now, when he hath been prevailed upon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it by ſome of his Friends, who thought the Publication of them would be of general Benefit and Advantage.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS on the late and preſent Conduct of the <hi>French,</hi> in NORTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AMERICA.</head>
            <p>THE late and preſent Conduct of the French in <hi>North-America,</hi> is now very juſtly become the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Attention of the Britiſh Nation. They are ſenſible that their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable Encroachments, muſt be attended with bad Conſequences to the Britiſh Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies there; and that in the Event, <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain</hi> itſelf muſt be greatly affected. But the Senſe of theſe Things is, however, ſo general and indeterminate, that it may not be amiſs at this Juncture, plainly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to ſhew the Importance of the Britiſh Colonies in <hi>North-America</hi> to the Mother-Kingdom; and the neceſſary fatal Conſequences of the preſent Meaſures the French are purſuing, unleſs a ſpeedy and final Stop be put to them.</p>

To render the whole more plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, it ſeems proper, previouſly to mention his Majeſty's undoubted Right to thoſe Territories, that the French have been, and are now invading, and fortifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon; and to give a ſuccinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Encroachments they have made ſince the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and the later one of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle,</hi> with ſome other occaſional Remarks.</p>

            <p>In the Country of the <hi>Iroquois</hi> they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral Fortreſſes, one between <hi>Lake Erie</hi> and <hi>Lake Ontario,</hi> on the Eaſt of the great Falls of <hi>Niagara,</hi> to Command the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians that ſhould paſs by the South Side of the Lakes; another at the Weſt End of <hi>Lake Erie;</hi> and a very ſtrong one at the South End of <hi>Lake Iroquois</hi> or <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> commonly called <hi>Crown-Point.</hi> This laſt is of the more Importance, as it gives the French the Command of that Lake; ſerves for a Barrier to <hi>Mont-Real</hi> on that Side; and as a Magazine for Stores, and a Rendezvous for Troops whenever the French, or their Indians make any Incurſions into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>New-York,</hi> or the Weſtern Frontiers of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> &amp; <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> It's about One Hundred and twenty Miles from the City of <hi>Albany,</hi> all Water Carriage ſaving a ſmall Carrying Place; and Eighty ſix Miles from the neareſt Part of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River.</p>
            <p>Theſe Encroachments made in Time of Peace before the laſt War, they pretend to hold, 'till the Limits of the Territories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the two Crowns reſpectively in <hi>North-America</hi> are ſettled by Commiſſaries.

The French Court ſeem always to have made <hi>North-America</hi> an Object of great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and long ago to have formed a Plan, which they have been ſteadily, tho' ſlowly, carrying into Execution.</p>
            <p>Since the Treaty of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> they have been more haſty; well knowing of what Advantage it would be to their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Views of univerſal Monarchy to accompliſh it. Their Encroachments have been more numerous, their Hoſtilities more violent.</p>
            <p>In the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> they have erected a Fort near <hi>Bay-Vert;</hi> from whence they have a Communication by Water with <hi>Louisbourgh,</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> and other French Settlements. They have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected another ſtrong one upon the Iſtmus of the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> mounted with 26 Cannon, which commands the Baſin and Harbour of <hi>Chiqnecto</hi> or <hi>Bobauſſin;</hi> and within very near Cannon-Shot of an inferior one built by the Engliſh on the other Side of the Baſin. They have ſeized <hi>St. John</hi>'s River, and erected two Forts there; from one of which they had lately the Inſolence to fire upon one of the King's Ships. They have engroſſed the whole Furr-Trade of that River to themſelves; which, before the late Peace, was wholly carried on by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007389_0018_102B8E7EF8F76F60"/>So that in Reality, conſidering the Diſpoſition of the French Inhabitants, and the Indians that are under their Influence and Direction, they are more effectually Maſters of that whole Province than the Engliſh. They have, in Conjunction with the Indians, who have been inſtigated by them, committed many Acts of Hoſtilities againſt his Majeſty's Troops, and other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in that Province; killed many, and taken others Priſoners; beſides plundering Veſſels and then burning them.</p>
            <p>Since the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> they have ſettled a conſiderable Village on both Sides the River <hi>Chaudiere;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The River <hi>Chaudiere</hi> empties itſelf into the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> on the South Side, a League and an half above the City of <hi>Quebec.</hi>

From hence the whole Force of <hi>Canada</hi> might, in a few Days, be poured into the Eaſtern Parts of the Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay;</hi> the great Nurſery of Trees for Maſts, Yards, and Bowſprits, for the Royal Navy.</p>

Since the Treaty of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle,</hi> they have erected ſeveral more Fortreſſes in the Country of the <hi>Iroquois:</hi> One upon the North Side of the Lake <hi>Ontario</hi> directly oppoſite to the Engliſh Fort at <hi>Oſwego</hi> on the South Side, (called by them Fort <hi>Trunto</hi>) at the Place where the Indians, that come by the North Side of the Lakes, uſed to paſs this Lake in order to Trade at <hi>Oſwego.</hi> They have built a large ſtrong Stone trading Houſe between the Lakes <hi>Erie</hi> and <hi>Ontario,</hi> to the Weſtward of the great Falls of <hi>Niagara,</hi> to prevent the Indians paſſing the South Side of the Lakes to <hi>Oſwego.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1753, they marched a large armed Force, conſiſting of Regulars, Militia and Indians, from <hi>Mont-Real</hi> into the Country of the <hi>Iroquois;</hi> altho' forbid by the Indians by three ſeveral Meſſages, and threatned to deſtroy all the Indians that ſhould oppoſe them: The ſame Year they built two Forts, one upon a River that empties itſelf into the Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> the other at fifteen Miles diſtance on the River <hi>Obèuf,</hi> which falls into the River <hi>Ohio.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The River <hi>Ohio,</hi> in the Indian Language, means the ſame as <hi>Belle Riviere</hi> in the French. It is a ſmooth eaſy River, not interrupted with Falls; for what is called the Falls near where it is joined by the River <hi>Oubaſche,</hi> is nothing more than a Ripling. It takes its Riſe in the Country of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> &amp; runs upon the Back of the Engliſh Settlements, &amp; after a Courſe of more than 200 Leagues, according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Indian Traders, it is joined by the River <hi>Oubaſche,</hi> &amp; after a Courſe of 80 Leagues more, it falls into the River <hi>Miſſiſippi.</hi> In its Courſe it receives many Rivers from the North and the South: The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannahs</hi> or <hi>Interval Lands</hi> adjoining to this, and ſome of the other Rivers, that run into it, are in many Places of ſuch large Extent, that it is agreed by all, they form a compleat Horizon.

                  <p>The far greater Number of the Indians, live upon thoſe Branches of this River that come into it from the Northward, and ſtill further to the Northward; the Engliſh Settlements are to the Southward: This River therefore with the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening lakes, form a perfect Communication between <hi>Quebec</hi> and <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and a Line of Separation when filled with French Forts and Settlements between the far greater Number of the Indians, and the Engliſh Settlements.</p>

Early the next Year, the French march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſmall Engliſh Fort at the Forks of <hi>Mohongahala,</hi> lower down the River <hi>Ohio;</hi> garriſoned by a ſmall Number of People from <hi>Virginia,</hi> who were obliged to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render upon Terms on the firſt Summons.</p>
            <p>Some Time after the ſame Year, a Body of eleven Hundred Men, French and Indians attacked Major <hi>Waſhington,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Forces, whoſe Corps conſiſted of but about three Hundred Men, &amp; obliged him to ſurrender upon Articles of Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

They have built another Fort at the Forks, where the River <hi>Oubaſche</hi> falls into the River <hi>Ohio.</hi> How many more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes they have erected lower down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and on that River, I do not pretend to know. They have likewiſe built two Veſſels like our Brigantines, of about 60 or 70 Tons for Tranſportation on the Lake <hi>Ontario.</hi> Theſe Lakes are large Inland Seas, navigable by Veſſels of a conſiderable Burthen.</p>
            <p>By the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> confirmed by the Treaty of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle,</hi> it is expreſly ſtipulated that the French ſhall have Liberty of paſſing into the Country of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and other Indians in Friendſhip with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for the ſake of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and that the Engliſh ſhall have the ſame Liberty of paſſing into the Countries of the Indians in Friendſhip with the French on the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Since the laſt Treaty, the French have plundered ſeveral of his Majeſty's Subjects trading, not in the Countries of the Indians in Friendſhip with the French, but in the Countries of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and other Indian Nations in Friendſhip with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> of Goods to a very great Value; killed ſome, made others Priſoners, and tranſported ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to <hi>Old-France.</hi> They have lately
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007389_0022_102B8E867B6903D0"/>avowed in the moſt publick Manner, their determined Reſolution to make Priſoners all his Majeſty's Subjects, that they ſhall find trading in thoſe Countries, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate their Effects.</p>
            <p>This Conduct of the French has deterred all the Traders of his Majeſty's Colonies, from paſſing into the Indian Countries for the ſake of Commerce; altho' before theſe Hoſtilities of the French, three Hundred Traders went yearly from the ſingle Colony of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe open Hoſtilities, and Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Encroachments, the French are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually making uſe of every Art, Policy can ſuggeſt, with the greateſt Induſtry humane Nature is capable of, to ſeduce the Indians in Alliance with the Engliſh, and draw them over to their Intereſt. For this Purpoſe, the moſt artful &amp; zealous of their Miſſionaries are ſent among them: The lower People are encouraged to live amongſt and intermarry with the Natives. The Prieſts after they are admitted amongſt them, ſoon gain a great Aſcendency over them. They make uſe of the Religion they teach them, to inſpire them with the greateſt hatred to the Engliſh, and Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the French. In this they have had but too much Succeſs; aſſiſted as they have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007389_0023_102B8E8940216E98"/>been, by the bad Conduct of ſome of the Engliſh Governments, to the Indians of the moſt Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Many Years ago, a Number of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> the moſt antient and faithful Allies of the Engliſh, and the moſt War-like of all the Indian Nations; went off and ſettled above <hi>Mont-Real.</hi> They have lately perſuaded one Half of the <hi>Onondago</hi> Tribe, with many other Indians to remove; and have built them a Church and Fort. Many of the <hi>Seneka</hi>'s, the moſt numerous Tribe of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> appear to be much inclined to the French; and there is great Reaſon to fear that the whole Body of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> will ſoon be loſt to the Crown of <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain,</hi> and gained by the French; unleſs ſome proper Meaſures be taken to prevent them, and to regain thoſe that are loſt.</p>
            <p>The Indians in the French Intereſt are, upon all proper Opportunities, inſtigated by their Prieſts, who have generally the chief Management of their publick Councils, to Acts of Hoſtility againſt the Engliſh, even in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns. Of this there are many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Inſtances: The War between the Indians &amp; the Colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bay, &amp; New-Hampſhire,</hi> in 1723; by which thoſe Colonies ſuffered ſo much Damage,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007389_0024_102B8E8AC8A921F0"/>was begun by the Inſtigation of the French; their Supplies were from them, and there are now original Letters of ſeveral Jeſuits to be produced; whereby it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they were continually animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indians, when almoſt tired with the War, to a further Proſecution of it. The French not only excited the Indians and ſupplied them, but joined their own Forces with them in all the late Hoſtlities that have been committed within his Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From an intercepted Letter this Year from the Jeſuit at <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> and from other Information, it is certain that they have been uſing their utmoſt Endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Indians to new Acts of Hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſty's Colony of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etts-Bay,</hi> and ſome have been committed.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the writing this, the Indians at the Inſtigation of the French have committed numerous Hoſtilities upon the Engliſh, in the Governments of <hi>Virginia, Maryland, New-York, New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bay,</hi> and the two laſt Governments have declared War-againſt ſeveral Tribes of the <hi>Abinaqui</hi> Indians.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The French not only excite the Indians to Acts of Hoſtility, but Reward them for it, by buying the Engliſh Priſoners of them; for the Ranſom of each of which, they afterwards demand the Price that is uſually
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007389_0025_102B8E8CA75A0920"/>given for a Slave in theſe Colonies. They do this under the ſpecious Pretence of reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor Priſoners from the Cruelties and Barbarities of the Savages; but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to encourage them to continue their Depredations; as they can by this Means get more by hunting the Engliſh, than by hunting Wild-Beaſts; while in Reality the French at the ſame Time, keep up a large Army of Indians entirely at the Expence of the Engliſh, without any to themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is very uncertain, &amp; difficult to gueſs, what may be the Number of Indians ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the back of the Engliſh &amp; French Settlements, thro' this vaſt Continent. But if the Account be true, or near true that was given in an open Council of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> at <hi>Turpehawkie,</hi> on their return from the Treaty at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in 1742, there muſt be a <hi>great many Thouſand</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>And altho' the Indians live ſcattered, as a Hunter's Life requires; they may be collected together from almoſt any Diſtance, as they can find their Subſiſtence from their Gun in their Travelling.</p>
            <p>But let the Number of the Indians be what it will, they are not formidable meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Account of their Numbers; there are many other Circumſtances that give them a great Advantage over the Engliſh.</p>

If this ſhould not be the Caſe, but the Engliſh ſhould purſue them, as ſoon as they have gained the Rivers, by Means of their Canoes, to the Uſe of which they are brought up from their Infancy, they preſently get out of their Reach: Further, if a Body of Men were to march into their Country to the Places where they are ſettled, they can, upon the leaſt Notice, without great Diſadvantage quit their preſent Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and betake themſelves to new ones.</p>
            <p>Bnt to return from theſe occaſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and to point out the Conſequences of the preſent Meaſures of the French, if they are ſuffered to purſue them:</p>
            <p>The firſt and moſt immediate will be the engroſſing the whole Furr and Pelt Trade. The Furrs and Pelts imported into <hi>England,</hi> have been computed to amount to about £. 90,000 Sterling per Annum, beſides what are uſed in the Plantations, which is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Quantity; but I believe greatly exceed that Sum. What Part is imported from <hi>North-America,</hi> and what from the Nothern Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> I cannot tell. The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007389_0028_102B8E92F24EB538"/>whole Indian Trade of <hi>North-America,</hi> is carried on entirely by Barter; and that chiefly, &amp; indeed almoſt wholly for Strouds, Duffils, Blankets, &amp; other Manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent Trade therefore is of great Conſequence, and if it was properly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, the Advantages ariſing to <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain,</hi> would be in Proportion to its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; not only as it would occaſion a greater Conſumption of Britiſh Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but likewiſe as it would bring in a greater Quantity of thoſe valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Purchaſe from other Powers at a dearer Rate, and Pay for in Money too. The Indians may be ſupplied cheaper from the Engliſh, than from the French; this is very evident, inaſmuch as the French are frequently ſupplied from <hi>Albany,</hi> by the Means of their Indians (who are really Factors for the French) with great Part of their Goods at an advanced Price, and yet have their own Profit upon them, when they ſell them to the Indians.—The Engliſh Colonies are better ſituated, were it not for the French Encroachments, to carry the Trade into the Indian Country, than thoſe of the French; and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore capable of increaſing and extending
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007389_0029_102B8E947B05AA38"/>this Trade to a greater Advantage than they. But notwithſtanding the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the Engliſh, and the Diſadvantages of the French, the latter have always puſhed it on with greater Vigour, and have always had by much the largeſt Share of it: Neither is this much to be wondered at, ſince the French of <hi>Canada</hi> have ſcarce any other Trade but this; and this is ſo eſſential to that Settlement, that if they were once to be cut off from it, that muſt ſoon languiſh and decay: Beſides that the Tax paid by the Company on this Trade, is one of the principal Funds from whence the Supplies are raiſed for defraying the Charges of that Government.</p>
            <p>The Pelts &amp; Furrs imported into <hi>France,</hi> amounted ſome Years ago, to no leſs than £.135,000 Sterling per Annum; and ſince that Time, the French Trade in thoſe Commodities has been continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, whilſt that of the Engliſh hath been diminiſhing; and in a little Time will, very probably, nay, muſt neceſſarily be entirely loſt to the Engliſh &amp; gained by the French, if the latter are ſuffered to continue poſſeſſed of their preſent Encroachments, and to ſtrengthen themſelves in them.</p>
            <p>Whoever will compare the Account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given of theſe Encroachments, with
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007389_0030_102B8E975057F1D8"/>the Map of the Country, muſt ſee at the firſt View that they have taken, &amp; are tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſſeſſion of, and fortifying all the moſt important Places upon the Lakes &amp; Rivers, upon the Back of all the Northern Colonies; by which the Indians muſt paſs from their Country to Trade with the Engliſh, or the Engliſh into the Indian Country on the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>When they ſhall have ſufficiently ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened themſelves in theſe, they will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cut off all Communication between the Indians and the Engliſh Settlements; and oblige the Natives to Trade ſolely with them, whether they will or no. Beſides, the Natives will find it more for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in that Caſe to Trade with the French, than with the Engliſh: For as the French, with their Forts, will carry their Trade into the different Parts of the Indian Country, can any one imagine the Indians will carry their Goods many Hundred Miles, attended with great fatigue and difficulty; to exchange them for thoſe very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that they can be ſupplied with for the ſame Goods, in a Manner at their own Doors? No certainly they will not.</p>
            <p>Beſides the engroſſing this Trade to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the French will, in a little Time, draw all the Indians entirely off from the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007389_0031_102B8E992C125D28"/>Engliſh, and firmly attach them to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The cutting off the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Engliſh and the Indians by the French Forts and Settlements, will oblige the Indians to Trade with the French, whether they will or no. Their carrying the Trade into the Indian Country, and ſupplying them with the Commodities they want at their own Doors, will make it their Intereſt to Trade with them. This Exchange of Commodities, if properly regulated, will attach the Indians to the Intereſt of thoſe that ſupply them with what they cannot ſubſiſt without. But above all, the Vigour and Reſolution of the French in carrying on Settlements, building Forts &amp; ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening themſelves in them at ſuch a Diſtance from their preſent Country, few as their Inhabitants are, will give them a high Opinion of the French Courage, and create a Dependance upon them. On the other Hand, the tame Behaviour of the Engliſh in looking quietly on, or in making but a feeble Reſiſtance againſt theſe violent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, while their Intereſt is ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned, their Colonies are ſo many, and their Inhabitants ſo numerous, will give them a mean, contemptible Opinion of them: They will look upon the Engliſh as daſtardly Cowards; upon the French as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007389_0032_102B8E9B0FCBC320"/>brave Men; upon the one as fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon for Protection; on the other as unworthy of the leaſt Confidence, &amp; rather wanting Aſſiſtance &amp; Protection from them, than capable of affording them any.</p>
            <p>A Sachem of one of the Tribes of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> publickly Reproached the Engliſh with this at the late Conference between Commiſſioners from the Britiſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> at <hi>Albany.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the Commiſſioners: "You talk, ſaid he, of your Strength, where do we ſee it? The French build Forts, and keep them when they have done; the Engliſh do not hinder them: The French behave like Men, the Engliſh like Women."</p>
            <p>The <hi>Six Nations</hi> are the braveſt Warriors of all the Indians. They have always been in Alliance with the Engliſh, and had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the greateſt Averſion to the French. They once not only threatned, but had very near compleated the Deſtruction of <hi>Canada:</hi> But from the Neglect of the Engliſh to cultivate this Temper, and indeed from a direct contrary Conduct in ſome of the Governments, and from the Induſtry and Aſſiduity of the French to gain them to their Intereſt; many went off and ſettled amongſt the French a long Time ago; a great Number are lately gone off; thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007389_0033_102B8E9CD0D3D0C8"/>that remain are very wavering in their Affections to the Engliſh, and there is not the leaſt Doubt to be made but that they will entirely abandon us; and that in a very little Time, if they have not already agreed to do it, unleſs we behave with more Diſcretion and Juſtice towards them, &amp; more Vigour and Reſolution againſt the French.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould be the Caſe; if theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſhould be gained to the French and the numerous Tribes in Alliance with them, all the reſt of the Indians upon the whole Continent would infallibly be brought into the ſame Intereſt. What Uſe the French would make of theſe new Allies, we know too well from paſt Experience. They would moſt certainly employ them even in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns, againſt any or all the Britiſh Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as would beſt ſuit their ambitious Views and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>It has been already remarked, that the Tribes of Indians living upon the Lakes and the Rivers that run upon the Back of the Engliſh Settlements in <hi>North-America,</hi> are very numerous, and can furniſh a great Number of fighting Men; all perfectly well acquainted with the Uſe of Arms as ſoon as capable of carrying them; as they get the whole of their Subſiſtence from hunting;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007389_0034_102B8E9F63788160"/>and that this Army, large as it may be, can be maintained by the French without any Expence.</p>
            <p>Fom their Numbers, their Situation and the Rivers that run into the Engliſh Settlements, it is eaſy to conceive that they can at any Time make an Attack upon and conſtantly Annoy as many of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Engliſh Settlements as they pleaſe; and thoſe at any Diſtance from each other.</p>
            <p>The Effects of ſuch Incurſions have been too ſeverely felt by many of the Britiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, eſpecially in the Eaſtern Parts of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> not to be very well known. The entire breaking up Places that had been for a conſiderable Time ſettled at a great Expence, both of Labour and Money; burning the Houſes, deſtroying the Stock, killing and making Priſoners great Numbers of the Inhabitants; with all the cruel Uſage they meet with in their Captivity, is only a Part of the Scene. All other Places that are expoſed are kept in continual Terror; the Lands lay waſte and uncultivated from the Danger that attends thoſe that ſhall preſume to Work upon them: Beſides the immenſe Charge the Governments muſt be at in a very ineffectual Manner to defend their extended Frontiers; and all this from the Influence the French have had over, but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007389_0035_102B8EA1A1938520"/>comparatively a few of the Indians. To the ſame or greater Evils ſtill will every one of the Colonies be expoſed whenever the ſame Influence ſhall be extended to the whole Body of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>South-Carolina</hi> may be eaſily annoyed in this Manner by the Indians that live near the French Settlements upon the River <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and the Branches of the other Rivers that run into it. <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath this Advantage at preſent, that theſe Indians have been for a long Time, and are ſtill in ſtrict Alliance with them; and whilſt they continue cloſely attached to their Intereſt, they will be a Barrier to them againſt the French and their Indians: But this is a very precarious Dependence, conſidering how eaſy it will be for the French, after they have gained the reſt of the numerous Tribes, to ſecure them alſo to their Intereſt, or elſe to employ their Indians to cut them off.</p>
            <p>The late and preſent Enterpriſes of the French, with the Aſſiſtance of the Indians upon the Borders of <hi>Pennſylvania, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>North-Carolina;</hi> are too ſtrong Proofs how much they are expoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-York</hi> is not more ſecure; but on the contrary, if the French ſhould gain the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to their Intereſt (of which there
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007389_0036_102B8EA328EC22A0"/>is the greateſt Danger) as theſe are the moſt War-like of all the Indians, as they are perfectly well acquainted with that Country, and might perhaps have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reſentment againſt that Colony; and at the ſame Time can be eaſily ſupplied by Water from the French Magazine at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> with Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; this Colony would perhaps be more expoſed than almoſt any other to the moſt cruel Ravages and Depredations.</p>
            <p>The Colonies of <hi>New-Jerſeys, Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> are at preſent ſecured, by having ſome of the other Colonies as a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to them.</p>
            <p>The Weſtern Parts of the Colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> lay open to the Incurſions of the Indians, that may be ſupplied from <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> it being not quite ninety Miles from that Fort to <hi>Connecticut-River.</hi> But the Eaſtern Parts of theſe Provinces, eſpecially the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> are ſtill more expoſed, and have been often and for a long Time together, thro' the Inſtigation of our good Allies the <hi>French,</hi> the Theatre of War.</p>
            <p>The <hi>St. John</hi>'s and other <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, whom the French have gained to an entire Dependance upon them, may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed either againſt the Eaſtern Parts of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007389_0037_102B8EA50C32E8D8"/>
               <hi>New-England,</hi> or the Province of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Scotia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Damage the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> has already ſuffered from them, at the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and with the Aſſiſtance of the French, has been ſuch, as has hitherto prevented their making Settlements back into the Country, whereon they might raiſe their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and threatens, if not remedied, to prevent any future Settlement of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it cannot be doubted that if the French ſhould engroſs the Furr Trade to themſelves, and attach the Indians firmly to their Intereſt, they would never want Inclination nor Power to employ them, even <hi>in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns,</hi> to harraſs any Number of the Engliſh Colonies as ſhould beſt ſuit their Purpoſes; which, beſides all the other Evils already mentioned, would be attended with this, that it would effectually hinder the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and Settlement of his Majeſty's Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, whilſt it would give the French an Opportunity to increaſe &amp; ſettle their own, and not only their own, but ſuch Part of his Majeſty's as they have unjuſtly taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of.</p>
            <p>But the Calamities of the Engliſh Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies would be greatly increaſed under theſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007389_0038_102B8EA6B6A36958"/>Circumſtances in Caſe of a War between the two Crowns.</p>
            <p>As the Fort at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> where the French may collect a ſufficient Number of Forces for their Purpoſe, is within little more than a hundred Miles of the City of <hi>Albany,</hi> and much nearer to many of their other Settlements, as there is an eaſy Paſſage by Water from this Fort, it would be no difficult Matter for the French, with the Aſſiſtance of the Indians, eſpecially of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> who border upon and are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with, every Part of that Colony, not only to burn and deſtroy the out Settlements, but even the City of <hi>Albany</hi> it ſelf, before they could receive Aſſiſtance from the other Parts of the Government: At the ſame Time their Neighbours may be prevented from giving them any, by having Employment enough at Home, to defend their own Frontiers againſt other Parties of Indians.</p>
            <p>The ſame Remark may be made with Regard to the Weſtern Frontier of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay:</hi> But it is in the Eaſtern Part that this Colony and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> is moſt expoſed in Time of War to the Ravages of the French and their Indians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:007389_0039_102B8EA9A61AE9D0"/>
               <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Capital of all the French Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, is ſo near to this Part of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> that whilſt other Parts of the Country, and their Neighbours too, are kept in a continual Alarm by Parties of Indians, the whole Force of <hi>Canada,</hi> with as many Indians as they ſee Cauſe to join with them, may very ſuddenly and ſecretly make their Attack here, burn and deſtroy many Towns, break up others, kill many of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and make more Priſoners, deſtroy their Stock, and return back with great Security, before a ſufficient Force could be ſent againſt them. They might at the ſame Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the King's Woods, from whence Maſts, &amp;c. are ſupplied for the Royal Navy, unleſs they ſhould hope one Day to be Maſters of them themſelves, and on that Account reſerve them for their own Uſe. But in Caſe of a War between the two Crowns, the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> will not only feel all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned calamitous Effects; but under its preſent Circumſtances, would be in Danger of being totally loſt to the Crown of <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain,</hi> and gained by the <hi>French.</hi> As <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> which is in the Neighbourhood of this, is on all Accounts a proper Place of Rendezvous for regular Troops and a Navy to be ſent from <hi>France,</hi> as the French have already a Fort upon <hi>Bay Vert,</hi> and another
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007389_0040_102B8EAB2F4F3C90"/>upon the Baſin of <hi>Chignecto,</hi> as they have ſecured the River of <hi>St. John</hi>'s, and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indians of that River, and the other Indians, to their Intereſt, as the French Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are well known to be better inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the French than the Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and muſt eternally be ſo, as long as they are ſuffered to have French Roman Catholic Prieſts, Subjects of the French King, and under the Direction of the Biſhop of <hi>Quebec,</hi> among them; and as the Engliſh have not one Fort, except <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> that can hold out one Day againſt a proper Number of regular Forces provided with ſufficient Canon, if the French ſhould, before the Engliſh are a ware of it, ſend a large Body of Troops, with neceſſary Artillery, and a Number of Men of War to protect them, the French Inhabitants, who amount to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands, would upon their firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, univerſally revolt, &amp; the Conqueſt of that whole Province would not take up one Fortnight. When the French have once made a Conqueſt of this Province, and ſtrengthened themſelves in it, they will have laid a good Foundation for diſpoſſeſſing the Engliſh, in ſome future Time, of all their other Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> and ſecuring them to themſelves, with all the Advantages of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:007389_0041_102B8EACB9A3B8D8"/>
That the French have had this in View from the Beginning of their Settlements in <hi>North-America,</hi> ſeems clear from their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the Engliſh Colonies, and building Forts upon the Lakes, and moſt convenient Rivers on the Back of the Engliſh Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>St. Lawrence-River</hi> to <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and claiming an excluſive Navigation in thoſe Lakes and Rivers, and the Property of all that Part of the Continent.</p>
            <p>What a Value <hi>France</hi> ſets upon the Colony of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> and how eſſential a Territory ſhe eſteems it for the Support of her other Settlements, and for compaſſing the Deſign ſhe hath upon the whole Continent of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>America,</hi> plainly appears from the extreme Reluctance with which ſhe made the Ceſſion of it to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> at the Treaty of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht;</hi> and it is clear from that Negociation, that nothing but the feeble State in which ſhe then felt herſelf, nothing but the laſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity could have reduced her to make it. What an attentive Eye ſhe hath kept upon it ever ſince it hath been in the Poſſeſſion of the Engliſh, appears from the continual Practices of the Governour of <hi>Canada,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Quebec,</hi> and the French Miſſionaries from thence in Time of Peace, to ſeduce the French Inhabitants from their Allegiance to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The ſame is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007389_0042_102B8EAEF638FB40"/>from the repeated Attempts of the French during the late War; ſome of them very expenſive and hazardous to a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part of her Navy, for the Reduction of it; as alſo ſince the Concluſion of the Peace, from her Encroachments upon the Iſthmus and <hi>St. John</hi>'s-<hi>River,</hi> in manifeſt Violation of her moſt ſolemn Stipulations at <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle;</hi> and with an apparent View of holding her ſelf in Readineſs to take the firſt favourable Opportunity upon a Rupture between the two Crowns of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing the Colony.</p>
            <p>One great, and indeed main Security of the Engliſh Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fatal Effects of the French En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment, conſiſts in this, that the French Settlements at preſent are not capable of ſubſiſting a Body of Troops ſtrong enough to over-run the Engliſh Settlements; but ſhould the French make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> which is a Country fruitful of all Kind of Grain and Proviſions; they would be in a Condition to introduce and ſubſiſt a Body of Troops ſtrong enough with the French <hi>Acadians,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> together with the <hi>Indians,</hi> to reduce all the Engliſh Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:007389_0043_102B8EB0D7C97A40"/>
Another great Security to the Engliſh Colonies, is that the French have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Harbours, but only in the Iſland of <hi>Cape-Breton;</hi> but ſhould they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> they might from their Poſſeſſion of ſo large a Sea-Coaſt extending from <hi>Cape-Sable</hi> to <hi>Cape-Canceau,</hi> ninety Leagues upon the Atlantic Ocean, abounding with moſt commodious Harbours for Ships of the largeſt Burthen, be in a Condition to diſpute the Maſtery of thoſe Seas. Thoſe who know the Situation and State of the Colonies upon the Continent of <hi>North-America,</hi> will not doubt but that the immediate Effect of the <hi>French</hi> gaining <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> would be the Loſs of the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> Cod-Fiſhery, and the intercepting and deſtroying the greateſt Part of the Trade of thoſe Colonies, the Loſs of the King's Woods in the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> which contain all the Nurſeries of white Pine Trees; from whence the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Navy is at preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Maſts, Yards &amp; Bowſprits; and occaſion the breaking up all the Engliſh Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements within the <hi>Province of Maine,</hi> which is the Eaſtern Part of the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Albany</hi> and the Settlements about it, which makes the Weſtern Part of <hi>New-York:</hi> And that thus
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007389_0044_102B8EB308155600"/>by Degrees with a proper Force and the continual Incurſions of the Indians, all the Engliſh Colonies might probably be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run in a few Years, unleſs they were ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported with regular Troops from Home.</p>
            <p>This may appear very extraordinary at firſt View, conſidering the ſuperiour Number of Inhabitants within the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Colonies, eſpecially as the Engliſh are Maſters of ſuch a large Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Coaſt: But if the Advantages which the Form of Government in the French Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies gives them, over that of the Engliſh Colonies in Time of War is conſidered, this will not ſeem an improbable Suppoſition. All the French Settlements in <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> how many ſmall Governments ſoever they may be divided into, are under the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Command of the Governor of <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Engliſh Colonies, excluſive of <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> are divided into eleven diſtinct Governments, within each of which nothing of any Conſequence can be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted but by their reſpective Aſſemblies. They are independent of each other, ſome of them very remote from the other, thoſe which are near are generally diſunited in their Councils upon the Manner of acting againſt the common Enemy, diſagreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007389_0045_102B8EB4DCCB27A0"/>the Quota of Men and Money which they ſhould reſpectively contribute; and conſidering themſelves as more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, according to the Diſtance of their Colonies from immediate Danger, ſo that it is very difficult for them to agree upon any one Plan, and as difficult to execute it, if one could be agree don. Of this there is a moſt melancholly Proof at this very Time, ſince not with ſtanding the preſent common Danger, no two Governments can agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Meaſures, nor has any one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeparately, except the <hi>Maſſachuſetts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bay,</hi> acted with any Degree of Vigour; much leſs with that Vigour that the preſent Circumſtances demand.
<note n="*" place="bottom">At that Time the Expedition to <hi>Crown-Point</hi> was not on Foot.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſy therefore to conceive, that a large Body of Men, Part of them regular Troops, with the Aſſiſtance of the Indians, ſcattered thro' the Continent, upon the Back of all the Engliſh Colonies, (as the French Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments likewiſe are) when under the abſolute Command of one Governor-General, who upon all Emergencies can direct their Force as he pleaſes, may reduce a Number of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united independent Colonies, unſupported with regular Troops, tho' much ſuperior to them in Point of the Number of Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:007389_0046_102B8EB668D17298"/>
The Effects of this Difference of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within the <hi>French &amp; Engliſh</hi> Colonies were moſt ſenſibly felt in the late War. And if we may judge by the late &amp; preſent Proceedings of the <hi>French</hi> upon this Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they deſign we ſhall feel them more ſenſibly ſtill, and that perhaps ſooner than we imagine.</p>
            <p>It is therefore highly neceſſary that the moſt vigorous Meaſures ſhould be ſpeedily and unitedly projected and purſued, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any further Encroachments of the <hi>French,</hi> and to oblige them to relinquiſh thoſe they have already made. The Safety and Security of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> their very Being as Engliſh Colonies, make ſuch Meaſures abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and that without any Loſs of Time. And how far the Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> it ſelf may make ſuch Meaſures neceſſary, will appear from conſidering the Importance of theſe Colonies to the Mother-Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That the preſent Grandeur of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> is owing to its large &amp; extended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, is agreed on all Hands.</p>
            <p>That it is by this large Commerce that ſhe is enabled to keep up ſo large a Naval Force, and that the Superiority of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Force maintains her preſent Power and Independency, is equally certain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:007389_0047_102B8EB9385BDF28"/>
What Addition is made to her Commerce, and Conſequently her Wealth, Strength and Superiority of Naval Power, by her being poſſeſſed of ſo many large Colonies, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly how far her Colonies in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>America</hi> conduce to the Support &amp; Increaſe of theſe, will appear from the following Remarks.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Colonies in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>America</hi> make a large Addition to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The Extent of theſe Colonies, excluſive of the Iſland of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland,</hi> &amp; meaſuring it upon the Sea-Coaſt from <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> to <hi>Georgia,</hi> incluſive of both, is about five Hundred Leagues, &amp; the Depth of them as far back as the South Sea.</p>
            <p>The Settlements, which are chiefly on the Sea-Coaſt, may be computed to contain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove One Million Inhabitants, excluſive of Indian Savages and Negro Slaves.</p>
            <p>Theſe Inhabitants within the Compaſs of one Hundred and forty Years, from which Time the utmoſt AEra of the eldeſt of theſe Colonies is to be dated, have from ſmall Drafts made out of the Mother-Country and her Dependencies, chiefly in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Settlements, grown to their preſent Number by the natural Increaſe of the People, ſaving what Addition they have
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007389_0048_102B8EBAC6239820"/>received by ſuch as have tranſplanted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Northern Parts of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been found by Aſſeſsments made from Time to Time of the rateable Polls in the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> where there are now near two hundred Thouſand Inhabitants, that taking their Increaſe at a Medium, from the firſt Settlement of the Colony to the Year 1743, they have doubled their Number once in twenty Years.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould not be thought an equitable Rule of eſtimating the future Growth of the Inhabitants within this Province, when their Number is ſo large, (tho' it ſeems it ſhould hold good as long as there is Room enough for them to ſpread) yet it ſeems a moderate Computation to reckon, that their preſent Number may be doubled at the End of thirty Years, and if that is a juſt Rule for rating the Increaſe of the Inhabitants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the other Colonies, as it ſeems to be, then the Number of Inhabitants within all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> may be expected from their natural Increaſe, and without making any Allowance for the tranſplanting of Proteſtant Families from the <hi>Palatinate, Swiſs</hi> Cantons, and other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> to amount at the End of that Period to near three Millions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:007389_0049_102B8475E1B2A5E0"/>
More diſtant Calculations may ſeem too remote and uncertain; it may ſuffice to Remark that from the general Healthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Climate thro' the whole Range of theſe Colonies, and the immenſe Tracts of Lands fit for all Kind of Agriculture, that this Territory is capable of ſupporting as many Inhabitants at leaſt as any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Advantage accruing to the Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Country from the great Number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in her Northern Colonies, will appear from the Conſideration of the Conſumption they will occaſion of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, and alſo of all other <hi>European</hi> Commodities in general, which laſt muſt be landed and reſhip'd in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> (which is by the Acts of Trade made the Staple of them for all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies) before they can be imported into <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into a Detail of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Commodities which are conſumed within the Colonies, or a Computation of what Number of Hands their preſent Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants may employ in <hi>England,</hi> for furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ones: Extracts from the Cuſtom-Houſe Books of the Goods exported for the Colonies, have ſhewn them to be very large at preſent; what is export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>New-England</hi> only amounting to <hi>Four
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007389_0050_102B8EBCA0248018"/>Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> Sterling per Annum; and the future Vent of them continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in Proportion to the Growth of its Inhabitants, muſt of it ſelf in Time become a more conſiderable Trade, and of a more beneficial Nature in every Reſpect to <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain,</hi> than all its Branches of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Foreign States, put together. It is computed that near Half the preſent Shipping of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is improved in the Commerce carried on with her Plantations, which Trade alone will in Time employ a much greater Quantity of Shipping, than all the preſent Shipping of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Beſides, this Trade will enable her with greater Advantage to extend her Commerce with other Countries.</p>
            <p>Another Remark relates to the Fiſheries carried on in the adjacent Seas: Very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eſtimates have been made of the <hi>New-England</hi> Cod-Fiſhery, whereby the Returns of it appear to be (excluſive of the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Fiſhery, for all of which there is a ſufficient Market) above <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> Sterling per Annum. All this Fiſh, except what is conſumed in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> which is but an inconſiderable Part of it, is exported to <hi>Portugal, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and there ſold for Gold, or Bills of Exchange payable in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> from whence Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007389_0051_102B8EBE7AD77A00"/>are made to the Colonies in Engliſh Goods; ſo that the Produce of the Fiſhery, as well as the Profit of furniſhing the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of it, center in the Mother-Country.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, a Whale-Fiſhery is carried on within the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bay,</hi> from whence conſiderable Quantities of Oil are yearly exported to <hi>England,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to the Amount of <hi>Twenty Thouſand Pounds</hi> Sterling, or more annually, the prime Coſt in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profits of theſe Fiſheries are the more Beneficial, as they are gained out of the Sea, (a Fund not to be exhauſted) and find Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for a great Number of Hands, many of which might be uſeleſs, or but of ſmall Account on Shore; as is found to be the Caſe of moſt Countries with Reſpect to the Refuſe Part of their Inhabitants: And Fiſheries are more particularly advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a Maritime Power, as they breed up the beſt of Sailors. The Cod-Fiſhery of <hi>New-England</hi> has therefore been ever juſtly eſteemed a good Nurſery of Seamen for the Royal Navy, &amp; it has the Advantage even of the Engliſh Colliery in this Reſpect, that whereas five or ſix Hands are ſufficient to navigate a Collier of a large Burthen, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Number of Hands is neceſſary to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on Board a Fiſhing Veſſel of fifty
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007389_0052_102B8EC05AD49760"/>Tons, for navigating it, and catching &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fiſh; all of whom may bereckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good Seamen, or at leaſt very fit for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Service on Board the King's Ships.</p>
            <p>The next Remark relates to the Naval Stores: Every Species of theſe is of the Growth and Produce of the Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. The Royal Navy is almoſt wholly ſupplied from the Province of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> with Maſts, Yards and Bowſprits; as the Shipping of <hi>England</hi> in general is with Pitch and Tar from <hi>Carolina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Article it may be obſerved, that it is an invaluable Advantage to a Maritime Power to have its Naval Stores of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of it's own Dominions, independent of a Foreign State, and not liable to be cut off from them by the Accident of War, or Prohibition of the Prince, in whoſe Dominion they muſt be purchaſed: To have them likewiſe imported in it's own Shipping, at reaſonable Rates, and in Exchange for it's own Manufactures.</p>
            <p>The Difference between being dependent upon a foreign Power for any of theſe Stores, and having them of the Growth of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Territories, is remarkable in the Article of Tar. When <hi>Great Britain</hi> was obliged to take that Species from the Northern
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007389_0053_102B8EC289E883A8"/>Powers, the Price of it roſe to <hi>five Pounds</hi> Sterling per Barrel; and <hi>Sweden</hi> in the Year 1710 refuſed to let it be exported in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels. This Impoſition occaſioned a Bounty to be given by Parliament for the Encouragement of raiſing Tar in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> the Effect of which has been to lower the Price of it to a tenth Part of what was before given; and to be paid for to Subjects of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, inſtead of being paid for to Foreigners in Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great-Britain</hi> may likewiſe in Time be ſupplied from her Northern Colonies with Bar Iron, Hemp and Pot-Aſh. Pot-Aſh has been made in <hi>New-England,</hi> and that of the beſt Quality and imported from thence to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And was the Method of making it publickly known, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> might be ſupplied from her Colonies in <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> with her whole Conſumption of that Article.</p>
            <p>The next Remark relates to the rich Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of Furrs, Tobacco
<note n="*" place="bottom">There are about 85,000 Hogſheads of Tobacco exported annually from <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi>
               </note> &amp; Rice, which are the Produce of theſe Colonies. There is likewiſe a fair Proſpect of <hi>Carolina</hi>'s rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſufficient Plantations of Mulberry Trees for the Production of Raw-Silk; they have
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007389_0054_102B8EC466C2CE48"/>already got to a confiderable Perfection in the raiſing &amp; making Indigo: It's Oranges are found to be near as good as thoſe of <hi>Seville;</hi> and it is not to be doubted but that the Climate and Soil of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Northern Colonies is capable of producing a variety of Wines that may vie with thoſe of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Thing to be remarked is, that the Lumber, Horſes and Fiſh (not to mention the Flower and Pork) with which <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>America</hi> ſupplies the Sugar Colonies, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for carrying on the Sugar Works in the Plantations there, &amp; for the Subſiſtence of their Negroes, ſo that the Support of theſe Iſlands, depends upon that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Northern Colonies: Were thoſe to be loſt, the Sugar Iſlands, independent of their being conquered by the <hi>French,</hi> would ſoon lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and decay to ſuch a Degree as to be of little Service to the Mother-Country.</p>
            <p>The laſt Remark to be made is, that the Prince, who holds Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> will be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to keep the Sovereignty of the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Ocean, thro' which the homeward bound Trade from the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally paſſes: This evidently appears from the Extent of the Sea-Coaſt, which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>North-America</hi> take up, abounding with moſt commodious Harbours, from
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007389_0055_102B8EC69E2C0790"/>whence the Ships paſſing thro' thoſe Seas, may be intercepted. <hi>France</hi> moſt ſenſibly felt the Effects of it during the laſt War in the Captures made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of their Trade in general, returning from thoſe Parts: And it is well known that the Harbour of <hi>Louisbourg</hi> is the Rendezvous of the <hi>French</hi> Eaſt-India and South-Sea Trade in their Paſſage home to <hi>France.</hi> It is evident from what has been mentioned, how much the Shipping, Trade and Maritime Power of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> muſt be increaſed by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ariſing to her from her Colonies in <hi>North-America:</hi> And on the other Hand, how much her Power would be diminiſhed, and that of <hi>France</hi> aggrandized, if ſhe ſhould ever happen to loſe them to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſervation therefore, which has been made by ſome, That <hi>England</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her Power and Sovereignty at Sea before ſhe was augmented with her Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and therefore may as well ſupport it now without them, is ill-founded. It is true, was the Conſequence of her loſing them only to be, that they would become vacant, or which is the ſame Thing with Reſpect to the Powers in <hi>Europe,</hi> be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied only by <hi>Indian Savages,</hi> (which was the State of <hi>North-America</hi> before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> entered into Poſſeſſion of it)
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007389_0056_102B8EC8CD3FD0B0"/>
               <hi>Great Britain,</hi> tho' much weakened by the Loſs of her Colonies, might ſtill (ſuppoſing the Marine of <hi>France</hi> to be as much inferior in all other Reſpects to that of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as it was before the two Crowns ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their reſpective Poſſeſſions in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>America</hi>) ſupport her Power at Sea in the ſame State ſhe did before the Acquiſition of them. But that is not the Caſe; if the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ſhould loſe Poſſeſſion of them, the <hi>French</hi> would gain it; and the Queſtion is, What Alteration in the State of Power, this Change might make to the Prejudice of <hi>England;</hi> and whether the <hi>French,</hi> after <hi>England</hi> had ſuffered this Diminution in her Trade and Maritime Strength, would not by their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of it, in Addition to the Reſources of Wealth and Power which <hi>France</hi> already has in her ſelf and her <hi>American</hi> Territories, have laid a ſure Foundation for a general and laſting Dominion by Sea as well as Land? Undoubtedly if this ſhould ever be the Caſe, the Trade &amp; Commerce of <hi>France,</hi> and with it her Naval Power, would increaſe to ſuch a Degree of Superiority over that of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as muſt entirely deſtroy her Commerce, reduce her from her preſent State of Independency to be at laſt nothing more than a Province of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> court are very ſenſible of this, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007389_0057_102B8ECAA6F459E0"/>have long been purfuing ſuch Meaſures as may finally bring about this Event, tho' perhaps at a diſtant Time.</p>
            <p>With this View, Maps of this Country have been from Time to Time publiſhed under the Direction of that Court, in every later one of which they have been making greater Exciſions of his Majeſty's Territories, and tacking them to thoſe of the Grand Monarch; and at the ſame Time actually taking Poſſeſſion of them, ſettling and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying upon them.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it is evident that the <hi>French</hi> have been, and are now, in manifeſt Violation of the moſt ſolemn Treaties, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt hoſtile Encroachments upon his Majeſty's undoubted Territories.</p>
            <p>That the Conſequences of theſe Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if the <hi>French</hi> are ſuffered to keep Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, and ſtrengthen themſelves in them, will be;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The engroſſing the whole of the Furr Trade of <hi>North-America</hi> to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The attaching all the Indians ſcattered thro' that vaſt Continent upon the Back of all the Engliſh Settlements to their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The employing thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> when thus attached to them, even in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007389_0058_102B8ECC2FE6A648"/>to annoy any or all his Majeſty's Colonies, as may beſt ſerve their Purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they will one Day make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>North-America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe Colonies are of ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Trade, Wealth and Naval Power of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and will in future Time make ſo much larger Additions to it, that whilſt ſhe keeps them entire, ſhe will be able to maintain not only her Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, but her Superiority as a Maritime Power. And on the other Hand, ſhould ſhe once loſe them, and the <hi>French</hi> gain them, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> herſelf muſt neceſſarily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to an abſolute Subjection to the <hi>French Crown,</hi> to be nothing more than a <hi>Province of France.</hi>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS concerning the Increaſe of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">1. TAbles of the Proportion of Marriages to Births, of Deaths to Births, of Marriages to the Numbers of Inhabitants, &amp;c. form'd on Obſervaions made upon the Bills of Mortality, Chriſtnings, &amp;c. of populous Cities, will not ſuit Countries; nor will Tables form'd on Obſervations made on full ſettled old Countries, as <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuit new Countries, as <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For People increaſe in Proportion to the Number of Marriages, and that is greater in Proportion to the Eaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of ſupporting a Family. When Families can be eaſily ſupported, more Perſons marry, and earlier in Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Cities, where all Trades, Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations and Offices are full, many delay marrying, till they can ſee how to bear the Charges of a Family; which Charges
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007389_0060_102B8ED0F391CC28"/>are greater in Cities, as Luxury is more common: many live ſingle during Life, and continue Servants to Families, Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neymen to Trades &amp;c. hence Cities do not by natural Generation ſupply themſelves with Inhabitants; the Deaths are more than the Births.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Countries full ſettled, the Caſe muſt be nearly the ſame; all Lands being occupied and improved to the Heighth; thoſe who cannot get Land, muſt Labour for others that have it; when Labourers are plenty, their Wages will be low; by low Wages a Family is ſupported with Difficulty; this Difficulty deters many from Marriage, who therefore long continue Servants and ſingle.—Only as the Cities take Supplies of People from the Country, and thereby make a little more Room in the Country; Marriage is a little more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd there, and the Births exceed the Deaths.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Europe</hi> is generally full ſettled with Huſbandmen, Manufacturers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now much increaſe in People: <hi>America</hi> is chiefly occupied by Indians, who ſubſiſt moſtly by Hunting.— But as the Hunter, of all Men, requires the greateſt Quantity of Land from whence to draw his Subſiſtence, (the Huſbandman
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007389_0061_102B8ED2805743D8"/>ſubſiſting on much leſs, the Gardner on ſtill leſs, and the Manufacturer requiring leaſt of all), The <hi>Europeans</hi> found <hi>America</hi> fully ſettled as it well could be by Hunters; yet theſe having large Tracks, were eaſily prevail'd on to part with Portions of Territory to the new Comers, who did not much interfere with the Natives in Hunting, and furniſh'd them with many Things they wanted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Land being thus plenty in <hi>America,</hi> and ſo cheap as that a labouring Man, that underſtands Huſbandry, can in a ſhort Time ſave Money enough to purchaſe a Piece of new Land ſufficient for a Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereon he may ſubſiſt a Family; ſuch are not afraid to marry; for if they even look far enough forward to conſider how their Children when grown up are to be provided for, they ſee that more Land is to be had at Rates equally eaſy, all Circumſtances conſidered.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hence Marriages in <hi>America</hi> are more general, and more generally early, than in <hi>Europe.</hi> And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one Marriage per Annum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 100 Perſons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in <hi>Europe</hi> they have but 4 Births to a Marriage (many of their Marriages being late) we may here reckon
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007389_0062_102B8ED46247C1C0"/>8, of which if one half grow up, and our Marriages are made, reckoning one with another at 20 Years of Age, our People muſt at leaſt be doubled every 20 Years.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But notwithſtanding this Increaſe, ſo vaſt is the Territory of <hi>North-America,</hi> that it will require many Ages to ſettle it fully; and till it is fully ſettled, Labour will never be cheap here, where no Man continues long a Labourer for others, but gets a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his own, no Man continues long a Journeyman to a Trade, but goes among thoſe new Settlers, and ſets up for himſelf, &amp;c. Hence Labour is no cheaper now, in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> than it was 30 Years ago, tho' ſo many Thouſand labouring People have been imported.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Danger therefore of theſe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies interfering with their Mother Country in Trades that depend on Labour, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, &amp;c. is too remote to require the Attention of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. But in Proportion to the Increaſe of the Colonies, a vaſt Demand is growing for Britiſh Manufactures, a glorious Market wholly in the Power of <hi>Britain,</hi> in which Foreigners cannot interfere, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in a ſhort Time even beyond her Power of ſupplying, tho' her whole Trade ſhould be to her Colonies: Therefore <hi>Britain</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007389_0063_102B8ED5F4BC3A98"/>ſhould not too much reſtrain Manufactures in her Colonies. A wife and good Mother will not do it. To diſtreſs, is to weaken, and weakening the Children, weakens the whole Family.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Beſides if the Manufactures of <hi>Britain</hi> (by Reaſon of the <hi>American</hi> Demands) ſhould riſe too high in Price, Foreigners who can ſell cheaper will drive her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants out of Foreign Markets; Foreign Manufactures will thereby be encouraged and increaſed, and conſequently foreign Nations, perhaps her Rivals in Power, grow more populous and more powerful; while her own Colonies, kept too low, are unable to aſſiſt her, or add to her Strength.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Tis an ill-grounded Opinion that by the Labour of Slaves, <hi>America</hi> may poſſibly vie in Cheapneſs of Manufactures with <hi>Britain.</hi> The Labour of Slaves can never be ſo cheap here as the Labour of working Men is in <hi>Britain.</hi> Any one may compute it. Intereſt of Money is in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies from 6 to 10 per Cent. Slaves one with another coſt 30 £. Sterling per Head. Reckon then the Intereſt of the firſt Purchaſe of a Slave, the Inſurance or Riſque on his Life, his Cloathing and Diet, Expences in his Sickneſs and Loſs of Time, Loſs by his Neglect of Buſineſs (Neglect is natural to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007389_0064_102B8ED82C5DCDA8"/>the Man who is not to be benefited by his own Care or Diligence), Expence of a Driver to keep him at Work, and his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from Time to Time, almoſt every Slave being <hi>by Nature</hi> a Thief, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the whole Amount with the Wages of a Manufacturer of Iron or Wool in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> you will ſee that Labour is much chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there than it ever can be by Negroes here. Why then will <hi>Americans</hi> purchaſe Slaves? Becauſe Slaves may be kept as long as a Man pleaſes, or has Occaſion for their Labour; while hired Men are continually leaving their Maſter (often in the midſt of his Buſineſs,) and ſetting up for themſelves. §. 8.</p>
            <p n="13">13. As the Increaſe of People depends on the Encouragement of Marriages, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Things muſtdiminiſh a Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The being conquered; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors will engroſs as many Offices, and exact as much Tribute or Profit on the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the conquered, as will maintain them in their new Eſtabliſhment, and this diminiſhing the Subſiſtence of the Natives diſcourages their Marriages, &amp; ſo gradually diminiſhes them, while the Foreigners increaſe. 2. Loſs of Territory. Thus the <hi>Britons</hi> being driven into <hi>Wales,</hi> and crowded together in a barren Country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſſicient
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007389_0065_102B8EDA5CC70CD8"/>to ſupport ſuch great Numbers, diminiſhed 'till the People bore a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Produce, while the <hi>Saxons</hi> increas'd on their abandoned Lands; 'till the Iſland became full of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now driven into <hi>Wales</hi> by ſome foreign Nation, there would in a few Years be no more Engliſhmen in <hi>Britain,</hi> than there are now People in <hi>Wales.</hi> 3. Loſs of Trade. Manufactures exported, draw Subſiſtence from Foreign Countries for Numbers; who are thereby enabled to marry and raiſe Families. If the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be deprived of any Branch of Trade, and no new Employment is found for the People occupy'd in that Branch, it will alſo be ſoon deprived of ſo many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 4. Loſs of Food. Suppoſe a Nation has a Fiſhery, which not only employs great Numbers, but makes the Food and Subſiſtence of the People cheaper: If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Nation becomes Maſter of the Seas, and prevents the Fiſhery, the People will diminiſh in Proportion as the Loſs of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and Dearneſs of Proviſion, makes it more difficult to ſubſiſt a Family. 5. Bad Government and inſecure Property. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not only leave ſuch a Country, and ſettling Abroad incorporate with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, loſe their native Language, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007389_0066_102B8EDC13473610"/>Foreigners; but the Induſtry of thoſe that remain being diſcourag'd, the Quantity of Subſiſtence in the Country is leſſen'd, and the Support of a Family becomes more difficult. So heavy Taxes tend to diminiſh a People. 6. The Introduction of Slaves. The Negroes brought into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sugar <hi>Iſlands,</hi> have greatly diminiſh'd the Whites there; the Poor are by this Means depriv'd of Employment, while a few Families acquire vaſt Eſtates; which they ſpend on Foreign Luxuries, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their Children in the Habit of thoſe Luxuries; the ſame Income is needed for the Support of one that might have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd 100. The Whites who have Slaves, not labouring, are enfeebled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo generally prolific; the Slaves being work'd too hard, and ill fed, their Conſtitutions are broken, and the Deaths among them are more than the Births; ſo that a continual Supply is needed from <hi>Africa.</hi> The Northern Colonies having few Slaves increaſe in Whites. Slaves alſo pejorate the Families that uſe them; the white Children become proud, diſguſted with Labour, and being educated in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are rendered unfit to get a Living by Induſtry.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007389_0067_102B8EDF11C2A950"/>
14. Hence the Prince that acquires new Territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes the Natives to give his own People Room; the Legiſlator that makes effectual Laws for promoting of Trade, increaſing Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, improving Land by more or better Tillage; providing more Food by Fiſheries; ſecuring Property, &amp;c. and the Man that invents new Trades, Arts or Manufactures, or new Improvements in Huſbandry, may be properly called <hi>Fathers</hi> of their Nation, as they are the Cauſe of the Generation of Multitudes, by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they afford to Marriage.</p>
            <p n="15">15. As to Privileges granted to the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (ſuch as the <hi>Jus trium Liberorum</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi>) they may haſten the filling of a Country that has been thinned by War or Peſtilence, or that has otherwiſe vacant Territory; but cannot increaſe a People beyond the Means provided for their Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Foreign Luxuries &amp; needleſs Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures imported and uſed in a Nation, do, by the ſame Reaſoning, increaſe the People of the Nation that furniſhes them, and diminiſh the People of the Nation that uſes them.—Laws therefore that prevent ſuch Importations, and on the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Exportation of Manufactures to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007389_0068_102B8EE0ECDDD700"/>be conſumed in Foreign Countries, may be called (with Reſpect to the People that make them) <hi>generative Laws,</hi> as by increaſing Subſiſtence they encourage Marriage. Such Laws likewiſe ſtrengthen a Country, doubly, by increaſing its own People and diminiſhing its Neighbours.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Some <hi>European</hi> Nations prudently refuſe to conſume the Manufactures of <hi>Eaſt-India:</hi> — They ſhould likewiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to their Colonies; for the Gain to the Merchant, is not to be compar'd with the Loſs by this Means of People to the Nation.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Home Luxury in the Great, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the Nation's Manufacturers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by it, who are many, and only tends to diminiſh the Families that indulge in it, who are few. The greater the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faſhionable Expence of any Rank of People, the more cautious they are of Marriage. Therefore Luxury ſhould never be ſuffer'd to become common.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The great Increaſe of Offspring in particular Families, is not always owing to greater Fecundity of Nature, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Examples of Induſtry in the Heads, and induſtrious Education; by which the Children are enabled to provide better for
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007389_0069_102B8EE27636D090"/>themſelves, and their marrying early, is encouraged from the Proſpect of good Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="20">20. If there be a Sect therefore, in our Nation, that regard Frugality and Induſtry as religious Duties, and educate their Children therein, more than others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do; ſuch Sect muſt conſequently increaſe more by natural Generation, than any other Sect in <hi>Britain.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="21">21. The Importation of Foreigners into a Country that has as many Inhabitants as the preſent Employments and Proviſions for Subſiſtence will bear; will be in the End no Increaſe of People; unleſs the New Comers have more Induſtry and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality than the Natives, and then they will provide more Subſiſtence, and increaſe in the Country; but they will gradually eat the Natives out.—Nor is it neceſſary to bring in Foreigners to fill up any occaſional Vacancy in a Country; for ſuch Vacancy (if the Laws are good, § 14, 16) will ſoon be filled by natural Generation. Who can now find the Vacancy made in <hi>Sweden, France</hi> or other Warlike Nations, by the Plague of Heroiſm 40 Years age; in <hi>France,</hi> by the Expulſion of the Proteſtants; in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the Settlement of her Colonies; or in <hi>Guinea,</hi> by 100 Years Exportation of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007389_0070_102B84744AF25288"/>Slaves, that has blacken'd half <hi>America?</hi>— The thinneſs of Inhabitants in <hi>Spain,</hi> is owing to National Pride and Idleneſs, and other Cauſes, rather than to the Expulſion of the <hi>Moors,</hi> or to the making of new Settlements.</p>
            <p n="22">22. There is in ſhort, no Bound to the prolific Nature of Plants or Animals, but what is made by their crowding and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with each others Means of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Was the Face of the Earth vacant of other Plants, it might be gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſowed and overſpread with one Kind only; as, for Inſtance, with Fennel; and were it empty of other Inhabitants, it might in a few Ages be repleniſh'd from one Nation only; as, for Inſtance, with <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> Thus there are ſuppos'd to be now upwards of One Million <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souls in <hi>North-America,</hi> (tho' 'tis thought ſcarce 80,000 have been brought over Sea) and yet perhaps there is not one the ſewer in <hi>Britain,</hi> but rather many more, on Account of the Employment the Colonies afford to Manufacturers at Home. This Million doubling, ſuppoſe but once in 25 Years, will in another Century be more than the People of <hi>England,</hi> and the greateſt Number of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> will be on this Side the Water. What an Acceſſion of Power to the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:007389_0071_102B8EE683B89360"/>Empire by Sea as well as Land! What Increaſe of Trade and Navigation! What Numbers of Ships and Seamen! We have been here but little more than 100 Years, and yet the Force of our Privateers in the late War, united, was greater, both in Men and Guns, than that of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Navy in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time.—How important an Affair then to <hi>Britain,</hi> is the preſent Treaty for ſettling the Bounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Colonies and the <hi>French,</hi> and how careful ſhould ſhe be to ſecure Room enough, ſince on the Room depends ſo much the Increaſe of her People?</p>
            <p n="23">23. In fine, A Nation well regulated is like a Polypus; take away a Limb, its Place is ſoon ſupply'd; cut it in two, and each deficient Part ſhall ſpeedily grow out of the Part remaining. Thus if you have Room and Subſiſtence enough, as you may by dividing, make ten Polypes out of one, you may of one make ten Nations, equally populous and powerful; or rather, increaſe a Nation ten fold in Numbers and Strength.</p>
            <p>And ſince Detachments of <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Britain</hi> ſent to <hi>America,</hi> will have their Places at Home ſo ſoon ſupply'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſo largely here; why ſhould the <hi>Palatine Boors</hi> be ſuffered to ſwarm into our Settlements, and by herding together
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007389_0072_102B8EE8B69119D8"/>eſtabliſh their Language and Manners to the Excluſion of ours? Why ſhould <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> founded by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> become a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Aliens,</hi> who will ſhortly be ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to Germanize us inſtead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Cuſtoms, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very ſmall. All <hi>Africa</hi> is black or tawny. <hi>Aſia</hi> chiefly tawny. <hi>America</hi> (excluſive of the new Comers) wholly ſo. And in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards, Italians, French, Ruſſians</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> are generally of what we call a ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Complexion; as are the <hi>Germans</hi> alſo, the <hi>Saxons</hi> only excepted, who with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wiſh their Numbers were increaſed. And while we are, as I may call it, <hi>Scouring</hi> our Planet, by clearing <hi>America</hi> of Woods, and ſo making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> why ſhould we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increaſe the Sons of <hi>Africa,</hi> by Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in <hi>America,</hi> where we have ſo
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007389_0073_102B8EEA44C7E080"/>fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increaſing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for ſuch Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.</p>
