         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FREDERIC Manheim, an induſtrious German, with his family, conſiſting of his wife, Catharine, a daughter of eighteen years of age, and Maria and Chriſtina, his youngeſt children (twins,) about ſixteen, reſided near the river Mohawk, eight miles writ of Johnſton. On the 19th of October, 1779, the father being at work at ſome diſtance from his habitation, and the mother and eldeſt daughter on a viſit at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's, two hoſtile Canaſadaga Indians ruſhed in, and captured the twin ſiſters.</p>
            <p>The party to which thoſe ſavages belonged, conſiſted of fifty warriors, who after ſecuring twenty-three of the inhabitants of that neighbourhood, (among whom was the unfortunate Frederic Manheim) and firing their houſes, retired for four days with the utmoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, till they were quite ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At length, with countenances diſtorted by infernal fury, and with hideous yells, the two ſavages who had captured the hapleſs Maria and Chriſtina, leaped into the midſt of their circle, and dragged thoſe ill-fated maidens, ſhrieking, from the embraces of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.

Theſe warriors had diſagreed about whoſe property the girls ſhould be, as they had jointly ſeized them; and, to terminate the diſpute, agreeably to the abominable uſage of the ſavages, it was determined by the chiefs of the party, that the priſoners, who gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I WROTE you a note a few days ago, in which I promiſed you the particulars of an affair between a white man of this county, and two Indians: now I mean to relate the whole ſtory, and it is as follows:</p>

to his plantation, which was about a mile diſtant, there to do ſome buſineſs in the field He afterwards thought fit to follow, and ſee how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ared. Get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeating himſelf upon the ſence, within view of his children, where they were at work, he eſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed two Indians making towards them; on which he called to his children to make their eſcape. The Indians immediately bent their courſe towards him. He made the beſt haſte to eſcape away, that his age and conſequent infirmity would permit; but ſoon found he would be overtaken, which made him think of defence. Being-armed with a good rifle, he faced about, and found himſelf under the neceſſity of running four or five perches towards the Indians, in order to obtain ſhelter behind a tree of ſufficient ſize.</p>
            <p>This unexpected in manceuvre obliged the Indians, who were cloſe by, to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p where they had but ſmall tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſhelter behind, which gave Mr. Morgan an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhooting one of them dead upon the ſpot. The other, taking the advantage of Morgan's empty gun, advanced upon him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut him to flight a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and being lighter of foot than the old man, ſoon came up within a few paces, when he fired at him, but fortunately miſſed him. On this Mr. Morgan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aced about again, to try his fortune, and clubbed his fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock. The Indian, by this time, had got his tomahawk in order for a throw, at which they are very dextrous. Morgan made the blow, and the Indian the throw, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame inſtant, by which the little finger was cut off Morgan's left hand, and the one next to it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt off, and his gun broke off by the lock. Now they came to cloſe grips. Morgan put the Indian down; but ſoon found himſelf overturned, and the Indian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, feeling for his knife, and yelling moſt hideouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as their manner is, when they look upon victory to be certain. However, a woman's apron, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian had plundered out of a houſe in the neighbourhood, and tied on him, above his knife, was now in his way, and ſo hindered him getting at it quickly, that Morgan got one of his fingers faſt in his mouth, and deprived him of the uſe of that hand, by holding it; and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed him conſiderably by chewing it; all the while obſerving how he would come on with his knife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="unknown:048110_0005_1024FBB8AEF92580"/>
length the Indian had got hold of his knife, but ſo far towards the blade, that Morgan got a ſmall hold of the hinder end; and as the Indian pulled it out of the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, Morgan giving his finger a ſevere ſcrew with his teeth, twitched it out through his hand, cutting it moſt grievouſly. By this time they were both got partly on their feet, and the Indian was endeavouring to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf; but Morgan held faſt by the finger, and quickly applied the point of the knife to the ſide of its ſavage owner; a bone happening in the way prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its penetrating any great depth, but a ſecond blow directed more towards the belly, found free paſſage into his bowels. The old man turned the point upward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, made a large wound, burying the knife therein, and ſo took his departure inſtantly to the fort, with the news of his adventure.</p>
            <p>On the report of Mr. Morgan, a party went out from the fort, and found the firſt Indian where he had fallen; the ſecond they found not yet dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at one hundred yards diſtance from the ſcene of action, hid in the top of a fallen tree, where he had picked the knife out of his body, after which had come out parched corn, &amp;c. and had bound up his wound with the apron aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and on firſt ſight he ſaluted them with, How do do, broder, how do do, broder? but alas! poor ſavage, their brotherhood to him extended only to tomahawking, ſcalping, and, to gratify ſome peculiar feelings of their own, they ſkinned them both.</p>
