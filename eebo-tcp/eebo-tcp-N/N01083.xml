            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it Endangers the World while it flatters and ſeems to adorn it: <hi>As in the days that were before the Flood, they did eat, they drank, they Marryed, — until the day that Noah entred into the Ark; and the Flood came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be there never was more <hi>Mirth,</hi> nor under leſs <hi>Regulation,</hi> than in this <hi>Age,</hi> and among too many in this <hi>Place.</hi> A great deal of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry</hi> there is in the <hi>Town,</hi> and very graceful and charming it is ſo far as it is Innocent and Wiſe. Our <hi>Wit</hi> like our <hi>Air</hi> is clear and <hi>Keen,</hi> and in very Many 'tis exalted by a <hi>Polite Education</hi> meeting with good <hi>Natural Parts:</hi> 'tis pity that <hi>Sin</hi> ſhould mix with it, to render it <hi>Nauſeous</hi> and <hi>Deſtructive,</hi> and make it end in <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi>

thy Youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the dayes of thy Youth, and walk in the way of thine Heart, and in the fight of thine Eyes; but know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi> To Young People therefore it is that I principally <hi>Write;</hi> and poſſibly may do it with <hi>Advantage</hi> as well as <hi>Decency,</hi> my own <hi>Youth</hi> and natural <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> not ſavouring to them of <hi>Moroſeneſs,</hi> that common <hi>Prejudice</hi> of ſenſual Youth againſt their wiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers.</p>
            <p>And indeed I am far from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt Sober <hi>Mirth:</hi> On the contrary, I juſtifie, applaud &amp; recommend it; <hi>Only let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be as becometh the Goſpel;</hi> let it be pure and grave, ſerious and devout, all which it may be and yet free and chearful; there's no neceſſity of being Immodeſt or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, Idle and Impertinent, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be Merry. Yet for want of

a Religious care and <hi>Watch</hi> over themſelves, people ſlip inſenſibly into theſe Exceſſes; and ſome ſet themſelves to abuſe and pervert their Wit, and the Bounty of God to them, to <hi>Filthineſs, and fooliſh Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Jeſting, which are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi> nor ſhou'd <hi>be once named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong</hi> us, <hi>as becometh Saints; But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving of Thanks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A more mean and ſickly thing this is in <hi>Elder People,</hi> as well as more vile and horrid! their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Abominable and Pernicious, and Portentous to themſelves that they are of that Number, St. <hi>James</hi> 5.5. <hi>Ye have lived in pleaſure on the Earth, and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your hearts, as in a day of ſlaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe there is another <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,</hi> and too many <hi>Good People</hi> run into it, I wou'd turn my <hi>Addreſs</hi> to them, and <hi>Say:</hi> That by no means muſt <hi>they</hi> ſeem to place any thing

of Religion in being <hi>Dull and heavy, ſad and diſconſolate, ſour and moroſe.</hi> Not only does Religion <hi>Allow</hi> but it <hi>Obliges</hi> unto chearfulneſs with Sobriety: It gives the moſt reaſon for it, and is ſerv'd by it: None have that <hi>Licenſe,</hi> and in none is it ſo <hi>Decent</hi> and <hi>Comely</hi> as in them that are Good. Mirth was not made for the Profane and Ungodly, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> is the peculiar Duty and Priviledge of Saints: They are under Bonds to exhibit the Pleaſures and <hi>Satisfactions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> if it be poſſible to convince the Ungodly how <hi>Superior they are</hi> to all thoſe of <hi>Senſe</hi> which this World has to boaſt of. If men are for <hi>Mirth, This</hi> is worthy to be called ſo and aſpir'd after! A Joy that is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, Pure, Perfective, Purmanent! Stronger than all Afflictions, and abiding in Death! A light in thoſe ſhades, and a Triumph 'ore thoſe Terrors!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:001293_0007_0FB22B40987E5AF0"/>To do my <hi>Duty</hi> therefore to One and Other, I have in the following <hi>Pages</hi> endeavour'd to ſhow the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Obligation of Natural and Civil Mirth,</hi> and then the foul <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes</hi> of it to <hi>Vice and Carnality;</hi> and finally I have conſider'd (as I was able within ſo ſhort a compaſs) the <hi>Pleaſures that are proper to Religion.</hi>

            <p>We are very prone to Err in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very State, and in all our Frames. The Devil is ready to ſuit his Temptations, and the Corruption within us ſhows it ſelf variouſly, but with equal impetuous Luſtings, as our Condition and Temper in this changing World do alter. It particularly luſts againſt the Duty of the preſent Day, and like an expert Enemy tries to make its advantage of all that occurs, and to divert us from making ours. On the contrary, where the Grace of God is lively and vigorous, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences to thoſe particular Duties which are <hi>peculiarly proper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent</hi> under preſent Providences,

The <hi>Rules</hi> are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch a <hi>Maſter,</hi> as they were the practice of an <hi>equal Apoſtle,</hi> who ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I know both how to be abaſed, &amp; I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need.</hi> So wou'd the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us alſo, how to ſerve God and preſerve Fellowſhip with him, how to carry on the proper work of our Lives, and maintain a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Intercourſe with Heaven, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are <hi>Merry or Sad.</hi>

it: Intemperate Pleaſures ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize it, and it becomes light and frothy: But if our affections be well limited and directed, they do excellently ſubſerve unto the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace. We may be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful and yet ſerious, reſign'd and thankful; and we may be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and yet grave, devout and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. It is utterly an Error to think, <hi>that a mournful Spirit does on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or beſt ſuit Exerciſes of Devotion:</hi> You need not of neceſſity always get the frame of your Spirit alter'd before you draw nigh to God, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improve the preſent frame to Serve him withal; for if it be not irregular and inordinate in it ſelf, there are Religious Acts or Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces peculiarly adapted to it.</p>
            <p>Many people if they are ſad and penſive, are apt to think, this is a ſerious frame, and proper to help me in Retirement or in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip; but if in a <hi>chearful vein,</hi> they go abroad to be <hi>merry:</hi>

Whereas they might be as laudably and as profitably <hi>now</hi> in their Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets or in the Church as before, and it may be rather the more ſo, becauſe a chearful ſpirit will go about Religious Duties, as well as Worldly Works, with the more life, delight and zeal.</p>
            <p>Let every man therefore in that circumſtance of Life wherein he is, <hi>Walk with God.</hi> Let no <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Frame</hi> prove your temptation; but as theſe alter, remember that the ſame work is to be carried on not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, only in a different manner. So that our buſineſs is to enquire, and ſatisfie our ſelves from the Word of God, what the duty of the preſent Circumſtance or Frame is: Am I now Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Yet let me not be duller and leſs active in Religion than before. Or, Am I in a pleaſant Humour? Let me not be leſs ſerious, leſs thoughtful of my Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal State. <hi>Praiſe</hi> may now

preſerve, continue and increaſe that Communion with God, which before was carried on by <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Inſtructive and Uſeful <hi>Leſſon</hi> ſuggeſted in the <hi>Text</hi> is this: <hi>That every Ornament, Gift and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our Souls is a Talent lent us by God, to be improv'd in his Service, and return'd to him again in way of tribute and acknowledgment. Two Inſtances</hi> there are before us, which I am apt to think are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſider'd as the Gifts of God, improveable to his Glory, and to be accounted for another day: theſe are, <hi>A Chearful Spirit, and a Muſical Ear and Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>A Chearful Spirit, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of Temper and Diſpoſition, is a precious gift of God, a happy &amp; love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, and to be uſed to his Glory.</hi> Such a Chriſtian muſt eſpecially recommend Religion in his Life, as a ſeal to that Truth, <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all her
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001293_0021_0FB22C0F199DB570"/>
Paths are Peace.</hi> He muſt beware of Vanity and Froth, and ſenſual Exceſſes, to which his Temper will eaſily betray him. His care ought to be that <hi>his Wiſdom remains with him</hi> in his Pleaſantry; and that he never give himſelf all the looſe which his heart may crave, for fear it ſhou'd run quite away with him. He is inexcuſable if he be not often delighting himſelf in God, and if he make not his Duty miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi> when Worldly things ſerve to his <hi>Senſitive.</hi> God did not give the Man this ſweet. Temper to Serve the Devil with it, &amp; make the ways of Irreligion look Gay; but to <hi>adorn</hi> his own Holy <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to ſhew how pleaſant the Road to Heaven, and how bright the Serenity, how profound the Peace, of his Servants Soul may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another conſiderable Ornament and Beauty in any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, <hi>A Muſical Ear and Voice; Art
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001293_0022_0FB22C131174C000"/>
and Skill in Singing, and a Genius to reliſh the Luſty Airs &amp; Strains of Poetry.</hi> Theſe alſo are of great Uſe unto Devotion, and when devoutly us'd they are truly Great &amp; Charming. God deſign'd 'em for the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own Perfections &amp; Works, tho' to be ſure the Devil has ſcarce ever had ſo much Honour and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from any thing. He uſes to attempt the faireſt and worthieſt part of God's Workmanſhip, and therefore has labour'd ſo to engroſs theſe; as knowing their Power and Force to ſerve that Intereſt they take in with.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> POEM we know of was a <hi>Divine One,</hi> Inſpir'd in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Numbers</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt; &amp; ſo the <hi>Firſt Singing</hi> we read of was to celebrate the <hi>Triumph of the God of Iſrael</hi> in the Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> (When had they altogether held their Peace the Neighbouring <hi>Rocks and Woods</hi> wou'd have cry'd out, and the <hi>Dumb Fiſh</hi> of the Sea after their

               <hi>Fright</hi> woud have found a Tongue.) We know alſo of another <hi>Song of Moſes</hi> to be Sung on a more Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Occaſion: So that the <hi>Firſt and Laſt of Poetry</hi> is ſacred to God: the <hi>Song of Moſes</hi> begins it, and the <hi>Song of Moſes and the Lamb</hi> ends it in the Holy Scripture; and the <hi>Argument</hi> of each much the ſame.</p>

               <hi>David's Skill</hi> is known both in <hi>Compoſing and Playing on Inſtruments,</hi> and in his <hi>Pſalms</hi> and by his <hi>Harp</hi> Poetry &amp; Muſick were both Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd and Perfected.</p>

The Triumphs of ſilthy Vice have been waited on and adorned, by a Servile and Scandalous Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of theſe lovely Gifts; and Sin has been ſo ſet off (like <hi>a Fiend transform'd into an Angel of Light</hi>) that Multitudes have been taken by its dreſs, and charm'd into Hell.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Were this indecent in all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Nature had not put this Faculty and Diſpoſition into us, and made it ſo beautiful in us.</hi> God has ſo form'd and fram'd us, and it is his Work; and 'tis moſt plain that he has grac'd and enobled is Creature in it.

               <hi>Sorrow of heart</hi> ſhows the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>broken,</hi> but <hi>a Merry heart makes</hi> a bright <hi>Countenance,</hi> Prov. 15.13. Then Man appears <hi>Without</hi> like his <hi>Firſt Self;</hi> Grave and yet full of Life and delight; ſo he muſt needs be tho't to have been in his State of Integrity and Dominion: he Survey'd himſelf and all about him with unknown Content and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; no Cloud hung over his Brow, nor Frown wrinkled it; he walk'd Erect, without a dejected look, and as there was nothing light in his Air and Gate, ſo there was nothing dull and heavy: he had that Life &amp; Majeſty in his face that aw'd all the Creatures, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded fear and obedience from them. God made Man in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and at the top of his proper Felicity; from which he is ſunk by Sin, partly becauſe of the Grief that comes of it, whereby we now ſo often look abject, low and mean; ſtrangly other than what cou'd have

And if this muſt be ſuppos'd of Man in his firſt Eſtate, then ſo far as chearfulneſs can be without Sin, we may conclude 'tis Comely &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental in our preſent State, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſign of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the will of Him that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If Mirth might not be decent &amp; lawful, our Bleſſed Saviour wou'd not have ever countenanc'd it, nor wou'd the Joyes of Heaven have been ſet off by it.</hi> It is plain that our Saviour did give <hi>Countenance</hi> to it, by his Preſence at <hi>the Marriage in Cana of Galilee.</hi> This was the Houſe of Rejoycing, and Jeſus goes thither as well as to the Houſe of Mourning: and as he <hi>Wept with the Siſters of Lazarus</hi> whom he found in Tears, ſo no queſtion

he here partook in the <hi>Bridegrooms Joy.</hi> The <hi>Gueſts</hi> were indeed Select and Heavenly; <hi>The Mother of Jeſus was there, and both Jeſus was called and his Diſciples;</hi> yet it is not to be doubted but there was Sober Mirth among them, as there was plenty of Wine; <hi>Wine that maketh glad mens hearts,</hi> and miniſters to their Mirth; and leſt there ſhou'd be any want of it, as there had like to have been, he ſupply'd 'em by his Divine Power. Hereby he ſanctify'd the Solemnity and the Joy of it. As alſo elſewhere he intimates, that Sorrow were improper &amp; indecent at ſuch a time and place: <hi>Can the Children of the Bride-chamber Mourn, while the Bride-groom is with 'em?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>The Joy of Heaven</hi> is repreſented to us by Vertuous Mirth. <hi>Let us make merry and be glad,</hi> ſaid the Father of the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> who in the <hi>Parable</hi> is our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heavenly Father in Jeſus Chriſt. We are the <hi>Prodigals,</hi> who
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001293_0035_0FB22C2F77AC0788"/>
ſo often ſpend our firſt years in Riots and Exceſs, madly hunting after all manner of ſenſual Joy, wandring from God, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him; but upon our <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> there is <hi>Joy in Heaven among the Holy Angels,</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt thus repreſents to us— <hi>They began to be merry.</hi> In Heaven we are told there is the <hi>Fulneſs of Joy</hi> and <hi>Rivers of Pleaſures:</hi> 'tis called alſo the <hi>Marriage Supper of the Lamb,</hi> and the united Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Elect Gueſts begins thus, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce.</hi>— So then Mirth may be decent and good, ſince it is a ſhadow of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sober Mirth is a duty ſo far as it is a due acknowledgment of Gods Bounties to us, which do beſpeak and challenge it.</hi> His Mercies call us to Mirth, we deny them if we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a heavy heart and ſad face; we in effect ſay, that we receive nothing from God to make

us chearful and thankful: we don't render to him according to his benefits, but act as if only afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were meaſured out to us, and we were <hi>Chaſtened every morning.</hi> This were an ungrateful Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or Undervaluing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God, who in giving <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Seaſons,</hi> deſigns <hi>to fill mens hearts with food and gladneſs.</hi> A glad Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhou'd be the leaſt fruit of that Divine Bounty which feeds our Bodies. Therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> had given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Law of Offering the <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> of their Land to God, he adds,—<hi>Thus thou ſhalt worſhip before the Lord thy God, and thou ſhalt rejoyce in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine Houſe.</hi> The nature of a Benefit leads us into the reaſon of Such a Precept: For ſhall we receive Good at the hand of God, and not be pleas'd in it? Are Health, Peace, Plenty, Children, Friends, and the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001293_0037_0FB22C3401B83750"/>
of Worldly Enjoyments of little or no price with us? Are they not his rich Beneficence, his Fatherly Proviſion, his Royal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence? How do we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this if we do not rejoyce in it? Do we need none of theſe things, or do we merit 'em and more at Gods hand? but if freely given without our deſert, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valuable Mercies in themſelves, ſelf-love as well as gratitude binds us to rejoice in 'em. In ſhort,</p>
            <p>There is the ſame reaſon why we ſhould rejoyce under the ſmiles of Providence, as there is for mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under its frowns. If when God bereaves us of Mercies he calls us to grief, then when he multiplies 'em, he calls us to Joy. Both have a voice, and ought to be heark'ned to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, <hi>The apparent Ends of Mirth are very good, therefore in it ſelf, &amp; if vertuouſly regulated, it can't be evil.</hi> Mirth is obviouſly good
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001293_0038_0FB22C3622C4D548"/>
to many excellent purpoſes; of great uſe, ſervice and benefit to us in many reſpects. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>To refreſh and recruit tir'd nature in its work.</hi> We are in a ſtate of frailty: a little labour wearies the Body and Mind too; the labour of the Mind is a <hi>weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Fleſh,</hi> and the toils of the Body ſoon tire the Mind. We daily need ſome reſpite &amp; diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which we dull our Powers; a little intermiſſion ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens 'em again. It ſpoils the <hi>Bow</hi> to keep it always bent, and the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol</hi> if always ſtrain'd up. Mirth is ſome looſe or relaxation to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mind or Body, it lifts up the hands that hand down in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, and ſtrengthens the feeble knees that cou'd ſtand no longer to work: it renews our ſtrength, and we reſume our labours again with vigour. 'Tis deſign'd by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to chear and revive us thro' all the toils and troubles of life;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001293_0039_0FB22C37A5E1C8D0"/>
and therefore equally a benefit with the other <hi>Reſts</hi> which Nature has provided for the ſame end. 'Tis in our preſent Pilgrimage and Travel of Life refreſhing as the <hi>Angels proviſion for Elijah</hi> in his ſore travel. Prov. 15.15. <hi>All the dayes of the afflicted are evil, but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Moderate Mirth is of great uſe to preſerve Health.</hi> It is both food and medicine; it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes a healthful Body, ſuſtains and reſtores the languiſhing. Prov. 17.22. <hi>A merry heart doth good like a Medicine, but a broken ſpirit drieth the bones.</hi> It minds me how the Prophet joyns theſe two things, <hi>Your heart ſhall rejoice, and your bones ſhall flouriſh as on herb:</hi> There is a natural Influence and Cauſality in the <hi>one</hi> unto the <hi>other.</hi> Cordials ſerve to cheer and keep up the ſpirits from ſinking; but Nature is the beſt Phyſician, it knows what will work moſt kindly and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001293_0040_0FB22C3921E08BE0"/>
for its own ſuſtentation; and things unnatural and violent ſhou'd be the laſt Remedies. Now we all owe this Duty to our ſelves, to look after our own life and health; and therefore ſo far as Mirth may be a neceſſary &amp; kind <hi>Means</hi> of that, ſo far we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to it by the <hi>Sixth Commandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Another good Uſe of Mirth is to cheriſh laudable Friendſhip, and to increaſe Love among Chriſtians.</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the <hi>greateſt</hi> Grace, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> gives it the preheminence; &amp; this muſt needs derive a Goodneſs on whatſoever ſhall be ſubſervient and inſtrumental to the advancing ſuch a Bleſſing in the World. Now it has been found a Means of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment and Love, for Relations, Acquaintance, Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt to be free &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant at each others Houſes. This was the Uſe of <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.27.43 34. <hi>Job</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.32. <hi>Acts</hi> 2 46.</note> 
               <hi>Feaſts</hi> from the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001293_0041_0FB22C3EB857F340"/>
firſt Ages of the World; and ſo the happy Family of <hi>Job</hi> cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that mutual delight in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for which they were ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary: and ſo the <hi>Firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did eat their Meat with Gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religious Friendſhip, and the pleaſure of Saints in one another, is the very Image and Joy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: There Holy Spirits unite, &amp; their pleaſure is, as their mutual Love, for ever; both in their <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> One end of Life and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to increaſe in Love, &amp; Mirth is both the fruit of Love as well as a means of it: For while we love, we ſhall rejoyce together; and feel the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> words, <hi>How good, and how pleaſant is it, for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to dwell together in Unity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, Another End and Uſe of Virtuous Mirth is <hi>That we may attend holy duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in Private or Publick, with the more chearfulneſs, and to promote Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001293_0042_0FB22C4086D73880"/>
Joy.</hi> So in the <hi>Text,</hi> Mirth helps to the Singing Pſalms, and making melody in our hearts to God. A chearful ſpirit ſanctify'd, finds its beſt pleaſure in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Davids</hi>

               <hi>Sanguine Temper</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Regulation of Grace, lead him to his <hi>Pſalmody.</hi> It not only fits a man to work the better in his Shop, to be a more pleaſant Neighbour, and a greater comfort to his Family; but it makes him more ſerviceable to Gods Glory, and acceptable in his ſight. <hi>God Loves a chearful</hi> Servant, (as we our ſelves alſo do) to ſee men love their Duty, and make Meditation, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Praiſe their delight, being never ſo much pleas'd, as when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſuch Exerciſes. He likes not to ſee us go pining or dull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Work, as if it were our Penance, and a hard Service. It gives a <hi>Luſtre</hi> to Religion to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001293_0043_0FB22C420B392758"/>
Gods Houſe with <hi>the Voice of Joy and Praiſe:</hi> When it is <hi>Pleaſant to our Souls,</hi> then is God indeed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by us. Now regular Mirth promotes this; the Habit of Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs does not accompany us juſt to the doors of the Church, or of our Cloſets, and there take leave of us; No, it goes with us to our Knees; quickens, enli'vens &amp; makes fervent: the Soul reflecting on its own delightful frame, ſayes to it ſelf, <hi>Thus will I bleſs him while I Live, I will lift up my hands in his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a ſad heart goes heavily about buſineſs, ſo a lightſome mind is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous: and as <hi>Worldly Sorrow works</hi> Spiritual <hi>Death,</hi> and carnal Mirth does the ſame, ſo temperate Mirth promotes our living Spiritually. Let the Spirit be clouded thro' bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Indiſpoſitions, &amp; the Spiritual Life often ſeems to languiſh: Good People in that caſe have ſometimes ſadly but groundleſsly complain'd of the decays of Grace; they are
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001293_0044_0FB22C4384C12DA8"/>
Lifeleſs and can't go to their knees with half that pleaſure and deſire they lately did. But it has been the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> work, more than the <hi>Divines,</hi> to adminiſter toward the Perſons reſtoration unto his <hi>Senſible</hi> Communion with God; which has not been really Interrupted as it has ſeem'd to be; for let his bodily Diſtemper be removed, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, and in other things too, returns: Which is a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that Chearfulneſs does greatly ſubſerve unto a holy &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Joy. In ſhort, Melancholly People commonly make drooping Chriſtians, to the diſadvantage of Religion.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Excellent Ends of Sober Mirth;</hi> it recruits nature, preſerves health, and cheriſhes both Charity and Devotion: wherein as it conſults Gods Glory, and our Neighbours Intereſt, ſo alſo our own preſent benefit &amp; future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And <hi>that</hi> which is of ſo
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001293_0045_0FB22C47C2BD08D8"/>
excellent <hi>Uſe</hi> to us in our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life muſt needs be decent and a duty: As theſe <hi>Ends</hi> are Great and Noble in themſelves, ſo muſt that be which is a <hi>Mean</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE.</hi> Having thus argued the lawfulneſs and uſe of ſober Mirth, I will only ſay this upon it, <hi>That it reproves the defect and want of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many good Chriſtians.</hi> The uſe of it both unto <hi>Life and Godlineſs</hi> being manifeſt, one wou'd have tho't that ſuch a Duty would be readily embrac'd; yet it is rather fled from by ſome few, either thro' the power of Melancholly, or a wrong notion taken up of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The laſt is injurious to God, diſhonourable to Grace, a ſcandal to Religion, and miſchievous to Mankind. 'Tis a groſs Opinion to think the Gravity, Sobriety, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Mortification to the World, which agrees to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Character, cannot conſiſt with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001293_0046_0FB22C48D9FA40D8"/>
Occaſional Mirth, or with Habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Chearfulneſs: Neither the Saints of old time, nor the Apoſtles after them, nor the Lord, the Saviour of the Church, has taught us any ſuch ſour Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Men wrong Religion by this ill account of it, and muſt anſwer for diſparaging the <hi>Service</hi> of Chriſt, &amp; giving an ill report of the Land of Promiſe, as if there were Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and <hi>Giants</hi> in the way terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to force thro'. It is the Spirit of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> that does God and Religion honour; they were for engaging chearfully, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated others to do ſo too; but the dulneſs and cowardice of the other <hi>Spies</hi> had a wretched influence to diſpirit the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> who <hi>lift up their Voice and wept that night,</hi> and were for turning their backs on <hi>Canaan.</hi> Juſt as a melancholly Chriſtian wou'd tempt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſuſpect Chriſtianity to be a grievous and moroſe kind of Life.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001293_0047_0FB22C4A5BC9B948"/>
A moſt certain way to obſtruct the growth of Chriſts Kingdom; for you know the vain World are ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at any thing that looks this way; therefore turn the bright ſide to 'em, and let 'em ſee that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more pleaſure in Serving God, than they can in ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures. It's true, we muſt not counterfeit or lye for God, but profane men muſt be told, that they muſt part with their Luſts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them, and that Repentance is a very bitter Grief, and that the <hi>Mortification</hi> of thoſe fleſhly pleaſures they have ſurfeited on in their paſt ungodly Life is a neceſſary Labour, wherein they may expect the <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful throws of a violent Death;</hi> and if men will go away Sorrowful from Chriſt upon ſuch faithfulneſs, there is no Remedy: Only let the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned Perſon know too, that this does not infer Chriſtianity to be a Life only of Penance &amp; Sorrow; No, ſenſual men need only exchange
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001293_0048_0FB22C4DAD6CEFD0"/>
their Pleaſures for far better, more ſubſtantial and enduring than thoſe they part with; ſuch as become <hi>Men,</hi> and Heirs of Heaven, in the hopes of which there is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Raviſhment.</p>
            <p>Such a joyous Life of eminently good men has been the <hi>Means of the Converſion</hi> of profane Sinners. Famous is the Story of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſo Converted in an <hi>Inn;</hi> he never before knew that Mirth was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Profaneſs &amp; Intemperance; the Mirth appear'd <hi>Wiſe</hi> to him, &amp; the Religion that allow'd and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd it charming. The ſad heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian ſeems to be <hi>without hope in the World,</hi> and ſo his Religion without <hi>Motive</hi> or Allurement in it, which were an Effectual Care that it ſhould make no Converts. Let me only ask the penſive drooping Chriſtian,</p>
            <p>Is your Maſter <hi>hard,</hi> your Work unreaſonable? I'm ſure you deteſt the Blaſphemy, you tremble at it,

and will reply, <q>

               <hi>Is Heaven before you Inconſiderable?</hi> (for I ſpeak to ſuch as are bound thither) that <hi>One Hope of your Calling, in Hope of</hi> ETERNAL LIFE, <hi>which God who cannot Lye has promiſed!</hi> Is your Hope poor? the Promiſes not precious? &amp; Grace (the Unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gift) not felt? How do you diſparage the Riches of Mercy, by a heavy lumpiſh Life! how ill a Return to the Lord, who hath <hi>done great things for you, whereof</hi> you ought to <hi>be glad,</hi> which ſhould <hi>fill your Mouth with Laughter, and your Tongue with Singing.</hi>

            <p>I have ſpoken of that <hi>Civil and Natural Mirth,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in a Chriſtian, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally a duty.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That there is a Carnal &amp; Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Merriment, to be condemned, abhor'd and avoided.</hi> All <hi>ſuch Rejoycing is
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001293_0053_0FB22C599FF81118"/>
Evil,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow is better than</hi> ſuch <hi>Laughter;</hi> wherefore this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in another place calls upon ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fools to <hi>be afflicted and mourn and weep, to turn their Laughter to Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their Joy to Heavineſs.</hi> There is a <hi>Laughter,</hi> of which the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> cou'd not but ſay — <hi>It is Madneſs,</hi> Tranſporting the Mind beyond the bounds of Sobriety &amp; Reaſon; and there was a <hi>Mirth</hi> too in his dayes of which he ſaid, <hi>What does it?</hi> It does no Imaginable good, but much hurt. This Unprofitable and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Mirth I ſhall endeavour to lay before you and deſcribe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of it.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>Meaſure.</hi> 2. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of it. 3. The <hi>Timing</hi> it. 4. The <hi>Object, Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it. 5. Its ill <hi>Effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Meaſure of our Mirth may be Prodigal and Intemperate.</hi> There is a <hi>Mean</hi> to be kept in all things. No Exceſs is Innocent. Mirth may be
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001293_0054_0FB22C5DA5502B78"/>
Immoderate in the degree of it: Exceſſive <hi>loud</hi> it ſometimes is, and ſometimes exceſſive <hi>long.</hi> The <hi>firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is too often to be heard in <hi>Taverns,</hi> when Drink has intoxicated men and baniſh'd Reaſon and Sobriety. <hi>They chant to the ſound of the Viol,</hi> but their own Voice moſt criminal. <hi>Inferiour Mariners</hi> eſpecially do give themſelves this Offenſive licence: the Noiſe argues a <hi>Tube;</hi> hollow Creatures that have nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'em; no Grace, Wiſdom, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or Tho't: A <hi>Gag</hi> is their proper and due puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Length</hi> alſo is a frequent <hi>Exceſs,</hi> and commonly is with the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> increaſing the Guilt and Miſchief. Some ſpend the whole day in a <hi>Rant,</hi> and continue the <hi>Dinn</hi> from Morning to Evening. Thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time is waſted in Madneſs and Riot: that <hi>Time</hi> which ſhou'd rather be redeem'd in Retirement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deep Reflections in Silence on their horrid Sins. Men conſume
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001293_0055_0FB22C6023ACC060"/>
their days in vanity, and keep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtunn'd till they paſs into their Graves; Death cures their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and at laſt they are in a <hi>State of Silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Short,</hi> That Mirth is immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which exceeds the Intention of Nature. 'Tis deſign'd to refreſh our Spirits in our work, and not to tire 'em and unfit for it. It is eaſy to over-doe &amp; get a habit of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: &amp; then the Headſtrong beaſt, us'd to liberty, won't endure the rein again; takes the <hi>Bitt</hi> in its <hi>teeth,</hi> and none knows the Compaſs of its <hi>Career.</hi> So hard is it to ſtop &amp; reclaim a <hi>Libertine</hi> &amp; <hi>Extravagant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>There is often a variety of Sin in the Licentious Manner of expreſſing our Mirth.</hi> 'Tis ſometimes <hi>Proud,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Profane,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Wanton &amp; Fleſhly. Pride</hi> puts on a very <hi>Pleas'd face</hi> when it ſcorns, derides and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults: Diſdain is <hi>fleer'd</hi> from the Eye, and Contempt is in the <hi>Smile;</hi> tho'
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001293_0056_0FB22C61CC3D1A38"/>
indeed Envy and Spite are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the paint; the Look is pleas'd eno' and Gay, but 'tis only Diſguize, a forc'd laugh while a man's gall'd and mad at the heart. <hi>Profane</hi> men Swear alike and Curſe, imprecate and blaſpheme, whether they are angry or pleas'd, in earneſt or in jeſt. A kind of Merriment as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent as it is Impious: that a Wretch can't be over-joy'd to ſee a Friend but he muſt curſe him, and every cup of drink he gets he damns himſelf he's ſo pleas'd, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes God the Giver of it. The <hi>Wanton</hi> mans Mirth is Ridiculous. He layes aſide the <hi>Man,</hi> and the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Reaſon, and acts the part of a frolick Colt: He roars and frisks and leaps; and lies and <hi>throws fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands in Jeſt. Finally,</hi> the <hi>Fleſhly</hi> mans Mirth lies in obſcene jeſts and drunken revels. There is a <hi>fooliſh Jeſting,</hi> which the Apoſtle names with <hi>Filthineſs,</hi> and oppoſes it to <hi>the giving of thanks;</hi> he ſayes of it that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001293_0057_0FB22C63D09A88B8"/>
'tis <hi>not convenient,</hi> which might ſeem a mild Cenſure, but that he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adds a vehement Inhibition of it, <hi>That it be not once named among us as becometh Saints,</hi> Eph. 5.3, 4. <hi>Frothy Wit</hi> is unſavoury and ſhou'd be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipped. The talk is not <hi>Seaſon'd with Salt, to miniſter Grace to the hearers,</hi> and is flat and taſtleſs to a <hi>chaſt</hi> and healthful Soul. But above all kinds of vain Mirth deliver me from the <hi>Drunken Club,</hi> who belch out noiſy <hi>Ribaldry</hi> rank of the foul lees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Nabals</hi> Mirth, and <hi>Folly</hi> is in it: 1 Sam. 25.36. <hi>His heart was very Merry within him, for he was very drunken.</hi> Wine is <hi>Miſchievous</hi> when it inflames Rage, but nothing is ſo <hi>Nauſeous</hi> as a Merry Drunkard: A ſickly ſight that no <hi>Satyr</hi> can ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eno' expoſe: So ridiculous and fulſome that it wou'd provoke one to renounce Mirth for ever. <hi>"Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Pii, garriunt Ebrii,</hi> the good man rejoyces, the drunkard drivels. The fleſh does thus pollute our Mirth,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001293_0058_0FB22C6544EDAC48"/>
and the <hi>Manner</hi> of expreſſing it is foul and licentious.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Mirth ill Tim'd may for that Reaſon be Sinful and Vicious. To every thing there is a Seaſon, — a time to weep, and a time to laugh.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is decent and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to day, may poſſibly become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and unlawful to morrow. Times of <hi>Affliction</hi> are proper for Humiliation and Mourning; Mirth were indecent under Mournful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. Ezek. 21.10. <hi>Shou'd we then make Mirth?</hi> ſcil. When <hi>the Sword is ſharp'ned and furbiſhed for ſlaughter:</hi> i. e. a time of <hi>Publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on a Land is no time for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments among them. Sorrows are <hi>forc'd</hi> on 'em: Iſai. 24.7, 8. <hi>All the Merry-hearted do ſigh, the Mirth of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brets ceaſeth, the noiſe of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce endeth, the joy of the Harp ceaſeth, they ſhall not drink Wine with a Song,</hi> &amp;c. God <hi>cauſes to ceaſe from</hi> a Place <hi>the Voice of Mirth &amp; the Voice of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001293_0059_0FB22C68D727D370"/>
Jer. 7.34. <hi>Joy is taken away from the plentiful field, &amp; the wine-preſs is no more to be trod with ſhouting.</hi> Some are too ſtout and ſtubborn to bend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divine Judgments; their Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a high Contempt and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Holy God; New woes hang over ſuch, Amos 6.1, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Wo to them that are at eaſe in Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, — that chaunt to the ſound of the Viol, — that drink wine in Bowls, — and are not grieved for the Affliction of Joſeph.</hi> Utter deſtruction is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch, Iſa. 22.12, 13, 14. <hi>In that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldneſs, and to girding with ſackcloth; And behold joy and gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen &amp; hilling ſheep, eating fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine: — And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hoſts, ſurely this Iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, till ye die, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Mirth does no ways agree to a <hi>Faſt-day.</hi> Iſai 58.3. <hi>In the day of your Faſt ye find pleaſure.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:001293_0060_0FB22C6AC8123150"/>
Nor common Mirth to the holy <hi>Sabbath,</hi> v. 13, 14. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, &amp; call the Sabbath a delight, the Holy of the Lord &amp; Honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not — finding thine own pleaſure,</hi> &amp;c. Sports and Paſtimes are deteſtable on the <hi>Lord-Day,</hi> whoever tolerate and authorize 'em: Work and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is rather ſufferable; for to make it a <hi>Play-day</hi> is worſe than not to make it <hi>a Reſt.</hi> More abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet is it to ſee People on the <hi>Merry-pin</hi> in the very Exerciſes of Worſhip; which is to affront the Great God to his very <hi>Face,</hi> and in his <hi>Houſe,</hi> which he has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us <hi>to Reverence,</hi> as well as to Sanctify his Day. Yet we too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee People bring vain and light minds thither. Some can Play and Laugh, as well as others Sleep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Word,</hi> which we ſhou'd <hi>Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at,</hi> becauſe we muſt be judged by it. How rude is it as well as
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001293_0061_0FB22C6C19E45F48"/>
Profane, not to put on Gravity and Reſpect in Gods awful Preſence, which we do when we come before any Superior on Earth! the God, <hi>the Lord our Maker,</hi> whom we ſhou'd <hi>bow down and kneel before,</hi> whom we ſhou'd <hi>Serve with fear,</hi> and <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in <hi>with Trembling!</hi> Only Spiritual joy becomes the Sacred Place &amp; Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>The Houſe of Mourning</hi> is no place to be Merry at. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity requires us <hi>to weep with thoſe that weep.</hi> A Corpſe and a Grave ſhou'd miniſter ſerious and devout tho'ts to us, and ſober behaviour becomes a <hi>Funeral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>A Graceleſs State is no condition for much mirth.</hi> A hard ſaying, and who can bear it? May not an Unregenerate man be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to laugh? Is it a Sin to be merry before we are Converted? I mean no ſuch thing, 'tis a tender point &amp; muſt be warily guarded.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie to obſerve, <hi>that there is too much and Inordinate mirth among
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001293_0062_0FB22C7009FC2ED0"/>
Unregenerate men.</hi> All exceſs of wantonneſs is to be ſeen among them, as if they had taken offence at Sobriety, and abjur'd all Rules of Reſtraint: ſo that confeſſedly the fault lies on this ſide, &amp; here's the danger; Levity being one fruit of Natural Corruption.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Occaſional Mirth in moderation is Innocent in all men:</hi> Elſe Nature it ſelf muſt be quarrell'd with, which has fram'd and invincibly diſpos'd us for it; and has made it one diſtinction of mankind from Inferior Creatures.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>There is a Quiet and chearfulneſs which is neceſſary to the preſervation of Nature:</hi> and without which we never ſhall in any good meaſure <hi>diſcharge the Duties of our Reſpective Places.</hi> Now to be ſure we may not deſtroy Nature, nor neglect Duty on any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as this,—<hi>I have no right to be merry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet the <hi>Graceleſs Perſon,</hi> upon
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001293_0063_0FB22C7235C653B0"/>
a ſober conſideration of his State, muſt needs confeſs that he has <hi>no reaſon for any more mirth than is neceſſary to theſe Ends.</hi> For let him but conſider what his State is and what his danger: that he is in the broad way to Hell, and under the heavy Curſe of God; and is this a condition for him to be merry in? <q>Shou'd we countenance it in a Criminal under Condemnation? Or like to ſee a <hi>Miſerable</hi> behave himſelf ſportively as he is <hi>drawn</hi> to the <hi>Gallows?</hi>
               </q> In like manner, rather ſhou'd Anguiſh and Horror ſeize the Sinner. <hi>Delight is not ſeemly for a fool.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> may well be diſquieted for this, <hi>A Fool when he is filled with meat;</hi> &amp; bounds upon it like a fed horſe. 'Tis eno' to draw tears from a ſober Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſee the outrageous Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of ſome wild &amp; careleſs, frolick people in a doleful, unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd State. But ſo much of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable</hi> Mirth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:001293_0064_0FB22C738537FBB8"/>IV. <hi>Mirth ill Plac'd becomes Sin:</hi> 'tis evil with reſpect to the <hi>Object, Cauſe, or Reaſon of it;</hi> and is either altogether idle and impertinent, or malicious and miſchievous, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Idle and Impertinent Mirth is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> which is ſquander'd away we know not on what, nor wherefore. No reaſon can be given of it, no cauſe aſſigned: 'Tis an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Blithneſs and Jollity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many, they know not why, but becauſe they are in a frolick. 'Tis a Noiſe without ſenſe &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without deſign, and void of Harmony: Eccleſ. 7.6. <hi>As the crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of thorns under a pot, ſo is the laughter of the Fool.</hi> 'Tis below the Reaſon of a man, who is (or ſhou'd be) an <hi>Agent by Counſel,</hi> and ſhou'd be able to aſſign ſome ſufficient cauſe for all his actions; know why he laughs, and why he weeps, and not like a <hi>Horſe that has no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:001293_0065_0FB22C7695DA7F68"/>
frisk and leap &amp; bound in a lawleſs tho'tleſs Range. A wiſe man pities and bluſhes for ſuch Freaks of others: And Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us to think it a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous ſight, when we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a poor <hi>Natural</hi> ſit laughing at his Straws. There is a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> that ſhows it ſelf in ſtrange and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Fitts of laughing &amp; weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but altogether as unhappy &amp; compaſſionate as ſome other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies: So is Idle Mirth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of many a vain heart; a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom of a ſickly Soul, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amuſement of the fancy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, &amp; toſſes about at pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Malicious &amp; Miſchievous Mirth is very wicked. It is a ſport to a fool to do miſchief,</hi> he <hi>plays</hi> with pointed <hi>Arrows and Death.</hi> His Mirth is injurious and cruel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is glad at Calamity,</hi> it may be; is merry in the ſufferings of others, and ſayes—<hi>Aye, ſo we would have it.</hi> This is equally againſt Nature and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001293_0066_0FB22C78E0D44C00"/>
againſt Chriſtianity, for both do teach us <hi>to weep with them that weep. Job</hi> deteſted the Barbarity, (Job. 31.29, 30. <hi>If I rejoyced at the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him that hated me, or lift up my ſelf when evil found him:—)</hi> &amp; good men have ſufficiently felt it; therefore does the <hi>Church</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſo bitterly of the wicked plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of her Enemies; <hi>they have heard of my trouble, and are glad that thou haſt done it; they paſs by and clap their hands;</hi> and in like manner does the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> grievouſly reſent it, <hi>In mine adverſity they rejoyced, yea the Abjects gathered themſelves together,— Lord let them not rejoice wrongfully, nor wink with the eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Too often people make ſport at the <hi>defects</hi> of others, whether Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or Intellectual: this alſo is cruel and uncharitable Mirth. 'Tis abuſive &amp; inhumane to make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at anothers Infirmity, &amp; much more his Miſery. A very odd fault, that an Infelicity, and not procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001293_0067_0FB22C7A55BFB7F0"/>
neither by enormous luſts, as ſometimes men are the guilty Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their own griefs, ſhou'd be made ſuch a matter of laughter! That if a poor <hi>Innocent,</hi> (as ſome Nations very humanely call 'em) a <hi>Miſerable whom God has deprived of underſtanding,</hi> do but paſs along the Streets, a troop of rude Boyes are after him, abuſing him, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves cruel ſport; when as they ought rather to weep in pity, and think with themſelves,— <hi>Did not he that made me in the womb make him?</hi>—</p>
            <p>I might note alſo that there is the malicious Joy of the <hi>Defamer</hi> and Backbiter; the huge ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Detractor</hi> if he can blaſt a name which he ſpites. <hi>Envy</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conceives a baſe Joy, &amp; is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratify'd in anothers loſs; as the Devils high ſatisfaction was, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine a happy world, and to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Race of Beings miſerable as himſelf. Finally; <hi>Perſecutors</hi> pleaſe
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001293_0068_0FB22C7BC4D97098"/>
themſelves in Blood. The Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rama,</hi> and the ſhrieks of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> are muſick to ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage hearts. The Guilt of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> all whoſe Gayety and Pomp &amp; Pleaſures have been bought with blood, or ſwam to thro' it.</p>
            <p>I will ſumm up this <hi>Head,</hi> of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Mirth, in the ſad Inſtance of <hi>Sampſon.</hi> His Indiſcretion &amp; Sin had deliver'd him into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> &amp; they had bound him and put out his Eyes; upon which they had a great <hi>Holyday</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>to offer a great Sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice;</hi> and when their <hi>hearts were merry,</hi> they call'd for their poor Captive <hi>to make 'em ſport.</hi> 'Twas like the reſt of their bruitiſh Religion, and juſt as croſs to true Goodneſs, as their ſtock <hi>Dagon</hi> was to the true and living God, the Immenſe Spirit. In this he was a <hi>Type</hi> of our Bleſſed Saviour, who going to his Croſs and upon it, was derided &amp;

reviled by the rude <hi>Mob.</hi> The laſt Inſtance <hi>this</hi> of cruel and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mirth, when it inſulted the Meek and Innocent <hi>Lamb of God:</hi> O fatal and impious pleaſantry of the bruitiſh ſtupid <hi>Guards,</hi> when they <hi>dreſt</hi> the King of Heaven and Earth in <hi>ſcorn of his Kingſhip,</hi> and bow'd the knee to him in <hi>Mockery!</hi> No doubt, they were wondrous merry at their inſolent and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Game, &amp; the <hi>Hall</hi> ſhook with their <hi>Hoots and roaring.</hi> This is the Mirth that is malicious and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, unmerciful and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is an ill-plac'd Mirth which is yet more ſtrictly to be called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Mirth is profane when we make our ſelves merry with Sin.</hi> Sin calls for Horror and not Laughter, for tears and not ſport: yet 'tis a common thing for <hi>Fools to make a

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is very profane to make our own Sins the reaſon or matter of our Mirth;</hi> inſtead of afflicting our Souls for them. Yet this men are often guilty of <hi>three</hi> ways more eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Profane men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Projecting</hi> Iniquity. They raiſe to themſelves a Scheme of what they will do, and the Pleaſure they ſhall find in it, and ſo their fancies are tickled before-hand with what their Imagination paints, and their Wiſhes have realiz'd. Thus Murderous <hi>Eſau.</hi> comforts himſelf with the ſweet Revenge he purpos'd, Gen. 27.41. <hi>Behold the days of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my Father are at hand, then will I ſlay my Brother Jacob.</hi> His heart conceiv'd a wicked Joy in Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this almoſt worſt of Crimes.

Prov. 1.11, 13. — <hi>They ſay, Come, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the Innocent without Cauſe, let us ſwallow them up alive as the Grave;— We ſhall find all precious Subſtance, we ſhall fill our Houſes with ſpoil.</hi> A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Morſel this, on the hopes of which the hungry dog will ſmile and live a great while. The <hi>Rich Fool</hi> in the Goſpel ſtrangely pleas'd himſelf in premeditating a long Life of Senſuality and Luxury: the gay proſpect tranſported his ſunk Soul: St. Luk. 12.19. <hi>I will ſay to my Soul, Soul, thou haſt much Goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink &amp; be merry.</hi> And ſo I might ſhow of the <hi>Lewd Heart</hi> too, what Scenes of pleaſure it paints to it ſelf, what charming Images it forms and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes at, and enjoyes! the Joy of this Sinner is all in Projection, he fancies things that are not, and promiſes himſelf what none can give. So the <hi>Impudent Solicitreſs</hi> whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, gave her

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Profane men find a Superior Joy in the <hi>Compaſſing &amp; Committing</hi> Sin. Juſt then their hearts are full of Satisfaction, and they greedily ſeize their Prey: they Sin in the <hi>Heat</hi> of blood, while their deſires violently carry them to the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Object; the Sinner is heated &amp; <hi>Athirſt,</hi> drinks eagerly and is pleas'd with his draught; the <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet,</hi> his luſt inflaming him as a Feaver within, &amp; tho' the Drought be Unnatural &amp; Mortal, yet its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to quench it.

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001293_0073_0FB22C8704A75C48"/>
Deſires. So the <hi>Intemperate</hi> man looks on the <hi>Wine in the Glaſs,</hi> and Praiſes its <hi>Colour</hi> and its <hi>Spirits,</hi> and when he has ſufficiently raiſed his <hi>Own,</hi> he lifts up the baneful draught to his Mouth. So do the <hi>Unjuſt</hi> ſnatch and graſp at wicked Gains, and you may ſee their delight in their Eagerneſs after 'em, even tho' Conſcience &amp; Fear check the bold <hi>Robber,</hi> &amp; he tremble in the attempt, as it is common to ſee them. So the Luſtful <hi>Amnon</hi> ruſh'd with mad deſire on his <hi>Rape &amp; Inceſt,</hi> had what he ſo long pin'd after, pleas'd for the moment the curs'd act was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrating, but ſtung with bitter Loathing and Remorſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Profane men remember and call to mind their Sins with a wicked pleaſure.</hi> It is ſweet to 'em in the Review, they act over again in Imagination paſt Exceſſes which they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain come at; as ſome Creatures fetch up the food they eat &amp; <hi>Chew,

the Cud;</hi> only they are <hi>Clean Beaſts,</hi> and ſo too good for a compariſon here. How Merry are Impenitent men very often in reciting the vain, the leud, the malicious Paſſages of their Lives? the Injuries they have done to ſome, the Contempts to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! glorying in their ſhame and diſhonour, to ſet the <hi>Club</hi> a laughing. What a Prize has this been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tho't, and what a Conteſt and Vying has there been to carry it? to that degree that many in the World will bely and defame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pretend to Impieties which they never had Opportunity for, for the pleaſure and delight of being tho't Vile. Others who have out-liv'd their Sin, but not the Will to it, can only ſurfeit on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it; and nothing is more ſickly as well as hydeous than the fulſome ſprightly talk of ſome <hi>Aged</hi> People, about the Sins of their Youth. They ha'nt loſt the Reliſh of their long acted follies, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potently

ſhew their Will &amp; Joy, tho' to be compaſs'd no more. This is <hi>Profane Mirth</hi> indeed! &amp; we may well be ſtruck with Horror at it, that mens <hi>Sins</hi> ſhou'd miniſter it, when <hi>they</hi> call for their moſt bitter Sorrows, or will lead to endleſs Wailings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is alſo a Profane thing to make the Sins of Others our Sport.</hi> Which men too often do under a <hi>double Character,</hi> either as <hi>Friends,</hi> or as <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Profane Approving of Anothers Sin, which is the Guilt of wicked Friends and Companions.</hi> This is Evil, and juſt croſs to the Holy Temper of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I beheld Tranſgreſſors and was grieved.</hi> Yet there are ſuch <hi>Merry Clubs,</hi> where the Envy'd &amp; Crown'd <hi>Hero</hi> is he that can tell of moſt ſingular Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and number up moſt daring Crimes: and well may he be the moſt admired (but deteſted) Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter among them.

the Devil meets his <hi>devoted Tribe of Malice,</hi> to hear who has moſt Serv'd him, and is likeſt to him, and there beſtows the Infamy of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a Profane <hi>Inſulting Anothers Sin, the Malicious Joy of an Enemy.</hi> A man loſt to that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Charity, which rejoyces not in Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.6. So contrary alſo to that Expreſs Precept, Prov. 24.17. <hi>Rejoyce not when thine Enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he ſtumbleth.</hi> Yet ſuch there are who have no greater pleaſure than to twitt, and caſt anothers Sin in his teeth; or if they ever hear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, then to Object it with a wretched ſpite. How contrary this

There are thoſe alſo that hate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and all that Profeſs it, and have no greater Joy than to hear of a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> falling into any Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; it is Sugar to their Cups to make a Sober man Drunk, &amp; they lay it up as a Memorable Feat, and for a ſufficient Triumph all their Life long; nay and it may be as a doughty, Eternal, Unanſwerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt God and His Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for Evermore.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>firſt kind</hi> of Profane Mirth, to make merry at <hi>Sin;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>our own,</hi> or <hi>other mens Sins.</hi>

               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:001293_0078_0FB22C9478F807B8"/>Secondly, <hi>It is equally Profane to make Religion and Goodneſs the Object of our Mirth:</hi> to Play and droll on things Divine and Sacred. And this is either <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſuch daring Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as can make themſelves merry <hi>in Blaſphemies.</hi> It is dangerous to have one light tho't of God, or of his Word: Unbelieving <hi>Sarah laugh't</hi> at the Incredible Promiſe of her Pregnancy, but was ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buk'd for it. Yet in our dayes ſome horrid Creatures dare to do much more than this comes to; they dare to Ridicule the Doctrines of Reveal'd Religion, &amp; the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt our Saviour in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, if not the very Being and Providence of God.

Banter; for ſo indeed our <hi>Modern Deiſts</hi> have been prodigal of <hi>Witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms</hi> at the Expence of Scripture; and no Merrier fools than theſe conceited Deſpiſers of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſtianity.

But this ſport won't laſt long; the Judgment Day will effectually ſtop it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Profane Contempt of Sacred Things, which helps the Scorner

to a great deal of vile Mirth.</hi> I know that thoſe whom I now accuſe will plead <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and try to excuſe themſelves from Contempt: they forſooth own a God and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and his Word, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them all; only indeed they have flights of Wit which ſome people are too grave and dull to be pleas'd with: but this pretence of Reſpect won't paſs, when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is plainly expreſſed.

and they burſt out and clap hands.

<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001293_0084_0FB22C9F05EA9660"/>
that is <hi>Ludicrous.</hi> Chriſt is ſtruck at thro' his Servants ſide, and made the <hi>Drunkards Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Some horribly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Fools can make Merry <hi>at the Judgments of God.</hi> As of late the <hi>Wretches,</hi> that cou'd <hi>act</hi> the <hi>Tempeſt</hi> as ſoon as the <hi>fearful Storm</hi> was over that had aſtoniſht <hi>Europe,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd amazing Ruines there, at the Recital whereof the Audience <hi>Clapt hands:</hi> things which the Hair of their head ſtood an End at in the Morning, and yet droll'd on in the Evening! A <hi>Deſolation</hi> which Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will remember with awe, and ſpeak of with Seriouſneſs. It is a daring pitch of Sin, but common in the World, that no Voice nor <hi>Blow</hi> of God can lay mens ribald tongues, nor fright 'em into Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let the <hi>Sea</hi> roar, &amp; the fierce Winds caſt the Waves up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet there are profane <hi>Mariners</hi> that will Drink and Sing on.

the hardy <hi>Souldier</hi> in a Mount of dead Companions, yet he'll jeſt it may be at their fall and maims, and their wild looks in Death. Let God ſpeak in yet louder <hi>Thunders,</hi> &amp; fill the Heavens with <hi>Flames,</hi> there are bold Sinners who will not <hi>buſh</hi> their Laughter, nor leave their Cups and their <hi>Games.</hi> There's not an <hi>Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing</hi> happens in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but 'tis twenty to one ſome Circumſtance ſhall be found to <hi>crack a Jeſt</hi> on.

            <p>I have thus briefly laid before you ſome <hi>Inſtances of Profane Mirth,</hi> plac'd amiſs, on <hi>Objects</hi> that will not bear it. Let it be never nam'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, nor ſaid that God and things Sacred are our Game. For if it be Vile to commit Sin, it is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſo to laugh at it when we have done; and if it be Vile to omit to do good, it is doubly ſo to revile and ſcoff at Goodneſs. But this is
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001293_0086_0FB22CA5AC5409A8"/>
the <hi>Fourth Head, Mirth ill plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. And Laſtly, <hi>Mirth may be known to be Evil and Unlawful, by its evil Fruits and Effects.</hi> As the tree is known by what it bears, the Vine of <hi>Sodom</hi> by its ſour Grapes. Particularly, That Mirth is evil, which is an hindrance of what is Good, or which cheriſhes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes to what is evil.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes it indiſpoſes for what is Good, which it ſhou'd promote by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilerating the Spirits.</hi> It begets ill frames, and unfits for duty: the temper of Spirit is perverſe, and will not be bro't to what is good. Thus, <hi>Spiteful Mirth is the death of Charity:</hi> The heart that can inſult the Miſerable is void of all Pity &amp; Beneficence: it won't ſo much as ſay, <hi>Be ye warmed, be ye filled:</hi> Again, <hi>Profane Mirth is the furtheſt point from Repentance and Spiritual Mourning.</hi> He that ſhou'd be Sorrowing and
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001293_0087_0FB22CA684F17508"/>
trembling at his own Sins, is helliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſporting himſelf without fear. Nothing that is good can dwell with this frame. And <hi>Frothy vain Mirth is an Enemy to all Devotion.</hi> It's hard to recover ones ſelf to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber &amp; Devout thinking, or to find delight in Divine Contemplations. It ſuppreſſes &amp; ſtifles the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were upon the Soul; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is born down, and the Spirit of God driven away by impure <hi>Blaſts:</hi> So pleaſures <hi>Choke the Word</hi> as well as worldly cares, and Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's concern for the Soul is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Finally, It takes away both <hi>Liſt and Confidence for Prayer:</hi> too <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> a Duty, and too much a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,</hi> for one that has been all the day in a light Spirit: How can he look God in the face at night, or compoſe himſelf to a holy Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Often it provokes to Evil, and promotes and ſtrengthens Sin in men.</hi> It ſtupefies &amp; hardens men, and by

The Jovial Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner comes in a little time to ſit under <hi>Sermons</hi> with the ſame Levity that he reads <hi>Playes</hi> with; and 'ere he is aware may come to make a Jeſt of Heaven &amp; Hell, and all that's Sacred. <hi>Profane Mirth</hi> runs men into all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities; it has a pernicious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to make men Shameleſs in all Immoralities: it hoots Modeſty and Fear away. <hi>Moreover,</hi> It cramps Induſtry, and is big with Idleneſs; it affects ſuch Company as are for the Glaſs and Gaming; it wou'd make the Year one long <hi>Holiday,</hi> &amp; dooms the <hi>Sabbath to Sport &amp; Paſtime,</hi> as well as the Six dayes of Labour. Finally, <hi>Malicious Mirth</hi> teaches men to backbite, imbitters 'em againſt their Neighbours, makes 'em hate 'em with Malignity, and Scorn 'em with Virulence. All this Iniquity it foments in our own Breaſts.</p>
            <p>Nor is it without an Evil Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on <hi>Others,</hi> who behold our vain

Converſation. It gives Scandal to the Sober and Temperate, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to Live Godly; as the Riots of <hi>Sodom</hi> vexed <hi>Lots</hi> holy Soul. And it tempts unſtaid graceleſs Minds to run into the ſame Exceſſes: they are for this ſort of Life, for a Merry and Looſe one, and eaſily prevail'd on to <hi>caſt in their Lot</hi> here; if you only beckon you <hi>force</hi> him, and he <hi>Follows as a Fool to the Correction of the Stocks,</hi> till he find his <hi>Bane</hi> mixt up in theſe <hi>Sweets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Mirth that is Carnal &amp; Vicious, and as ſuch to be condemned, avoided and abhorred.</hi> And the view we have had of it is very <hi>Improvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and of excellent <hi>USE</hi> for our Conduct and Government: That we be <hi>Merry and Wiſe;</hi> that we <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves with Wiſdom,</hi> while we yet deſire to <hi>enjoy that Good which is for the Sons of men, all the dayes of their life.</hi> It teaches us to <hi>rejoyce with trembling,</hi> and never to let go that holy Fear which is a Check on
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001293_0090_0FB22CAC957D3C68"/>
our mad luſts. It warns us what a <hi>wild thing</hi> Joy is in a Corrupted Heart, and with what <hi>Care</hi> it ſhou'd be lookt after. It may be a <hi>Cue</hi> to us in looking back on our paſt life, and ſearching out what has been amiſs and faulty in our paſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It may <hi>remind</hi> us how often our Joyes have been Intemperate, Fleſhly, Profane, Uncharitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may poſſibly diſcover Folly or Malignity, where it wou'd be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable for another to charge it, and where we our ſelves did not ſo much ſuſpect it. And all will have this good uſe, to <hi>preſerve</hi> us from <hi>future Errors</hi> of this nature, &amp; make us <hi>Penitent</hi> for thoſe that are <hi>paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I might obſerve, what a <hi>Strong Poiſon Sin is,</hi> how curſed its Influence to pervert every graceful Power God has given to man.

Gall and Wormwood! In it ſelf truly a gay and pleaſant thing, but now a black &amp; threatning Evil; our Wound and our Blemiſh, our Grief and our Shame! How diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from their Native Beauty are thoſe <hi>Smiles,</hi> which ſhou'd have been both <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to us, to make our <hi>Hearts Glad,</hi> and our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Shine.</hi> The Devil who is held in Chains of black Deſpair him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, envy'd us <hi>Ihis</hi> which is forbid to him for over: But who cou'd have Imagin'd that it cou'd be turn'd to ſo much Sin and Miſchief! Such a help to Duty into ſo great an hindrance, and the Pleaſure of Life into ſo great a Curſe! <hi>Sin is a Blaſt on all the Works of God, deforms the faireſt Angels, and brings moſt hurt out of the greateſt Good.</hi> You may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive from hence, what the Works of God once were before Sin enter'd, and how ſtrangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and perverted now. Alas! Men have no Conception of their

Original Rectitude, and the Uſe that wou'd have been made of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Power in us to the Creators Glory, &amp; our own Felicity.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Sin never comes with that force upon us, as when it puts on a face of Pleaſure, and invites us to be merry, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore add ſome <hi>Rules and Motives</hi> to help us to withſtand it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us Accuſtome our ſelves daily to meditate on ſome ſerious awful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or other.</hi> Inconſideration is the Cauſe of mens Levity and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs; or rather it is from the poſſeſſion which one Triffle or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother takes of the mind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is Engroſs'd and ſwallow'd up of vanity. But did we ſuffer our tho'ts daily to dwell upon ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Holy Subject; did we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize God preſent with us, his eyes faſtned on us as a ſevere Obſerver and Judge; it would thicken our flowing Blood, and cool our Fever. Did we calmly take a view pretty
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001293_0093_0FB22CB4DF38B4D0"/>
often of our Sins as they are linckt to amazing Conſequences, even to a Judgment-day, wherein we muſt give an account for every <hi>Idle word;</hi> our own hearts wou'd as often call upon us in the words of the Apoſtle <hi>James, Be afflicted, and mourn and weep! let you Laughter be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mourning, and your Joy into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs.</hi> To conclude, Let your Souls and Eternity come often to mind, and think with your ſelves, I have an unſeen part to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of an Invaluable Price and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Duration, the Danger of loſing it is great, and the Time of Saving it very ſhort; and am I <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling</hi> and <hi>Playing</hi> with my Soul in my hand, and it may be but a ſand or two more in may Glaſs to run? O my Soul, it highly imports one haſtning into Eternity to be <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adviſes, <hi>Lay a good Foundation for Joy in Repentance, and by ſecuring an Intereſt in the Lord

Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This will both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Mirth well, and be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Warrant to us to rejoyce. <hi>Let every man prove his own work, &amp; then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf,</hi> Gal. 6.4. Stay till your Souls be ſafe, and then be as merry as your daily Reviewing your Evidences for Heaven can Inſpire you. What quiet or eaſe belongs to you till you begin to return to God, &amp; to ſeek ſafety under the Wings of Chriſt. Then God himſelf will take part in your Mirth, as it is repreſented in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Prodigal Son,</hi> after his happy Recovery from his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, Luk. 15.23, 24. <hi>Let us eat and be merry, for this my Son was dead &amp; is alive again, he was loſt &amp; is found: And they began to be merry.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be conſtant in Secret Prayer, and therein daily renewing your Repentance.</hi> This will leave a ſeriouſneſs on the Soul, and keep a man in the fear of God all the day long. He that in his Retirements has been confeſſing

and bewailing Indwelling Sin, and all the curſed fruits of it; fervently praying too for the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Mortification of every Inordinate Affection, &amp; to become <hi>dead to the world,</hi> will find little heart to fall in with mad Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that day. Watchfulneſs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſerious Prayer; It alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in the Soul a Contempt of the wild Freaks, which the carnal heart loves. It makes a man look upon 'em with a Generous Pity, or a Noble Diſdain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Guard againſt the Sins of Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality more eſpecially, &amp; ſhun Evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> are the Fomentors, the <hi>Laſt</hi> the Favourers of &amp; Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in Vain Mirth. <hi>Senſual Luſts</hi> are made up of Levity; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of nothing thats Grave &amp; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, no not a ſingle Tho't; their Life and Empire depends on the Exile of this; for Reaſon is really Sedition and Conſpiracy againſt the Reign of Sin: if we ought to

live to the Fleſh, verily Conſcience and Reaſon ought to die as Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable Traitors.</p>
            <p>Morever, Theſe Senſual Luſts love <hi>Company:</hi> Men can't Game, and Drink, and be leud and laugh <hi>Alone!</hi> they provoke and ſpur on one another by <hi>Evil Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is very Infective, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably depraves while it is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k'ned to: As the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk</hi> kill, ſo <hi>Attention</hi> does here, the deadly <hi>Poiſon</hi> is convey'd in the <hi>Sound.</hi> Where is Profaneſs &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs taught and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but in theſe <hi>Clubs,</hi> which are the <hi>Devils Schools,</hi> and ſome <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> in his Works ſits, as <hi>Maſter,</hi> at the <hi>Head</hi> of the Table.

impoſſible to keep up an Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy here, and be Serious too; tho' it may be there's many a Soul that's gull'd by promiſing it: He ventures at firſt into vain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with a wrong and falſe notion of them and their Wayes, as not ſo guilty neither as ſome do report 'em to be; or at leaſt he promiſes for himſelf to preſerve a Decorum among them, and let 'em ſee that one may be Jocund and Innocent: But how vainly is this pretended! he finds their <hi>Breath</hi> a <hi>ſubtle Poiſon,</hi> that imperceptibly <hi>Sheds</hi> it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his <hi>Veins,</hi> and he comes out from them as very a <hi>Rake</hi> as the worſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Call often to mind the Afflictions you have gone thro', and the Frames you were in when theſe were upon you.</hi> Then you were ſerious, &amp; tho'tful for your Souls and another Life: then you had a ſenſible Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Emptineſs of this World, and could find no Pleaſure in it.:

then your paſt Merriments were taſtleſs and nauſeous to you, and ſtung you with Remorſe: then you wiſh'd you had thoſe days of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to live over again &amp; Redeem: then you cou'd have felt Comfort from a ſober and temperate, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual &amp; Heavenly Life paſt: then you reproach'd and curs'd your paſt pleaſures of Sin, and <hi>ſaid of Laughter, It is Mad.</hi> O judge of vain Mirth now by what your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpake upon, the <hi>Sick-bed:</hi> You were then far from laviſh Mirth, you promis'd to be more temperate in your Joyes if ever you recover'd, Sobriety then look'd Manly to you, and Godlineſs was infinitely Amiable and deſirable: never forget thoſe Apprehenſions of things, and they will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Check, and a faithful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory. Remember, Theſe were your wiſe and ſober Hours, now was your Judgment Unbyaſs'd, &amp; your Sight clear and diſtinct. It

was in his deep Affliction that the <hi>Prodigal</hi> came to himſelf, he was out of his wits before in his <hi>Riotous Life.</hi> Luſt and a Fever alike make the head giddy and light; when the Rod of God (which is Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal) layes our Fever, our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon returns.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, <hi>Set the Life of the Bleſſed</hi> JESUS <hi>before you, &amp; by it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reprove your Exceſſes.</hi> Did our Holy Savior, whoſe Steps we ought to tread in, leave us any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for Intemperate Mirth? Was there the leaſt ſhadow of it, the leaſt Inclination to it in his Life? On the contrary, how Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteer &amp; Mortify'd was it! In what ſubjection kept he his Body and Paſſions! In what Contempt had he the World and all its Glories! How wide did he keep from it! His Converſation was Above, his Nights he ſpent in Prayer, his Days in doing good! in God-like Acts of Mercy, many as the Miſeries of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001293_0100_0FB22B49C7C39068"/>
Men; the Needs of their Bodies, and of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Indeed there was nothing <hi>Moroſe and Sour</hi> in the Converſation of our Lord: and I wiſh we cou'd learn from thence, and alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, that Evangelical Holineſs and Mortification do require no ſuch thing of us. He was Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Obliging, Affable to all that ſought unto him; only Severe &amp; Inexorable to mens Sins. 'Tis true, we read of his <hi>Tears,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his <hi>Laughing;</hi> and his Style was—<hi>A Man Sorrows:</hi> Yet we know alſo he did not ſhun Mirth on proper Occaſions, nor cenſure it in others. I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, how he honour'd the <hi>Joyful Solemnity in Cana</hi> with his Preſence; wherein he ſufficiently countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Regular Mirth, &amp; indeed ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd it; for it wou'd be ſilly to queſtion whether the Gueſts were Merry there; there was the <hi>Joy of the Bridegroom,</hi> and <hi>his Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001293_0101_0FB22B4B56518040"/>
to hear his Voice;</hi> but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it wou'd be Audacious to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were any Indecent Irregular Mirth there; No Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, no Scornful Fleering, no fooliſh Jeſting, no Profaneſs, no rude Laughs with their Wine. To conclude, If we ever find our ſelves in a licentious Vein, ready to be carry'd away by flowing Mirth, let us bethink our ſelves of our Character and Relation to Chriſt; Is this as becomes a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> did the Life of <hi>Jeſus</hi> teach me this? ſhou'd his Profeſſed Follower give himſelf this <hi>looſe? For he hath not called us unto Uncleanneſs, but unto Holineſs: therefore let us who are of the Day be Sober.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suffer me yet to lay two or three CONSIDERATIONS before you, to deter men from playing away their Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider Seriouſly what a Shadow
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001293_0102_0FB22B4D007B94B8"/>
Sinful Mirth is.</hi> What is there of ſubſtance in it after all? What has a man enjoy'd at laſt? It is Contingent, Mutable, mixt with pain, daſh'd with ſorrow, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fleeting. As Children blow up <hi>gay Bubbles</hi> in the Air, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in a minute. Or as <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the Compariſon, Eccl. 7.6. <hi>As the crackling of Thorns under a Pot, ſo is the Laughter of the Fool; this alſo is Vanity.</hi> His Mirth is like that Inſignificant Noiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and ſoon over.</p>
            <p>In the gayeſt part of Life his Mirth is mixt, <hi>Sunt quaedam triſtes Voluptates,</hi> ſay <hi>Seneca:</hi> there are imbitter'd and ſour'd Pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we have a greater witneſs than his that there are ſo: Prov. 14.13. <hi>Even in Laughter the heart is ſorrowful, and the End of the Mirth is Heavineſs.</hi> Some ſudden <hi>Judgment</hi> may put an untimely Period to it, and long ſorrow
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001293_0103_0FB22B512145AB70"/>
may ſucceed it. Or the Sinner may long out-live the Reliſh of what he now ſurfeits on: At the Venerable <hi>Barzillai's</hi> Age will he diſcern between Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? Will he taſte what he eats? Or be able to hear the Voice of <hi>Singing-men,</hi> and all their ſoft Airs? Deaths haſty Advances wou'd ſpoil all if he cou'd. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals Mirth, and ſtruck dead to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row!</hi> And what becomes of the Fools Mirth as he dies! What Profit or Comfort! It is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with ſhame, and bitter in Reflection: <hi>Tho' Wickedneſs was ſweet in his Mouth, yet his Meat in his Bowels is turned, it is the Gall of Aſps within him. Truly the Triumphing of the Wicked is ſhort, and his Joy but for a moment; it flies away as a dream, and is chaſed as a Viſion of the night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider Soberly what thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are which Sinful Mirth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001293_0104_0FB22B52C96E8148"/>
and fights againſt, and where you will end.</hi> It will ſcandalize you at this Folly, if you are not loſt to all ſenſe of what is Good and Comely, to ſee what it is, you declare againſt, and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Impiety it tends. You declare againſt Sobriety, Charity, Purity; the Fear, Reverence and Worſhip of God: And are you indeed the profeſſed Enemy of theſe? Do you deſign to be this <hi>Libertine?</hi> Believe it, looſe Mirth will ſoon run you to all this length. It is an Inchantment, and you can't break it when you liſt. It is like Some <hi>Mills</hi> that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got the leaſt hold of a man draw in the whole Body. The Diſguiſe of all Sin is Pleaſure, and a Bewitching one it is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider, In thy Vain Mirth thou thy ſelf art the Sport of Satan, and the Pity of Heaven.</hi> You gratifie and pleaſe the Devil, but every
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:001293_0105_0FB22B5444F1EE20"/>
Wiſe and Good and Happy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pities thy madneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. There is a Cruel Sport I have ſeen in the World, that goes under the guiſe of Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Mercy; <hi>ſcil.</hi> A poor <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> kept in a Rich mans Houſe, whom they daily make themſelves very merry with: I know no Condition of Life more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated, and yet truly I know no more juſt Compariſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to repreſent the deplorable Circumſtances of the Jovial Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; only the Devil who in a ſort <hi>begs</hi> and <hi>keeps</hi> him, feeding his Luſts, and provoking him to his follies, does it with a more <hi>malicious</hi> pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And Laſtly, <hi>Conſider the ſad work which Sinful Mirth makes for Repentance, or the Sorrow that will come of it for evermore.</hi> The man is mad, who thinks the pleaſures of Sin can ballance the pain of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001293_0106_0FB22B55C6C16690"/>
Repentance; were he ſure of the Grace to repent. He knows not what Remorſe is, nor how heavy the Hand of God may lie; nor how the ſwallow'd Poiſon will ſting and rend 'ere it be caſt up. One drop of Divine Wrath is ſo fiery, that if you cou'd mix it with an Ocean of Senſual Mirth, yet it were not ſufferable. The diſgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging there pleaſing Draughts of Sin is an uneaſie thing; but the utter and extream Griefs that attend Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence are amazing to think of. A ſad Change of <hi>Note</hi> will ſoon be in this Caſe, and an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi> portion of <hi>Sorrow</hi> for a little <hi>empty Mirth! This</hi> for a day, <hi>that</hi> for ever! <hi>this</hi> Imperfect for the Moment it laſts, <hi>that</hi> Inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Weight as well as for Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our Senſual Pleaſures will be ſoon forgotten here, or then Memory will add to our Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and raiſe the more <hi>Wailing and Gnaſhing of Teeth</hi> for ever. And

very often there is a <hi>ſad Prologue to theſe,</hi> and men are bro't to mourn deſpairingly for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Joyes before they go down into Hell: Prov. 5.11, 12. <hi>And thou mourn at the laſt—and ſay, How have I hated Inſtruction, &amp; my heart deſpiſed Reproof!

            <p>Next unto this, and Subordinate unto it, is the Teſtimony of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE for us; of which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſayes, 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>Our Rejoycing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience.

Fountain of all Mercy and Saving Good to loſt Sinners.

We rejoyce in his Light.</hi> In ſuch a Merciful <hi>High-Prieſt!</hi> Rom. 5.11. <hi>We joy in God thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the Atonement.</hi> In ſuch a <hi>King</hi> &amp; Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and Judge! <hi>He ſhall Save us.</hi> In ſuch an <hi>Advocate!</hi> verſe 2, 3. <hi>By whom alſo we have acceſs by Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Grace, and rejoyce in Hope of the Glory of God.</hi> The Joy of Faith &amp; Hope, of Prayer and Praiſe, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Evangelical Grace and Duty, (hereafter to be Enumerated) does all Ultimately center in Chriſt the <hi>Saviour.</hi> Phil. 3.3. <hi>We are the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001293_0128_0FB22B8AAC875A60"/>
which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp; have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well did the <hi>Angel</hi> ſay to the <hi>Shepherds, I bring you good Tidings of</hi> GREAT JOY, <hi>which ſhall be to</hi> ALL PEOPLE: <hi>for unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Our <hi>Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee</hi> that Bleſſed <hi>Day; He ſaw it and was glad.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Simeon</hi> waited for this <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and at laſt had it in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where he <hi>took the Holy Child in his Arms, and bleſſed God, and ſaid, Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace,— for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi>—</p>
            <p>So then, <hi>Our Rejoycing may be</hi> MORE ABUNDANT IN CHRIST JESUS, to borrow the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Words; but that muſt needs depend upon an <hi>Aſſured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> in Him, and a <hi>Title</hi> to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant of Grace. And the Divineſt Joyes flow from
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001293_0129_0FB22B8C88600B00"/>
               <hi>this, Namely,</hi> from a ſenſe of Gods Eternal Love to us in Chriſt, that he has pardon'd, accepted &amp; juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd us in his <hi>Son.</hi> This is that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs which is better than life.</hi> In this our <hi>Saviour</hi> bids us to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> ſcil. <hi>That our Names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven.</hi> The Joy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf is in his Exaltation, <hi>Ours</hi> in the Great Salvation thro' Him: Pſal. 21.5, 6. <hi>His Glory is great in thy Salvation; Honour and Majeſty thou haſt laid upon Him: Thou haſt made Him moſt Bleſſed for ever,— exceeding Glad with thy Countenance.</hi> If the Hope of Salvation will not give a ſinking, periſhing Sinner Joy, what ſhou'd? 'Tis his <hi>Hearts Deſire</hi> ſurely! the one <hi>Requeſt of his lips!</hi> all the <hi>Bleſſings of Goodneſs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether! even <hi>Life for ever &amp; ever!</hi> Rev. 2.17. <hi>I will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new Name written, which no man knoweth ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he that receiveth it.</hi> 
               <q>It was a Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom (they ſay) anciently to ſend
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001293_0130_0FB22B8E151EE7F8"/>
a <hi>white</hi> Stone in token of <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> and a <hi>black</hi> Stone as the ſign of <hi>Condemnation,</hi> with the Perſons <hi>Name</hi> written upon it, accordingly this <hi>New Name</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyes Gods Pardon &amp; Adoption, the Inexpreſſible Sweetneſs of which Priviledge, no man knows but he that is poſſeſſed of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, The Ground of all this muſt be the Evidences and Fruits of our SANCTIFICATION; and the ſure perception of the GRACE of God in our hearts: Which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Invaluable Gift of God, &amp; Benefit by Chriſt, that affords us aſſurance of Gods Love and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. To behold in our ſelves a Conformity and Subjection of Soul unto the Redeemers Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs! that <hi>Likeneſs</hi> wherein we hope to <hi>Awake,</hi> and reſt ſatisfy'd for ever! which is the Seeds of Glory <hi>Sown</hi> in us, and <hi>Light</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in! Heaven begun in us! the <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> and Foretaſt of its Perfection,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001293_0131_0FB22B9032BAC930"/>
and therefore neceſſarily of its Joyes. Indeed it can't be pleaſant to think of a Holy God, and to find no <hi>Image</hi> of his Holineſs on our ſelves; no love to it, no deſire of it, nothing of His <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> But on the contrary, the bare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of theſe Excellencies in us is an Unſpeakable Pleaſure; the Holy Soul even dies away thro' the Exceſs of it, ſaying,—<hi>The Health of my Countenance, and my God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To finiſh this Head, <hi>The</hi> GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY OF GOD <hi>in the Salvations granted to his Church, &amp; in the Converſion of Sinners,</hi> is a ſpecial Matter and Object of an Holy Joy. 'Tis the Honour of God and of the <hi>Lamb</hi> that occaſions the Joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Witneſs in what Triumphing Words they Sing his Works of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and of Judgment: <hi>Alleluia, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God!—Let us be Glad and Rejoyce, and give Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:001293_0132_0FB22B910FDBE408"/>The <hi>Church's</hi> HOLINESS is the publick Honour of Chriſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>there's Joy among the Angels of God over one Sinner that repenteth;</hi> And when <hi>Jeſus Rejoyced in Spirit</hi> it was on this Account, (as well became the Lover and Saviour of Souls) <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes: Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed Good in thy ſight.</hi> The Holy Children of God <hi>have no greater Joy</hi> than to behold the <hi>Grace</hi> of God in one another; Eſpecially Holy <hi>Miniſters</hi> have <hi>none</hi> higher, than to ſee <hi>this</hi> in their <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For what is our Hope, or Joy, or Crown of Rejoycing? Are not even ye in the Preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his Coming? for ye are our Glory &amp; Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again, The Illuſtrious SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATIONS of Gods Church in the Earth, and its outward <hi>Tranquility and Flouriſhing,</hi> is to the Saviours Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;

and for this Reaſon alone <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be <hi>Preferr'd above our chief Joy.</hi> It is but Piety to God and to his Intereſt, a Duty to Chriſt &amp; to his Members: Iſa. 66.10. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ye with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her; Rejoyce for Joy with her, all ye that Mourn for her.</hi> Thus <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Finally, The Joy of the LORDS-TABLE riſes yet higher: 'tis the Stated and Solemn Memorial of the Love of Chriſt and his Purchaſed Benefits, the happy Seaſon of raiſed Devotions and intimate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Him, and of the Renewal of our Covenant Engagements to Him, which while we are doing with burning Love &amp; Zeal, with ſtrong Faith &amp; Deſire, with deep Repentance and Self-loathing for our Sins; We have our Pardon Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Blood, &amp; Aſſurance of our Intereſt in the Mercies of God thro' Him. 'Tis a moſt refreſhing thing to revive often in our Minds the LOVE OF CHRIST, &amp; the FREE GRACE of God, which (we truſt) has choſen us in Him, and inſtated us in the Dignity, and will bring us to the Glories of his Redeemed. We have <hi>Great Joy in his Love,</hi>— O

how Unſpeakable! to think — <hi>I am my Beloveds, and his Deſire is towards me!</hi> He is my <hi>Saviour,</hi> I am a part of his <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> mine are the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Heaven</hi> of Bleſſedneſs therein made over! <hi>Who Loved me, and gave Himſelf for me!</hi> To repreſent him to our ſelves, either on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or on his exalted <hi>Throne,</hi> equally reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſame Arms of Mercy to Embrace returning Sinners! to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize our ſelves <hi>with Him, where He is, to behold his Glory;</hi> Beloved of him, and Crowned by him,—what can beget in a devout Soul ſuch Extaſy &amp; Raviſhment as this?

Iſrael, Deut. 10.21. <hi>He is thy Praiſe, and He is thy God, that has done for thee theſe great things which thine Eyes have ſeen.</hi> How agreeable this is to a devout heart, let the <hi>Book of Pſalms</hi> bear witneſs, wherein we are ſo often call'd upon to <hi>ſhew forth</hi> Gods Praiſe, to make his Praiſe <hi>Glorious,</hi> to <hi>Triumph</hi> in his Praiſe, &amp; to have our <hi>Mouth filled</hi> therewithal.

my mouth: O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together! — And my Tongue ſhall ſpeak of thy Righteouſneſs, and of thy Praiſe all the day long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the leaſt Teſtimony of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Eſteem that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from us, who have Souls in our Bodies, and Tongues in our Heads; who have the power of Speech, and Reaſon to regulate it; who have a Conſcience within us, and a ſenſe of Benefits. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are our Minds and Tongues ſo well imploy'd, as when the Glories of God do take 'em up: therefore the Inhabitants of Heaven are thus buſied for ever. <q>
                  <hi>Praiſe is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Happy Creatures,</hi> it is the natural Homage of Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q> 'Tis the beſt part of Worſhip: the beſt Affections of the Soul are in the beſt manner that can be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd towards the Beſt Good.

faileth;</hi> but if it imploys our life here, ſo will it our Eternity; &amp; he that dies with theſe in his mouth, changes his place but not his Frame &amp; Work; only in Heaven they are perfected. And what do we think it is that makes <hi>Praiſe</hi> the Work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? verily, becauſe 'tis the Place &amp; State of compleat Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Joy. Every Glorious Spirit there is full of theſe, &amp; out of their abundant delight in God, they pour out Praiſe unto him. God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates unto them with a liberal hand, they drink of the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Goodneſs to the full, they know no want &amp; indigence, &amp; can know no ſorrow; therefore being always brimful of Content, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly praiſe Him in whom <hi>all their ſprings</hi> are. So we, while the Joy of the Divine Benefits fills our Souls, muſt imitate the raviſht Minds above, &amp; give Bleſſings and Praiſes to Him.</p>

            <p>I will not enter on any Elaborate proof, that <hi>Singing of Pſalms</hi> is a part of Divine Worſhip, Natural &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, Private &amp; Publick.

that filled the Houſe of the Lord with Glory?

            <p>I mean not that <hi>Singing</hi> does not ſuit Occaſions of Grief, and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Humiliation</hi> &amp; Mourning; for there are <hi>Penitential Pſalms,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pſalms

of Prayer,</hi> &amp; of Sorrowful <hi>Complaint;</hi> and the ſad Heart may and ſhou'd Sing theſe, which ſuits its State and Temper; bemoaning it ſelf, &amp; ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace and Help of God in this way, as well as in Prayer. Nor is <hi>Solomon</hi> to be underſtood to deny this when he ſayes, <hi>As Vinegar upon Nitre, ſo is he that Singeth Songs to a Heavy Heart:</hi> 'tis as the Song is, and as it is tim'd and ſung, that inſtead of ſoothing Grief will only vex and enrage it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I mean to deny the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Uſe of Reading the Inſpired Pſalms,</hi> but affirm that this alſo is wonderfully Adapted to the Spirit of Praiſe. Cou'd I ſpeak with the <hi>Tongue of Men &amp; Angels</hi> whether in Prayer or Preaching, had I all the Eloquence of the World given me this day, and the holy Zeal &amp; Flame of a <hi>Seraph</hi> put within me, yet cou'd I no wayes compoſe for your Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, &amp; the raiſing your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward God, any thing to be

Nam'd with <hi>thoſe Pſalms of Praiſe,</hi> which have this day been Read in your Hearing. Nor cou'd an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> do it, ſave ſpeaking by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who inſpir'd theſe holy <hi>Odes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſuited is the <hi>Book of Pſalms</hi> to a day of <hi>Thanksgiving!</hi> From thence we may beſt take our Words and Expreſſions, clothing our Tho'ts in theſe excelling Strains of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to raiſe in our Selves a like heat and warmth: while we <hi>Muſe</hi> on <hi>theſe</hi> the <hi>Fire Kindles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Singing</hi> has its <hi>Peculiar Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for Edification,</hi> if it be not our own fault. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore ſpeaks of the Inſtruction &amp; Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which this <hi>Ordinance</hi> deſigns us: Col. 3.16. <hi>Teaching &amp; Admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, Hymns and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Advantage hereunto is the <hi>Deliberateneſs</hi> &amp; Leiſure of this Mode of Praiſe or Prayer. The Mind has time allow'd it to Pauſe on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

Paſſages: Every <hi>Sillable</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly utter'd, and <hi>drawn out</hi> in its proper <hi>Note,</hi> that the Mind may fix and faſten and dwell on the holy Tho't. And as the Voice leiſurely Aſcends, ſo may the Soul with it towards Heaven.</p>
            <p>Another Advantage is, that it ſtrikes ſo ſtrongly on <hi>Senſe &amp; Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> and by them has the more forcible Acceſs to our <hi>Affections.</hi> Our Spirits being Imbodyed are naturally come at by Impreſſions on our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and more particularly by the <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear. Muſical Notes</hi> may be fitted to the <hi>Matter Sung,</hi> whether it be Grave or Looſe; and they may be Addreſs't with Art &amp; great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to one or other <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our Souls; and accordingly they do convey into our Minds Ridiculous <hi>Idea's</hi> or Venerable, which provoke Laughter or Seriouſneſs, beſpeak Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or Contempt, move Love or Hatred, Joy or Sorrow: Hence it is that looſe <hi>Sonnets</hi> have ſo fatal a power to deprave men, and <hi>Satan</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="unknown:001293_0159_0FB22BCAC7924B20"/>
uſes 'em as natural Means hereunto; while the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> works alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Souls in ways adapted to our Frame and Nature, and uſes <hi>Holy Pſalms</hi> as naturally tending to leave Impreſſions of what is Holy and Good upon us.</p>
            <p>Another Advantage of <hi>Singing</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>Edification</hi> is, the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> which generally Mankind take in it: tho' it muſt be granted that its Force is not alike on all. <hi>Muſick</hi> has its Charm, in ſuch an <hi>Ear</hi> as <hi>Davids</hi> more eſpecially, and ſo have <hi>Pſalms</hi> where there is <hi>his Devotion, It is a good thing to give Thanks unto the Lord, &amp; to ſing Praiſe to thy Name, O moſt High!</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Eccho</hi> of our Earth to Heaven, and a ſofter kind of Rapture. It has had wonderful <hi>Effects:</hi> The ſweet Voice of a <hi>Pſalm</hi> has ejected Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, as <hi>Davids Harp</hi> did the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirit</hi> from the Lord on King <hi>Saul:</hi> It has ſweet'ned a <hi>Priſon,</hi> and given new Heart to <hi>Martyrs</hi> at the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:001293_0160_0FB22BCC54BADAB0"/>
               <hi>Stake:</hi> It has made the <hi>Shades of Death</hi> to flee away, and clos'd up a Saints Eyes in like <hi>Brightneſs,</hi> as the Sun ſets in a fair Evening. <q>Come help me with your Praiſes, (cry'd happy Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> on his <hi>Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi>) Yet all too little! Come help me all ye <hi>Mighty Angels,</hi> who are ſo well skill'd in the Heavenly Work of Praiſe! <hi>Hallelujah! Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah! Praiſe</hi> is now my Work, &amp; I ſhall be engag'd in this <hi>Sweet Work</hi> for ever. Come, bring me the <hi>Bible,</hi> &amp; turn to <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> &amp; let us lift up our Voices in the Praiſes of the <hi>Moſt High:</hi> I will Sing with you as long as my Breath does laſt, &amp; when I have none, I ſhall do it better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this a <hi>Senſitive</hi> Pleaſure meerly. The <hi>Body</hi> ſubſerves the Soul, and is its Inſtrument in this State of their Union: yet the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part governs, and he that throws away his <hi>Senſes</hi> and Natural Powers, muſt his Reaſon &amp; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:001293_0161_0FB22BCF0E2DC2C0"/>
too; nor Glorify God in his <hi>Spirit</hi> no more than in his <hi>Body.</hi> God reaches the Soul by the <hi>Ear,</hi> or elſe <hi>Faith</hi> had not <hi>come by Hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it ſufficient for men to ſay, that they cou'd never have any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> of the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> nor find <hi>Profit</hi> from it: 'Tis their <hi>Carnality</hi> that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; &amp; it may be neither have they ever had any real ſavour of <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Hearing</hi> the Word: It's too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for People to live under <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances,</hi> &amp; not taſt the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nor feel the <hi>Power</hi> of 'em. And it is eno' to ſay, that thro' Grace others do reliſh this Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, &amp; the more Heavenly men are, the more do they delight it it. Moreover, It is poſſible for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Heart not to reliſh Heaven neither: were he taken thither he wou'd find <hi>Singing</hi> there, &amp; if that can diſguſt him, Heaven can be no Place for him.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, It muſt be granted, that ſome do <hi>Abuſe</hi> the Ordinance;
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:001293_0162_0FB22BD0EDB3DC10"/>
they Sing <hi>Vainly, Conceitedly, Lightly</hi> in the Solemn Worſhip of God, &amp; 'tis an offence to ſee 'em do ſo: But is it not as true, &amp; equally a Lamentation, that they can have wandring Minds, can Sleep, &amp; be wanton in <hi>Prayer</hi> &amp; <hi>Hearing</hi> alſo? And muſt we therefore reject, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and pour contempt on all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip? No: Gods Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are no more to be charg'd with our Sinful Abuſes of 'em, than Affronts &amp; Injuries are to be charg'd on Him that innocently ſuffers 'em.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid all this of the <hi>Uſe of</hi> SINGING unto the Ends of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to depretiate <hi>Prayer</hi> and the other <hi>Ordinances,</hi> but to aſſert the Place due to <hi>this,</hi> &amp; to ſhow that God owns all his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> and chuſes which of them he pleaſes to work by.</p>
            <p>The USE of this Meditation on the <hi>Joyes of Religion</hi> might be eaſily enlarged on, in many <hi>Particulars.</hi> As,</p>

of God unto us Sinners, &amp; to put us on <hi>Adoring</hi> Him, who has provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thro' <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> this <hi>Holy Joy</hi> for us; allows it to us, &amp; requires it of us.</p>

Yet disbelieve the Account of it they can't, having felt the torturing Gripes of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing Conſcience, which alone may ſatisfy 'em that its Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is exceeding Joyous.

Borrowed, and at the mercy of a thouſand Accidents, proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Body, Partial &amp; Fleeting! whereas <hi>Thoſe</hi> of Religion are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Soul, Sure and Full, at the mercy of no Evil or Enemy, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Spite of a frowning World, bearing the Heart up under Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, growing like the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> under Burdens &amp; heavy Preſſures, &amp; Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Death, &amp; after it.

The more of it there is, ſo much the Worſe! the more Sin and Miſery!</p>
            <p n="5">5. I muſt needs again lay before <hi>Good People</hi> their Duty, <hi>to Exhibit in their Lives the Joyes of Religion,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make ſome <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> to the Great God of the Riches of his

               <hi>Mercies</hi> toward them, and to <hi>Honour</hi> the Wayes of God in the ſight of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Why elſe has God made a Proviſion of <hi>Joy</hi> for his Children, but that they might Serve Him with a Glad Heart, and Serene Face!</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Some,</hi> whom we muſt needs account Good People, ſeem not at all to apprehend it a Duty to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after a ſettled Joy in God, &amp; <hi>Others</hi> that have it, apprehend not their Obligation to Exhibit it.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Firſt</hi> I would ſay, <hi>That</hi> they act as if Unknowing in the Nature, Deſign, Tendency &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Effects of Religion: <hi>That</hi> 'tis no Chriſtian Modeſty and Humility to put that Divine <hi>Pleaſure</hi> from us which God allows to us: <hi>That</hi> on the contrary, Nothing is more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental to Chriſtianity, or does more Honour to God, than for Good People to be Walking in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Goſpel; Nor ſcarce any thing more Unſeemly in them, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to God, and more palpably

            <p>Again, The Miſ-behaviour of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> is very groſs, who are not Strangers to the Joyes of Religion, but yet have taken up a Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Way, on a Conceit (I fear) of its Looking Religious, and being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Seriouſneſs of Spirit. Zeal is apt to run Weak Minds into ſome Unnatural Oddities, by which Religion is hurt and wounded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Served. Unnatural it is to ſpeak of God as <hi>Our God</hi> in the ſame ſad manner as we wou'd Lament after the Bleſſed Hope in. Is the Soul indeed delighted? I'm ſure 'tis Ill-favour'dly Expreſſed, and croſs to Nature the Interpretation muſt be; As if Frowns and Tears ſhou'd be made to ſignify Pleaſure and Content. But, why ſhou'd not Holy Joy expreſs it ſelf freely? Why ſhou'd not the Brightneſs of the Face, and the Life in the Eye, ſpeak it? and the Tone of the Voice be

Natural; <hi>Then was our Mouth filled with Laughter, and our Tongue with Singing: the Lord hath done Great things for us, whereof we are Glad.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Let me Argue a little with the <hi>Sad Spirited Saint.</hi> Is this the <hi>Look</hi> that the Servant of a Kind and Good Maſter, and a Child of God, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectant of Glory ſhou'd have! <q>Why art thou, being a Kings Son, lean from day to day?</q> Do you not look for <hi>Joy</hi> in Heaven? and why ſhou'd the State of Grace be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that of Glory?

            </p>
            <p>Is it that you only groan after more Grace? a clearer Sight of it in your ſelf? and then you ſhou'd Rejoyce! But do you not the mean while overlook the Grace you have,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:001293_0168_0FB22BDCFA82F930"/>

            <p>You ſee the proper <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the DAY, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> we muſt be in before the Lord our God.

            <p>As,</p>
            <p>Do we Praiſe the <hi>God of our</hi> HEALTH?

See alſo Pſalms LXV. 9, —13. CXLIV. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Do we magnify the Power and Love of our Gracious PROTEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR?

               <hi>Finally,</hi> Are we Praiſing our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Merciful God for his GOSPEL, and all <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings in</hi> CHRIST JESUS?

<pb n="165" facs="unknown:001293_0174_0FB22BE823454FE8"/>
like the Earth which he hath Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Ever. — He ſheweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto Iſrael; He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, and as for his Judgments they have not known them: Praiſe ye the</hi> LORD.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Praiſes muſt be Sung with Hearts full of</hi> JOY. The Call of Providence is to this, and 'tis more requiſite and decent than <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Praiſe</hi> or a joyful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. There ſhou'd be no ſad Heart or Face in the Lords <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies:</hi> We remember his Benefits in
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:001293_0175_0FB22BE9842F9820"/>
the midſt of all our Sins and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Our work <hi>To Day</hi> is like that of Heaven, where Prayers are chang'd into Praiſes: the very Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of Angels, to Rejoyce in the Divine Munificence, to Rejoyce in Praiſing God! O might we all feel this Heavenly Principle of <hi>Joy,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging us in this Good Work of <hi>Praiſe!</hi> But remember,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Our Joy muſt be</hi> SPIRITUAL, and what is properly <hi>Religious.</hi> I very much dread to ſee the day, when <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> ſhall loſe of their <hi>Solemnity</hi> in this <hi>Land.</hi> It has been our Crown and Glory that they have not been Debas'd &amp; Proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among us, as they are too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in <hi>Other Places,</hi> by Play and Sports, to Drinking and <hi>Bonefires,</hi> and Noiſy Lawleſs Jollity; nor yet have dwindled into more Silent and Innocent <hi>Illuminations.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is pleaſing to God, and ſeemly to Man, that we do at leaſt
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:001293_0176_0FB22BECE4594C40"/>
appear more Spiritual, Grave and <hi>Retir'd</hi> on ſuch Occaſions. So <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> I beſeech and humbly Charge you in the Lord, that your Joy in Him, his Operations and Favours, be Serious and <hi>Inward,</hi> and Holy.</p>
            <p>The truth is, Spiritual Joy is as <hi>Uneaſy</hi> and Impoſſible to a carnal Heart, as other Duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. We eaſily Rejoyce in a <hi>Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> manner, our Luſts provoke to it, we can <hi>Eat, Drink and be Merry:</hi> But to Rejoyce Spiritually is to ſour the Pleaſures of the Fleſh. <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are good things, and the Fleſh to thinks 'em ſo: But to ſet our ſelves to conſider &amp; weigh 'em as coming from God, and our Ill-deſerving any of 'em; to Abaſe our Souls for our Sins ungratefully committed in Abuſe of his Benefits, to Rejoyce in paying the Homage and debt of Praiſes for them, and to bind our ſelves to Live Devoted to God as a meet <hi>Thank-Offering;</hi>— this has nothing of Pleaſure in it,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:001293_0177_0FB22BEECC0A2740"/>
but is a ſore <hi>Penance</hi> to the Carnal Mind ſo much as to think of! Let God take his Gifts again, ('tis ready to ſay) if we muſt Pay ſo dear for 'em, at the Expence of our Luſts!</p>
            <p>But nevertheleſs, I muſt inſiſt on it, that our <hi>Joy be Holy:</hi> Such as true Devotion inſpires, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God kindles in holy Souls, by his Fellowſhip with them in holy Duties: Such as the Spirit of <hi>Praiſe</hi> requires, as the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Holy SPIRIT do cheriſh, and as Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unto all Holineſs. If men do not feel themſelves delighted from Love to God, Admiration of his Mercy, Deſires &amp; Serious Purpoſes (thro' Grace) of Living to his Glory, and to Serve him with the more Chearfulneſs and Diligence, under the large Experience of his Benefits, they do but play with and mock their <hi>Benefactor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And Laſtly, <hi>Therefore our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> WORSHIP <hi>muſt be from the</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:001293_0178_0FB22BF0537D3A30"/>
HEART, <hi>from an Engaged Spirit, &amp; raiſed Affections.</hi> A Joyful Noiſe alone is not Praiſe. The Tranſports of the Ear are one thing, thoſe of the Heart quite another. The Lord takes no more pleaſure meerly in the <hi>Voice,</hi> than in the <hi>Legs of a Man,</hi> but in them that <hi>Fear</hi> him. 'Tis a Play of Worſhip, whether we Sing Pſalms of <hi>Praiſe</hi> or <hi>Penitence,</hi> if no Inward <hi>Pleaſures</hi> Elate us in the one, nor Sorrows depreſs us in the other. The very Sport of <hi>the Children in the Market-place, We have piped to you &amp; ye have not danced! We have mourned to you &amp; ye have not lamented!</hi> The Goodly Sacrifice is the Heart it ſelf; the <hi>Subſtance</hi> this, a <hi>Lifeleſs Sound</hi> the other. Without <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and in <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> we make no <hi>Melody</hi> to the Lord; <q>as a <hi>Nightingale</hi> dead or aſleep can no more than a <hi>Crow.</hi>
               </q> We may paſs for <hi>Tubes,</hi> making a <hi>Sound,</hi> but by no means are <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers.</hi>
