            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Major General ST. CLAIR pleads NOT GUILTY.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate ſtates the matters upon which the charges againſt the General are founded, as follow:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is neceſſary (previous to my producing the requiſite evidence on this trial) that I ſhould inform you of the matters, upon which the charges againſt Major General St. Clair are founded. They are certain remarks, made by a committee of the Hon. the Continental Congreſs, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and to ſtate charges againſt the general officers who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated.</p>
               <p>Before I mention theſe remarks, I would inform you that Major General St. Clair, on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, took upon him the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that theſe places were evacuated to the enemy by his orders on the 6th day of July following.</p>
               <p>The firſt remark is: That on the 13th day of June General St. Clair was poſſeſſed of an information from two priſoners taken in Canada, that the Britiſh forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as faſt as poſſible againſt him, and that he might expect their arrival in three weeks at fartheſt. That as on the 18th of June four of the enemy's veſſels were lying on the hither ſide of Split Rock, and on the 24th ſeven of them were at Crown-Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both ſides of Gilleland's Creek, and he was informed by his ſcouts that they were very numerous; ſo from theſe circumſtances it appears General St. Clair had ſubſtantial reaſon to confide in what the priſoners had told him
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016141_0003_0F9B776CC0376B80"/>
relative to the intentions and ſtrength of the enemy; and that he ought at this time to have taken his final reſolution, either to ſtand an attack, or to retreat with his ſtores, the preſervation of which was a principal object in the determination of a council of war on the 20th of June. Therefore it appears that General St. Clair's neglecting to form his deciſive opinion at this time, or at a later day, ſo as to allow him a ſufficient opportunity to retreat with his troops, ſick, ammunition, cannon, proviſions and cloathing, and to deprive the enemy of ſhelter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That General St. Clair, on the 24th of June, was informed by his ſcouts the enemy were very numerous and yet, nevertheleſs, on the next day he wrote to Congreſs, that he was not able to diſcover whether the enemy were in force or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> That if General St. Clair found ſmall ſcouts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was his duty in due time to have ſent out reconnoitering parties, in ſuch force as might have aſſured him whether or not the enemy were in ſtrength, this being a moſt important point, as upon this he was to regulate his motions; and therefore his failure in ſending out ſuch parties in due time was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> That as Jeſſe Leavenworth ſwears General St. Clair did not annoy the enemy in their advance againſt, and inveſtiture of, the poſts under his care, although the troops were healthy, courageous, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of action, it appears the General did not to the utmoſt of his power oppoſe the operations of the enemy; and therefore that he is liable to the charge of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth.</hi> That as it was determined in a council of war on the twentieth of June, approved by General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention; and Jeſſe Leavenworth ſwears not a ſtroke was ſtruck for thoſe purpoſes; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decreaſed in number, and continued ſo at a time when it ſhould have been abundantly increaſed; ſo on theſe points the General is liable to be charged with a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, and with treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth.</hi> That as on the 25th of May, the Deputy Commiſſary rated that 1400 barrels of flour would, at an allowance of one pound each man <hi>per diem,</hi> ſerve 4000 men 66 days, and that 661 barrels of beef would ſerve the ſame number of men 75 days; and ſuppoſing that, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July incluſive, there were in Ticonderoga and Mount Independence 4739 men, and there does not appear to have been at any time between theſe periods a greater number; ſo eſtimating the conſumption of 4739 men, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July incluſive, upon the 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork, on the twentieth of June returned by Deputy Commiſſary Yancey as then actually remaining on hand, there did on the fourth of July remain, or ought, if proviſions had been regularly and properly iſſued, to be then remaining 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; a magazine of proviſions ſufficient to afford to the army on the fifth of July, amounting, by the arrival of the militia of the Grants, to 5639 men of all ranks, <hi>fall allowance</hi> of proviſion in flour for 52 days, and in beef and pork for 32 days, excluſive of the conſiderable number of fat cattle that arrived at Ticonderoga on the fifth of July, the teams of oxen neceſſarily attending the poſt, and other ſtores ſpecified in the Commiſſary's return on the twentieth of June, and even ſuppoſing, as may not reaſonably be done, that no ſupply of flour had arrived after that day. And as this calculation has been liberally made, upon the quantity of proviſions actually in Ticonderoga on the twentieth of June, for the expenditure of which General St. Clair, as commander at the poſt, ought to be held reſponſible; therefore it clearly appears Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not abandoned upon the juſt principle of a want of proviſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh.</hi> That as General St. Clair informed the Hon. Mr. Jay, that at the time of holding the council of war on the 5th of July he knew it to be impoſſible to defend the poſts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point as early as the 29th of June, the day that he ſent his ſon and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate effects from Ticonderoga to Fort-George, as a place of ſafety: That being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken as effectual meaſures for the preſervation of the public property, at leaſt equally with his own, claiming his earlieſt attention: That on the 30th of June, the enemy being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing againſt him ſo near as the Three-mile-point, it is incredible that he did not then know that they were in force: That it was his duty, <hi>at that point of time,</hi> to have finally determined either to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire: That if the laſt reſolution was taken, and, from his ſending off his ſon and baggage the day before, there is the ſtrongeſt preſumption that this reſolution was <hi>then</hi> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to ſend off the public ſtores, to deſtroy the works, and to evacuate the poſts without loſing a moment of time: And that by deferring to take any meaſures to retire till the laſt moment when he could poſſibly retreat even with his effective troops, a moment when the ſick, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing of the army muſt be abandoned and loſt, beſides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, General St. Clair appears charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General, and with ſhamefully abandoning the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge. Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wiſhes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too extenſive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if ſuch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehenſible point of view, as the weakneſs of his defence being more obvious, his retreat ſhould have been the earlier determined upon.</p>
               <p>The charge of neglect of duty is founded on the firſt, third, fourth and fifth remarks reſpectively.— Cowardice, treachery, incapacity as a General, reſpectively, are founded upon the fourth remark.— Treachery, founded upon the fifth remark.—Inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, treachery, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as a General, reſpectively, founded upon the ſeventh remark.—Shamefully abandoning the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge, founded upon the ſeventh remark.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair requeſts that the Reſolution of Congreſs of the 5th of February laſt, appointing two Counſellors learned in the law to aſſiſt and co-operate with the Judge Advocate in the trial of the General

               <p>The letters being read, Major General St. Clair addreſſes the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>THE reſolution that has juſt been read is of ſo ſingular a nature, that I cannot paſs it by without ſome obſervations.</p>
               <p>The treatment I have received renders it neceſſary for me to ſubmit to any regulation that may have been preſcribed, as an objection on my part would probably be conſtrued into the fear of a thorough inveſtigation, and conſequently an evidence of guilt. I ſhall therefore make no objection to the learned gentlemen, ſhould they attend, aſſiſting and co-operating with the Judge Advocate in my trial: But, as I conceive this to be introducing a very great change in the mode of proceeding before Courts Martial, I cannot conſent that Congreſs have any power to make that change.</p>
               <p>Courts Martial were conſtituted by the firſt article of the 14th ſection of the rules and articles for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the troops, and the mode of proceeding in them by the third article of the ſame ſection. Theſe articles every officer is obliged to ſubſcribe, whereby they become a compact betwixt the army and the people, and cannot be altered but by common conſent; and a reſolve of Congreſs has no more operation upon them than an edict of the Grand Turk. But a power to alter the ordinary courſe of proceeding for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe is big with conſequences of the moſt dangerous nature, and might be made an inſtrument of the moſt grievous oppreſſion. I do therefore, on behalf of the army, ſolemnly proteſt againſt my having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this innovation ever hereafter being drawn into precedent.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair admits he took the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, and that theſe poſts were evacuated by his orders the 6th day of July following.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate produces copies of letters from Major General St. Clair to Major General Schuyler, dated June 13th, June 18th, and June 24th, 1777; alſo a copy of a letter from Major General St. Clair to Congreſs, dated June 25th, 1777; a copy of a letter from General St. Clair to Major General Schuyler, dated June 30th, 1777; the proceedings of a Council of Officers held at Ticonderoga the 20th of June, 1777; a ſtate of the guards and fatigue party, June 15th, 1777, from a copy of General St. Clair's orderly book; alſo an order from the ſaid orderly book reſpecting the guards and fatigue party, June 23d, 1777: which, being read, are as follow:</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>HERE follows the ſubſtance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken priſoners by one of our parties on Onion River.</p>
                     <p>That General Burgoyne it arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the Britiſh army is aſſembling as faſt as poſſible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is ſaid to conſiſt of about ten thouſand men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John Johnſon, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River whilſt the reſt of the army under General Burgoyne croſſes the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the incloſed letter to General Sullivan) is all in the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at fartheſt.</p>
                     <p>From the nature and circumſtance of the paſs granted to one of the two, which I here incloſe, and his own account of the manner in which he was ſent from Montreal, viz. to ſearch plans of the country which he pretended to know are hid at Metcalf's, and his being poſſeſſed of a conſiderable ſum of continental money, and ſome gold and ſilver, I have the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicion of his being a ſpy, and have ſecured him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſuch, and ſent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him yourſelf, and that, if you ſhould think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, ſhould he be found guilty, the ſentence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer, who lately ſuffered a ſpy he had in charge to eſcape, through the groſſeſt miſconduct, has been honourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by a Court Martial.</p>
                     <p>You will likewiſe find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen ſent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circumſtance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if theſe fellows have really been ſent by him to ſee what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an eaſy reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwithſtanding be genuine, and Amſbury ſays it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a ſeparate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he ſeemed unwilling to part with, and which I ſuppoſe to have been a private ſignal by which he was to be known upon his return.</p>
                     <p>If the enemy intend to attack us, I aſſure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, excluſive of Baldwin's artificers and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Beſides theſe there are three regiments of Hampſhire militia, engaged for no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular term, and who go off whenever they pleaſe, 150 are gone ſince laſt return; two regiments of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with ſome of them is already expired. Among the number returned ſick there is no doubt but many would be uſeful in caſe of neceſſity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this diſagreeable detail, but I have ſomething worſe to add to it.—We cannot increaſe our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commiſſary's return and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for ſeven weeks only on the ground, and he has no proſpect of any ſupply of ſalt meat, but from ſome place near Still-Water, nor of freſh, but by ſending to New-England for it.—This I have deſired him to do, but muſt own I have little proſpect of advantage from it; for be aſſured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very eaſily be cut off.—I have heard of ſome cattle below Crown-Point, which I ſhall ſend for to-morrow.</p>
                     <p>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy troubleſome job.—The caſſoons, Col. Baldwin ſays, will be all ſunk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower ſide of them, which will ſerve as a kind of ſecond boom, and retard at leaſt, if not prevent, the enemy's veſſels from paſſing, ſhould they attempt it.</p>
                     <p>A magazine of wood ſhould be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a ſtick upon the Mount.—All the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwiſe be neceſſary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purpoſes.—What can the Quarter-Maſter mean by leaving this place, where ſo many works are to be carried on, without ſo neceſſary an article as draught cattle?</p>
                     <p>The tents here are in general very bad. I muſt beg you, my dear General, to haſten up the new tents, for I ſhall get no good of the troops here in any way, whilſt they remain in barracks.</p>
                     <p>Our powder magazines are in ſo wretched a ſtate, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In ſhort, every thing is ſo much out of order, that I will add no more to this lift of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</p>
                     <p>When I write again, I hope to have ſomething more agreeable to entertain you with, and am,</p>

                     <p>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and ſtores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is ſo drained I thought it needleſs to aſk for any from him, as he has almoſt literally nothing.</p>
                     <p>Since my laſt I have had conſtant ſcouts out, but have made no diſcovery of the enemy, ſave that four of their veſſels are lying about a mile on the hither ſide of the Split Rock; they conſiſt of two ſhips, and two gondolas; and on Friday laſt a ſchooner beat up within four miles of Crown-Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday about noon we had two men, who had ſtrolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of ſavages, who had ſtole down to the road ſide betwixt M'lntoſh's and the bridge, and concealed themſelves in the buſhes; they were immediately purſued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be over-taken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, however, they fell in with a ſcouting party I had ſent down to diſcover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and ſcalped, and one miſſing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</p>
                     <p>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned laſt night on diſcovering a large party of Indians on the eaſt ſide of the lake about four miles above Crown-Point. I think of ſending to feel their pulſe to-night, as I am ſure it would be of conſequences to give thoſe fellows a drubbing.</p>
                     <p>I am at a loſs to form a judgment of the deſigns of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indiſcreet to put us on our guard by ſuch a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the ſavages to come on, unleſs they had an army not far off to ſupport them.

                     <p>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was raiſed. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promiſed his people that they ſhould have the ſame bounty as the troops of the ſtate in which they were raiſed, notwithſtanding they were not part of their quota. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe has not been complied with, and they are held by a conditional agreement only, which expires this day. I ſhall be able to retain them, however, until you favour me with your anſwer.</p>
                     <p>I am making ſome improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga ſide have ſuch dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our preſent numbers hold both. I deſign, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and after defending Ticonderoga as long as poſſible retreat to Mount Independence.</p>
                     <p>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Albany.</p>

                     <p>SERJEANT HEATH, who I ſent down the Lake to make diſcoveries, returned laſt night, and informs me, that on Tueſday laſt he ſaw two birch canoes going down the Lake with ſixteen Indians and three white men in them, and ſuppoſes it was the party that had done the miſchief near the lines the day before—that, from a place near the mouth of Otter Creek, he ſaw three veſſels under ſail beating up, one at anchor about one mile above Split Rock, and the Thunderer behind it—from this place he likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried an encampment of the enemy on both ſides of Gilliland's Creek—that from the appearance of it, and the extent, he thinks it muſt contain a great body of men, and that a number of ſmoaks aroſe at a diſtance back, which he ſuppoſed was from the encampment of the Indians,—that on Friday laſt, from Pointon, he ſaw twenty batteaus come out of Gilliland's Creek, and ſail up the Lake paſt the Split Rock towards Ticonderoga—that one of the inhabitants in whom he could place confidence informed him the Indians were very numerous—that they frequently croſs to the eaſt ſide of the Lake, and that a party of them had been at his houſe a few minutes before his arrival—that he then returned to Otter-Creek, where he propoſed to have halted to refreſh his party, but on being informed that a large party of Indians were at one Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, he made the beſt of his way here—one of his party this day fell behind a little, and was either taken or deſerted; he ſuſpects the latter, becauſe he both waited for him, and ſent back to look for him—that one Webb, another inhabitant, informed him that the enemy had been four or five days at Gilliland's— that they came up with a vaſt number of batteaux and ſome gondolas—that ſome of the troops come over frequently, and ſay their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the reſt of their veſſels and ſtores, when they are to attack this place.</p>
                     <p>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their deſign is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harraſs us, and give confidence to their ſavages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by ſome regular troops. Were they in force, it is improbable they would waſte their time at ſuch a diſtance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refreſh themſelves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the eaſt ſide.</p>
                     <p>It is not eaſy to judge of the force at a diſtant view of an encampment, and Heath muſt have been ſix miles or more diſtant from that on Gilliland's Point, a diſtance too great to determine any thing with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, although he had a glaſs to aſſiſt his eye; beſides, I think the ground is not capable of encamping a great number (for he inſiſts on it they are not upon the high ground, but upon the beach only) but of this you are a much better judge than me, as I never ſaw it but once: Be the matter as it will, I ſhall endeavour to guard againſt ſurprize, and to diſcover both them and their deſigns; and, if opportunity offers, feel their pulſes a little.</p>

                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016141_0007_0F9C7A4DA6A007F0"/>I had all the ground between this and Crown-Point, from the Lake ſome diſtance over the mountains, well examined yeſterday with a heavy ſcout, but they diſcovered no enemy, nor appearance of any: Whitcomb ſays he is certain there has not been an Indian but three in that quarter ſince the priſoners were taken, and that it was three or four days ſince theſe three had been there; ſo that the Indians ſaid to have been about us, and fired at, were, I believe, the children of a diſturbed imagination.</p>
                     <p>You had an exceeding bad time to croſs the Lake, but I hope you got well over, and without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to your health, though it muſt have been expoſed, as I doubt if you were not obliged to be out a ſecond night.

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I INCLOSE you a return of the troops at this poſt, by which you will ſee that our effective numbers are very little more than two thouſand, a force greatly inadequate to its defence, which, ſhould the enemy attack it in force, would require at leaſt four times that number. In that two thouſand are included a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of artificers, who are unarmed, and many of the ſoldiers are in the ſame condition, and the whole in very great want of cloathing, accoutrements and bayonets.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence I have received of the enemy's approaching, I have from time to time tranſmitted to General Schuyler, of which I make no doubt he has appriſed Congreſs. It is now paſt a doubt that they are moving towards us, but whether in force or not I have not yet been able to diſcover. Seven of their veſſels came up to Crown-Point laſt night, and others of their fleet are about three or four miles lower down, as we judge from their morning guns. They have alſo landed ſome troops, who are encamped upon Chimney-Point, which lies on the eaſt ſide of the Lake, directly oppoſite to Crown-Point. If the militia were called in, they might poſſibly enable us to keep poſſeſſion, but I have not yet ventured upon that ſtep, on account of the low ſtate of our proviſions, there not being more than thirty-five days meat tor the troops now here, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in which we were with regard to the enemy's deſigns.</p>
                     <p>No army was ever in a more critical ſituation than we now are; and, ſuppoſing that this motion is only a feint to favour the operations of General Howe, which I ſtill ſuſpect it to be, we may, and probably will, be reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs, the ſupplies being derived from ſuch a diſtance, and the communication ſo difficult, that it is next to impoſſible to ſupport it. The extenſiveneſs of our works adds greatly to our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, and will demand ſo great conſtant guards, as muſt in a very ſhort time wear down our troops, and do the enemy's buſineſs for them; and ſhould we give up one ſide of the Lake, and confine ourſelves to the defence of the other, they would infallibly cut off our communication, and reduce us by famine.</p>
                     <p>My duty to my country, and to myſelf, obliges me to make theſe repreſentations; nevertheleſs, I ſhall leave nothing undone within my power to fruſtrate the attempts of the enemy, nor leave any means untried to penetrate their real deſigns. If I am happy enough to make any material diſcovery, I ſhall take the earlieſt opportunity to give information to Congreſs; and although I may at laſt be obliged to evacuate this place, I hope to make them pay dear enough for it, to repent of their bargain.</p>

                     <p>THIS morning ſome of the enemy's gun boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could ſee them diſembark a number of men, and the boats increaſed to eighteen, which are now lying a breaſt from the hither ſide of the point to about half way acroſs the lake. The batteaus in which they tranſported their troops are not come in ſight, lying on the far ſide of the point, under cover of it.</p>
                     <p>Soon after their landing a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, puſhed towards our lines. As we had a ſcout down the lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately ſent out two parties to ſupport and bring them off. The ſcout fell in with the enemy, and after a few ſhot, in which they ſay ſome of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, diſperſed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greateſt part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that ſome of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but it was occaſioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</p>
                     <p>My people are in the beſt diſpoſition poſſible, and I have no doubt about giving a good account of the enemy, ſhould they think proper to attack us; and if the perſon I mentioned to you in my laſt purſues the opportunity that now preſents itſelf, they will go back faſter than they came on. He has above a thouſand men.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt.</hi> That the number of troops now at this poſt and Mount Independence, which are under 2500 effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defence of both poſts.</p>
                           <p>

                              <hi>Second.</hi> That both poſts ought, nevertheleſs, to be maintained as long as poſſible, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Third.</hi> That if it ſhall become neceſſary to evacuate one or other of the poſts, and that it remains in our election which, that it ought to be the Ticonderoga ſide.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourth.</hi> That ſuch cannon and ſtores as are not immediately neceſſary on the Ticonderoga ſide be removed, without delay, to Mount Independence.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fifth.</hi> That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient; and that the repairing the old, and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be directed to repair and make the neceſſary fortifications.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sixth.</hi> That the obſtructions in the Lake to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off all ſupplies, or preventing a retreat, if ſuch a meaſure ſhould unhappily become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, ought to be compleated with all imaginable diſpatch.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventh.</hi>That ſo much remains to be done effectually to compleat the obſtruction, that with the few troops we have, there is no great probability that it can be done in leſs than ſix weeks.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eighth.</hi> That although our force may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unleſs a ſufficient ſtock of proviſion can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days proviſion of meat kind, we think it would be imprudent to expoſe the army to be made priſoners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prudent to provide for a retreat, to effectuate which, that all the batteaus now at this poſt be immediately repaired, and as many as can be ſpared out of the Lake George be brought hither.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ninth.</hi> That a quantity of proviſion of the meat kind ſhould, if poſſible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or elſe-where.</p>

                              <hi>Tenth.</hi> That immediate application be made to his Excellency General Waſhington for a reinforcement to be ſent on with all expedition.</p>

                           <p>GENERAL ST. CLAIR repreſented to the Council, that as there is every reaſon to believe that the batteries of the enemy are ready to open upon the Ticonderoga ſide, and that the camp is very much expoſed to their fire, and to be enfiladed on all quarters; and as there is alſo reaſon to expect an attack upon Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and Mount Independence at the ſame time, in which caſe neither could draw any ſupport from the other; he deſired their opinion, whether it would be moſt proper to remove the tents to the low ground, where they would be leſs expoſed, and wait the attack at the Ticonderoga lines, or whether the whole of the troops ſhould be drawn over to Mount Independence, the more effectually to provide for the defence of that poſt. At the ſame time the General begged leave to inform them, that the whole of our force conſiſted of 2089 effectives, rank and file, including 124 artificers unarmed, beſides the corps of artillery, and about 900 militia who have joined us, and cannot ſtay but a few days.</p>
                           <p>The Council were unanimouſly of opinion, that it is impoſſible with our force to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and ſtores, ſhould be removed this night, if poſſible, to Mount Independence.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016141_0011_0F9C7A4CE6FD3380"/>
                              <hi>Second.</hi> Whether, after the diviſion of the army at Ticonderoga have retreated to Mount Independence, we ſhall be in a ſituation to defend that poſt; or, in caſe it cannot be defended, if a retreat into the country will be practicable.</p>
                           <p>The Council are unanimouſly of opinion, that, as the enemy have already nearly ſurrounded us, and there remains nothing more to inveſt us compleatly but their occupying the neck of land betwixt the Lake and the Eaſt Creek, which is not more than three quarters of a mile over, and poſſeſſing themſelves of the Narrows betwixt and Skeenſborough, and thereby cutting off all communication with the country, a retreat ought to be undertaken as ſoon as poſſible, and that we ſhall be very fortunate to effect it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Mr. Avery, Deputy Commiſſary General in the Northern Department, being ſworn,</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity of proviſion was at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence the 13th of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot particularly aſcertain the quantity of proviſion, as I had no particular return at that time, but to the beſt of my recollection General St. Clair wrote me the 15th or 16th of June, that there was ſeven weeks proviſion on hand at Ticonderoga, Mount Independence and its dependencies.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What was the general purport of my letter to you?</p>
               <p>A. The general purport was informing me that there was ſuch a quantity of proviſion there. That you thought it too ſmall a quantity; and if I did not forward on more, you would leave me to judge what the conſequence would be to myſelf.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you receive a letter from General Schuyler about the ſame time, and upon the ſame ſubject?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the purport?</p>
               <p>A. Much the ſame as your's was; complaining of the quantity of proviſion at that poſt being too ſmall, and urging an immediate ſupply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Yancey, who ſuperintended the Iſſuing Commiſſary's Department at Ticonderoga and Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, being ſworn,</p>
               <p>Q. Were any ſupplies of proviſion received at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence between the 20th of June and 6th of July, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. I left Ticonderoga the 21ſt of June in order to purchaſe cattle. I purchaſed myſelf twenty-one cattle, and ſent forward to Ticonderoga twenty of them. The other I ſent forward, with thirty oxen and ſteers delivered me by Mr. Avery's order, all to Ticonderoga. There were a few cattle alſo ſent on in company with theſe for the hoſpital. I do not know their number. The firſt was ſent on the 26th of June; the place from where they were ſent was called Paulett. The next was the 27th of June, place called Mancheſter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether theſe cattle arrived at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. Not from my own knowledge. I underſtood that one, two or three of the cattle were made uſe of by Colonel Warner, who took them under his care to drive them into Ticonderoga, and I underſtood that they arrived there, but only from information.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What quantity of proviſion was iſſued the 20th of June as a ration?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, at preſent, exactly know what quantity was iſſued as a ration at that time. The artificers received one ration and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What quantity of proviſion was daily iſſued by the General's orders, and to the general hoſpital?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know. The general hoſpital was ſometimes ſupplied by my magazine, but not ſteadily. The general officers and their families, and ſeveral of the field and ſome other officers, drew what they pleaſed on account.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Where could the general hoſpital have been ſupplied with proviſion, unleſs it was from your magazine?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know from any place with reſpect to freſh proviſion, unleſs they ſent out and purchaſed it. The ſalt proviſion and flour could be got from me only.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was there any country in the neighbourhood from which they could have been ſupplied?</p>
               <p>A. None nearer than the Hampſhire Grants.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. When you made the return of the 20th of June, did you count the barrels of proviſion yourſelf, or did you make up your return from the returns made to you?</p>
               <p>A. I did not count the barrels of proviſion. I made the return from the entries of my peoples receipts and deliveries.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. When did the book of accounts commence from which you made your return?</p>
               <p>A. I believe the firſt of December<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1776.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Had there not been, from time to time, a conſiderable quantity of proviſion condemned at this poſt?</p>
               <p>A. I ſent ſome packers to Ticonderoga in March, 1777, to repack the proviſion. They returned to me I think in April, and I ſaw when I got up to Ticonderoga an account of damaged proviſion amongſt my papers, amounting to about twenty-eight barrels of beef or pork, but I am pretty confident the twenty-eight barrels of beef or pork were not included in the general return of the 20th of June, but I cannot undertake to ſay there was no damaged proviſion amongſt the quantity mentioned in the return of the 20th of June.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you know, when you were ſent to purchase freſh proviſion, of any magazine of ſalt proviſion in the vicinity of Ticonderoga, from which you could have ſupplied that garriſon?</p>
               <p>A. I knew of ſalt proviſion having been carried forward from Bennington and William's-Town to St. Coack, but I do not know the quantity.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Mr. Avery. Did you order ſalt proviſion from St. Coack or Stillwater to Albany?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016141_0012_0F9C7A50A42382B8"/>A. I ordered a ſmall quantity from Stillwater, the magazine at Albany being empty of ſalt proviſion at the time. It was ſome time in the month of June, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Queſtion to Mr. Avery. How long did the magazine at Albany remain empty, and did any ſupply of proviſion arrive between that time and the 6th of July?</p>
               <p>A. There was ſome proviſion arrived at Albany, but what quantity I cannot tell, but not much more than was ſufficient for the ſupply of the troops that were there.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Mr. Avery. Did you write to General Schuyler, that you were deceived by your Purchaſing Commiſſaries?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember that I did; but I do not know but I might have wrote to General Schuyler that they had not collected the quantity that I expected.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow, nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>Mr. Leavenworth, being ſworn, ſays: I arrived at Ticonderoga the 9th of March, and tarried there until the retreat. About three weeks before the retreat, as near as I can remember, it was reported that the enemy were at Split Rock, and I heard guns ſome days that were ſaid to be their evening and morning guns. I alſo heard General St. Clair give out he thought that the enemy were between ſix and ſeven thouſand ſtrong. On the 26th of June I made report to General St. Clair of the tallow in my poſſeſſion, the quantity being great. He ſaid he would give directions about it, and ſaid alſo that the Commiſſary ought to have taken care of it, and had it worked up. General St. Clair took occaſion to mention that the Commiſſary had not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected his duty in that inſtance, but alſo had neglected it in not ſending on the ſupplies of proviſion. I did not hear any thing more about it, and on Wedneſday before the retreat I went to General St. Clair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it, who ſaid it was the Commiſſary's buſineſs, and he ought to have taken care of it, and blamed him again on account of proviſion, and ſaid there were but a few days proviſion. I told him I thought there was more. All the proviſion had been removed from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence, and on Thurſday or Friday I went to Mount Independence to ſatisfy myſelf reſpecting the quantity of proviſion there, and I think there were full three thouſand barrels of beef, pork and flour there, from the appearance of them. I did not count them. This was a larger quantity than appeared to be there on the twenty-ſixth of June. On Wedneſday before the retreat I was at Head-Quarters, and obſerved it was entirely ſtripped of the baggage, and in conſequence of it I put my baggage in a boat, and ſent it to Mount Independence. Having received no orders about the tallow, I deſired ſome gentlemen to ſpeak to the General about it, and on Saturday morning the enemy made their appearance on Mount Defiance, when, talking to ſome gentlemen reſpecting the tallow, one of them ſaid I had done enough to exculpate myſelf reſpecting it, and gave me to underſtand that we were to retreat that evening, and told me not to let it be known by words or actions, and told me not to regulate my conduct by it ſo that it might be known. It was General Poor who told me of it. On Saturday evening, at gun firing, I went into my boat with my people, and went to the ſouth-weſt point of Mount Independence, and I continued in my boat and on the point of Mount Independence all night. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eleven and twelve o'clock at night, one Serjeant Bond came down, who told me that he came down to ſee what boats were there. That between twelve and one o'clock, a party of men came down to the Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, and took the boats up to the Crane, as they ſaid, to load with proviſion, and at day light began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and I went off with my boat in company with the firſt boats. The cannon began to be removed (when General Schuyler was preſent) from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence, and continued to be removed after General Schuyler's departure, as were quantities of artillery ſtores.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016141_0013_0F9C7A516462CDD8"/>Q. Did any quantity of proviſion arrive at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence from the 20th of June to the time of the evacuation, either from Fort George or Skeenſborough!</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any number of cattle arrive at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence between the 20th of June and the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I ſaw cattle that Colonel Warner ſaid he brought in with him. I thought I ſaw (from the idea I now have) about forty head.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any parties ſent out to annoy the enemy, by order from General St. Clair, in their advance againſt, and inveſtiture of, the poſts under his ca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, to your knowledge?</p>
               <p>A. The enemy came to Three Mile Point, and I have ſeen parties go out of about twenty men in a party. I know of none ſent out to oppoſe the enemy's progreſs.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What kind of ground was it between Three Mile-Point and Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I have not been over the whole of the ground, but over part of it; there are ſome cleared fields next to the Lake, and woods back. This is all the deſcription I can give of the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the troops under General St. Clair healthy, courageous, and deſirous of improving every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What reaſon had you to think the troops were healthy, courageous, and deſirous of improving every advantage againſt the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. In the firſt place, with regard to their being healthy, I had occaſion to be at the hoſpital ſeveral times after the enemy came near to us, and I did not ſee many ſick there, and it was generally reported that the army was healthy. After I was apprehenſive that we were to retreat, I took pains to enquire of a number of officers of my acquaintance, indirectly, whether the troops were courageous, and determined to fight, ſhould the enemy come on, and they all anſwered in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was it your opinion, and the opinion of the officers you indirectly aſked whether the troops were courageous and determined to fight, that the place was defenſible?</p>
               <p>A. I did not aſk any of the officers whether the place was defenſible. It was my own opinion that the place was not defenſible in the circumſtances it then was.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What do you mean by the circumſtances it was then in?</p>
               <p>A. In the firſt place, the lines were very extenſive, ſo that there were not men enough on the ground to man them: Another circumſtance was, the enemy had got poſſeſſion of the heights about us: Another was, the heavy cannon, artillery ſtores, and all the proviſion, were removed from Ticonderoga to Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and the reaſon why Mount Independence could not be defended was, that there were not works thrown up ſuitable to cover the men. Great part of the proviſion that was carried over to the Mount was, at the time of the retreat, at the foot of the Crane. The diſtance from the place the proviſion lay, to the top of the Mount, was about two hundred feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done at Mount Independence between the 20th of June and the 6th of July, 1777, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repairing the old works there, and adding new works?</p>
               <p>A. I was not at the ſouth end of Mount Independence, but I heard there were ſome ſmall works flung up there. The north end of Mount Independence appeared to me as uſual on the Thurſday or Friday preceding the evacuation. I ſaw no new fortifications on it, nor any additional works. I know there were no new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications where I expected there would have been ſome built.</p>
               <p>Q. Did General St. Clair ſend his ſon and baggage to Fort George, as a place of ſafety, before his evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know that he did of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the ſick, the public ſtores of ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing left behind, when the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated?</p>
               <p>A. Some of the ſick were carried off, which I ſaw. I know nothing reſpecting the other particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you heard General St. Clair give out that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 ſtrong?</p>
               <p>A. It was ſaid by General St. Clair while the enemy lay at Split Rock. I believe about a fortnight before the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Would the proviſion be (lying at the foot of the Crane) under the enemy's fire, after Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga ſhould be in their hands?</p>
               <p>A. They were within cannon ſhot of Ticonderoga, and the enemy muſt have commanded the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were there not parties conſtantly at work, getting up the proviſion from the bottom to the top of the Mount?</p>
               <p>A. There was a party at work when I went to ſee what proviſion was there, and I ſuppoſe there was a party conſtantly at work. It was reported ſo.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. At what time of the day was it on Saturday that General Poor gave you the information of the evacuation being likely to take place?</p>
               <p>A. It was in the morning before breakfaſt. I don't know the time of the day. I took it General Poor was going to Head-Quarters.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What quantity of tallow had you in your poſſeſſion?</p>
               <p>A. One hundred and fifty-four barrels. If I remember right, there were 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 345 lbs.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Had you ever made any report of the tallow to me before the 26th of June?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. You have mentioned ſeveral times that I gave out that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 ſtrong. I ſhould be glad to know whether it was to you I told it, or how you came to be acquainted with it?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect the circumſtances but at one time; that was on the day it was ſaid the ſcout returned from Split Rock. I was at Head-Quarters, and I heard you obſerve to ſeveral officers who were there, that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 ſtrong.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the company who were there?</p>
               <p>A. I can't recollect any perſon particular, but I think General Patterſon was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016141_0014_0F9C7A522430E098"/>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you ever hear me ſay that the enemy were lying at Split Rock, to the amount of any number of troops?</p>
               <p>A. You did not ſay that the enemy lay at Split Rock, but that they conſiſted of about the number before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know of any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> between any of the parties from Ticonderoga and the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I heard of ſome people being killed and ſcalped between the breaſt-work and Ticonderoga landing, and I think there was a ſcalp brought in by ſome of Whitcomb's people.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know of any larger parties than twenty men being ſent out?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect any.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. You have mentioned Head-Quarters being ſtripped of baggage. I ſhould be glad to know what kind of baggage you obſerved had been removed from thence?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect particular things.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What kind of baggage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had you ever obſerved there?</p>
               <p>A. I had obſerved utenſils, ſuch as drinking glaſſes, one chair, a table and a vallefe; but all the utenſils I ſaw in the room at this time was one bowl, except a table and ſtools.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you ever ſee any thing removed from Head-Quarters?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſay abſolutely that I did.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know whether there were parties employed in forming an abbitis about Mount Independence, at any time between the 20th of June and the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you ever ſee parties of axe-men ſent over there?</p>
               <p>A. I ſaw parties of axe-men go off the parade often, but I did not know where they went, nor did I aſk them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know whether the parties of axe-men you ſaw go off the parade were employed on the Ticonderoga ſide?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Mr. Yancey. Did you ever report to me that there was an ounce of tallow at Ticonderoga, or did it appear in any return of your's?</p>
               <p>A. I don't believe that I ever told you any thing about it, or made any return to you of it.</p>

               <p>The Court met at Captain Rathburn's, in King's-ſtreet, according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair admits that he wrote a letter to the Hon. John Jay, dated July 25th, 1777, in which there was a ſentiment, in ſubſtance, that if the General Officers had been againſt the evacuation of the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, it would have taken place, as he knew it would be impoſſible to defend the poſts with his numbers.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Hale being ſworn,</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence when the evacuation of thoſe poſts took place?</p>
               <p>A. I was on Mount Independence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you command a regiment?</p>
               <p>A. I was Lieutenant Colonel of Colonel Leonard's regiment of Maſſachuſetts militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the time of ſervice of this regiment nearly expired when the evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence took place?</p>
               <p>A. It was nearly expired, as they viewed it, and I think within two or three days from the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the terms, as they viewed it?</p>
               <p>A. I mean the men viewed their time of ſervice to have commenced from the time they were raiſed, and the time they drew pay from. They, I underſtood, founded this belief from the order of the Brigadier, which was that they were raiſed for two months ſervice; which, when I ſhewed General St. Clair, he ſaid it was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the order of the Court. The order of the Court was, that they ſhould ſerve two months from the time of their being on the ground, to the beſt of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform General St. Clair that the men viewed their time of ſervice to be nearly expired, and when it took place were determined to go home?</p>
               <p>A. After I had heard ſomething ſaid among the people that they viewed their time of ſervice as nearly out, and it was talked among them if they ſtaid they ſhould get no pay, I ſpoke to them that the enemy were near, and that was the only time, if they came to do any thing, that it was to be done. I alſo ſpoke to ſome of the officers, with regard to the time of ſervice being nearly out, and told them I would inform the General of the circumſtances. After this, on Saturday preceding the evacuation, I waited on General St. Clair, to let him know what the regiment thought reſpecting theſe matters, and invited Lieut. Colonel May, the Colonel of the other Maſſachuſetts regiment, to go with me. We went, and I informed General St. Clair of the circumſtances I have related, and told him their uneaſineſs with reſpect to drawing their money on the ground; who told me, that if they made up their rolls their money was ready for them. Lieutenant Colonel May and myſelf ſhewed the General the Brigadier's order, and the General ſaid it was different from the order of the Court. The men alſo made an excuſe that they had not been invited to ſtay. When we informed General St. Clair of the circumſtances, he ſaid the men muſt not go away by any means if they were diſpoſed to go, and told me to write a certificate of the matter, and ſaid perhaps I ſhall give them a ſmall bounty, and ſaid your certificate will juſtify me for ſo doing. The General ſaid he would let the matter reſt till morning and think on it, and would ſend word to me in the morning what propoſals to make to the regiment. I went and told the officers of it that night, who appeared to be well ſatisfied. It was near night when we parted from the General.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016141_0015_0F9C7A52E4B1FB60"/>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you not recollect your mentioning to me, or Lieutenant Colonel May, that the men conſidered their time nearly out, and were determined to go home when it was out, and ſuggeſted to me that probably a ſmall bounty might induce them to ſtay?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What do you conceive the men underſtood by their ſaying that they were not invited to ſtay?</p>
               <p>A. Upon ſome of the men ſaying that their times were nearly out, I told them they muſt ſtay longer if there was an occaſion for it. They ſaid they had not been invited to ſtay, and ſuppoſed, if they ſtaid, they ſhould get no pay for it. I conſidered it only as an excuſe of theirs, that they ſhould not get pay if they ſtaid after their time was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Had you ever before the Saturday informed General St. Clair of the mens opinion of the ſhort time they had to ſtay?</p>
               <p>A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What was your inducement for going to the General that day?</p>
               <p>A. Upon hearing what I have before related amongſt the men, that they conſidered their time of ſervice as nearly out, and that ſome of them talked of going home, and to remove all uneaſineſs about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What Reaſons have you to ſuppoſe the men would have ſtaid, had General St. Clair given them an invitation?</p>
               <p>A. The converſation I had with them induced me to think ſo.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were you at Caſtle-Town the day after the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did not both your's and Colonel May's regiment determine to leave the army that day?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were you preſent when I had the two militia regiments drawn up, and ſpoke to them on that ſubject?</p>
               <p>A. No; but I knew that you were ſpeaking to one of the regiments. I was at a diſtance, and ſaw a parade of men, and you amongſt them. The regiments were intermixed, and ſome of my men likely were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Did you know at the time what General St. Clair ſaid to them?</p>
               <p>A. I was unwell at a diſtance at the time, and did not know, but I underſtood afterwards, but don't know from whom, that he was ſaying ſomething to them about keeping with the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. When did the regiments leave the army?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was the fourth day at Mancheſter.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Did the regiments go off by order?</p>
               <p>A. We were marching rather in diſorder, when General St. Clair aſked me whether I commanded that regiment? I told him I did, part of them; and he ſaid, By God, I wiſh you would embody them, and march them home.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did I not, in the courſe of the march, frequently complain of the diſorder of the two regiments, and reprove them for it?</p>
               <p>A. Not in my hearing?</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were they not diſorderly on the march?</p>
               <p>A. They did not keep rank and file.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you remember of Colonel May's having reported to me that the men were willing to ſtay, but the officers were not?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did your regiment keep their ſtation that was aſſigned them in the line of march?</p>
               <p>A. I know of no ſtation that was aſſigned them but one day: Whether they kept it that day or not I don't remember.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did not your regiment break the line of march, and were you not halted by General Poor juſt after leaving the picketted fort, who ſaid he would turn out a party of men, and order them to fire upon them?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the regiment Colonel May belonged to in the ſame ſituation with reſpect to the opinion of the men, that their time of ſervice was nearly expired, as your's was?</p>
               <p>A. Much the ſame.</p>
               <p>Q. When Colonel May went with you to General St. Clair, did he inform him that his men viewed their time of ſervice nearly expired, and were determined to go as ſoon as it was expired?</p>
               <p>A. We related what I have before mentioned.</p>

               <p>Major General Gates being ſworn, ſays, Some time in April, in the year 1777, I made a requiſition from Congreſs for the defence of the Northern Department, and eſtimated the troops neceſſary for that ſervice as follows: Two Major Generals; ſix Brigadiers; one battalion of artillery, 600; twenty-five battalions of infantry, 12,500; two companies of rangers, 100; ſtaff, batteau-men, &amp;c. 400; total 13,600. At that time I did not expect General Burgoyne would have landed between 10 and 11,000 men. If I had, I ſhould have required more men for the defence of that department.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. During the time I had the honour of ſerving under you, did you ever diſcover in me cowardice, treachery, or incapacity as a general officer?</p>
               <p>A. From my long acquaintance with you as an officer, and particularly your uſefulneſs to me as a Brigadier General in the campaign of 1776, it excites my aſtoniſhment that there ſhould be ſuch charges as cowardice, treachery, or incapacity, exhibited againſt you. From any knowledge of you, both as an officer and a gentleman, I have the higheſt opinion of your courage, honour, capacity and fidelity.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion of theſe troops ought to be at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. At Fort Schuyler, 500. The intermediate poſts between Albany and Fort Schuyler incluſive, 500. The poſts between Albany and Fort George incluſive, 600. At Fort Ann and Skeenſborough, 300. The remainder at Ticonderoga and its dependencies. Beſides theſe, I expected aid from the Militia of the country, having unlimited powers from Congreſs for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What number of men would you have thought neceſſary, had you been fully poſſeſſed of the force of General Burgoyne?</p>
               <p>A. Three to two.</p>
               <p>Dr. Brown being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were the ſick removed from the hoſpital at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. All except four, whom it was unſafe to remove, as there was a chance of their recovery by remaining, and if they were removed, it was my opinion they would not have ſurvived to have reached Skeenſborough.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was any part of the medicines and hoſpital ſtores removed?</p>
               <p>A. A day or two days before the communication was cut off with Fort George, all were removed, except what was wanted for an immediate ſupply, which were all ſaved.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was any part of what was left at Ticonderoga ſent off?</p>
               <p>A. There was; but I cannot ſay what proportion was ſaved. There was an officer and fifty men given us, and boats ſufficient, and had they done their duty, it is my opinion we could have ſaved all the medicines and ſtores.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. How long before the evacuation took place were the ſick ſent off?</p>
               <p>A. There were a number of ſick ſent off ſome days before the evacuation took place; about the time the enemy appeared at Three Mile Point: The reſt, except the four, were removed at the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know whether there was a magazine of flour appropriated for the uſe of the hoſpital, ſeparate from the general magazine?</p>
               <p>A. I believe there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any proviſion arrive for the hoſpital, particularly, ſome days before the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. There were ſome ſheep, beeves and milch cows. I do not recollect the number.</p>
               <p>Q. In what ſituation was the army at the time of the evacuation, with reſpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. There were very few in the hoſpital, not above 100; a great proportion of them wounded. There were a number in the regiments not fit for duty, on account of the meaſles, and the conſequences of that diſorder, which had prevailed much; but not proper objects for the general hoſpital.</p>
               <p>Dr. Townſhend being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were the ſick removed from the hoſpital at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. All that could be removed with any degree of ſafety to themſelves.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was any part of the medicines and hoſpital ſtores removed?</p>
               <p>A. A day or two before, to the beſt of my remembrance, the communication with Fort George was cloſed, there was a large proportion carried over to the ſtore there, and only what was judged ſufficient was left for thoſe that remained on the ground.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was any part of what was left at Ticonderoga ſent off?</p>
               <p>A. Yes. Early in the evening, about dark, preceding the evacuation, we had a number of men ſent to carry the ſtores down to the landing on the ſouth ſide of Mount Independence. They worked very induſtriouſly the firſt of the evening, and packed nearly the whole, and the chief of them was carried to the landing, myſelf aſſiſting; but the men, when they found the place was to be evacuated, deſerted us. We got the greater part into the boats, and went off to Skeenſborough in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. How long before the evacuation took place were the ſick ſent off?</p>
               <p>A. About the time the medicines were ſent off to Fort George. The ſick, that were not likely to recover in a few days, that could be ſent off without injuring them by tranſportation, were ſent to the hoſpital at Fort George.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know whether there was a magazine of flour appropriated for the uſe of the hoſpital, ſeparate from the general magazine?</p>
               <p>A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what ſituation was the army at the time of the evacuation, with reſpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. The army was healthy, except with reſpect to the meaſles, which had prevailed very generally through the camp. They had recovered of the meaſles at the time of the evacuation, but they had left many of them languid with coughs.</p>
               <p>Q. What ſituation was the army in a few days previous to the evacuation, with reſpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. Much in the ſame ſituation as they were at the time of the evacuation, except a number more had the meaſles then than had at the time of the evacuation. I examined a number of regiments a little before the evacuation particularly, and there were in general between thirty and forty unfit for duty, but not fit objects for the general hoſpital.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:016141_0017_0F9C7A54A3482678"/>
Queſtion to Dr. Brown. What ſituation was the army in a few days previous to the evacuation, with reſpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. I believe they were not quite ſo healthy as at the time of the evacuation, and not ſo many fit for duty, as they were recovering daily from the meaſles and its effects. I examined the regiments myſelf a few days before the evacuation, and the preſcriptions of the ſurgeons, and found but very few but had from twenty to thirty unfit for duty. Some had more.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Dr. Brown. Were not the hoſpital ſurgeons frequently required to inſpect into the ſtate of the ſick in each regiment, and was it not done with a view that I might not be impoſed on by the regimental returns?</p>
               <p>A. They were deſired to do it frequently, and I have ſome idea of ſome converſation paſſing between Dr. Potts and myſelf about the intention of doing it, but I do not recollect the particulars of it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Dr. Townſhend. The ſame as the laſt to Dr. Brown.</p>
               <p>A. We were directed to do it frequently, and there was ſcarcely a day paſſed but ſome of the regiments were examined by ſome of the ſurgeons of the general hoſpital.</p>
               <p>Colonel Hay, who acted as Deputy Quarter-Maſter General for the army at Ticonderoga and Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, being ſworn, ſays: On Saturday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the day preceding the evacuation, I was ſent for by General St. Clair, who informed me that a Council of General Officers had been held, and they had determined to evacuate the garriſon next morning. I then took the liberty of aſking the General if he had received orders from General Schuyler? He told me he had not. To which I took the liberty of ſaying I was extremely ſorry for it. The General ſaid he knew very well what I meant, and he had ſeriouſly conſidered the conſequences of the ſtep he was taking. If he remained there, he would ſave his character and loſe the army; if he went off, he would ſave the army and loſe his character; the laſt of which he was determined to ſacrifice to the cauſe in which he was engaged. The General then deſired me to prepare every thing for the removal of as many of the ſtores as poſſible. I then told the General, that as the wind blowed hard from the north-eaſt, and the batteaus were lying at the ſouth end of Mount Independence, it would be impoſſible to get them round to remove the greateſt part of the ſtores. The General ſaid it muſt at all events be attempted; for if the enemy knew of our deſign to evacuate the place, they would certainly cut off our retreat; but, on further conſideration, ſaid he would take the opinion of the General Officers, and let me know the reſult. In the mean time, that I was to prepare every thing poſſible for carrying off the ſtores, which I did as far as the wind, which roſe much higher, would permit. I ſaw the General afterwards at ſunſet, who told me that Generals Poor and Patterſon were of opinion the evacuation ought not to be retarded. What few boats were near Ticonderoga ſide were then given to the artillery men, and the moſt valuable ſtores on that ſide carried down to the wharff on that ſide. About nine the General ſent for me again, and having aſked what I had done, deſired me to go as ſoon as poſſible to Mount Independence, order as many boats as could be brought from the ſouth ſide of the Mount to bring off the proviſions that were lying near the Crane, leaving a proper proportion for the medicines, ammunition, and other moſt valuable ſtores, which were to be carried down to the ſouth ſide. About, I think, one o'clock, I ſaw the General again on Mount Independence, who begged that we would make all the diſpatch poſſible, and carry off all that we could in boats by day light. I then went down to where the proviſion laid, and got a very conſiderable number of boats loaded, which at break of day were taken round to the ſouth end of the Mount by the General's order. When I got there I found the ſoldiers in the utmoſt confuſion, and could not by threats or promiſes prevail on them to unload from the waggon, and embark on board the boats the moſt valuable part of the General's baggage. Nearly about ſun-riſe the General himſelf came up, and begged, if poſſible, I would ſave his papers, and pay no attention to the reſt of his baggage I ſpoke to Colonel Long, who, I underſtood afterwards had received orders from the General, was to command by water, and went off himſelf after the army that had marched ſome ſhort time before. Some days before the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being at Head Quarters after dinner, there were three field officers there (I think Colonels, but am not certain) who had lately arrived with a ſtrong reinforcement of militia. Being aſked by the General what time they could poſſibly ſtay? they replied, it would be impoſſible to detain them but a very few days, as they had not a ſecond ſhirt to their backs, having firſt turned out with no other view than driving a party of the enemy from Otter-Creek. I went off by water.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair produces a return made to him by Colonel Hay, which Colonel Hay acknowledges was made by him to General St. Clair, and which Colonel Hay thinks muſt have been made by him about the 21ſt of June, 1777; which, being read, is as follows:</p>

               <p>UDREY HAY, D. Q. M. G.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know whether the men, returned by you as conſtant fatigue-men, were not included in the daily details for fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. I am certain they were not included in the daily details for fatigue, being appropriated entirely to my department, and under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the greater part of the proviſion and ſtores were got off from the garriſon?</p>
               <p>A. The greater part of the proviſion, I am certain, was not. I cannot anſwer with reſpect to the ſtores, as when we arrived at Skeenſborough I had no time to examine them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the body of the militia that arrived ſome days before the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the number.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know of more than one body of militia arriving?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was there a ſufficient number of boats at the poſt to carry off all the proviſion?</p>
               <p>A. There was not a ſufficient number to have carried off the proviſion and the other ſtores.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many ox-teams were employed at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence at the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell, having loſt all my returns; but the number was not large, as in that wilderneſs there was not graſs to maintain them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. In what condition were the ox-teams that were employed at theſe poſts?</p>
               <p>A. The oxen were in poor working order, but might probably have brought the proviſion from the landing, had they no other garriſon duty to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know of any parties having been ſent out by General St. Clair to diſcover the enemy's numbers, or to annoy them in their progreſs againſt the garriſon?</p>
               <p>A. To diſcover their numbers, I know of parties having been frequently ſent out, and the General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained they were in ſuch dread of the ſavages, he could not get proper intelligence from them. I know of none ſent out to annoy the enemy in their progreſs, but the regular pickets that were ſent out.</p>
               <p>Q. How large were theſe parties that were ſent out to diſcover the enemy's numbers?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot anſwer with any exactneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:016141_0019_0F9C7A55E60CB130"/>Q. Court. Do you know whether the troops were courageous, and had a deſire to improve every advantage againſt the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. Their own words, and the facts which aroſe when they were ſent out, were ſo very different, that it was difficult to judge, as they were generally beat back again.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn till to-morrow, nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn, by his Excellency's deſire, until Thurſday next, at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn, by his Excellency's deſire, until Monday, nine o'clock, to meet in camp.</p>

               <p>Colonel Koſeiuſzko being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect what the ſtrength of the fatigue parties was, that were employed on Mount Independence on or about the 23d day of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. About five or ſix hundred men were employed on the batteries at Mount Independence as fatigue men, after General Schuyler had been at Ticonderoga, and had given directions to put new works on Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. There was alſo a party employed in front of the works, in a thick wood, cutting abbatis; I do not recollect the number. I remember that General Fermoy's brigade was employed in the wood cutting abbatis. General Fermoy himſelf was there two or three days. Beſides theſe, I always ſent a fatigue party to cut the abbatis.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know whether there was a fatigue party likewiſe employed at the time on the Ticonderoga ſide?</p>
               <p>A. I know there was a fatigue party employed on the breaſt-work.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you not, by my orders, make ſome additions to the works on the Ticonderoga ſide?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; between the weſt end of the French lines and the Lake. It was not quite finiſhed at the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Suppoſing Ticonderoga to have been abandoned, and the enemy to have been in poſſeſſion of it, would it have been poſſible to have maintained the works on the point of Mount Independence, that were made for the command of the Lake and the defence of the bridge?</p>
               <p>A. No; as the ground overlooked them about fifty feet.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect where the place from which we got our water was, on Mount Independence ſide, and the ſituation of it?</p>
               <p>A. On the weſt ſide of Mount Independence, on the low ground, near the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Could we eaſily get at the water?</p>
               <p>A. No; It was very ſteep, and I think about one half a mile diſtant from the fort.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Suppoſing the enemy had paſſed ſome of their veſſels into South-Bay, would it not have been wholly in their power to have cut us off from the water?</p>
               <p>A. The ſpring would have been expoſed to the fire of the enemy.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the diſtance from the Lake to Eaſt-Creek, beyond the ſouth end of Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. About one half a mile or three quarters.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Would it not have been in the enemy's power to have annoyed, from the veſſels from South-Bay, any troops that might have been marching acroſs the Iſthmus to the relief of Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. It would have been in the enemy's power to have done it on account of the paſſage being narrow, a thick wood, and the poſſeſſion of the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect whether any works were begun to improve the redoubt on the high ground, on the point of Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; by your order I marked out the lines, and prepared the faſcines; which was after General Schuyler left Ticonderoga.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. In what condition was the fort upon Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. It was a picketted fort, only for ſmall arms. Picketted all round, ſome good and ſome bad.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. How many men could the fort contain with convenience for the defence of it?</p>
               <p>A. About 1000 men.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What batteries had the enemy erected againſt Ticonderoga at the time, or before the evacuation took place?</p>
               <p>A. One battery was erected againſt the Jerſey redoubt on the oppoſite ſide of the Lake, about half a mile diſtant, and on higher ground. They had made ſome works where they had an encampment againſt the French lines, about half a mile or three quarters diſtant. The enemy had alſo taken poſſeſſion of Mount Hope, a retrenched camp, which had been occupied by us the campaign before, by which the communication with Lake George was cut off. They had taken poſſeſſion of the mill, burnt the block-houſe, and paſſed on the other ſide of the creek, where they took poſſeſſion of a hill which commanded all Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and had begun a firing on the ſloop that was ſtationed for the defence of the paſſage from Lake George. They had alſo begun ſome works on a point on the eaſt ſide of the Lake, oppoſite to the bridge.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect Colonel May's having told me, after I had ſpoke to the militia at Caſtle-Town, that the men would ſtay, but the officers would not?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect Colonel May's having told you of it, but I met ſome of the militia on the retreat, and having expreſſed my ſurprize at their not ſtaying to fight for their country, they anſwered, they were willing to ſtay, but their officers would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Could the enemy's veſſels lie in South-Bay, in a ſituation to command the ſpring, and not be expoſed to our batteries on Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. There was high ground, and batteries could have been placed there to prevent them.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Could the enemy's ſhips lie in South-Bay, in a ſituation moſt to annoy a reinforcement going to Mount Independence, without being expoſed to the fire of our batteries from Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. They could.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:016141_0020_0F9C7A56A65C7710"/>Q. Court. Was there any other ſpring on Mount Independence, out of the enemy's fire, that the garriſon could have been ſupplied with water from?</p>
               <p>A. No other laſting one.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What kind of ground was it on the height on Mount Independence. Whether ſtony, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of raiſing a parapet on. or of ſinking a ditch?</p>
               <p>A. Very ſtony and rocky ground, and would require a great deal of labour to put on the works. A ditch could not be ſunk to any proper depth without blowing the rocks.</p>
               <p>Brigadier General Wilkinſon being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Do you recollect what means were taken by me to gain intelligence of the approach of the enemy, and their numbers?</p>
               <p>A. By ſcouts and detachments, both by land and by water.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Were not there ſcouts and detachments ſent out frequently?</p>
               <p>A. There was an eſtabliſhed daily ſcout, as well as I recollect, beſides many that were ſent out occaſionally.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Do you recollect the diſtance from Ticonderoga to Gilliland's Creek?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot aſcertain the diſtance.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Do you recollect the nature of the ground between Ticonderoga and Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liland's Creek?</p>
               <p>A. I can judge of it only from obſervation as I paſſed up and down the Lake. On the weſt ſide it is a mountainous craggy country, the mountains in many places jutting in full upon the Lake. On the eaſt ſide a flat low country covered with wood.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Could large detachments of troops, had our garriſon been in a ſituation to have afforded them, march through that country on the weſt ſide of the Lake?</p>
               <p>A. Not without great difficulty and probable loſs, on either ſide of the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Was there not, notwithſtanding the difficulty of the country, frequently ſmall parties ſent out towards Gilliland's Creek, to diſcover the approach and ſtrength of the enemy, and were there not parties ſent out on the eaſt ſide of the Lake with the ſame view?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. If large detachments had been ſent out at ſuch a diſtance that they could not have been ſupported with the whole force of the garriſon, could they have retarded the progreſs of the enemy, or muſt they not have fallen into their hands?</p>
               <p>A. They might have given a momentary check, but muſt inevitably have been out off.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Do you recollect my ſending out ſerjeant Heath, with a party, previous to any account we had of the embarkation of the enemy on the Lake, with orders to proceed to Point au-Fer, or whenever he ſhould find the enemy, endeavour to make a priſoner, and bring me an account of them?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect the officer's name, but I recollect a ſcout was ſent out for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Do you recollect the account he brought?</p>
               <p>A. I recollect, that he informed that he diſcovered the enemy ſomewhere about Gilliland's Creek, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and that he conceived them to be in force.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Queſtion. Do you recollect in what part of the country he was when he made the diſcovery?</p>
               <p>A. I think he was on the eaſt ſhore, oppoſite to Gilliland's Creek. I do not recollect the diſtance.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you hear of any other debarkation of the enemy than at Gilliland's Creek, from the time of their embarkation at Point-au-Fer to their landing at or near the Three Mile Point?</p>
               <p>A. We were informed of their approach to Crown Point, and of their being encamped there. I don't recollect any other particular debarkation until their arrival at or near Three Mile Point.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Had we not information of numerous parties of the ſavages being in the country, on the weſt ſide of the Lake?</p>
               <p>A. We had, and found them ſo very numerous that our parties could ſcarce ever get in view of the enemy, though many attempts were made to diſcover their ſituation.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were there actions ſeveral times between our parties and the ſavages?</p>
               <p>A. There were, and I remember our parties on thoſe occaſions were routed.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the ſtrength of the fatigue parties that were detailed on or after the 20th of June?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot particularly aſcertain the number. I remember that the fatigue parties and guards generally amounted to about one fourth of the number of effectives fit for duty in the garriſon, and ſome times one third.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Beſides the number of men for fatigue that was detailed, was there not a conſtant fatigue party with the Quarter Maſter General, and a regiment of militia alſo employed in conſtant fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. The Quarter-Maſter General had a conſtant fatigue party, beſides the number that was furniſhed him by the details. There were beſides, 100 men employed on daily duty from two regiments of militia.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect my having ordered the fatigue on Mount Independence to be done by a brigade at a time, under the command of a Brigadier; and was not this number alſo excluſive of the detail for fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. I recollect there was, and they were excluſive of the detail for fatigue, except the proportion from the brigade ordered on duty.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the diminiſhing the camp guards, and was it not done on account of the ſeverity of duty, by having ſo many men on fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. I recollect it, and it was done upon that principle.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. As you lived with me, you muſt be acquainted with the baggage I had. I wiſh you would mention it.</p>
               <p>A. You had a portmanteau, and a cheſt which contained your baggage; alſo ſome kitchen furniture.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was any part of my baggage ſent off from Ticonderoga previous to the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016141_0021_0F9C7A5764CC5D48"/>General St. Clair's queſtion. What age was my ſon, who left Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. He was a mere child; about ten or twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was any part of my baggage ſent off with him when he was ſent to Fort George?</p>
               <p>A. No part of it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Could any of my baggage have been removed without your being acquainted with it?</p>
               <p>A. I don't think it poſſibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was any part of the furniture belonging to Head-Quarters removed to any other place previous to the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect what orders were given to the troops on the evacuation being determined upon?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, as I was then employed in fixing an occaſional picket, but I believe the orders were given to the Brigadiers.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was there a ſtrong picket advanced of the French lines, and the other pickets reinforced, ſo as to form a chain of centinels the night of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know it of my own knowledge, as I was ordered to Mount Independence to give orders about loading the battea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; but, from every information I received, I am induced to think there was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was not the order for the march of the troops, the ſtriking their tents, and loading their baggage, delivered by you to ſome of the regiments on Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. The order for ſtriking their tents and loading their baggage was delivered by me, and diſperſed to all the regiments about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. How was the retreat conducted?</p>
               <p>A. The troops puſhed out of Mount Independence without order or regularity, in a great deal of confuſion. I remember that, after you had got them ſtretched, you rode from the rear to the front, in order to halt and throw them into ſome form, but your orders were directly diſobeyed, and the militia would not halt, but puſhed on, and drew after them many of the continental troops. When we arrived at Hubbarton, the army halted, and was refreſhed as well as our circumſtances would admit. After waiting a length of time, two or three hours, for the rear guard and ſtragglers, you moved on with the main body, leaving the command with Colonel Warner, with orders to follow as ſoon as the whole came up.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were not many of the continental regiments got into good order ſoon after they left Mount Independence, and did not the rear guard come off in very good order?</p>
               <p>A. There were ſeveral regiments got into tolerable good order by your halting them, and other attempts, and the rear guard under Colonel Francis came off in very good order.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the daily ſcout that was ſent out to gain intelligence of the enemy's approach and ſtrength?</p>
               <p>A. From fifteen to twenty-five. It was a ſubaltern's light command.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the ſtrength of thoſe that were ſent out occaſionally for that purpoſe?</p>
               <p>A. Their numbers varied. I remember one which amounted to 100.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the time this ſcout, conſiſting of 100, was ſent out?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect the day, but the occaſion was the enemy had made a couple of priſoners, and fell in with a returning ſcout of ours which they routed; in conſequence of which this party was detached to come up with them if poſſible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where the enemy lay at the time?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot recollect particularly, but believe at Gilliland's Creek.</p>
               <p>Q. After the enemy had landed at Three Mile Point, were any parties ſent out to annoy them in their approach towards the garriſon?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. How large were theſe parties?</p>
               <p>A. There were two ſmall parties ſent out. I believe they might have been about 60 men. They were routed and purſued by the Indians.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any orders given for the deſtruction of the barracks at the time of the evacuation of the garriſons of Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, or before?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge. The reaſon General St. Clair aſſigned for not ſetting them on fire was, it would have betrayed our movement to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you ſuppoſe it would have had that operation?</p>
               <p>A. It moſt certainly would.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the number of men returned on command in your return of the 28th of June, on command in the garriſon, or where?</p>
               <p>A. There were many of them on command in the garriſon. I do not recollect the number. Some were on command at Fort Schuyler; ſome at Albany, and on the communication to Ticonderoga; at Skeenſborough, Fort-Ann, Lake-George landing, and at the block-houſe at the ſaw-mill.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. During my command at Ticonderoga, or at the time of the evacuation, did you perceive any inſtances of cowardice in me?</p>
               <p>A. No; but I have upon every occaſion obſerved a direct contrary conduct.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were you with me at Princeton and Trenton, and did you obſerve any inſtance of cowardice in me there?</p>
               <p>A. I was. I obſerved no inſtance of cowardice in you, but, on the contrary, upon every occaſion of danger, you manifeſted the utmoſt coolneſs and intrepidity.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. At the affair of Princeton do you recollect your riding up to me, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me that our troops had given way in the centre; and do you recollect what paſſed between me and you upon that occaſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016141_0022_0F9C7A5B256C75A8"/>A. I recollect your begging me to take no notice of it, left it ſhould communicate a pannic to the troops we were with.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. At the time the picket was attacked at Ticonderoga, which occaſioned ſome firing from the lines, and at every other time when there was firing, did I not transport myſelf to the place with the utmoſt expedition?</p>
               <p>A. You did; and your poſitive injunctions to the officers and exhortations to the ſoldiery were, to reſerve their fire until the enemy came within a very certain ſhot.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were there any other pickets placed by you beſides thoſe mentioned in the orderly book?</p>
               <p>A. There was an additional picket of 50 men poſted on the left of the French lines, without them, every night, which came off in the morning; and a ſimilar picket, ſubject to the ſame orders, was poſted on the point to the right of the Jerſey redoubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. During the time you were with General St. Clair at Ticonderoga, did you obſerve any conduct of his that induced you to think him treacherous to the United States?</p>
               <p>A. No; but he did, upon every occaſion, manifeſt the moſt enthuſiaſtic zeal for the good of the cauſe of the United States.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know the particular period when General St. Clair had compleat information of the number and deſigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. The firſt information of their number and deſign which he received, that could be relied on was, I think, two days before the evacuation. This intelligence was by ſtratagem obtained from a priſoner.</p>

The ſucceſs of General Waſhington over General Howe is an event of ſuch importance, as muſt deſtroy every proſpect of the enemy's carrying their plans into execution, ſhould they ſuccced here. I have ordered a feu-de-joye upon the occaſion, and will find ſome way to communicate the intelligence to the enemy. We have now two ſhips, eighteen gun boats, and three ſloops, lying off the Three Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the point, and retrenching it. This does not look like their being ſtrong. Other matters I hope to manage to-morrow morning, but cannot be particular for fear of accidents.</p>

                     <p>YESTERDAY at noon, in the very inſtant of the feu-de-joye, which conſiſted of thirteen pieces of cannon (the muſketry might have diſcovered to the enemy our numbers) forty-one batteaus appeared of me Three Mile Point, croſſed the Lake, and landed troops on the eaſt ſide, in the Bay formed behind the Long Point, oppoſite to the Three Mile Point. I obſerved them very attentively, and am certain they did not contain on an average above twenty men. It is not improbable, however, that part of the troops tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in them from Canada may have landed on the weſtern ſide, ſo low down as to be out of our ſight, and I am rather inclined to think this the caſe, from their camp extending a conſiderable diſtance down the Lake, and its being much too large for the number of men we ſaw debark at the Point.</p>
                     <p>I am in great pain for the batteaus and ſtores at the Landing. We cannot poſſibly get them over (the enemy having poſſeſſed themſelves of Mount Hope) without riſking ſuch large detachments as might oblige us to come to action in the open field, which would not be altogether prudent. I had ordered a party to bring them off this morning, but the eſcape of ſome of the cattle, and the ſtupidity of the drivers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded us ſo much that day appeared, and it was then too late to attempt it. The deſign was therefore laid aſide, and a party ſent to reinforce the party at the Landing, with orders to take back the ſtores to Fort-George, and all the batteaus, deſtroying the block-houſe, and ſuch batteaus as they might not be able to carry off. At the ſame time I ſent orders to the block-houſe at the mills, which has been attacked ſeveral times, and was ſurrounded yeſterday all day, for the officer to ſet fire to it and the mills, and to retire to camp, which he has this moment effected. The party gone over with the boats I have deſired to return by Skeenſborough. It will be of the utmoſt importance to ſecure that communication, which I have no doubt of your being able to do; and when the Grant people come in, I hope to keep open that by Caſtle-Town. A party of them, with cattle, ſhould have been here yeſterday. I hope no accident has happened them.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants who live between this and the bridge, I found it neceſſary to bring within the lines, and have now ſent them to Skeenſborough, with directions to Captain Gray to forward them to Albany by the firſt opportunity. I do not know that they are our enemies, but they are certainly not our friends; and when the enemy firſt preſented themſelves they were through their houſes, and they gave us no intelligence of them</p>
                     <p>I am ſtill of opinion that the enemy have no great force here, but whether the whole of their army may as yet be come up I am not certain, but laſt night they tired their evening gun from three different places, farther down the Lake than their poſt at Three Mile Point. A little time will clear up this matter.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſufficiently acquainted with this country to form any judgment how a body of men can be ſent out to our relief, in caſe the enemy poſſeſs themſelves of the ſhores of the Lake above Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016141_0023_0F9C7A6126094E00"/>
which they certainly will by means of their ſavages; but if they can be brought by land in their rear, a ſmall party would oblige them to quit the Lake, and conſequently leave the communication Open.</p>

                     <p>OUR picket was attacked yeſterday two or three times, in which we loſt five men killed, and two or three wounded. The enemy's loſs we are not apprized of, but we have one priſoner of the 47th regiment, and two deſerters from the corps of Jagers. The priſoner was very ſulky, and would give no information whatever; but by diſguiſing an officer, a countryman of his, and confining him in the ſame room with him, with the help of a little rum, we got out all he knew, which have here incloſed, as alſo the examination of the deſerters. Two men came in from the Grants laſt night, and returned. I have wrote very preſſingly for the people to come on, and for the preſent leave the cattle to be brought up by thoſe who ſucceed them. I think it is probable Warner will fall in with the foreigners, who are all on the eaſt ſide of the Lake. The Britiſh troops upon the weſt. Excuſe this ſcrawl. I am ſo much in want of ſleep, that I am nodding as I write.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>CONGRESS may probably think it extraordinary that ſo much time ſhould have elapſed before they heard from me, after a ſtep of ſuch conſequence as the evacuation of the poſts that had been entruſted to my care, but it was not in my power to write whilſt on the march to this place. I am ſorry to find that my letter to General Schuyler, the night the evacuation took place, has not come to his hands; as, for want of that, tho' he has doubtleſs informed Congreſs of the matter, he could not give them the reaſons that induced it. They were theſe:</p>
                     <p>Seeing that the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were nearly inveſted, and having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by my ſpies that they would be compleatly ſo in twenty-four hours, when we ſhould be cut off from all poſſibility of ſuccour; that the batteries of the enemy were ready to open, and the whole of our encampment, on the Ticonderoga ſide, expoſed to their fire; conſidering, at the ſame time, the weakneſs of the garriſon, that the effective numbers were not ſufficient to man one half of the works, and that, conſequently, the whole muſt be upon conſtant duty, which they could not poſſibly long ſuſtain, and that of courſe the places, with the garriſon, muſt inevitably in a very few days fall into the enemy's hands; I ſaw no alternative but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to evacuate them and bring off the army. Whereupon I called the General Officers together, to take their ſentiments. They were unanimouſly of opinion that the places ſhould be evacuated without the leaſt loſs of time; and it was accordingly ſet about that night, the 5th inſtant, after embarking in boats as much of our cannon, proviſion and ſtores, as was poſſible.</p>
                     <p>With the boats, which were ordered to Skeenſborough, I ſent Colonel Long, an active, diligent, good officer, to take the command there, with his regiment and the invalids, until I ſhould join him with the army, which was to march to that place by Caſtle-Town. The body of the army reached Caſtle-Town the next evening, thirty miles from Ticonderoga, and twelve from Skeenſborough; but the rear guard, under the command of Colonel Warner, which, with the ſtragglers and infirm, amounted to near 1200, ſtopped ſhort of that place ſix miles, and were next morning attacked by a ſtrong detachment the enemy had ſent to hang upon our rear and retard our march. Two regiments of militia, who had left us the evening before, and halted about two miles from Colonel Warner, were immediately ordered to his aſſiſtance; but, to my great ſurprize, they marched directly down to me. At the ſame time I received information that the enemy were in poſſeſſion of Skeenſborough, and had cut off all our boats and armed veſſels. This obliged me to change my route, that I might not be put betwixt two fires, and at the ſame time be able to bring off Colonel War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to whom I ſent orders, if he found the enemy too ſtrong, to retreat to Rutland, where he would find me to cover him, that place lying nearly at an equal diſtance from both. Before my orders reached him his party was diſperſed, after having for a conſiderable time ſuſtained a very warm engagement, in which the enemy ſuffered ſo much, that they purſued but a very ſmall diſtance. Our loſs I cannot aſcertain, but believe it does not exceed 40 killed and wounded. About 200 of the party have joined me at Rutland and ſince, but great numbers of them are ſtill miſſing, and I ſuſpect have got down into New-England by the way of No. Four. After a very fatiguing march of ſeven days, in which the army ſuffered much from bad weather and want of proviſion, I joined General Schuyler the 12th inſtant.</p>
                     <p>It was my original plan to retreat to this place, that I might be betwixt General Burgoyne and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and that the militia might have ſomething in this quarter to collect to. It is now effected, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia are coming in, ſo that I have the moſt ſanguine hopes that the progreſs of the enemy will be checked, and I may yet have the ſatisfaction to experience, that, altho' I have loſt a poſt, I have eventually ſaved a State.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps I may be cenſured, by thoſe who are unacquainted with the ſituation I was in, for not ſooner call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the militia to my aſſiſtance. I think I informed Congreſs that I could not do that for want of proviſion; and as ſoon as I got a ſupply I did call for them, and was joined by near 900 the day before the evacuation, but they came from home ſo ill provided, that they could not, nor did not, propoſe to ſtay with me but a few days. The two Maſſachuſetts regiments of militia likewiſe, which compoſed part of the garriſon, gave me notice that their time expired in two days, and they intended then to go home. In vain did I beg of their officers to exert every influence they had over them, and, from their ſubſequent behaviour, I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the officers are moſt to blame. They kept with me, however, for two days on the march, but their conduct, was ſo licentious aud diſorderly, and their example beginning to affect the continental troops, I was conſtrained to ſend them off.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a copy of the Council of War, in which you will find the principles upon which the retreat was undertaken. As I found all the General Officers ſo fully of opinion that it ſhould be done immediately,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016141_0024_0F9C7A61E6231B78"/>
I forbore to mention to them many circumſtances which might have influenced them, and which I ſhould have laid before them, had they been of different ſentiments. For I was, and ſtill am, ſo firmly convinced of the neceſſity, as well as the propriety of it, that I believe I ſhould have ventured upon it, had they been every one againſt it.</p>
                     <p>I have the utmoſt confidence in the candour of Congreſs, and perſuade myſelf, notwithſtanding the loſs they have ſuſtained, when they have impartially conſidered that I was poſted, with little more than 2000 men, in a place that required 10,000 to defend it—that theſe 2000 were ill equipped and worſe armed, not above one bayonet in ten, an arm eſſential in the defence of lines—that with theſe 2000 I have made good a retreat from under the noſe of an army at leaſt four times their numbers, and have them now betwixt the enemy and the country, ready to act againſt them—that my conduct will appear at leaſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving cenſure.</p>

               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Varrick being ſworn,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you muſter the troops at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence in the month of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; except Colonel Long's regiment, which was muſtered before I arrived there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the continental troops with reſpect to arms?</p>
               <p>A. Some of them very indifferent. The three New-Hampſhire regiments, Colonel Scammel's, Colonel Cilley's and Colonel Hale's, had pretty good French arms, and chiefly bayonets. I believe a majority of the other regiments had not bayonets. The militia regiments had arms, but very indifferent, but no bayonets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the corps of artillery or artificers any arms?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lines and redoubts at Ticonderoga furniſhed with ſpears?</p>
               <p>A. They were furniſhed with ſome ſpears and ſharp pointed poles, but whether there were ſufficient or not for them I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did General St. Clair inform you on or about the 26th or 27th of June, 1777, of the quantity of proviſion he had in the garriſon?</p>
               <p>A. I think he mentioned to me he had about thirty-ſix days of the meat kind. Flour, I do not know what quantity he had.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were there not a great many boys amongſt the troops?</p>
               <p>A. There was a number of boys, old men and negroes. I diſmiſſed at the muſter 50, as poſitively unfit for any kind of ſervice, and would have diſmiſſed more, had you not deſired me to be very tender, as you had ſo few troops in garriſon.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did not my ſon paſs the Lake from Ticonderoga with you?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; he paſſed the Lake at my requeſt. I urged the matter to you.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did any part of my baggage go over when he went with you?</p>
               <p>A. None. Some of your ſon's clothes were left behind.</p>
               <p>Major Hull being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. How was the retreat in General from Mount Independence conducted?</p>
               <p>A. The general plan of the retreat, I think, was very well, though there was ſome part of the troops that behaved diſorderly.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. During the time of my command at Ticonderoga, did you ever obſerve any kind of cowardice, treachery, or inattention to the progreſs of the enemy in me?</p>
               <p>A. Not the leaſt appearance of either.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the circumſtance of my ordering a ſtrong picket out the night of the evacuation under Colonel Francis, and that it was directed to be of picked men?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What was the general plan of the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. General Poor's brigade was ordered in front, the militia next, General Patterſon's brigade next, General Fermoy's brigade after him, and the rear guard, conſiſting about 450 men, under the command of Colonel Francis. Over the firſt part of the ground we marched in file, owing to the nature of the country; where the ground would admit of it we marched in platoons. General Poor's brigade, as far as I was capable of ſeeing, when they firſt marched off from Mount Independence, marched off in good order.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. How were the invalids diſpoſed of at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. Thoſe who were not able to march were ſent by water. The others marched with their reſpective regiments.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What quantity of proviſion was ordered for the troops to take with them before they left the garriſon?</p>
               <p>A. I think eight days; principally pork and flour, and ſome hard bread.</p>
               <p>Brigadier General Poor being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know what means were taken to diſcover the approach and ſtrength of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. By continually ſending ſcouts by land on both ſides of the Lake, and by water.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you ever hear of any landing the enemy made but at Gilliland's Creek, until they came to Crown-Point?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect my ſending out ſerjeant Heath, with a party, to make diſcoveries?</p>
               <p>A. No; but I recollect your ſending out Lieutenant Lifer, who returned with two priſoners. I remember your ſending out a perſon with orders to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy were, who brought intelligence that the enemy were on the well ſide of the Lake at Gilliland's Creek.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:016141_0025_0F9C7A5CA8BEB5B8"/>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the general ſtrength of the parties that were ſent out?</p>
               <p>A. Sometimes a Subaltern's command, ſometimes a Captain's command, Captain Whitcomb being out frequently; ſometimes by twos and threes, merely as ſpies.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Would the ſending of larger parties have anſwered a better purpoſe than of ſending the parties that were ſent, and could larger parties have been ſent without great danger of loſing them?</p>
               <p>A. For the ſake of gaining intelligence of the approach of the enemy, or to aſcertain their numbers, could have been much better attained by ſmall parties than by large ones, as any conſiderable number of men marching in that woody country, where the ground is covered with moſs, might eaſily be diſcovered, and of conſequence would be expoſed to have been cut off by the enemy.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect whether the working parties were increaſed on or after the 20th of June?</p>
               <p>A. If I remember right, the detail was taken off, and we were ordered to work by brigades, to turn out in the brigade every officer and man who were off duty and able to work, to throw up lines on Mount Independence, and alſo to fell the trees on the ſides and at the bottom of the hill. Near twenty acres of trees were felled.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was there any wood on Mount Independence, to have ſupplied the garriſon in caſe of a ſiege, or was there a magazine of wood laid in?</p>
               <p>A. There was no magazine of wood laid in. There was ſome ſcattering logs upon the top of the hill, and ſo much upon the ſides, that I believe we ſhould not have been put to any difficulty in getting wood, in caſe we had been beſieged.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. How long do you ſuppoſe the wood that was on the Mount would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed firing for the garriſon we had?</p>
               <p>A. At that ſeaſon of the year it might have laſted us a fortnight.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Could we have ſpared men from the works that we were engaged in, to have laid in a further ſupply of wood, or had we a number of draught cattle ſufficient to have brought it from any diſtance?</p>
               <p>A. At that time we had not half men enough to man our works. I never underſtood we had many teams, but I do not recollect the number. What few teams we had were employed in tranſporting the ſtores from Lake George Landing to Lake Champlain.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect, after the enemy landed at Three Mile Point, and before they broke ground, my ordering the men to lie a night or two on their arms?</p>
               <p>A. I do.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you not underſtand the reaſon of that order was, that tho' I did not think the enemy were in force, yet I thought they might attempt to carry us by a coup-de-main?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was our force in any degree adequate to the defence of the places?</p>
               <p>A. No; I think that the places could not have been maintained unleſs with at leaſt 10,000 good troops, and we ought to have had poſſeſſion of two hills without the French lines, as alſo the one on the other ſide of the Lake, known by the name of Mount Defiance.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair produces a paper, and aſks General Poor whether the matter therein contained was the order of march and diſtribution of batteaus, that was agreed upon at the Council on the 5th of July?— The paper is as follows:</p>

                           <p>160 from General Poor's brigade, commanded by Lieut. Col. Read and Major Durborn—150 from General Patterſon's, commanded by Col. Francis—6 Captains, 12 Subalterns, and non-commiſſioned in proportion—to advance as a picket in the front of the French lines.</p>
                           <p>ORDER OF MARCH.</p>

               </q>
               <p>A. I very well remember the orders, and I think it to be the paper.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect a picket to be advanced, conſiſting of the number of men, and under the officers mentioned in the paper?</p>
               <p>A. I well remember it. I was deſired by you, when this picket was paraded, to poſt them with the other picket, which I think was 150 men, as near the enemy as I could without bringing on an action, and to give them particular orders in the morning, when I was to call them in, that they were to compoſe the rear guard, which I did.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you not underſtand that the reaſon of ordering out that picket was, to prevent any ſurpriſe happening to us while the men were employed in carrying the ſtores and baggage to the landing place?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; and likewiſe to form a chain of centinels from water to water, to prevent any of our men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting to them, and giving them any information.</p>
               <p>General St Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the burning of General Fermoy's houſe?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; before I called in the pickets on Ticonderoga ſide I ſaw that houſe in flames, which laid the hill that his brigade was on open to the view of the enemy, as I could ſee every movement they were making, ſtriking their tents and loading and carrying off their baggage, which induced me to order in the pickets one half an hour ſooner than I ſhould otherwiſe have done, as the principal part of the troops on Ticonderoga ſide had croſſed the bridge, in order to embark their baggage on board the boats, the wind being ſo high the boats could not be brought over.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were not orders given not to ſet fire to any of the buildings?</p>
               <p>A. Yes: You gave me particular orders, as ſoon as I had poſted the pickets, to communicate your orders with reſpect to the evacuation of the place to the commanding officers of regiments in my brigade, and deſired,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016141_0026_0F9C7A62A46CC888"/>
as ſoon as the baggage was packed up, that every light, both from fire and from candle, might be put out, previous to ſtriking the tents and putting the baggage on board the boats. I underſtood the reaſon was, to prevent the enemy from making any diſcovery of our intentions; and had not the wind been ſo very high, which obſtructed the moving of the boats, we ſhould have been able to have left the place by two o'clock, as was determined on.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was not the confuſion of marching off the troops from Mount Independence occaſioned by that houſe of General Fermoy's having been ſet on fire?</p>
               <p>A. I believe that was the principal occaſion of it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. How far did the troops march before that confuſion was, in a great meaſure, remedied?</p>
               <p>A. I marched in front. I frequently fell back to the rear of my brigade, to examine into their ſituation, and before we had marched many miles I got them nearly all together; I can ſay nothing with reſpect to the others; and the firſt halt we made the brigades were all formed in order, and marched ſo during the whole retreat, excepting Colonel Leonard's and Colonel Wells's, two militia regiments, who behaved with the greateſt diſorder.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect of one or both of theſe regiments having broke the line of march?</p>
               <p>A. The day after the evacuation, when we arrived at Otter Creek, we were alarmed by a report that the enemy were juſt in our rear. I, being in front, was ordered to croſs the bridge, and draw the men up upon the moſt advantageous ground I could find. I poſted the regiment that Lieut. Colonel Hale commanded at a ford; he left it, and went off. In the evening, on our march, about a mile and a half from that place, I came up where Colonel Hale was with his regiment. The regiment had four oxen killed and ſkinned. I aſked him how he came there without leave? he ſaid he came to get ſome proviſion, to prevent his men from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I ordered him to cut up his meat, to be ready to fall into the line of march, which he might be in a few minutes; if not, we ſhould march but about a mile and a half, and make a halt. I moved on, and in about ten minutes found his regiment running by my brigade, and he nearly at the head of them. He, with about forty of his men, paſſed the brigade. I rode forward, and halted him till part of one regiment of my bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade had paſſed him; he came up again, and inſiſted on paſſing, as he would not be left in the rear. I turned out about forty men, and ordered them to fire upon them, unleſs they would remain on the ground till the line of march came up, where they were to fall in, which halted them. Both regiments frequently broke the line of march.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect, whether the troops, at the time of the evacuation, were ordered to take five days proviſion with them?</p>
               <p>A. They were ordered to take ſeveral days proviſion with them, which was judged ſufficient to have carried them to the North River, had we purſued the route we expected to take.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. During my command at Ticonderoga, did you diſcover any thing that had the appearance of cowardice in me, or induced you to think me treacherous, or inattentive to the progreſs of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I was once with you where you were in danger, and ſundry times when we have expected an immediate attack, and never diſcovered the leaſt diſcompoſure of mind, but you always appeared with the greateſt bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſteadineſs, becoming the character of an officer. From your cloſe application to your duty by day, before the enemy made their appearance at Ticonderoga, and your conſtant application both by day and night, after they came there, gave me every reaſon to imagine you left nothing undone that was in your power to contribute to the ſtrength of the garriſon; therefore I had not the leaſt reaſon to induce me to think you either treacherous or neglectful of your duty, I remember your obſerving to me, if I evacuate the place, my character will be ruined; if I remain here, the army will be loſt; but I am determined to evacuate it, altho' it will give ſuch an alarm that has not happened in the country ſince the war commenced.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. At what time did this converſation happen. Was it previous to the reſolution that was entered into by the Council of War, or poſterior to it?</p>
               <p>A. It was after it. You gave your reaſons for it, and ſaid that it was to throw this body of troops between the country and Burgoyne, that the militia might have a body to collect to; which, if this body was cut off, they would have none, and of courſe Burgoyne would purſue his operations without any obſtacle, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were you with me at Trenton or Princeton, and what was my conduct at thoſe places with reſpect to courage?</p>
               <p>A. I was with you at both places. We were not brought to cloſe action at either place, but you behaved with the greateſt ſpirit, and with as much coolneſs as at any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. At what time did General St. Clair receive the firſt compleat intelligence of the ſtrength and deſigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect any that was obtained before the priſoner was taken; he was the firſt perſon that gave us intelligence who commanded the enemy's army, of their ſtrength and deſigns, and that not until the next day after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was there any other intelligence received, between the time of the priſoners being taken and the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. There was a report in camp, that ſome of the inhabitants ſaid they were clearing a road through the wood to get into our rear. The Jagers alſo mentioned that they were clearing a road.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know whether it was a prevailing opinion, that nothing ſerious would be attempted againſt Ticonderoga that campaign, and whether it was not expected that the enemy's troops would have been ſent round from Quebec to the ſouthern army?</p>
               <p>A. A little before General St. Clair arrived at Ticonderoga the enemy made a movement up the Lake, with a number of boats and one or two veſſels, tarried a few days, and returned. I acquainted General Gates of it, and further acquainted him that I was informed they were making preparations at St. John's to proceed with their whole army. He wrote me, that he had the ſtrongeſt aſſurances from Congreſs that the King's
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016141_0027_0F9C7A5D6638E1B0"/>
troops were all ordered round to New-York, leaving only a ſufficient number to garriſon their forts, and deſireſt me to be getting every thing in readineſs, that if the enemy went out of one door, we muſt enter the other. He farther mentioned in his letter, that we might daily expect alarms, as they commanded the Lake, and might come up with their ſhipping, and that the intelligence he had by a ſpy that came from Canada corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ſentiment of Congreſs.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What orders had the commanding officer of the rear guard, and did he obey the orders he received?</p>
               <p>A. He was ordered upon his coming in to ſweep every thing off the ground upon Ticonderoga ſide, to bring every man and beaſt, which I underſtood he effected, and then to fall in the rear of General Fermoy's brigade, as a rear guard to the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What orders did the officer of the rear guard receive at Hubbarton?</p>
               <p>A. The firſt halt that was propoſed to be made was at Lacey's camp, which was the firſt cleared land we came to after we left Mount Independence. When I got within about a mile of the place, I met an inhabitant, who informed me there was a large number of the enemy and Indians at Hubbarton, which was two miles farther, which induced me to continue the march until I arrived at Burnam's, in Hubbarton, where it was ſaid the enemy were. Upon our arrival we were told that about 500 of the enemy had been there, and had gone to Caſtle-Town. There I marked out the ground for each brigade, poſted officers to fall in with his brigade and regiment as they came up. We had then made a march of about twenty miles, which had fatigued many of our feeble men; ſo that the officer commanding of the rear guard thought proper to halt at the place firſt propoſed, Lacey's camp, two miles in our rear. General St. Clair ſent ſeveral times to order the rear guard up; the laſt meſſenger came and ſaid they were on their way up. As we tarried there about three or four hours, General St. Clair ſaid he would march to Caſtle-Town with his army, and would leave Colonel Hale's and Warner's regiments to cover his retreat, with orders for them to move on moderately. Some time in the evening I heard the General expreſs a good deal of uneaſineſs and concern that Colonel Francis did not come up with the rear. Towards morning he ſent one of his Aids up to order them down immediately; and, if I miſtake not, ſent a ſecond time. They did not join the army, but remained until they were attacked by the enemy the next morning.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know whether the rear guard had orders to move on to Caſtle-Town that night?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſay poſitively that they had, but I underſtood they had.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect my having ſent orders to Colonel Pellows and Colonel Halcott's militia regiments, who were halted two miles from Hubbarton, to march up and ſupport them upon being attacked?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was that order obeyed?</p>
               <p>A. It was not. The regiments came directly to us at Caſtle-Town.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair produces a map of Ticonderoga, Mount Independence and the adjacent country, with references, which Colonel Koſeiuſzko, on his oath, ſays is a true one, to the beſt of his knowledge and judgment, except as to the diſtances, it not having been made from actual ſurvey, but taken from view.</p>

               <p>THE Court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Captain Woolcott being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect the orders that were given to Colonel Warner at Hubbarton?</p>
               <p>A. I was in front when we arrived at Hubbarton, laid down, and got a ſleep. When I waked, I found the party were nearly all gone. I aſked Captain Smith where they were gone to, who ſaid to Caſtle-Town; and having aſked him whether we were to march, he ſaid it was General St. Clair's orders, delivered by General Patterſon, that we were to march to Caſtle-Town. I went into the houſe where Col. Warner, Col. Francis and Col. Hale were, and having aſked Col. Warner whether he determined to march any farther, he ſaid he did not that night; tho' there were orders to march to Caſtle-Town, he did not intend to go on any farther, becauſe the men were much fatigued.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What time did the rear guard arrive at Hubbarton?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What time did they leave it the next morning?</p>
               <p>A. They commenced their march about eight o'clock, but before the whole got in motion they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Colonel Warner the commanding officer of the rear guard at the time?</p>
               <p>A. He was.</p>
               <p>Colonel Baldwin, being ſworn, ſays, On the 5th of July, 1777, about nine o'clock in the evening, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral St. Clair ſent for me, and told me that he had determined to abandon the place that night; he would have me with the artificers, get all the intrenching tools, and the carpenters and ſmiths tools on board of batteaus that were aſſigned me for that purpoſe, and be ready by two o'clock in the morning to leave the place. I left him and went to my men, got every thing on board belonging to my department agreeable to order, on Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016141_0028_0F9C7A6365E76650"/>
ſide, by twelve o'clock. I then went to the ſtone redoubt, and aſked Captain Winſlow if he wanted any aſſiſtance? He told me that every thing was out of the magazine and on board the boats, there was nothing left but his tents, that were to be carried. I then went to Head-Quarters, and was informed that General St. Clair was gone over to the Mount. I rode over, and met him near the fort, told him what I had done, and aſked him if he had any further orders? He ſaid that the people were all aſleep on this ſide, wiſhed that I would go and wake General Fermoy. I went, called him up, and returned. General St. Clair then deſired I would go, and ſee to get the ſtores away from the magazine that was not then open. I ſoon got a large party of men, went to the magazine, and rolled the barrels from it to the landing (I believe about 100 large barrels of powder.) I then went to the landing, where I found the men in great confuſion, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about boats. The wind was high, and it was bad loading them; the men very croſs, and hard to be prevailed with to do their duty. About ſun-riſe the army was paſt and the boats put off. There remained only a few barrels of powder and rum, with a ſmall matter of baggage on ſhore, and there were only two batteaus that lay at a little diſtance. I promiſed Captain Nicholls, that if he could get theſe boats with his carpenters, and carry off what remained at the landing, I would give him a barrel of the rum when he got to Skeenſborough; he immediately brought them in, got all on board (except about eight old tents that were not worth carrying, and a howitzer that we run into the Lake and left, with ſome carriages for cannon and General St. Clair's waggon) juſt as the enemy came into the works on the hill and fired upon us. The boats puſhed off, and I rode away with Captain Buckland. We ſaw none of our people (except General St. Clair's waggoner with his horſes; Captain Buckland rode one of them, and we brought off the other) until we came to the laſt houſe; there we found four ſoldiers partly drunk. We made them run until we ſoon came up with others that were too heavy loaded, and who had ſtopped to throw away a part. We endeavoured to bring all up with us, until we came to Colonel Francis, which was about two miles, as near as I can gueſs. He had then fell ſome ſmall diſtance in the rear, by reaſon of people ſtopping to lighten their packs. I marched ſome time with him, but he found the front marched too faſt for him. He deſired I would ride forward to the General, and deſire him to make a ſmall halt till he could come up, which was done. We marched to Hubbarton, where the front halted two or three hours. We were informed that a large body of the enemy was juſt gone from the place where we halted as the front came up, and were gone towards Caſtle-Town. After the army had refreſhed themſelves the General ordered Colonel Warner, with ſome others, to wait until Colonel Francis came up with the rear guard, and then march on with them; and then General St. Clair marched with the army to Caſtle-Town, and took twenty-ſix priſoners on the way—there halted for that night, the men very much fatigued. On the morning of the ſeventh the rear, with Colonel Warner and Colonel Francis, was attacked at Hubbarton; we heard the guns. General St. Clair immediately ſent one of his Aids to order Colonel Bellows, with two militia regiments (that lay two miles on the road towards the rear) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce Colonel Francis, and cover his retreat if it was neceſſary; but thoſe regiments ſoon came down to us, and I heard the Aid ſay that he could not by any means prevail with the men to obey the order, and Colonel Bellows did all in his power to get the men to go with him to meet the enemy. The General this morning heard our boats were cut off at Skeenſborough, which cauſed him to alter his route, and go by the way of Rutland.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect whether the working parties at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were increaſed or decreaſed on or about the 23d day of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. They were conſiderably increaſed. There were ſeveral works that were not finiſhed that were ordered to be done, beſides a number of new ones laid out that the men were ordered to work upon, and we continued at theſe works both at Mount Independence and Ticonderoga until the day we came away, beſides a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reinforcement to the party at work upon the bridge. As the troops increaſed the working parties increaſed, we having almoſt every man upon the ground on duty of one kind or another. There was a regiment of militia conſtantly on duty in the woods, under my direction, providing timber for the bridge, that was not included in the details. I had about 100 men, beſides the militia on duty with me there, that were not included in the details. I had about 30 out of the militia alſo making ſhingles, and a party making brick, not included in the details.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was the boom that was laid below the bridge in the Lake fixed in ſuch a manner, that it would have been able to have reſiſted the ſhock of a veſſel?</p>
               <p>A. The anchors were chiefly loſt from it, the cables having been broken by the ice. I rather think it would not have ſtopped their heavy veſſels, though it might their ſmaller ones.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you receive directions for building a general hoſpital at Ticonderoga, and were you not employed on that work?</p>
               <p>A. I did, from General Schuyler. I was at work on it about the 23d of June, and the greater part of the fatigue-men were then taken from that work to be put on other works. Some of the artificers were taken off, though the greater part of them continued at work on it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What diſtance is the laſt houſe you have mentioned from Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not more than a quarter of a mile from the landing upon the ſouth ſide of the Mount.</p>
               <p>Captain Winſlow being ſworn.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What part of the artillery, and at what poſt, did you command at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga?</p>
               <p>A. I commanded in a ſtone redoubt, where there were thirteen pieces of artillery.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were the artillery and ſtores that were in that redoubt removed at the time of the evacuation.?</p>
               <p>A. The ſtores were all removed, and ſix of the pieces of artillery. I loaded the cannon in a flat bottomed boat that was given me to load them in, and was ordered, I think by General Poor, afterwards to take them out to put the baggage in. There were alſo 40 barrels of powder there, which, with the ſtores, I loaded myſelf in the boats to go to Skeenſborough, after I had got thoſe articles down. I was then ordered by General St. Clair, as I was coming up from the boats, to ſpike up the remainder of the cannon, to go to the old fort to aſſiſt in removing the ſtores from thence.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were the ſtores generally removed from the old fort?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:016141_0029_0F9C7A64242138C8"/>A. Every thing of any conſequence was. They were all carried down to the boats at leaſt, if they were not put on board.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were the cannon all ſpiked that were left?</p>
               <p>A. I ſpiked all that I had the care of, and ſome more that were at the ſhore that were brought from the French lines, that could not be embarked.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were you Paymaſter to the troops at Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was the military cheſt ſaved?</p>
               <p>A. It was. I ſent it away the morning of the evacuation, about three o'clock, with four of my men. You ordered me to ſend it away ſooner, but I could not get a boat to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the ſtores that were ſent from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, at the time of the evacuation, fall into the hands of the enemy afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. They did, after they arrived at Skeenſborough; though there might have been ſome boats that fell into their hands before they got up to Skeenſborough.</p>
               <p>Q. To Colonel Hay. Did the ſtores that were ſent from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, at the time of the evacuation, fall into the hands of the enemy afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. They did at Skeenſborough, after an engagement between the enemy's veſſels and ours.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Col. Hay. Was not a great part of them deſtroyed by fire by our people?</p>
               <p>A. One of the veſſels was blown up.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Col. Hay. Do you recollect the number of batteaus that were at Ticonderoga, fit for ſervice?</p>
               <p>A. Not poſitively, but I imagine they were about 70</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Col. Hay. Was the boom below the bridge ſo ſecured, that it could reſiſt the ſhock of a veſſel?</p>
               <p>A. It was ſecured with several anchors and cables. It would have ſtopped a veſſel's way, ſo far as to have expoſed her to the fire from on both ſides, and made it difficult for her to get back again; but if a veſſel came againſt it with a full wind, I never thought it would have reſiſted her.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Col. Hay. Was the wind fair the night of the evacuation for veſſels to come up againſt it?</p>
               <p>A. It was, and blowed very hard.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion to Col. Hay. If the enemy had attempted it that night, was it not probable they would have broke through every obſtruction?</p>
               <p>A. I am of opinion they would have carried away our boom and broke our floating bridge, but muſt probably, by that means, have been thrown athwart ſome of the caffoons, and thereby expoſed to the fire of our batteries on both ſides, until the cannon were removed or ſpiked up.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Stevens being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you command the artillery at Ticonderoga at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect what orders were given to you at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. About ſeven o'clock in the evening of the 5th of July was the firſt of my hearing of the intended evacuation. You waited on me at my quarters (as I was unwell) and informed me that the retreat was to take place that night. On the information, I told you I had reaſon to curſe the day I ever put my feet into the country, there being ſo much retreating. Yoy ſaid that you had the greateſt reaſon to curſe the day, and intimated that more blame would fall on you than on me for loſing the artillery. You then adviſed with me what artillery to bring off, and was anxious for bringing the whole off, and offered me what aſſiſtance I wanted. I told you it was impoſſible to bring the whole off, on account of the deficiency of boats; and 500 men were turned out to my aſſiſtance. You had agreed to move all the pieces except the eighteen pounders, and thoſe above them, which I got to the landing, but the ſcarcity of boats was the occaſion of my leaving ſome of them there. I did make out to get a number of them to Skeenſborough, but they were loſt there. I ſhould have got the whole there, had not the boats been taken up by General Poor for the men's baggage, into which the pieces were to go. The boats with the ammunition and powder had reached almoſt to Skeenſborough before the enemy came up with them. One of them we ſet fire to, with fifteen tons of powder, which blew up; the reſt fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Were not orders given to ſpike up all the cannon tha could not be removed?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was that done?</p>
               <p>A. It was. You adviſed with me about knocking the trunnions off, but being fearful it would make too much noiſe and alarm the enemy, as they were ſo near, it was omitted.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was there any artillery ordered to be fired that night, to amuſe the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. There were two eighteen pounders in the Jerſey battery fired every ſeven minutes at their ſhipping, and at a battery that the enemy were raiſing oppoſite to the Jerſey battery, which continued till near ſun-riſe the next morning, to amuſe them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. At the time the enemy moved up with their gun boats, as if they meant to attack the Jerſey battery, do you recollect what paſſed at the time between you and me?</p>
               <p>A. You ſeemed to be angry at me for firing without your poſitive orders, and ſaid you would rather give fifty pounds than I ſhould have fired.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect my explaining to you the reaſon of my ſaying ſo?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect your explaining to me the reaſon. You expreſſed in your diſcourſe to me, that you wiſhed they would come nearer, that we might have a fairer chance to ſink them; and I judged that it was on account of your thinking they were not near enough.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you receive any orders for diſmounting and moving the cannon at Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I did about the latter end of June, or beginning of July, from General Schuyler, and moved all the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016141_0030_0F9C7A64E4998D78"/>
cannon above a twelve pounder, except the two eighteen pounders which were left at the Jerſey battery, to Mount Independence, and laid them on ſkids, with their vents down, which induced the ſoldiers to think that a retreat was intended from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence. I moved alſo the ammunition by your orders, except about one hundred rounds, to Mount Independence.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was all the fixed ammunition removed at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I have the greateſt reaſon to think that all was brought off.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was there any annoyance given by the artillery to the enemy in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the place?</p>
               <p>A. They were fired upon from the French lines, and from every quarter where they made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by heavy artillery, from the firſt of their approach to the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyer being ſworn, General St. Clair's queſtion. In what ſtation did you act at Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. As an Aſſiſtant Commiſſary of Proviſion.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. When I called on you on the 5th of July for a return of proviſion, what quantity did you report to me to be on hand?</p>
               <p>A. I imagine there were two thouſand barrels of flour, and eight hundred barrels of beef and pork, the greater part was pork, and it was about that quantity I reported to you there was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you recollect what quantity of proviſion was iſſued as a ration at Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I think, but am not poſitive, there was iſſued for a ration, one pound of bread, one pound of beef, or three quarters of a pound of pork in lieu of beef. That was all they daily drew. The other parts of a ration I do not remember.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was there any allowance made to the men for the ſmall articles you could not furniſh them with?</p>
               <p>A. They had briefs given them for them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. How long were you Aſſiſtant Commiſſary at that place?</p>
               <p>A. About ſix weeks.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Had you received any directions from any of the principals in the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what quantity of proviſion to iſſue as a daily ration?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember that I had.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you not iſſue the ſame ration that had been iſſued before you came into office?</p>
               <p>A. I iſſued the ſame quantity that had been iſſued before I came into the office.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow, ten o'clock.</p>

                     <p>THIS may certify, that the detachment of Colonel Michael Jackſon's regiment, which was under my command at Ticonderoga at the time of its evacuation, was very poorly cloathed, many of their arms out of repair, and about one third of them deſtitute of bayonets.</p>

                     <p>I INFORMED you yeſterday that an encampment of the enemy had been diſcovered at Gilliland's Creek. I aſt night two of their veſſels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are ſeven lying at that place; the reſt of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns diſtinctly at different places. They have alſo debarked ſome troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016141_0032_0F9C7A6665CA4160"/>
they have landed at Crown Point my ſcout-boat did not diſcover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpoſe, on account of their ſhipping; but I have ſent a party on this ſide the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a juſt account of their ſituation.</p>
                     <p>I cannot help repeating to you the diſagreeable ſituation we are in, nor can I ſee the leaſt proſpect of our being able to defend the poſts, unleſs the militia come in; and ſhould the enemy protract their operations, or inveſt us, and content themſelves with a ſimple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. I have thoughts of calling for the Berkſhire militia, which are neareſt to us, and will probably be the moſt alert to come to our aſſiſtance, becauſe they are in ſome meaſure covered by this poſt; but on that I ſhall conſult the other General Officers. This, however, is clear to me, that we ſhall be obliged to abandon this ſide, and then they will ſoon force the other from us; nor do I ſee that a retreat will in any ſhape be practicable. Every thing, however, ſhall be done, that is poſſible, to fruſtrate the deſigns of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred. I ſhall write you again as ſoon as the ſcout returns,</p>

                     <p>THIS moment I have received information from Hoite, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, ſuppoſed to be five hundred, and are deſigned to cut off the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Skeenſborough. They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them to about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before yeſterday, and killed and dreſſed the cattle; and it is ſuppoſed that to-night they will be at the new road near Caſtle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeenſborough. They reported that a very large party were gone on the weſt ſide of the Lake, to fall on Fort George. That is ſaid to conſiſt of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</p>
                     <p>We have alſo had juſt now another attack at the mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The ſcene thickens faſt, and Sunday next, it ſeems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We muſt make the beſt we can of it, and I hope at leaſt to cripple them ſo as they may not be able to purſue their fortune, ſhould it declare in their favour.</p>
                     <p>I ſent a party down laſt night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me ſome uneaſineſs. I hope, however, they are ſafe, and will bring me ſome intelligence of conſequence. I have ſome thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the worſt, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many ſtill left, to become priſoners.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to deſire that all they can poſſibly ſpare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</p>

               <p>Major General Schuyler being ſworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. What troops had you eſtimated for the defence of the garriſons of Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga and Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. Ten thouſand continental troops. I do not know that I mentioned in my letter to General Waſhington and to Congreſs that they ſhould be continental troops, but I intended them to have been continental troops.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you think the poſts tenable with the force I had?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this queſtion, General Schuyler produces an extract from a copy of a letter to Congreſs, dated the 8th of June. 1777, which he ſays was ſent by expreſs to Congreſs, and was received by them about the 13th of June, but he did not receive any anſwer to the letter till late in July.

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I DO myſelf the honour to adviſe you that I arrived here on Tueſday, the 3d inſtant, and found an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</p>
                        <p>I incloſe you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As ſoon as I procure thoſe from the other poſts, I ſhall make out a general return, and do myſelf the honour to tranſmit copies to you and his Excellency General Waſhington.</p>
                        <p>You will perceive, by the return of the Commiſſary of Proviſion, which I alſo incloſe, that only 337 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of proviſion, of the meat kind, have been forwarded to Ticonderoga ſince the 26th of March, and no freſh beef; ſo that the ſtock of ſalted proviſion ſince that time is conſiderably diminiſhed, nor is there any conſiderable quantity provided in the country. I have, therefore, directed the Commiſſary to forward an immediate ſupply of freſh beef, that as much of the ſalted beef and pork may be ſaved as poſſible, in order to have a ſtock on hand, in caſe the enemy ſhould be able ſo to interrupt the communication, as to prevent cattle being ſent on.</p>
                        <p>Incloſe you copy of the inſtructions I have given General St. Clair: I have directed that Mount Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould be the primary object, of attention.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt.</hi> Becauſe, if the lines on the weſt ſide ſhould be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force deſtined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, which it cannot; for the ſeveral poſts on the Mohawk river, and thoſe on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at leaſt 2000 men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this ſide of the Lake.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Second.</hi> Becauſe I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army ſhould occupy a poſt, which, if the enemy ſhould be able ſo to inveſt, as to cut off the communication with the country on this ſide, we might poſſibly experience a diſaſter ſimilar to that at Fort Waſhington.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Third.</hi> I am fully convinced that between 2 and 3000 men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and ſecure the paſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourth.</hi> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is poſſible that a want of proviſion might oblige us to abandon that important poſt.</p>

                           <hi>Fifth.</hi> If the enemy ſhould attempt to draw their boats over land into Lake George from beyond the Three Mile Point, our naval ſtrength on Lake George will prevent their progreſs: If it did not, we ſhall have a body of troops to oppoſe them with.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixth.</hi> Becauſe, if Mount Independence ſhould be inveſted, the militia will readily join when they have an army to join, and the ſeige may be raiſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seventh.</hi> Becauſe, if they ſhould attempt to march a body of troops from Crown Point, leaving Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga on their left (by the road laſt year cut by the tories who joined General Carlton) to interrupt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, there will be a force to meet them, and to prevent the evil conſequences of ſuch a manoeuvre of their's.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eighth.</hi> Becauſe, if a ſudden irruption ſhould be made on the Mohawk River, or from New-York by Hudſon's River, a force will be at hand to face them. Beſides theſe conſiderations, there are oeconomical ones alſo to induce me to this diſpoſition of the army, if it can be done without injury, which I am fully of opinion it may, and will certainly be ſo, if General Carlton ſent part of the troops, from Canada to New-York or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>ort, about which orders had been given the beginning of February to Colonel Baldwin, was far advanced; that the obſtruction in the Lake was compleated; that there were carriages provided for the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; that the lines were compleated, and not by one half ſo extenſive as he found them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did you ever give me any orders for evacuating theſe garriſons?</p>
               <p>A. No. The reaſon why I did not give you any orders for evacuating theſe garriſons was, becauſe I had wrote this letter to Congreſs, and they did not give me any orders about it; and as the continent conceived them of great importance, and very ſtrong, I did not think myſelf at liberty to give any orders for an evacuation of them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Was the defective ſtate in which you found the works at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence owing to any negligence in me, or diſregard to the orders I received from you?</p>
               <p>A. It could not be owing to any negligence in you, or diſregard to the orders you received from me, as you had arrived there but a few days before; not was it owing to the negligence of any officer who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there in the winter or ſpring before; nor to the commanding officer of the artiliery or the engineer. I conceive it to be owing to a want of men and a want of materials.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know of any ſteps taken by the eaſtern ſtates to reinforce theſe poſts, after their inveſtiture?</p>
               <p>A. Immediately on my return from Ticonderoga, I wrote to the eaſtern ſtates to haſten on the remainder of the continental troops. Some troops came up in conſequence of my application, but did not reach Albany till ſome time after the evacuation of Ticonderoga. Upon receiving the firſt letter from you after I returned from Ticonderoga, I applied to the eaſtern ſtates, and to this, for reinforcements of militia. The militia from the Maſſachuſetts arrived at Fort-Edward, I believe, between the 4th and 7th of July. A few from Connecticut did not join us until towards the latter end of July. Thoſe from this ſtate got up much about the ſame time that the Maſſachuſetts did. The Maſſachuſetts militia were up as ſoon at Fort-Edward, and thoſe from this ſtate, as I could reaſonably expect them to be. Connecticut, as I was informed by Governor Trumbull, had a call for the militia from General Waſhington, to go to the Highland, or Peeks-Kill. That was the reaſon that their militia did not join us ſooner.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did the force you had collected, ſuppoſing the garriſons to have held out, put you in a ſituation to have raiſed the ſiege?</p>
               <p>A. I believe that, with all the troops you brought with you, with the reinforcement with General Nixon, and including all the militia, I had not at Fort-Edward, about the 20th of July, more than five thouſand men. If the garriſon had remained, I ſhould have had no more than three thouſand militia, before I was joined by General Nixon, to have marched to its relief, which number I conceive very inadequate to have raiſed the ſiege. General Nixon, I believe, arrived about the 12th or 13th of July; but if I had had a force which I might think was ſufficient, yet I ſhould not have been able to have raiſed the ſiege for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, there being ſcarcely any proviſion of the meat kind in the department; flour was plenty. Nor was there any ſtock of proviſion of the meat kind laid in, not even a ſufficiency of ſalted meat to have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſcouts with. We had not lead in the department ſufficient for an army any thing like to have raiſed the ſiege with. At Fort-Edward, on the 7th of July, we were obliged to ſtrip the men that were there of every cartridge they had, to ſend them to Fort-Ann, and were left without any lead for ſome days, excepting a mere trifle I got from Albany, a very ſmall quantity brought up by the militia, and by ſtripping the windows.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know the uſual weight of a barrel of beef or pork in that country?</p>
               <p>A. Barrels of beef or pork ſhould weigh, when they are well packed, about 200 weight; but I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complained that the barrels of beef or pork of the Commiſſary's were not in well packed as they ought to be, owing to their making uſe of ſoldiers and others, whom I ſuppoſed did not underſtand the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo well, ſo that the barrels were but ſlighty packed. I have ſeen ſome that I ſuppoſe a quarter of meat might have been put in more, others that the deficiency was leſs. I ſhould imagine, if the reſt of the barrels were the ſame as thoſe I inſpected into, they would not have averaged more than 170 pounds each.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Did I not, when it was determined in the Council of Officers that was held the 20th of June, 1777, reſpecting the holding Mount Independence and evacuating Ticonderoga, expreſs my opinion that it would be impoſſible to hold that poſt, when the other ſide of the Lake ſhould be abandoned?</p>
               <p>A. I remember perfectly well you did.</p>
               <p>

               <p>General St. Clair's queſtion. Do you know any inſtance of cowardice, treachery, or inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, that I was guilty of during my command at Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair admits, that in the number of men returned on command the 28th of June, there were about 457 on command in the garriſon.</p>

               <p>Major Dunn, Aid de Camp to General St. Clair, being ſworn, ſays:</p>
               <p>I arrived at Ticonderoga about the 18th of June, 1777. A day or two after my arrival I went round the lines on Ticonderoga, and found them much in the ſame ſituation as they were in November, 1776, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the redoubts on the low ground, which were evacuated, and a chain of new ones erected on the height between the old ſort and the right of the French lines. Theſe were nearly compleated. In ſome cannon were mounted, and a party of fatigue at work on the reſt. On Mount Independence I found a party of about 100 men, under the direction of Colonel Koſeiuſzko, erecting three redoubts in the rear of the Mount, and forming an abbatis, the old one having taken fire ſome time before, and was chiefly deſtroyed. One other party of about 150 men, under Colonel Baldwin, ſinking a number of piers in the paſſage between the two poſts. One other fatigue party, employed daily in bringing ſtores and proviſion from Lake George Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides theſe, Colonel Hay, the Quarter-Maſter General, had a party of Negroes, taken from the different regiments, as a conſtant fatigue, independent of the daily detail. There were two regiments of militia cutting logs for the piers then ſinking, theſe were likewiſe independent of the daily detail, and exempt from all other garriſon duty. All theſe parties of fatigue were continued as above, with very little alteration, till the evacuation took place. Being the only Aid de Camp belonging to General St Clair's family, moſt of the orders delivered were through me, and therefore I had the greateſt opportunities of ſeeing all parties that were ſent out; and after my arrival, I do not remember a day that parties were not ſent out on the eaſt or weſt, and frequently on both ſides of the Lake Champlain, to reconnoitre the Lake and woods. Thoſe parties conſiſted from 15 to 50 men. I do not recollect exactly the time the enemy firſt made their appearance on the Lake, but remember perfectly, after their appearing with their fleet at Split-Rock, that no party could be perſwaded (becauſe of the ſavages) to approach near enough to diſcover any thing of conſequence. They frequently fell in with the enemy's parties, but were always obliged to retire. In this ſtate we remained till the enemy landed on Three Mile Point, I think on the 30th of June; and on this occaſion I heard the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral complain that his garriſon was not in force to riſque a party large enough to do them any damage. This occaſioned the parties being reduced; ſometimes not more than one officer, and two or three men, was thought the moſt eligible mode to diſcover the movements of the enemy. A look-out boat was alſo ſtationed between the enemy's fleet and the Jerſey redoubt, to apprize the garriſon of any movement in the fleet. On the enemy's landing at the point, the General ordered all the proviſion and ſtores at Lake George Landing immediately removed into the lines; the batteaus and boats to be in readineſs to move to Fort George on the ſhorteſt notice. The enemy, advancing towards the lines, on the firſt or ſecond day of July took poſſeſſion of the heights between the landing and the old French lines. The boats were ordered to move to Fort George, and the troops poſted at the landing and ſaw-mills ordered into the garriſon, which was effected without any loſs. The communication between the garriſon and Lake George was now effectually cut off, the enemy being in poſſeſſion of the heights in our front. Their light parties made frequent attacks on our picket, which conſiſted of fifty men, poſted ſome diſtance in front of the lines. On thoſe occaſions, and every other alarm that came to my knowledge (and I believe none eſcaped me) the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral always appeared at the lines, going from right to left encouraging the troops, putting them in mind of the cauſe they were engaged in, telling them to keep themſelves cool, and not to throw away their fire if the enemy ſhould approach; that he wiſhed for nothing more than a ſerious attack, and did not doubt but we ſhould repulſe them if they did attack. Such was the General's perſonal attention to the poſts, and the movements of the enemy, after they landed at Three Mile Point, that I do not believe he ſlept one hour in four and twenty, on an average, till the evacuation took place. As to the quantity of proviſion I can ſay but little; but I recollect, ſoon after my arrival. General Schuyler's expreſſing great ſurprize that no magazines were formed at Albany, or any other place nearer than that, for the ſupply of the garriſon. He ſent Mr. Yancey immediately to the country, and preſſed him in the ſtrongeſt terms to ſpare no pains in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining proviſion for the poſt; that if the enemy ſhould come on, we ſhould be reduced by famine; adding, at the ſame time, that the neglect of the Commiſſaries had been ſuch, that he believed it would be ſerving the public to hang at leaſt one of the department.—The following are the particulars I recollect reſpecting the retreat. About eight o'clock in the evening, July 5. I ſaw the ammunition and cannon removing on board the veſſels and to Mount Independence. I was at this time ignorant of the retreat. About nine o'clock the ſame evening General St. Clair ſent me with orders to General Fermoy, that he ſhould direct all the ſtores, ammunition, cannon, baggage, &amp;c. to be taken to the foot of the hill on the eaſt ſide of the Mount, where they were to be put on board batteaus for Skeenſborough. I returned, after delivering the order, to Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, and was ſent by the General with orders to the Officer in the Jerſey redoubt, to continue firing his cannon every half hour towards the battery the enemy were erecting oppoſite to the redoubt till further orders. About twelve o'clock the ſame evening I was again ſent to Mount Independence. I found General Fermoy near his houſe, with his own baggage. I went to the landing, where I found Colonel Hay directing the loading the boats, with between three and four hundred men carrying down the ſtores, &amp;c. but, for want of proper orders and attention from General Fermoy, every thing appeared in the greateſt confuſion. About this time they began to ſtrike their tents on Mount Independence, all of which, I believe, were put on board the boats. At two o'clock General St. Clair left Ticonderoga, all the ſtores, ammunition, artillery and camp equipage from that ſide being removed, except the heavy cannon, which, from our ſmall number of men and want of draught cattle, could not then be removed. All the tents and hoſpital ſtores, moſt of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016141_0035_0F9C7A7625004E28"/>
and light cannon, were alſo removed from Mount Independence. Some proviſion, I cannot ſay what quantity, and moſt of the heavy cannon, were left; all the batteaus and boats were however loaded. About three o'clock in the morning the troops were put in motion for the evacuation, but General Fermoy having ſet fire to his houſe (contrary to poſitive orders) which lighted the whole Mount, and gave the enemy an opportunity of ſeeing every movement we made, it damped the ſpirits of our own troops; the militia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments puſhed out of the Mount in diſorder, and were followed by a number of continental troops; the guards from Ticonderoga had alſo to paſs the light, and ruſhed forward in confuſion. The General at this time rode to the front, and obliged them to halt, and formed a line of march in rank and file, the roughneſs of the country and badneſs of the road permitting no other. Having effected this, he returned to the rear, which ſtill remained at the foot of the Mount. It was near four in the morning when the rear began to march. Colonel Francis, who commanded the rear guard, followed immediately after, and the line continued in good order till we arrived at Hubbarton, where the whole were halted to refreſh. The halt was near two hours. Moſt of the ſtragglers and rear guard having joined us, the army was again put in motion. The rear guard here was given to Colonel Warner, with orders to halt about one and a half mile ſhort of the main body, which would remain that night at Caſtle-Town, about ſix miles from Hubbarton, and to march in the morning by four, and join the main body. In the morning the General paraded the army, and waited near two hours for the rear guard. About ſeven o'clock a firing began on Warner's party, and on enquiry found he had halted at Hubbarton. The General expreſſed his ſurprize that his orders were diſobeyed. He diſpatched myſelf and Major Livingſton to order two militia regiments, that had halted between the main body and Warner, to reinforce him (theſe regiments were commanded by Colonel Bellows) and if the enemy ſhould appear in much ſuperior force, that Warner ſhould retreat to Rutland, where the main body would be to cover him. Thoſe regiments of militia refuſed to go up, tho' poſitively commanded, and afterwards intreated, by Colonel Bellows. This delay occaſioned Warner's retreat to Rutland, where the main body received him. The militia regiments returned, and although myſelf on horſeback, and three miles from the main body, they arrived there with me. I rode expreſs.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Beſides the parties you have mentioned on fatigue, do you recollect whether there was a brigade ordered for fatigue on Mount Independence about the 23d of June?</p>
               <p>A. I do recollect there was a brigade ordered for fatigue on Mount Independence about that time, which was excluſive of the parties for fatigue I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the time General St. Clair received information of the ſtrength and deſigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did General St. Clair remove any of his baggage from Ticonderoga at any time previous to the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. No part of it. His ſon went off, I believe, about a week before, but did not even carry all his own baggage with him. About the time General St. Clair's ſon went away, General Fermoy's baggage was removed from Head-Quarters to Mount Independence, he having lived with the General until that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What diſtance is Split-Rock from Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. About thirty-ſeven miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What diſtance is Gilliland's Creek from Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. About forty-two miles.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Livingſton, Aid de Camp to General Schuyler, being ſworn, ſays:</p>
               <p>About the middle of June, 1777, General St. Clair (agreeable to orders from General Schuyler) took upon himſelf the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. A few days after I went to Ticonderoga, in company with General Schuyler. After being there a few days. General Schuyler found it neceſſary for the ſervice to return to Albany, and the command in that department continued in General, St. Clair, with whom I had the honour of ſerving during the ſiege and on the retreat. Previous to the enemy's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before Ticonderoga, every method was made uſe of to gain intelligence of their movements and intentions. For this purpoſe ſcouting parties, properly officered, were kept out on the eaſt and weſt ſides of Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Theſe parties were generally ſelected from a corps of rangers, who had been accuſtomed to ſervices of this kind. The General did not confine his attention to the article of intelligence alone. No meaſures were neglected to ſtrengthen the works on both ſides of the Lake. Fatigue parties were daily employed in this duty, and the direction of them generally committed to Colonel Koſeiuſzko, an active officer, who acted as an aſſiſtant engineer in the northern department. The obſtructions of the navigation at Lake Champlain was alſo attended to. Beſides a very ſlight boom, which had been thrown acroſs the Lake during the command of General Gates, large caſſoons were ſunk between Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, altho' this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous work was not compleated when the evacuation took place. On the 26th of June, or thereabouts, our ſcouts obſerved an encampment of the enemy at Crown-Point, fifteen miles from Ticonderoga. From this time it became exceedingly difficult to procure any intelligence of the ſtrength or movements of the enemy, as the woods between us and Crown-Point were ſo infeſted with ſavages as to render it exceedingly hazardous to ſend ſmall parties that way, and the force of the garriſon was too weak to juſtify the detaching a large number. Not many days after, I think it was on the laſt of June, the enemy's gun-boats appeared off Three Mile Point. The ſame day there was a ſkirmiſh between a ſcout from the garriſon and the enemy. Our party were worſted, and obliged to retire with a little loſs. A conſiderable body of the enemy then took poſſeſſion of Mount-Hope. This height commanded the road between Ticonderoga and the North Landing of Lake George. It had been fortified by us the preceding year, but was diſmantled long before General St. Clair's arrival in that quarter. The old block-houſe at the north end of Lake George was ſtill in our hands. A ſubaltern's guard was left in it, to protect the public ſtores which were lying at that landing. The enemy did not ſuffer this officer to remain long in peaceable poſſeſſion; they attacked him with ſmall arms, and were repulſed. The General, aware of the dangerous ſituation of the block-houſe, and that the ſmall garriſon there muſt ſoon be overpowered by numbers, or be obliged to ſubmit on the appearance of artillery, judged it neceſſary to order them within the lines. This was effected juſt in time, and without loſs. The Communication between Ticonderoga and Lake George, by the main road, was now entirely cut off, which rendered it impracticable to bring the ſtores from the Lake within the fort. There was now
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016141_0036_0F9C7A77A54AB120"/>
great danger of their falling into the enemy's hands. To prevent a loſs of this kind, the General ordered the ſtores to be immediately put on board the batteaus, and carried back to Fort George, on the ſouth ſide of the Lake. This ſervice was executed without loſs, and no further communication poſſible between Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and the country by the way of Lake George. The enemy continued to make their approaches on the Ticonderoga ſide of the Lake. It was impoſſible, from the weakneſs of the garriſon, and the great extent of works we had to defend, to give them much interruption in their approaches. But the movement of the enemy, which gave the greateſt alarm to the garriſon, was the very rapid progreſs they made in clearing a road, and getting artillery on Sugar Hill or Mount Defiance. This proceeding was the more ſurpriſing, as it had been in agitation during the command of General Gates (in the fall of 1776, after our misfortune on Lake Champlain, when an attack on Ticonderoga was daily apprehended) to occupy that height with artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, but was judged to be impracticable. This hill had ſuch an entire command of Ticonderoga, that the enemy might have counted our very numbers, and enfiladed every part of our works. After poſſeſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this commanding height, it would have required but a few hours more to inveſt us on all ſides. This might have been effected by only occupying the ground on the eaſt ſide of Lake Champlain below Mount Independence, where the paſs from the Lake to Eaſt Creek is very narrow. Had this taken place, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the country had been at an end, no further ſupplies of proviſion or men could have reached us, nor would a retreat, in caſe of neceſſity, then been practicable. But before this was effected, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a Council of War to retire from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. This reſolution was entered into on the evening of the 5th of July, and very early in the morning of the 6th the troops left the ground. Meaſures for the evacuation were concerted with the greateſt ſecrecy, to keep the enemy ignorant of our deſigns. The centinels within the works were ordered to challenge no perſon that night. This order I carried myſelf to the guards on Ticonderoga, though I was ignorant of the reaſon of ſuch an order. The guns at the French lines were ſpiked; but, to amuſe the enemy, the Jerſey battery kept up a regular fire during the night. The General alſo ſent me to the old French redoubt, which commanded the bridge between Ticonderoga and the Mount, to order the officer commanding the artillery there not to ſpike the guns in that redoubt until further orders, as this redoubt might have been of ſervice in covering our troops on their paſſage acroſs the bridge; but I found that through ſome miſtake thoſe guns had already been ſpiked. What ſtores it was poſſible to remove in the courſe of one night, or rather in the ſpace of a few hours, were put on board the veſſels and batteaus in Lake Champlain, and ſent for Skeenſborough under Colonel Long, with the invalids and ſick of the hoſpital. Many barrels of powder, in particular, I remember were taken from the magazine, and put on board the veſſels, though they afterwards fell into the enemy's hands, or were blown up. The remainder of the army, under General St. Clair himſelf, retired by land. The rear guard was under the command of Colonel Francis. The army the firſt day reached Caſtle-Town, about thirty miles from Mount Independence. We made a halt of between one and two hours at Hubbarton, twenty odd miles from the ſame place. Before our leaving that town, the General ordered the rear guard to halt a mile or two ſhort of Caſtle-Town, where he intended to ſtay with the army that night. The General had no reaſon to doubt but theſe orders would have been attended to, and therefore was not a little ſurpriſed to find early the next morning that the rear guard was ſtill at Hubbarton, which is ſix miles diſtant from Caſtle-Town. At this diſtance from the army, they were attacked by General Frazer's corps. The rear guard was increaſed by many who at firſt did not belong to it. This was owing to the exceſſive bad roads and very heavy march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which prevented many, who were more feeble than others, from keeping pace with their regiments. Theſe were picked up by the rear guard, agreeable to orders. At the time of the engagement, I imagine it could not amount to leſs than 1000 men. The moment the firing was heard at Caſtle-Town, the General determined to ſupport the rear guard at Hubbarton. The troops at Caſtle-Town were already under arms, and ready to march when the firing was firſt heard. They were then ordered to keep their ground, and Major Dunn and myſelf were diſpatched with orders from the General to Colonel Bellows, who lay with his and another militia regiment between Caſtle-Town and Hubbarton. Our orders were to direct Colonel Bellows to march with thoſe two regiments immediately to the aſſiſtance of Colonel Francis, and to aſſure Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows at the ſame time that they ſhould be farther ſupported, if neceſſary. In riding towards Hubbarton we were met by theſe regiments which were marching with ſpeed towards Caſtle-Town. We delivered our orders, but could not prevail upon either regiment to reinforce the rear guard; though, in juſtice to Colonel Bellows, it muſt be ſaid, he was in the rear of the regiment, and warmly perſuaded them to go to the field of action. an unaccountable panic had ſeized his men, and no commands or intreaties had any effect on them. Finding it impoſſible to turn theſe regiments to this neceſſary piece of ſervice, we rode on towards the ſeene of action, to find how matters were ſituated there, and report to the General; but we had not proceeded far before we were met by Capt. Chadwick, with about 30 men. Capt. Chadwick had juſt left the field, and informed us that the action was at an end, that our men were diſperſed, that the communication between us and Hubbarton was cut on, ſo that we ſhould run the greateſt riſque of being made priſoners if we proceeded any further that way, and that the enemy were in poſſeſſion of the field of battle, in great force. The firing (which had heen very ſmart) having ceaſed, countenanced this intelligence, and we returned to Caſtle-Town and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the General of it. General St. Clair now thought it unneceſſary to ſend any further reinforcement to Hubbarton, and prepared to purſue his march. But here I muſt not forget to mention the conduct of the General towards two eaſtern regiments of militia, commanded, I believe, by Hale and Learned. Theſe regiments had ſhewed much diſcentent on the march the preceding day, and began now to be very cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous to be diſmiſſed. The General, apprized of this ſpirit of diſcontent in theſe regiments, ordered them to be paraded at Caſtle-Town, on the morning of the action at Hubbarton, and addreſſed them in perſon. He ſpoke on this occaſion in ſo forcible and pathetic a manner, that the regiments, aſhamed of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, conſented to remain with the army as long as there was any proſpect of immediate danger from the enemy; but the plundering diſpoſition they diſcovered on the march, and their other diſorderly behaviour, obliged the General a day or two afterwards to diſmiſs them from the army with diſgrace. The army after this continued their route through ſeveral towns, eaſt of Caſtle-Town, without any further interruption from the enemy, to Hudſon's River. I am very well perſwaded that it was General St. Clair's intention at firſt to have marched by Skeenſborough to Fort Edward; but an officer of one of our gallies on the Lake arrived
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016141_0037_0F9C7A7926E0D1E0"/>
at Caſtle-Town before we left it, and informed the General that the enemy were purſuing in force that way, who would reach Skeenſborough before he could poſſibly get there, and that ſome veſſels had already fallen into their power. This determined the General to change his intended route, and take the road he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did. Before we reached Hudſon's River, General St. Clair diſpatched me to inform General Schuyler of the ſituation of his army. So far as I had an opportunity of obſerving General St. Clair's conduct, it reflects high honour on him. Previous to, during the ſiege, and on the retreat, he gave proofs of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, activity and courage. The garriſon were always under arms at their proper poſts before ſun-riſe, and frequently before day-break. The General was always out on theſe occaſions himſelf, and was an example of vigilance to the ſoldiery. I do not remember, tho' I lived in the ſame quarters with him the greater part of the time during the ſiege, that he ever undreſſed himſelf at night. All night, indeed, he would ſcarcely ever permit himſelf to ſleep. If he did, it was not above an hour or two, tho' the gentlemen about him would frequently obſerve that he would certainly injure his health unleſs he indulged himſelf with more ſleep. In caſe of alarms, which were very frequent, he always appeared at the lines, encouraging the ſoldiery by his preſence and exhortations. On the retreat, he preſerved as much order in the army as was poſſible thro' ſuch bad roads, and ſo rough a country.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the time General St. Clair received information of the ſtrength and deſigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair, having concluded the teſtimony in his behalf, deſires the Court to give him time to make his defence.</p>
               <p>The Court, taking into conſideration the General's deſire, do give him till the 21ſt inſtant for that purpoſe.</p>

It ſeems to me a very extraordinary proceedure, to be tranſporting proviſion from Fort Edward to the Lake, and then bringing it back for the uſe of that garriſon, and muſt ariſe from the greateſt inattention in the Commiſſary.

                     <p>MY ſcout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It conſiſted of three men only, the beſt of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for the purpoſe. The woods are ſo full of Indians that it is difficult for parties to get through. I ſhall ſend off Whitcomb himſelf preſently, for intelligence I muſt have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, left he ſhould fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no ſmall deſire to have him in their power.</p>
                     <p>I ſent Colonel Warner to the Grants yeſterday, to raiſe a body of men to oppoſe the incurſions of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages that are gone by Otter-Creek, and have ordered him to attack them, and join me again as ſoon as poſſible. I am very happy to find the country was apprized of the march of that party before Colonel War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner got to Skeenſborough, as it will probably prevent their ſucceſs, and may end in their ruin.</p>
                     <p>We are going on with the neceſſary works on the Mount as faſt as poſſible, and have removed the moſt valuable of the ſtores and proviſion to that ſide. The bridge is in very little more forwardneſs to appearance than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will finiſh the getting timber for it.

               <p>Major General St. Clair, being requeſted to make his defence, ſays as follows:</p>
               <p>HOWEVER diſagreeable it may be to appear before a Court, a priſoner, and in the light of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, I am happy that my conduct, which has been ſo much cenſured at large, is at laſt to be enquired into by a proper judicatory, and that, after ſo long a delay, and ſo injurious a diſcrimination, public juſtice will be done upon a full, an impartial, and diſpaſſionate examination, and that it will be paſſed upon by men equal to the taſk of inveſtigating the truth, however artfully concealed, and determining upon the intrinſic merit of military actions, ſtripped of the glare that is ſometimes thrown upon them by ſucceſs, or the falſe lights in which they are often placed by conſequences. If I am guilty of all, or any of the charges againſt me, I wiſh not to eſcape puniſhment; but, conſcious of no crime, I hope by your ſentence, upon a candid compariſon of the teſtimony, to have thoſe ſtains wiped from my character, with which it has been ſuffered to remain too long blotted, and to be reſtored with honour to the arms of my friends and of my country. I ſay a proper judicatory, in contra-diſtinction to that before which the matter has been ſo long hung up, and which, from the proceedings, ſeems to have conſidered itſelf as analogous to a grand-jury, and has ſtrictly followed the ill example of grand juries in latter times; I mean their calling for, or admitting, ſuch evidence only as might ſerve to criminate, not conſidering how much the bare accuſation affects the reputation, or, where the perſon has any ſenſibility, how deeply it cuts into the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The inſtances of diſcrimination are ſo many, it is painful to mention them. But has it not taken place in the caſes of General Sullivan. General Wayne, General Maxwell, General Putnam, and others? They have all been accuſed of miſconduct, but General Schuyler and myſelf only have been forced to languiſh, in torpid inactivity, under the weight of the accuſation.</p>
               <p>The charges againſt me are of a very general and criminal nature, and have been ſtated by a Committee of Congreſs, upon the evidence collected by another Committee, appointed for the purpoſe of collecting evidence againſt the General Officers, who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated. Sir, all this formal interference of Congreſs, or Committees of Congreſs, gives the matter an air of vaſt importance, and impreſſes on the public an idea of great criminality. It will, therefore, be neceſſary for me, whilſt I defend myſelf againſt the charges directly, to take ſome notice of the reaſonings of the Committee, and to ſhew in ſome inſtances their fallacy, in others their futility. For which reaſon I beg leave to read the report.</p>
               <p>THE Committee, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and ſtate charges, againſt the General Officers, who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated, Report.</p>
               <p>That, having examined the papers to them committed, relative to the ſubject in queſtion, they find</p>
               <p>That, on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, Major General St. Clair took upon him the command at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that thoſe poſts were, by his orders, evacuated to the enemy on the 6th day of July following.</p>
               <p>That, by Deputy Commiſſary Avery's return of proviſion at Ticonderoga on the 25th of May, 1777, there were at that poſt 1400 barrels of flour, and 661 barrels of beef; which he ſtated as ſufficient proviſion in flour for 4000 men during 66 days, and in beef for 75 days.</p>
               <p>That, by Deputy Commiſſary Yancey's return of proviſion remaining on hand at Ticonderoga the 20th of June, 1777, there were 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, 784 barrels of pork, and 48 barrels of hard bread, beſides peaſe, Indian meal, ſugar, coffee, chocolate, molaſſes, wine, rum, ſalt, candles and hog's-lard.</p>
               <p>That, on or about the 5th of July, 1777, as appears by Jeſſe Leavenworth's affidavit, a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fat cattle arrived at Ticonderoga.</p>
               <p>That, by the general return of the troops on the 14th of June, 1777, preſent at Ticonderoga and on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and which we ſuppoſe to be in the <hi>environs,</hi> there were

               <p>That General St. Clair informed the Council of War held on the 5th of July, 1777, that 900 militia had joined him. That Jeſſe Leavenworth ſwears they were of the Grants; and General St. Clair, in his letter to Congreſs, July 14, ſays they joined on the 5th. That the whole force in Ticonderoga, on the 5th of July, 1777, was 5639 men and officers, of which a number, not exceeding 639, could be conſidered as ſick.</p>
               <p>That, on the 13th of June, 1777, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that two men from Canada, taken priſoners, informed him that the Britiſh army in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada were aſſembling, to the amount of about 10,000 men, as faſt as poſſible, to croſs the Lake, and attack Ticonderoga; and that he might depend upon it their fleet would appear in a fortnight at fartheſt.</p>
               <p>That, on the 18th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that four of the enemy's veſſels were lying within a mile of the hither ſide of <hi>Split-Rock</hi>; that on the day before the enemy's Indians had taken two priſoners, who had ſtrolled from his camp unarmed; and that he thought the enemy's main army was not far off.</p>
               <p>That, on the 14th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that the evening before he had received information, from a ſcouting party, the enemy were encamped on both ſides of Gilliland's Creek, and that they were very numerous.</p>
               <p>That, on the 25th of June, General St. Clair wrote to Congreſs, that he was not able to diſcover whether the enemy were in force or not; that ſeven of their veſſels arrived at Crown-Point the preceding evening; and that others of their fleet were four or five miles lower down.</p>
               <p>That, on the 30th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that the enemy having advanced to the Three Mile Point, the alarm was given; that his people were in the beſt diſpoſition poſſible; and that he had no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, ſhould they think proper to attack him.</p>
               <p>That it does not appear the enemy did attack General St. Clair; yet, nevertheleſs, on the 5th of July he called a Council of War, and deſired their opinion, whether he ſhould wait the attack at the Ticonderoga lines, or whether the whole of the troops ſhould be drawn over to Mount Independence, the more effectually to provide for the defence of that poſt. Whereupon the Council were unanimouſly of opinion, that it was impoſſible, with their force (then ſtated by General St. Clair to be 2089 rank and file, beſides the corps of artillery, 900 militia, and 124 artificers unarmed) to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and ſtores ſhould be removed that night, if poſſible, to Mount Independence. That the General alſo put another queſtion, whether, after a retreat to Mount Independence, they ſhould be in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion defend that poſt? or, in caſe it could not be defended, whether a retreat into the country would be practicable? Upon theſe points, the Council unanimouſly concluded that a retreat ought to be undertaken as ſoon as poſſible, and that they ſhould be very fortunate if it could be effected. And in purſuance of this determination Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were abandoned between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 6th of July, 1777, General St. Clair having, as appears by Jeſſe Leavenworth's affidavit, eight days before ſent his ſon and baggage from Ticonderoga to Fort George.</p>
               <p>That General St. Clair, in his letter to the Hon. John Jay, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> dated July 25, 1777. writing of the evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, ſays, That had the opinion of the Council been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it was, it (meaning the evacuation) would nevertheleſs have taken place, as he knew it to be impoſſible to defend the poſts with their numbers.</p>
               <p>That the ſick at Ticonderoga, and the public ſtores of ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing, were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>That on the 20th of June, 1777. a Council of War was held at Ticonderoga, Generals Schuyler and St. Clair being preſent, wherein it was determined, that Ticonderoga and Mount Independence ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as long as poſſible, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and <hi>ſtores</hi>; that, if either of thoſe poſts muſt be evacuated, the former ſhould be evacuated; that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient; and that repairing the old and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention.</p>
               <p>That, by Jeſſe Leavenworth's affidavit, it appears there was not a ſtroke ſtruck to fortify Mount Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that no parties were ſent to annoy the enemy, though the troops were healthy, courageous, and deſirous to improve every advantage againſt them.</p>
               <p>That, by the determination of the Council of War on the 5th of July, it appears the enemy had then nothing more to do to compleat their inveſtiture of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, than to occupy the neck of land, a ſpace of three quarters of a mile between the Lake and the Eaſt Creek, and to poſſeſs themſelves of the Narrow, between them and Skeenſborough.</p>

               <p>That, on the 23d of June, the abovementioned guards were reduced from 178 to 95 men; the fatigue party from 326 to 250 men; and 78 privates, under proper officers, were ordered for the detail of guards at Mount Independence; all to continue till further orders.</p>
               <p>That the 26th of June was the firſt day the troops were drawn up at their alarm-poſts, ordered to diſcharge their loaded pieces, and to clean them; and it was but on this day that a ſignal was given in orders, in caſe of an attack at the French lines, or at Mount Independence.</p>
               <p>That, on the 29th of June, it was ordered that a ſcout, conſiſting of a ſubaltern, a ſerjeant, and twenty privates, ſhould be ſent out every morning, one hour before gun-fire; the fatigue party being then increaſed to 310 privates, the other guards continuing as before, 173 privates, without any addition till the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the poſts.</p>
               <p>Upon which ſtate of evidence, your Committee, in order to ground their charges againſt Major General St. Clair, beg leave to remark;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> That, on the 13th of June, General St. Clair was poſſeſſed of an information, from two priſoners taken in Canada, that the Britiſh forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as faſt as poſſible againſt him, and that he might expect their arrival in three weeks at fartheſt. That as, on the 18th of June, four of the enemy's veſſels were lying on the hither ſide of Split-Rock, and on the 24th ſeven of them were at Crown Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both ſides of Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Creek, and he was informed by his ſcouts that they were very numerous; ſo from theſe circumſtances it appears General St. Clair had ſubſtantial reaſon to confide in what the priſoners had told him relative to the intentions and ſtrength of the enemy, and that he ought at this time to have taken his final reſolution, either to ſtand an attack, or to retreat with his ſtores, the preſervation of which was a principal object in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Council of War on the 20th of June. Therefore it appears that General St. Clair's neglecting to form his deciſive opinion at this time, or at a later day, ſo as to allow him a ſufficient opportunity to retreat with his troops, ſick, ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> deprive the enemy of ſhelter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That General St. Clair, on the 24th of June, was informed by his ſcouts the enemy were very numerous, and yet, nevertheleſs, on the next day he wrote to Congreſs, that he was not able to diſcover whether the enemy were in force or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> That it General St. Clair found ſmall ſcouts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was his duty in due time to have ſent out reconnoitring parties, in ſuch force as might have aſſured him whether or not the enemy were in ſtrength, this being a moſt important point, as upon this he was to regulate his motions; and therefore his failure in ſending out ſuch parties in due time was a neglect, of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> That as Jeſſe Leavenworth ſwears General St. Clair did not annoy the enemy in their advance againſt, and inveſtiture of, the poſts under his care, although the troops were healthy, courageous, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of action, it appears the General did not to the utmoſt of his power oppoſe the operations of the enemy; and therefore that he is liable to the charge of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth.</hi> That as it was determined in the Council of War on the 20th of June, approved by General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention; and Jeſſe Leavenworth ſwears not a ſtroke was ſtruck for thoſe purpoſes; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decreaſed in number, and ſo continued at a time when it ſhould have been abundantly increaſed; ſo on theſe points the General is liable to be charged with a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, and with treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth.</hi> That as on the 25th of May, the Deputy Commiſſary rated that 1400 barrels of flour would, at an allowance of one pound each man <hi>per diem,</hi> ſerve 4000 men 66 days, and that 661 barrels of beef would ſerve the ſame number of men 75 days; and ſuppoſing that, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July incluſive, there were in Ticonderoga and Mount Independence 4739 men, and there does not appear to have been at any time between thoſe periods a greater number; ſo, eſtimating the conſumption of 4739 men, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July incluſive, upon the 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork, on the twentieth of June returned by Deputy Commiſſary Yancey as then actually remaining on hand, there did on the fourth of July remain, or ought, if proviſions had been regularly and properly iſſued, to be then remaining 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; a magazine of proviſions ſufficient to afford to the army on the 5th of July, amounting, by the arrival of the militia of the Grants, to 5639 men of all ranks, <hi>full allowance</hi> of proviſion in flour for 52 days, and in beef and pork for 32 days, excluſive of the conſiderable number of fat cattle that arrived at Ticonderoga on the fifth of July, the teams of oxen neceſſarily attending the poſt, and other ſtores ſpecified in the Commiſſary's return on the twentieth of June, and even ſuppoſing, as may not reaſonably be done, that no ſupply of flour had arrived after that day. And as this calculation has been liberally made, upon the quantity of proviſion
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:016141_0041_0F9C8035A59B1340"/>
actually in Ticondero on the twentieth of June, for the expenditure of which General St. Clair, at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander at the poſt, ought to be held reſponſible; therefore it clearly appears Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not abandoned upon a juſt principle of a want of proviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh.</hi> That as General St. Clair informed the Hon. Mr. Jay, that at the time of holding the Council of War on the 5th of July, he knew it to be impoſſible to defend the poſts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point at early at the 29th of June, the day that he ſent his ſon and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate effects from Ticonderoga to Fort-George, as a place of ſafety: That being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken at effectual meaſures for the preſervation of the public property, at leaſt equally with his own, claiming his earlieſt attention: That on the 30th of June, the enemy being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced againſt him ſo near as the Three Mile Point, it is incredible that he did not then know that they were in force: That it was his duty, <hi>at that point of time,</hi> to have finally determined either to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire: That if the laſt reſolution was taken, and, from his ſending off his ſon and baggage the day before, there is the ſtrongeſt preſumption that this reſolution was <hi>then</hi> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to ſend off the public ſtores, to deſtroy the works, and to evacuate the poſts without loſing a moment of time: And that by deferring to take any meaſures to retire till the laſt moment when he could poſſibly retreat oven with his effective troops, a moment when the ſick, ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing of the army muſt be abandoned and loſt, beſides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, General St. Clair appears chargeable with inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General, and with ſhamefully abandoning the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge. Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wiſhes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too extenſive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if ſuch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehenſible point of view, at the weakneſs of his defence being more obvious, his retreat ſhould have been earlier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon and made.</p>
               <p>Your Committee, having thus ſtated the points principally reſulting from the evidence collected againſt General St. Clair, recommend that a general court-martial be ordered to fit for the trial of Major General St. Clair, for the loſs of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, with the public ſtores; and that he be charged</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt. With Neglect of Duty</hi>; under the 5th article of the 18th ſection of the rules and articles of war— and that the charge be founded upon the firſt, third, fourth and fifth Remarks, reſpectively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second. With Cowardice, with Treachery, with Incapacity as a General,</hi> reſpectively; under the 5th article of the 18th ſection of the rules and articles of war—and that the charge be founded upon the fourth remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third. With Treachery</hi>; under the 5th article of the 18th ſection of the rules and articles of war— and that the charge be founded upon the fifth remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth. With inattention to the Progreſs of the enemy, with Treachery, with Incapacity as a General,</hi> reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; under the 5th article of the 18th ſection of the rules and articles of war—and that the charge be founded upon the ſeventh remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth. With ſhamefully abandoning the Poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge</hi>; under the 12th article of the 13th ſection of the rules and articles of war—and that the charge be founded upon the ſeventh remark.</p>
               <p>Finally, upon the caſe of Major General St. Clair, your Committee recommend that authenticated copies of the returns, letters, and determinations of courts-martial, referred to, be tranſmitted to the Judge-Advocate-General; that Eliſha Avery, James Yancey, Richard Varrick, Jeſſe Leavenworth, and the Colonels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the two battalions of Maſſachuſetts militia, whoſe time of ſervice was nearly expired at the evacuation of Ticonderoga, be ſummoned to give evidence at the trial of Major General St. Clair; and that he be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a copy of the remarks and charges againſt him.</p>
               <p>The firſt obſervation that naturally offers is, that the charges which have been exhibited to this Court have all been founded upon the <hi>ex parte</hi> affidavit of a Mr. Leavenworth, which (in moſt inſtances) he has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in open Court, and conſequently is entitled to no degree of credit, and upon my own letters to Congreſs and to General Schuyler, the Officer who commanded in chief in the northern department. It is ſingular, however, that charges of ſo high a nature againſt an officer of my rank ſhould be attempted to be ſupported (for ſupported I truſt they are not) by no other living witneſs than Mr. Leavenworth, a private man! a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the army! in ſome of the loweſt and vileſt occupations! who, if he had had capacity to judge, could not poſſibly have had proper information; that not an officer, of any rank whatſoever, has been called upon; and yet, had treachery, had neglect of duty, been committed,—had I been inattentive to the progreſs of the enemy,—had the poſts in my charge been ſhamefully abandoned,—or had I been guilty of cowardice,—they could not have eſcaped their notice altogether; nay, it was by them only they could probably hate been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. But this by the bye. Previous to any remarks upon, or application of, the teſtimony, I beg leave to inform the Court, that, before I left Philadelphia to take upon me the command of Ticonderoga, Congreſs had received information, which they credited, that the principal part of the enemy's troops in Canada were ordered round by St. Lawrence to join General Howe; that no ſerious attempt would be made upon Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga; at moſt, it would be a diverſion only. This was communicated to me by Mr. Hancock, then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and I have his authority to mention it to this Court. This circumſtance will ſerve as a key to many of my letters, and will account for my doubts about ſome intelligence I received after my arrival at Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga. And it appears from General Poor's teſtimony, that General Gates had likewiſe, from them, received the ſame account.</p>
               <p>The firſt charge is neglect of duty, founded upon the firſt, third, fourth and fifth remarks, reſpectively.</p>
               <p>The firſt remark is, "that on the 13th of June I was poſſeſſed of an information, from two priſoners taken in Canada, that the Britiſh forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as faſt as poſſible againſt me, and that I might expect their arrival in three weeks at fartheſt; that as, on the 18th of June, four of the enemy's veſſels were lying on the hither ſide of Split Rock, and, on the 24th, ſeven of them were at Crown-Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both ſides Gilliland's Creek,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016141_0042_0F9C8036970591E8"/>
and that I was informed by my ſcouts they were very numerous; ſo, from theſe circumſtances, it appears I had ſubſtantial reaſon to confide in what the priſoners had told me relative to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ſtrength of the enemy, and that I ought at this time to have taken my final reſolution either to ſtand an attack, or to retreat with my ſtores, the preſervation of which was a principal object in the determinations of the Council of War on the 20th; therefore it appears, that neglecting to form my deciſive opinion at this time, or at a later day, ſo as to allow myſelf a ſufficient opportunity to retreat with my troops, ſick, ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing, and to deprive the enemy of ſhelter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty."</p>
               <p>It is true, that on the 13th of June I was poſſeſſed of an information, from two priſoners, that the Britiſh army amounted to about 10,000 men, and that they were making every preparation to croſs the Lake, to attack my poſts; but it is alſo true, that I conſidered theſe perſons as ſpies; that their information was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by two Frenchmen, who had been ſent into Canada by General Gates, for the expreſs purpoſe of gaining intelligence of the enemy's deſigns; that the information of theſe Frenchmen arrived at the ſame time, and was tranſmitted by the ſame conveyance to General Schuyler; as appears from my letter to him of June 13th.</p>
               <p>The information, Sir, of priſoners is generally doubtful; but that of perſons conſidered as ſpies muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſuſpected. I would therefore have been juſtifiable in not giving them credit, if I had not received contradictory intelligence. But when the Court conſider the opinion of Congreſs above-mentioned, and that the perſons actually were ſpies (the letter from Mr. Livius to General Sullivan, that has been publiſhed by the General, having been found upon one of them) and that their intelligence was contradicted by perſons of credit, they will think the concluſion I drew the natural and proper one—that they were ſent to deceive us, and were unworthy of belief. They will think that the enemy's advancing their veſſels to Crown-Point and Split Rock, and forming an encampment at Gilliland's Creek, as they did on the 18th and 24th of June (that place being at a diſtance, out of the reach of our parties, but not out of the way of obſervation) thereby to induce the diviſion of our troops, to reinforce the places on which they had no deſign, and to leſſen the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition where their army was to act effectually, was the very thing they ought to have done; and we all know the appearance of a great encampment can be made with very few troops. And this ſentiment at cofor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the poſition of their camp, which was a ſandy beach upon the ſhore of the Lake, where the creek falls into it, forty-two or three miles diſtant from Ticonderoga, as has been proven by General Wilkinſon, Major Dunn, and others, with a rough, broken, woody country betwixt them.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems I ought then, or at a later day, to have taken my deciſive reſolution to retreat, ſaving to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſufficient opportunity to bring off my troops, and every thing that was at the poſts, and to deprive the enemy of ſhelter at Ticonderoga, and that the not doing ſo was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>I ſuſpect, Sir, the Committee, who formed theſe charges, had no idea of the nature of a ſubordinate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. They would otherwiſe have known, that I had no power to form or execute any ſuch reſolution, and that my juſtification for evacuating the poſts at all muſt depend upon the neceſſity of the caſe. I did what my duty required me. I gave the earlieſt notice to the Commanding Officer of the department, and ſtood ready to execute his commands. But I am perſwaded that, had it been in my power to have taken my final reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, and upon the intelligence I had received I had abandoned the poſts, altho' every thing had been ſaved which has ſince been loſt, the charges of treachery and cowardice would have been rung much louder, and preſſed home more ſtrongly, and with more virulence, if poſſible, than in the preſent caſe. I ſhould have heard, that no deciſive operation ſhould be founded on the vague report of priſoners or deſerters, often ignorant, almoſt always ill informed; but that to abandon a poſt on the information of perſons I ſuſpected to be, and actually were, the enemy's ſpies, or from the view of an encampment upwards of forty miles off, and that only ſeen acroſs a lake ſix or eight miles broad, could proceed from no other than one of thoſe ſources, or from perfect ſtupidity; and this Court, from whom I expect a very different deciſion, would have joined in that opinion, and condemned me to the puniſhment I had juſtly merited. But, beſides all this, if the Council of War was to guide, it was out of my power to take any ſuch meaſure; for the reſolution of the Council is, that both Ticonderoga and Mount Independence are to be held as long as they can be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores. When the ſafety of the troops and ſtores became doubtful, Ticonderoga, not Mount Independence, was to be evacuated.</p>
               <p>The ſecond article upon which the charge of neglect of duty is founded is, "That if I found ſmall ſcouts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was my duty, in due time, to have ſent out reconnoitring parties, in ſuch force as might have aſſured me whether or not the enemy were in ſtrength, and that this was not done."</p>
               <p>Had not the Committee been totally ignorant of the nature of the country in which theſe parties were to act—had they given any attention to the returns of my army, which were before them, or credit to my letters to General Schuyler, of which they had the peruſal, this article would never have made its appearance. Had it ever occurred to them that the enemy proceeded by water, and that the only debarkation we hear of was at Gilliland's Creek, forty miles and upwards from Ticonderoga, and that they proceeded from thence by water again, we ſhould not have heard this ſtory of reconnoitering parties, of which, I am morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they themſelves had no determinate idea. My whole army would not have formed one party ſuch as they ſeem to think ought to have been ſent out frequently. I have proven that ſmall parties were ſent out, not only frequently but conſtantly; and altho' they were but ſmall parties, they were as ſtrong as the ſtate of my garriſon, and the works in hand, would allow. It is true, indeed, I obtained by them no certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the enemy's force until they landed at Three Mile Point, nor was it poſſible before; they poſſeſſed neither the gifts of divination, nor walking upon the water; but they could give me information if any part of the enemy's army were advancing by land, and this was all I could expect from them, except that, in that caſe, they might have brought off ſome priſoners.</p>
               <p>The returns prove the ſtrength of my army—the orderly book the daily guards—and I have proven, by General Poor, Colonel Baldwin, Colonel Koſeiuſzko, General Wilkinſon, and almoſt every witneſs, the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous fatigue parties and pickets. I leave it to the Court to judge if larger parties could have been ſpared to make diſcoveries. But ſuppoſing, for argument ſake, that my army would have afforded ſtronger reconnoitring parties, I contend that, until the enemy were landed, they would have been uſeleſs, and afterwards highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:016141_0043_0F9C803728851F88"/>
and that the ſending ſuch would have argued great want of Judgment. It would have been ſending two or three hundred men (and that number would perhaps have been thought a pretty good recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitring party) to certain deſtruction. They could not have marched thro' thick woods and rank herbage without being diſcovered, if the enemy's parties were the leaſt vigilant. If they were attacked at a diſtance, as they could not be ſupported, they muſt inevitably have fallen into the enemy's hands; if attacked within ſupporting diſtance, they muſt ſtill have fallen, or a general action been brought on; for they could no otherwiſe have been ſupported, but by marching out to ſuſtain them, and then all the expence and time that had been laid out on the fortifications were thrown away. A General, entruſted with the defence of a poſt, who reduces himſelf to the neceſſity of fighting the enemy to ſupport his detachments, or who, by making large detachments and loſing them, puts it out of his own power to maintain his poſt, certainly diſcovers very little knowledge, and would juſtly be the object of cenſure at leaſt, if not of puniſhment. Had ſuch detachments been made from my army, one or other of theſe conſequences muſt have followed; they muſt have been when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or I muſt have riſked an action to bring them off: But I had not a force ſufficient for the defence of my poſts, much leſs to cope with the enemy in the field, therefore no ſuch detachments, as ſhould lay me under the neceſſity of attempting it, or be of any great moment if a misfortune happened to them, were made. But further, as very ſmall parties, three men for example, can approach an enemy without much danger of being diſcovered, which large parties cannot, and that theſe ſmall parties, from that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, have a better chance to make priſoners, to take off a centinel for example, to which they are fully adequate, and that the intelligence to be obtained from reconnoitring parties muſt depend, in a great meaſure, upon the priſoners they make, it follows that ſmall parties are the moſt proper, and fully anſwer every purpoſe of gaining intelligence that can be derived from the larger, without being ſubject to the ſame dangers. It likewiſe follows, that there was no neglect of duty in this inſtance, but, on the contrary, that the moſt proper methods for obtaining certain intelligence of the motions and force of the enemy were taken and purſued.</p>
               <p>The charge of neglect of duty is further grounded upon the affidavit of Mr. Leavenworth, who, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſwears that the enemy were not annoyed by me in their advance againſt, and inveſtiture of, the poſts under my care, though the troops were healthy, courageous, and deſirous of action, and therefore I am liable to the charges of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General. The Committee ſeem to be in doubt on which of the four to ſix, it is one or t'other, but, to make ſure of the matter, and ſwell the black liſt, they have directed that I be proſecuted upon each. It has been proven by Dr. Brown and Dr. Townſhend, the hoſpital ſurgeons, that the troops were not healthy, and their teſtimony will have weight. The Court will pleaſe to obſerve the contradiction betwixt what the Committee ſay Mr. Leavenworth ſwore, and what he actually ſwears before this Court; here he ſwears that he has ſeen parties go out of about twenty men, and that he once heard of a ſcalp being brought in; there he ſwore that they were not annoyed at all; perhaps he thought killing and ſcalping the ſavages employed by the enemy no annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! But it is needleſs to dwell upon this man's teſtimony, as, from his ſtation, he could not know much, and, from his obſervation, he actually knows very little.</p>
               <p>It is in proof to the Court, by a number of witneſſes, that parties were conſtantly out, and that they frequently were engaged with the enemy; and, by Colonel Stevens, that every annoyance was given to the enemy by the artillery, from every quarter, from the firſt of their appearance until the evacuation. But if the Committee meant that no large detachments were ſent to annoy the enemy, it is granted; and the reaſons that have been already given for not ſending out large reconnoitring parties apply ſo directly, it would be treſpaſſing on the patience of the Court to repeat them.</p>
               <p>The laſt ground for the charge of neglect of duty is, "that, notwithſtanding it had been determined in a Council of War on the 20th of June, that the repairing the old works, and adding new ones on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention, Mr. Leavenworth ſwears not a ſtroke was ſtruck for theſe purpoſes." Here Mr. Leavenworth gives the Committee the ſlip again; for he ſwears before the Court, not that there was not a ſtroke ſtruck for theſe purpoſes, but that he has heard there were many ſtrokes ſtruck; he has heard of what he calls ſome ſmall works flung up on the ſouth end of Mount Independence; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the map, and explanation by Colonel Koſeiuſzko, theſe were lines and three redoubts, for 1500 men at leaſt. But, forſooth, there were none erected where he expected, and <hi>he</hi> did not think the works ſuitable to cover the men. He acknowledges he has ſeen parties of axe-men ſent from the parade. He could not ſuppoſe they were ſent to ſtrike no ſtrokes; and it is ſcarce conceivable that a perſon, who on other occaſions, as much out of his way, was ſo very inquiſitive, ſhould not have had the curioſity to aſk ſome one what thoſe men were going to do with their axes, if his occupation as a ſuttler had not given him an opportunity to know it.</p>
               <p>Theſe palpable contradictions betwixt the evidence this man has given to the Committee, and what he has declared to the Court, will, I hope, put a ſtop to all <hi>ex parte</hi> enquiries for the future; in which caſe, I ſhall the leſs regret the injuries I have myſelf ſuſtained from them. But the Committee go on, and ſay, in further ſupport of the charge, "that from the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decreaſed, and continued ſo at a time when it ought to have been abundantly increaſed." It is true the parties furniſhed by the daily details were decreaſed; but I have proven, by a cloud of witneſſes, that circumſtance notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the fatigue parties were abundantly increaſed, and continued ſo; nay, that almoſt my whole army were conſtantly employed in repairing the old and conſtituting new works; and that, ſo far from being guilty of a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, in that reſpect, I did every thing in my power to put the poſts in a proper poſture of defence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond charge is cowardice, treachery, and incapacity as a General, directed to be tried upon the 5th article of the 18th ſection of the Rules and Articles of War, and founded on the fourth remark of the Committee.</p>
               <p>By Mr. Leavenworth's teſtimony again are theſe horrid accuſations to be ſupported; not in a direct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but by inference and deduction from that part of it, which the Committee in the above remark ſay he gave them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. "that the enemy were not annoyed in the advance to, and inveſtiture of, the poſts;" but which he, in part, has contradicted here, as I obſerved before, and which, by Colonel Stevens, General
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:016141_0044_0F9C8037E34CE550"/>
Wilkinſon, Colonel Livingſton, Major Dunn, and others, I have proven to be falſe. The inferences of conſequence are falſe likewiſe, and of courſe the charges groundleſs. But I believe it is the firſt inſtance where charges of a capital nature have been brought againſt an officer by deduction, without a ſhadow of proof to ſupport them; and cowardice and treachery are capital crimes, although the Committee have directed them to be tried by an Article of War to which no capital crime whatever can be referred, having been expreſly provided for crimes not capital. I wave, however, any advantage that might be taken of this. My reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or my ſafety, ſhall never depend upon the blunders of any ſett of men who may think proper to accuſe me; but, when proof is wanting, candour will never attribute actions to the worſt cauſe from which they could poſſibly flow; good-nature will ever aſcribe them to the beſt. Hitherto, however, I have experienced very little of either. But my birth, Sir, my education, my connections, both in this country and in Britain, my ſtation in life, my children (if to theſe had not been added the habitudes of early life) as they were the beſt pledges, ſo they ſhould have ſecured me from the imputation of thoſe moſt ſhameful vices, from which the meaneſt of the people are generally free. But my reputation reſts not on that bottom. I am happy in the general good opinion of the army, which is never beſtowed upon cowards, nor has all the calumny that I have been loaded with ſhaken me a ſingle friend. The Court have the fulleſt evidence, that on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I have given demonſtrations of an active, as well as paſſive, courage; my conduct in that reſpect has been uniform on all occaſions; and this is confirmed by the concurring teſtimony of many of the principal officers of the army, with ſome of whom I have been, perſonally, in almoſt every action that has happened during the war. From thence they muſt conclude, that, whatever might have been the motives for my evacuating Ticonderoga, it could not have been owing to cowardice, and chat the charge is falſe, malicious and ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>Treachery, Sir, is a crime it is impoſſible to prove, poſitively, not to have been committed. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary, in order to fix it, that ſome actual commiſſion ſhould be proven; but as this has not been attempted, it is enough alone to overthrow the charge. But I beg leave to inform the Court, that when Congreſs appointed me to the command of a regiment, I conſidered it as the call of my country, that could admit of no refuſal. I reflected that ſome knowledge acquired by ſtudy, and the ſervice of the whole laſt war (during which I was in almoſt every ſiege and every action of conſequence) put me in a ſituation to be of ſome uſe to our army in its infant ſtate. My country, I thought, had a right to my ſervices, and to every advantage that could be derived from my experience. I therefore, without heſitation, reſigned an honourable and profitable employment I then held under the crown, to qualify myſelf for that offered to me by Congreſs, notwithſtanding it was not of one half the yearly value. I quitted die ſweets of a retirement I was fond of, the pleaſures of domeſtic life, and the care of the education, and proviſion for a riſing family, (both of which claimed my cloſeſt attention) for the toils, the hardſhips, and the extraordinary expences of war. Had this the appearance of treachery? And yet, for theſe, I have met with the ungracious return of thoſe cruel accuſations, though, ſurely, they were not the natural returns to ſuch a conduct. What farther promotion Congreſs were pleaſed to confer upon me was totally unſolicited. I received it with gratitude, determined that my actions ſhould be the beſt proof of the ſenſe I had of the honour they had done me; nor have I been therein diſappointed. My country now reaps the ſolid advantages of my conduct, whilſt I am loaded with obloquy and abuſe. I forgive it, however, but I can never forget that the channels of juſtice have been ſhut againſt me, and that for thirteen long, long months, I have been hung up to be ſtung by the envenomed tongue of malice, and pointed at by the finger of folly. But the ſentence of this Court will, I truſt, place me once more in that honourable point of view, from which I have not deſerved to be removed, having been careful to obſerve that maxim of Horace, <hi>Nil conſcire ſibi, nulla palleſcere culpa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How incapacity came to be a crime, unleſs in thoſe who made the appointments (for I muſt repeat it, no office I have ever held, or now hold, under Congreſs, was ever ſolicited by me) or by what Article of War it is triable, I own I do not know. But this charge, with the others, has been made upon a ſuppoſition that I did not do every thing in my power to oppoſe the operations of the enemy in their advance againſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of, the poſts in my charge; but it is in full proof to the Court that every thing was done, which pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dictated, and circumſtances would allow. It follows, that this is equally groundleſs with the others.</p>
               <p>The third charge is treachery again, under the ſame Article of War, to which, at I obſerved before, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred, and grounded upon the fifth remark of the Committee, which is, "that as it had been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a Council of War on the 20th of June, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence claimed immediate attention, and Jeſſe Leavenworth ſwears not a ſtroke was ſtruck for theſe purpoſes; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decreaſed in number, and ſo continued, at a time when it ſhould have been abundantly increaſed, I am liable to be charged with treachery." I have already ſo fully refuted theſe matters in the charge for neglect, of duty, which is founded on the ſame allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that I think it unneceſſary to take up the time of the Court with a repetition of the ſame arguments. But as it may, perhaps, appear odd, that the number of men actually employed on theſe duties differs ſo widely from the orderly book, I will here, once for all, account for it. I never approved of putting all orders into the book. Accidents frequently happen to the copies; deſerters carry them off to the enemy, who thereby become perfectly acquainted with every thing you are doing; to prevent which, as our works were ſo very incompleat, a great many of my orders were verbal. Yet I dare ſay, had the Committee attended to it, they would have found in the orderly book frequent orders for whole brigades (beſides the daily details) to parade at certain hours, and take their orders from their reſpective Brigadiers; and had they called upon any officer of the army, they would have been informed theſe brigades were ſent upon fatigue, repairing the old and conſtructing new works, which has been proven to the Court in the fulleſt manner.</p>
               <p>The fourth charge is, inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, treachery, and incapacity as a General again, founded on the ſeventh remark of the Committee; which is, "that as General St. Clair informed the Honourable Mr. Jay, that, at the time of holding the Council of War on the 5th of July, he knew it to be impoſſible to defend the poſts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point as early as the 29th of June, the day that he ſent his ſon and private effects from Ticonderoga to Fort George, as a place of ſafety. That, being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken as effectual meaſures for the preſervation of the public property, at leaſt equally with his own, claiming his earlieſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016141_0045_0F9C8039032F75D0"/>
That on the 30th of June, the enemy being advanced to Three Mile Point, it is incredible that he did not then know they were in force. That it was his duty, <hi>at that point of time,</hi> to have finally determined to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire. That if the laſt reſolution was taken, and, from the ſending off his ſon and baggage the day before, there is the ſtrongeſt preſumption that this reſolution was <hi>then</hi> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to have ſent off the public ſtores, to deſtroy the works, and to evacuate the poſts without loſing a moment of time; and that by deferring to retire till the laſt moment when he could poſſibly retreat even with his effective troops, a moment when the ſick, ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing of the army muſt be loſt, beſides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, he appears to be chargeable with inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General." They appear to be again uncertain upon which charge to fix; but, to make ſure work of it, direct, as in the former caſe, that I be proſecuted for each, and upon the beforementioned Article of War, which certainly cannot be applied to treachery. Bnt let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what all this amounts to. The Committee ſay that becauſe I wrote to Mr. Jay, that on the 5th of July I knew it to be impoſſible to defend the poſts with my numbers, it is natural to conclude that I knew it to be impoſſible to defend them with my numbers ſo early as the 29th of June; for that they muſt mean (if they mean any thing) by being "decided upon this point." But this is by no means the natural concluſion; the natural and candid concluſion is, that circumſtances might have changed betwixt theſe periods, and matters have come to my knowledge on or before the 5th of July, of which I was ignorant on the 29th of June, and which would fully juſtify a change of meaſures. But the reaſon they conclude in that manner is, that on that day I ſent my ſon and private effects to Fort George, as a place of ſafety; and this, I find by a former part of their report, is alſo the information of Mr. Leavenworth upon oath. Now it happens that, although I ſent my ſon on that day to Fort George, I ſent no part of my baggage there then, or at any other time; and this very reſpectable witneſs, Mr. Leavenworth himſelf, ſwears that I did not, to his knowledge. The account he has given of Head-Quarters being ſtripped, as he calls it, is ſo abſurd, that was there no other teſtimony to diſprove it, it would deſtroy itſelf. But his teſtimony before the Court contradicts, in almoſt every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the Committee ſay he has given to them. My ſon was a boy betwixt eleven and twelve years of age, who, on the information I have mentioned to have received from the Preſident of Congreſs, that there was no probability of an active campaign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had taken with me, that I might ſuperintend his education. He remained with me at Ticonderoga until matters wore a gloomy aſpect, and was then ſent to Fort George, on his way to Albany, where he was put to ſchool. In caſe of an attack, he would naturally have diſtreſſed me, and divided my attention; and this is the dreadful affair of ſending my ſon, that has been ſo often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and upon which ſo many baſe ungenerous comments have been made. I have proven beyond the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a doubt, that I never ſent away ſix-pence worth of my private effects, and that I took the moſt effectual meaſures for the preſervation of the public property, great part of which was brought off, whilſt my own was left a prey to the enemy. But it ſeems it is incredible that the enemy ſhould be at the Three Mile Point, where ſome of their veſſels arrived on the 30th of June, and that I ſhould not <hi>then</hi> know whether they were in force or not. The Committee have again forgot that the enemy were water-borne, and that at this time they had not debarked. Had that occurred to them, they would not have thought the matter ſo very incredible. I believe they would have thought it very probable. But they ſeem to have viewed one ſide of the picture only. I have proven to the Court, that from the number of ſavages, who kept my parties at a diſtance from the ſhores of the Lake, it was impoſſible to obtain any ſatisfactory account of the enemy's numbers until they were landed, which they began to be on the 30th of June, and with ſo much caution, as appears by my letter of that date to Gen. Schuyler, that I had very good reaſon to conclude they were not in force, and to exult in that conſideration too, hoping for an opportunity not only to have ſerved my country, but in ſome meaſure to have filled the expectations I knew the public had formed from me. The reſolution to retire was therefore not "<hi>then</hi> fully taken." But what idea of military movements muſt theſe gentlemen have? who conclude that an enemy at three miles diſtance is not immediately upon you, or who imagine that works may be deſtroyed, and ſtores, ammunition and cannon, &amp;c. removed, under the eye of a ſuperior and collected force. Sir, had a retreat been attempted upon the enemy's landing at Three Mile Point, and the ſteps purſued which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee have enumerated above, it is impoſſible, in the nature of things, but the army muſt have been cut off, or fallen priſoners into their hands. But, by our putting a good face upon the matter, and ſhewing a determination to hold both poſts, they were induced to divide their force, in order to inveſt us and reduce us by the more ſlow, but certain, method of regular approach; not that this method was neceſſary to them, for they might moſt certainly have carried us by aſſault at any time: But aſſaults are frequently very bloody things! and on that circumſtance I chiefly depended for rendering my ſmall garriſon ſerviceable to their country. I was in hopes the enemy would aſſault us, and ſome accounts that I had, that they were ſhort of proviſions, gave me ſome reaſon to expect it. I depended upon my troops—I was perſwaded they were brave, and I believe they too had confidence in me. Every order and every advice I gave them pointed directly to that object— and I ſtill believe that, had they attempted it, we ſhould have given ſo good an account of them, that the conqueſt of Ticonderoga would have terminated the operations of that campaign—but conquered it would have been, after all our exertions. Every letter I have wrote holds up the ſame idea, and I always ſpeak of an attack as contra-diſtinguiſhed from a ſiege; and the character of the General I was oppoſed to gave me reaſon to expect ſomething by aſſault or ſurprize. I mentioned to Congreſs, ſo early as the 25th of June, the great deficiencies in troops and proviſion, and the probability of my being obliged from theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to evacuate. The moment I was informed, with any tolerable degree of certainty, of their numbers, which I was not until the 3d of July from a priſoner and ſome deſerters (their information was confirmed by a ſpy I ſent into their camp the 3d and returned the 5th) and ſaw that they meant a regular ſiege, I was certain the defending the poſts effectually was impoſſible. The moment, however, which I choſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, as it was the only one was ever in my power to chuſe, ſo it was almoſt the only one after the enemy's landing at Three Mile Point in which the retreat could have been effected. I have fully proven that the ſick were not left behind nor loſt, that great part of the cannon, all the ammunition, the baggage and tents of the army, the hoſpital ſtores and part of the proviſion, were removed from Ticonderoga—as much as could at once have been removed at any prior time. Every boat was loaded. I think I have proven it to have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:016141_0046_0F9C803965E975A8"/>
and well conducted, and that the confuſion, occaſioned principally by the burning of General Fermoy's houſe, and his not circulating the orders to his brigade in proper time, was ſoon remedied.—I beg the Court to reflect one moment upon what was to be done, and now ſhort the time to do it in!—for, though the evacuation was reſolved on about three o'clock in the afternoon, we could not begin to carry it into execution until night came on, the enemy being in poſſeſſion of a high hill on the oppoſite ſide of the Lake, from whence they could ſee our every movement,—that it was the ſeaſon when the nights are at the very ſhorteſt, and that it was moreover moon-light,—and that the neceſſity of keeping the matter a ſecret, until the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evacuation, prevented any preparatory ſteps being taken to expedite the buſineſs, and they will be of the opinion that more was never done, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> in equal time; and if, in the different embarkations, ſome irregularities did happen, when every circumſtance is taken in—the ſuddenneſs of the thing—the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition every man would naturally have to ſave perhaps his little all—the confuſion the night alone is apt to occaſion—the diſtance every thing had to be carried, and their variety, the candid mind will be more apt to wonder that any order could be preſerved, than that ſome irregularities ſupervened. On this occaſion it would be great injuſtice not to acknowledge, that the officers were in general diligent and attentive, and the men ſilent and obedient to a wonder; the continental troops I mean; for the militia, Bellows's and Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's regiments excepted, held a very different conduct. Colonel Bellows exerted himſelf greatly in removing the cannon from the lines and embarking them, which he effected, notwithſtanding ſome difficulties that, I have ſince heard, were thrown in his way by an officer of the artillery. I was in a very particular manner obliged to General Poor, Colonel Long, Colonel Hay, and Colonel Stevens, to whoſe pains and aſſiduity it was chiefly owing that ſo much of the public property was taken off. It is true, however, the greateſt part of it fell afterwards into the enemy's hands at Skeenſborough, but not from any fault of mine. That was the only place to which they could have been removed; and had not my march been delayed, as has been ſhewn, by Colonel Warner's unfortunately taking upon himſelf to judge of and diſobey his orders, I ſhould have arrived at Skeenſborough time enough to have protected the ſtores, and probably to have cut off that party of the enemy which purſued them. I agree perfectly with the Committee, that the poſts, as the proper number of men for their defence were not ſent to them, ſhould have been evacuated earlier. But I did my duty. I apprized both Congreſs and General Schuyler of my ſituation, and the probable conſequences; and from one or other of them, if it was thought proper to evacuate the poſts, my orders were to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From theſe circumſtances, it appears that I have not been guilty of treachery or incapacity. But it is truly ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that gentlemen, who had the peruſal of my letters to General Schuyler, ſhould have alledged inattention to the progreſs of the enemy, as in every one of them, viz. thoſe of the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1ſt, 2d and 3d of July, I make particular mention of their progreſs, and the ſteps taken to obtain a knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt charge is, "Shamefully abandoning the poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in my charge," and this is directed to be founded upon the ſeventh remark, which has juſt been under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The puniſhment of this crime, Sir, is death, without alternative. No preſumptive evidence, therefore, can be admitted, no conſtruction can be allowed, to fix it; but the fact muſt be proven in the cleareſt and moſt poſitive manner. But in the remark of the Committee referred to, I do not find a ſingle circumſtance that relates to it, except a looſe aſſertion, for which I am bold to ſay they had no warrant either from reaſon or evidence. It is this: "Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wiſhes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too extenſive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if ſuch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehenſible point of view; as, the weakneſs of his defence being more obvious, his retreat ſhould have been earlier determined upon and made." I have proven by General Gates, General Schuyler, General Poor, and Colonels Baldwin and Koſeiuſzko, the engineers, and a number of other witneſſes, that the works were much too extenſive for my numbers; by General Gates, that the numbers were not one fourth of what he demanded, and Congreſs had voted, at a time he did not expect the enemy would have come on with 10 or 11,000 men, and not much more than a fifth of what he would have demanded in that caſe, excluſive of the militia, which he had powers to call for, in any number he thought proper; by General Schuyler and General Poor, that they would at leaſt have demanded 10,000 good troops; by Major Hull's certificate, and the returns of arms from the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers commanding regiments, that many of the men were very badly armed. And, with the Committee's good leave, although the weakneſs of my defence was certainly from theſe circumſtances the more obvious, yet, as proper notice thereof was in due time given both to Congreſs and General Schuyler, neither of whom gave any directions about the matter, and I had no power of myſelf to order the evacuation until the laſt extremity, I cannot thereby be placed in a point of view reprehenſible in any degree whatſoever. As the proof here fails entirely, the charge muſt fail with it. But, Sir, the poſts were not ſhamefully abandoned. The retreat was undertaken upon the juſteſt principles, and, I hope the Court will bear with me when I ſay, upon the moſt honourable and ingenuous motives; the meaſures to effect it were taken with judgment; the orders were pertinent and clear; and the whole, notwithſtanding ſome croſs accidents, which it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to foreſee, was conducted with a degree of art, that reflects ſome credit upon both the General and the troops. I need not tell this honourable Court that a retreat, with an inferior army, from before a ſuperior one, is perhaps the mo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> delicate and dangerous undertaking in the whole circle of military operations, and that it never will be effected without prudence, fortitude and ſecrecy. I hope I have ſatisfied the Court, that I could not order the evacuation until the laſt moment, when I ſaw no alternative betwixt that and the certain loſs of the army. I think I have proven that that moment was arrived, as one day more would probably have compleated the inveſtment of the poſts, and then it would have been impoſſible. I have proven that my motive was not to avoid the enemy, but to ſave the army, and by removing them to a place where rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements could reach them, to make them ſerve as the baſis of a force ſufficient to cover the country, and check the progreſs of the enemy; and this I did with the certainty of a loſs of reputation, a price few people are willing to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

of the 14th of July, proves, that I foreſaw the events that would probably happen, and which muſt have had ſome effect upon my determinations.</p>
               <p>Indeed, from the knowledge I had of the country through which General Burgoyne had to advance,—the difficulties I knew he would be put to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The event juſtified my conjecture, but attended with conſequences beyond my moſt ſanguine expectations. A fatal blow given to the power and inſolence of Great-Britain, a whole army priſoners, and the reputation of the arms of America high in every civilized part of the world! But what would have been the conſequences had not that ſtep been taken, and my army had been cut to pieces or made priſoners? Diſgrace would have been brought upon our arms and our counſels,—fear and diſmay would have ſeized upon the inhabitants, from the falſe opinion that had been formed of the ſtrength of theſe poſts,—wringing grief and moping melancholy would have filled the now chearful habitations of thoſe whoſe deareſt connections were in that army,—and a lawleſs hoſt of ruſſians, ſet looſe from every ſocial tie, would have roam'd at liberty through the defenceleſs country, whilſt bands of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages would have carried havoc, devaſtation and terror before them! Great part of the ſtate of New-York muſt have ſubmitted to the conqueror, and in it he would have found the means to enable him to proſecute his ſucceſs. He would have been able effectually to have co-operated with General Howe, and would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have ſoon been in the ſame country with him—that country, where our illuſtrious General, with an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force, made ſo glorious a ſtand, but who muſt have been obliged to retire if both armies came upon him at once, or he might have been forced, perhaps, to a general and deciſive action in unfavourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whereby the hopes, the now well-founded hopes of America, of liberty, peace and ſafety, might have been cut off for ever. Every conſideration ſerves to prove the propriety of the retreat, that I could not undertake it ſooner, and that had it been delayed longer it had been delayed too long. But it may juſtly be matter of wonder why Congreſs, who, ſo early as the twenty-ninth of April, declared their opinion, as appears by the reſolve of that date, which has been read, that unleſs certain meaſures were purſued by the eaſtern ſtates for compleating and forwarding without delay the troops ordered for that ſervice, the important poſts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence muſt inevitably be loſt, and who muſt have known from the returns, if it can be ſuppoſed they knew through no other channel, that no ſuch, meaſures had been purſued, nor even any taken to replace the corps of militia whoſe times of ſervice had expired, and had left the poſts, it may be juſtly matter of wonder, I ſay, that they ſhould not have ordered the evacuation, in proper time to have ſaved every article of public property. It has been proved that my numbers were greatly inadequate to the defence of the poſts. But I muſt acknowledge a miſtake I made with reſpect to theſe numbers. At the Council of War held on the 5th of July, I ſtated them at 2089 rank and file, fit for duty; to which ſhould have been added 457 of thoſe returned on command, and who were within the garriſon, which brings them up to 2546. I took the account from the general return, and did not recollect that the regiments had a cuſtom of returning men on particular duties in camp as on command, nor was this noted at the foot of die general return. It was a miſtake, but not ſuch a one as would have made any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, had it not happened. It has been proven by General Schuyler, that, had the garriſon held out, he could not have raiſed the ſiege, as he had not been able to collect a ſufficient force, and that, if a ſufficient force had been collected, the ſiege could not have been raiſed for want of ball. But, had the poſts been eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated ſooner, I am perſwaded there would have no little been ſaid about the vaſt numbers of militia that would have come to my aſſiſtance, had the poſts been held longer; and theſe reports would have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and added no little to the opprobrium under which I ſhould have lain. I am, however, of the ſame opinion with my late worthy friend Mr. Livingſton, then a Member of Congreſs, who uſed to ſay—that, had I left Ticonderoga one week ſooner, I ſhould certainly have been hanged, and probably without the ceremony of a court-martial. But, Sir, if it is ſhameful for an inferior army to retreat before a ſuperior one, we muſt begin and unlearn what we have been ſpending years in reading to acquire; and hiſtory, inſtead of being a faithful guide to the unexperienced, has been hanging out falſe lights for many centuries, to miſlead the unwary traveller. According to this doctrine, ſome of the moſt famous actions of antiquity, and which we have been taught to conſider as maſter-pieces of ſkill, were ſhameful retreats, and founded in cowardice, treachery or incapacity. The famous retreat of Brafidas, with his Lacedemonians—the retreat of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul Attilius Colatinus, amongſt the Romans—Marſhal Banier, amongſt the Sweedes—Marſhal Belleiſle, amongſt the French—and, to add to the catalogue one of our times, that of his Excellency General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington from New-York—were all ſhamefully abandoning poſts. But impartial poſterity, as it formed a better judgment of thoſe, ſo will it alſo do of that; and whilſt the candid hiſtorian dwells with rapture upon the many ſhining events that have been produced by that diſtinguiſhed Chief, he will point to that retreat, as the beginning of a ſyſtem that has enſured the Liberties of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>I have now got through the main body of the charges, but there are ſtill ſome light parties of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and others, intended to act, I ſuppoſe, as irregulars, with whom there muſt be ſome ſkirmiſhing; for though their teſtimony has not the leaſt connection with any of the charges, it has taken up the time of the Court, and makes a conſiderable figure in the proceedings. The proviſion returns I ſuppoſe are meant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, to ſtrengthen the charges or to create a ſuſpicion of careleſſneſs or waſte in that article.</p>
               <p>I have admitted Mr. Yancey's return of the 20th of June, which ſtates that there was on hand at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and its dependencies at that time 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; on which the Committee, having taken an eſtimate of Mr. Avery's (which ſtates that 1400 barrels of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:016141_0048_0F9C803AE31CDC70"/>
flour, and 661 barrels of beef, would afford ſufficient proviſion in flour for 4000 men for 66 days, and in beef for 75) for a foundation conclude, that there did on the 4th of July remain, or ought to be, if proviſions had been properly and regularly iſſued, then remaining, 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; which, they ſay, was a magazine ſufficient to afford <hi>full allowance</hi> of proviſion to 5659 men of all ranks for 52 days in flour, and 32 days in beef and pork.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Avery's ſtatement is egregiouſly wrong; 1400 barrels of flour, averaging them at 200 lbs. and 651 barrels of beef, averaging them at 212 lbs. ſuppoſing the ration to be a pound of each, will afford 4000 rations of flour for 70 days, and of beef for 35 days only. But in 4000 men there will be 322 officers (I have taken the proportionate number of officers to the troops at Ticonderoga as the foundation) who, on an average, are entitled to draw three rations, and conſequently for 4000 men, who have that proportion of officers, 4644 rations muſt be iſſued daily, which the ſtock above-mentioned would afford no longer than 60 days of flour, and 30 days of meat.</p>
               <p>But the ration at Ticonderoga was a pound and a half of flour, and a pound of fleſh (beef or pork) the addition having been made in lieu of vegetables and other articles, to which the ſoldier was entitled, but which the Commiſſary could not furniſh. This Mr. Avery muſt have been acquainted with, and ſhould have taken into the account; and this reduces the magazine to 40 days flour inſtead of 66, and 30 days meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of 75. As theſe are matters in which there is not the leaſt intricacy, depending upon the moſt ſimple calculation, the Committee ſhould certainly have ſatisfied themſelves Mr. Avery's eſtimate was right, before they adopted it as a principle: As the principle is falſe, all the ſuperſtructure they have raiſed upon it falls to the ground. But the quantity is ſtill over-rated; for it is certain, that in the diviſion and diſtribution of proviſion they ſuffer conſiderable waſte.—I believe an allowance of five <hi>per cent.</hi> is made to the Commiſſaries on that account, therefore five <hi>per cent.</hi> is to be deducted from the whole quantity, viz.

4644, the number of rations iſſued daily, the quotient is 37 days flour, and 28 days meat nearly. In this manner Mr. Avery's eſtimate ought to have been made, and it was impoſing upon the public, and the officers who commanded at theſe poſts, to make it otherwiſe.</p>

and the above quantities of flour and beef, divided by 7000 for the beef, and 10,500 for the flour (one half muſt be added for the half-pound) leaves of flour for twenty-nine days, and of beef for nineteen nearly; an ample proviſion for a ſiege! Neither is this calculation made upon a liberal plan, with reſpect to Ticonderoga, but a very narrow one, indeed a very narrow one any where, as neither the hoſpital, the ſailors, the batteau-men, or any followers of the army are taken into the account; nor any notice taken of the inhabitants who
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:016141_0049_0F9C803BA51EAF80"/>
had been driven from their houſes, and were neceſſarily furniſhed with proviſions at that poſt, to enable them to reach the inhabited parts of the country; neither is there any notice taken of the real weight of the barrels, which, from the manner of packing them, fall greatly ſhort, both flour and meat, of what I have calculated upon. I have proved by General Schuyler that the barrels of meat are generally about 170 pounds, which would reduce that article to about ten days proviſion. I have never pretended, for all this, that the want of proviſion obliged me to evacuate the poſts, but the low ſtate of the magazines, and the little proſpect which it has been proven I had of an effectual ſupply, prevented me from calling in the militia: The Court will judge if it would not have been madneſs to have done it in theſe circumſtances, and they will pleaſe to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that it is in proof, that although ſome proviſion was forwarded from Fort George after the 20th of June, the greateſt part of it was ſent back, the enemy having cut off the communication betwixt Ticonderoga and the landing previous to its arrival. I grant that an officer commanding at a poſt is in ſome meaſure reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the expenditure of the proviſion; and I am bold to ſay, that during my command, as far as it depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, proviſion was iſſued with great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. Avery ſays that he did not know what quantity of proviſion was on hand at Ticonderoga on the 13th of June, the time I took the command there, but that on the 15th or 16th of June I wrote to him that there was proviſion at the poſts for ſeven weeks. From his manner of mentioning this, one would imagine I had wrote merely for his information, and all was well; but the fact is, and he has owned it, though with apparent reluctance, that the deſign of my letter to him was, to complain of the ſmall quantity of proviſion, and preſs a further ſupply in a decent, at the ſame time the ſtrongeſt manner, by putting him in mind of the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to himſelf that might attend a failure. This letter he never thought proper to anſwer, or give me the leaſt ſatisfaction whether I might expect ſupplies or not. It has been proven that the magazine at Albany was empty, and part of the proviſion that had been forwarded to Still Water, on its way to Ticonderoga, was carried back for the ſupply of that poſt. Upon my way from Albany to Ticonderoga I found the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine at Fort Edward in the ſame caſe, and the proviſion that had been forwarded from thence to Fort George bringing back to ſupply the troops at that poſt; as appears by my letter to General Schuyler of the 10th of June, from Fort George. Mr. Yancey indeed ſays, he had heard of ſalt proviſion having been ſent from Bennington to St. Coak, but is ignorant of the quantity, but does not pretend to ſay there was any magazine from which the poſts at Ticonderoga could have been ſupplied. That very proviſion ſent from Still Water to Albany was part of that which came from Bennington; but why ſhould I multiply words, Mr. Avery acknowledges he was deceived by the people he had employed to purchaſe proviſion, "they did not collect the quantity he expected." It is true, ſome cattle arrived at Ticonderoga the day before the evacuation, I believe about forty,—they arrived too late to be of any uſe in the garriſon, but they were of great uſe on the retreat.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid the ration at Ticonderoga was a pound and a half of bread and a pound of beef or pork, but I am not able to prove it. The march of a part of the army has deprived me of ſeveral witneſſes I intended to have examined. I know it, however, to have been the caſe. The Commiſſaries whoſe buſineſs it was to be perfectly acquainted with what was iſſued as a ration, know nothing about the matter, neither Principal nor Deputy. Mr. Avery knows nothing about it, for he was at Albany; Mr. Yancey knows nothing about it, for he was purchaſing cattle; and Mr. Boyer, the Iſſuing Commiſſary on the ground, is not certain what it was: He ſays, he believes it to have been a pound of bread and a pound of beef, or three-quarters of a pound of pork. He acknowledges the men did not receive the other component parts of a ration. They got briefs for them. He likewiſe acknowledges, that during the time he was at the poſt the ſame quantity of bread and meat war iſſued as a ration, that had been cuſtomary before and at the time he came into office. Now it is certain that a pound of bread and a pound of beef, or three-quarters of a pound of pork, is not a ſufficient allowance for a ſoldier, eſpecially when, as was the caſe at Ticonderoga, he is kept conſtantly to hard labour; his brief he cannot eat; and it is alſo certain that the Commiſſaries did not furniſh them with vegetables and the other ſmall articles; it is therefore probable that the quantity of bread and meat was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. But in June, 1776, in Canada, General Sullivan ordered that, where milk could not be procured, the troops ſhould have a pound and a half of beef or eighteen ounces of pork <hi>per diem,</hi> beſides molaſſes, rice, Indian meal and peaſe; and this continued to be the allowance in meat until ſome time after General Gates took the command, who altered it from a pound and a half of beef, or eighteen ounces of pork, to a pound of either, and added half a pound to the quantity of bread; and this alteration was induced, chiefly, by the prevalence of bilious complaints, which it was expected leſſening the quantity of animal and increaſing the quantity of vegetable food would help to abate: That continued to be the ration at theſe poſts until the evacuation, ſome temporary alterations excepted, when the troops were ſupplied with vegetables. And this reaſoning is confirmed by General Wayne's orderly book, by which it appears, that on the 30th of December he reduced the quantity of flour to one pound and a quarter, and of meat to one pound, vegetables being then iſſued by the Commiſſary, agreeable to the reſolve of Congreſs of the 28th of December, 1776; and, doubtleſs, when theſe were expended, the ration returned to its former ſtandard.</p>

               <p>The attention of the Court has been a good deal taken up with a quantity of tallow that was in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mr. Leavenworth. He ſays, I think, that he informed me of it on the 26th of June, and it may be that he did ſo; but as I knew Leavenworth to be a private perſon, and as I had no official account of any tallow, I concluded it was altogether a private affair, ſome money-making job betwixt him and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Reflecting, however, on the quantity, which was ſurprizingly great, 34,345 pounds, and finding it was public property, I determined to have ſent it to Fort George by the firſt opportunity; but before any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered, that communication was cut off. Mr. Yancey acknowledges he had never made any return of this tallow, tho' it muſt have been great part of a year on hand. If he had, I ſhould not have ſuffered it to remain there; tho' it might perhaps have been worked up at that place more to his profit, had he been allowed to employ ſoldiers, which ſeems to have been his expectation. As he never did make any return of it, and the only account I ever had was from a private perſon, a very ſhort time before the communication with Fort George was ſtopped, the loſs of it is juſtly chargeable to his negligence, and he ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond remark of the Committee is a miſrepreſentation of my letter to General Schuyler of the 24th of June. They ſay I was on that day informed by my ſcouts that the enemy were very numerous, and on the next wrote to Congreſs that I was not able to diſcover whether the enemy were in force or not. Let the letter ſpeak for itſelf. "Serjeant Heath, who I ſent down the Lake to make diſcoveries, returned laſt night, and informs me that, from a place near the mouth of Otter-Creek, he deſcried an encampment of the enemy on both ſides of Gilliland's Creek; that, from the appearance and the extent, <hi>he thinks</hi> it muſt contain a great body of men; and that a great many ſmokes aroſe at a diſtance back, which he ſuppoſes was from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments of the Indians;" and again, "that one of the inhabitants, in whom he could place confidence, informed him the <hi>Indians were very numerous</hi>;" and in another place, "that another inhabitant informed him, that ſome of the enemy's troops had ſaid their whole army was there," that is, at Gilliland's Creek. Now, Sir, is there any thing in all this like poſitive intelligence that the enemy were <hi>very numerous?</hi> No, Sir, there is not. The encampment was ſeen from a very conſiderable diſtance, acroſs the Lake, and the ſerjeant <hi>thinks</hi> that, from the <hi>appearance</hi> of it, it might contain a great body of men. An inhabitant, indeed, <hi>told</hi> him the <hi>Indians</hi> were very numerous. Four or five hundred, Sir, is a large body of Indians, and what the inhabitants any where would call very numerous, but ten times that number is not a great body of troops; and for aught I knew, and had reaſon to believe, the whole of their army left in Canada did not amount to that number. There was therefore no inconſiſtency in my writing to Congreſs on the 25th of June, that I was not able to diſcover whether the enemy were in force or not, notwithſtanding the information I received by my ſcouts on the 24th. But, in the ſame letter, I gave General Schuyler my reaſons for not believing that there was a great body of men in that encampment (of which the Committee do not think proper to take any notice) viz. that it was improbable the enemy would waſte their time at ſuch a diſtance from the object againſt which they were to act, in a country that afforded them nothing (the inhabitants had all left that ſide of the Lake the year before) and they had been there four or five days; and I thought the ground, on which Heath deſcribed the encampment to be, incapable of containing a great number of men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was more probable that it was a party only ſent to amuſe, and to give confidence to the ſavages. Had I given Congreſs other information than I did on the 25th of June, it had been a falſhood.</p>
               <p>I have now got through the whole of this matter, and it clearly appears there is not the ſmalleſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for all, or any of the charges againſt me.—On the contrary, it has been proven beyond the poſſibility of a doubt, that I did every thing which my duty required, and that circumſtances would allow. I have therefore good reaſon to expect the deciſion of this Court in my favour. Yet I ſtill ſhall have it to regret, that the accuſations have ſpread far and wide, and been greedily ſwallowed for truth, whilſt few, comparatively very few, will ever hear of the honourable acquittal.</p>
               <p>If in the courſe of this buſineſs I have appeared with confidence, I hope I have not with arrogance; and though I have examined the report of the Committee of Congreſs with freedom, I have not forgot to do it with decency. No man can have a higher ſenſe than I have of the reſpect in which Congreſs ought to be held; but a dignified conduct can alone ſecure reſpect to any man, or body of men. That conduct this Congreſs will, no doubt, ever preſerve. But ſhould ſome future Congreſs depart from the great buſineſs of watching over the affair of a whole continent, to hunt down an individual—ſhould factions ariſe amongſt them, and local intereſts take place of the general intereſt—ſhould their time be waſted in frivolous and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſputes, where the object is a mere boyiſh deſire of victory, whilſt the public ſervice ſtands ſtill, and its honeſt ſervants tired out with tedious and expenſive waiting—and ſhould they create offices with great ſalaries, where thoſe who hold them may rob the public at their pleaſure, without a poſſibility of detection, and cabal amongſt themſelves for the diſpoſal of them—and ſhould they paſs reſolves, ridiculous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and impoſſible to be carried into execution—then will Congreſs ſink into contempt, nor will all the importance they may endeavour to aſſume, nor the faſtidious pomp they may diſplay, ſupport them, and then will the misfortunes of America begin.</p>
