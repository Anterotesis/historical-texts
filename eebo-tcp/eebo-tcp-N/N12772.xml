            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Major General ST. CLAIR pleads NOT GUILTY.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate ≈øtates the matters upon which the charges again≈øt the General are founded, as follow:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is nece≈ø≈øary (previous to my producing the requi≈øite evidence on this trial) that I ≈øhould inform you of the matters, upon which the charges again≈øt Major General St. Clair are founded. They are certain remarks, made by a committee of the Hon. the Continental Congre≈øs, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and to ≈øtate charges again≈øt the general officers who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated.</p>
               <p>Before I mention the≈øe remarks, I would inform you that Major General St. Clair, on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, took upon him the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the≈øe places were evacuated to the enemy by his orders on the 6th day of July following.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt remark is: That on the 13th day of June General St. Clair was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an information from two pri≈øoners taken in Canada, that the Briti≈øh forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible again≈øt him, and that he might expect their arrival in three weeks at farthe≈øt. That as on the 18th of June four of the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels were lying on the hither ≈øide of Split Rock, and on the 24th ≈øeven of them were at Crown-Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both ≈øides of Gilleland's Creek, and he was informed by his ≈øcouts that they were very numerous; ≈øo from the≈øe circum≈øtances it appears General St. Clair had ≈øub≈øtantial rea≈øon to confide in what the pri≈øoners had told him
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016141_0003_0F9B776CC0376B80"/>
relative to the intentions and ≈øtrength of the enemy; and that he ought at this time to have taken his final re≈øolution, either to ≈øtand an attack, or to retreat with his ≈øtores, the pre≈øervation of which was a principal object in the determination of a council of war on the 20th of June. Therefore it appears that General St. Clair's neglecting to form his deci≈øive opinion at this time, or at a later day, ≈øo as to allow him a ≈øufficient opportunity to retreat with his troops, ≈øick, ammunition, cannon, provi≈øions and cloathing, and to deprive the enemy of ≈øhelter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That General St. Clair, on the 24th of June, was informed by his ≈øcouts the enemy were very numerous and yet, neverthele≈øs, on the next day he wrote to Congre≈øs, that he was not able to di≈øcover whether the enemy were in force or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> That if General St. Clair found ≈ømall ≈øcouts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was his duty in due time to have ≈øent out reconnoitering parties, in ≈øuch force as might have a≈ø≈øured him whether or not the enemy were in ≈øtrength, this being a mo≈øt important point, as upon this he was to regulate his motions; and therefore his failure in ≈øending out ≈øuch parties in due time was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> That as Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth ≈øwears General St. Clair did not annoy the enemy in their advance again≈øt, and inve≈øtiture of, the po≈øts under his care, although the troops were healthy, courageous, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> of action, it appears the General did not to the utmo≈øt of his power oppo≈øe the operations of the enemy; and therefore that he is liable to the charge of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth.</hi> That as it was determined in a council of war on the twentieth of June, approved by General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention; and Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth ≈øwears not a ≈øtroke was ≈øtruck for tho≈øe purpo≈øes; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea≈øed in number, and continued ≈øo at a time when it ≈øhould have been abundantly increa≈øed; ≈øo on the≈øe points the General is liable to be charged with a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, and with treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth.</hi> That as on the 25th of May, the Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary rated that 1400 barrels of flour would, at an allowance of one pound each man <hi>per diem,</hi> ≈øerve 4000 men 66 days, and that 661 barrels of beef would ≈øerve the ≈øame number of men 75 days; and ≈øuppo≈øing that, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu≈øive, there were in Ticonderoga and Mount Independence 4739 men, and there does not appear to have been at any time between the≈øe periods a greater number; ≈øo e≈øtimating the con≈øumption of 4739 men, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu≈øive, upon the 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork, on the twentieth of June returned by Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary Yancey as then actually remaining on hand, there did on the fourth of July remain, or ought, if provi≈øions had been regularly and properly i≈ø≈øued, to be then remaining 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; a magazine of provi≈øions ≈øufficient to afford to the army on the fifth of July, amounting, by the arrival of the militia of the Grants, to 5639 men of all ranks, <hi>fall allowance</hi> of provi≈øion in flour for 52 days, and in beef and pork for 32 days, exclu≈øive of the con≈øiderable number of fat cattle that arrived at Ticonderoga on the fifth of July, the teams of oxen nece≈ø≈øarily attending the po≈øt, and other ≈øtores ≈øpecified in the Commi≈ø≈øary's return on the twentieth of June, and even ≈øuppo≈øing, as may not rea≈øonably be done, that no ≈øupply of flour had arrived after that day. And as this calculation has been liberally made, upon the quantity of provi≈øions actually in Ticonderoga on the twentieth of June, for the expenditure of which General St. Clair, as commander at the po≈øt, ought to be held re≈øpon≈øible; therefore it clearly appears Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not abandoned upon the ju≈øt principle of a want of provi≈øions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh.</hi> That as General St. Clair informed the Hon. Mr. Jay, that at the time of holding the council of war on the 5th of July he knew it to be impo≈ø≈øible to defend the po≈øts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point as early as the 29th of June, the day that he ≈øent his ≈øon and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate effects from Ticonderoga to Fort-George, as a place of ≈øafety: That being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken as effectual mea≈øures for the pre≈øervation of the public property, at lea≈øt equally with his own, claiming his earlie≈øt attention: That on the 30th of June, the enemy being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing again≈øt him ≈øo near as the Three-mile-point, it is incredible that he did not then know that they were in force: That it was his duty, <hi>at that point of time,</hi> to have finally determined either to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire: That if the la≈øt re≈øolution was taken, and, from his ≈øending off his ≈øon and baggage the day before, there is the ≈øtronge≈øt pre≈øumption that this re≈øolution was <hi>then</hi> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to ≈øend off the public ≈øtores, to de≈øtroy the works, and to evacuate the po≈øts without lo≈øing a moment of time: And that by deferring to take any mea≈øures to retire till the la≈øt moment when he could po≈ø≈øibly retreat even with his effective troops, a moment when the ≈øick, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing of the army mu≈øt be abandoned and lo≈øt, be≈øides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, General St. Clair appears charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General, and with ≈øhamefully abandoning the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge. Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wi≈øhes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too exten≈øive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if ≈øuch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehen≈øible point of view, as the weakne≈øs of his defence being more obvious, his retreat ≈øhould have been the earlier determined upon.</p>
               <p>The charge of neglect of duty is founded on the fir≈øt, third, fourth and fifth remarks re≈øpectively.‚Äî Cowardice, treachery, incapacity as a General, re≈øpectively, are founded upon the fourth remark.‚Äî Treachery, founded upon the fifth remark.‚ÄîInattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, treachery, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as a General, re≈øpectively, founded upon the ≈øeventh remark.‚ÄîShamefully abandoning the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge, founded upon the ≈øeventh remark.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair reque≈øts that the Re≈øolution of Congre≈øs of the 5th of February la≈øt, appointing two Coun≈øellors learned in the law to a≈ø≈øi≈øt and co-operate with the Judge Advocate in the trial of the General

               <p>The letters being read, Major General St. Clair addre≈ø≈øes the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>THE re≈øolution that has ju≈øt been read is of ≈øo ≈øingular a nature, that I cannot pa≈øs it by without ≈øome ob≈øervations.</p>
               <p>The treatment I have received renders it nece≈ø≈øary for me to ≈øubmit to any regulation that may have been pre≈øcribed, as an objection on my part would probably be con≈øtrued into the fear of a thorough inve≈øtigation, and con≈øequently an evidence of guilt. I ≈øhall therefore make no objection to the learned gentlemen, ≈øhould they attend, a≈ø≈øi≈øting and co-operating with the Judge Advocate in my trial: But, as I conceive this to be introducing a very great change in the mode of proceeding before Courts Martial, I cannot con≈øent that Congre≈øs have any power to make that change.</p>
               <p>Courts Martial were con≈øtituted by the fir≈øt article of the 14th ≈øection of the rules and articles for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the troops, and the mode of proceeding in them by the third article of the ≈øame ≈øection. The≈øe articles every officer is obliged to ≈øub≈øcribe, whereby they become a compact betwixt the army and the people, and cannot be altered but by common con≈øent; and a re≈øolve of Congre≈øs has no more operation upon them than an edict of the Grand Turk. But a power to alter the ordinary cour≈øe of proceeding for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ca≈øe is big with con≈øequences of the mo≈øt dangerous nature, and might be made an in≈øtrument of the mo≈øt grievous oppre≈ø≈øion. I do therefore, on behalf of the army, ≈øolemnly prote≈øt again≈øt my having ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this innovation ever hereafter being drawn into precedent.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair admits he took the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, and that the≈øe po≈øts were evacuated by his orders the 6th day of July following.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate produces copies of letters from Major General St. Clair to Major General Schuyler, dated June 13th, June 18th, and June 24th, 1777; al≈øo a copy of a letter from Major General St. Clair to Congre≈øs, dated June 25th, 1777; a copy of a letter from General St. Clair to Major General Schuyler, dated June 30th, 1777; the proceedings of a Council of Officers held at Ticonderoga the 20th of June, 1777; a ≈øtate of the guards and fatigue party, June 15th, 1777, from a copy of General St. Clair's orderly book; al≈øo an order from the ≈øaid orderly book re≈øpecting the guards and fatigue party, June 23d, 1777: which, being read, are as follow:</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>HERE follows the ≈øub≈øtance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken pri≈øoners by one of our parties on Onion River.</p>
                     <p>That General Burgoyne it arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the Briti≈øh army is a≈ø≈øembling as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is ≈øaid to con≈øi≈øt of about ten thou≈øand men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John John≈øon, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River whil≈øt the re≈øt of the army under General Burgoyne cro≈ø≈øes the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the inclo≈øed letter to General Sullivan) is all in the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at farthe≈øt.</p>
                     <p>From the nature and circum≈øtance of the pa≈øs granted to one of the two, which I here inclo≈øe, and his own account of the manner in which he was ≈øent from Montreal, viz. to ≈øearch plans of the country which he pretended to know are hid at Metcalf's, and his being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a con≈øiderable ≈øum of continental money, and ≈øome gold and ≈øilver, I have the ≈øtronge≈øt ≈øu≈øpicion of his being a ≈øpy, and have ≈øecured him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> ≈øuch, and ≈øent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him your≈øelf, and that, if you ≈øhould think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, ≈øhould he be found guilty, the ≈øentence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer, who lately ≈øuffered a ≈øpy he had in charge to e≈øcape, through the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt mi≈øconduct, has been honourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by a Court Martial.</p>
                     <p>You will likewi≈øe find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen ≈øent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circum≈øtance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if the≈øe fellows have really been ≈øent by him to ≈øee what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an ea≈øy reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwith≈øtanding be genuine, and Am≈øbury ≈øays it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a ≈øeparate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he ≈øeemed unwilling to part with, and which I ≈øuppo≈øe to have been a private ≈øignal by which he was to be known upon his return.</p>
                     <p>If the enemy intend to attack us, I a≈ø≈øure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, exclu≈øive of Baldwin's artificers and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Be≈øides the≈øe there are three regiments of Hamp≈øhire militia, engaged for no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular term, and who go off whenever they plea≈øe, 150 are gone ≈øince la≈øt return; two regiments of Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øachu≈øetts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with ≈øome of them is already expired. Among the number returned ≈øick there is no doubt but many would be u≈øeful in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this di≈øagreeable detail, but I have ≈øomething wor≈øe to add to it.‚ÄîWe cannot increa≈øe our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commi≈ø≈øary's return and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for ≈øeven weeks only on the ground, and he has no pro≈øpect of any ≈øupply of ≈øalt meat, but from ≈øome place near Still-Water, nor of fre≈øh, but by ≈øending to New-England for it.‚ÄîThis I have de≈øired him to do, but mu≈øt own I have little pro≈øpect of advantage from it; for be a≈ø≈øured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very ea≈øily be cut off.‚ÄîI have heard of ≈øome cattle below Crown-Point, which I ≈øhall ≈øend for to-morrow.</p>
                     <p>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy trouble≈øome job.‚ÄîThe ca≈ø≈øoons, Col. Baldwin ≈øays, will be all ≈øunk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower ≈øide of them, which will ≈øerve as a kind of ≈øecond boom, and retard at lea≈øt, if not prevent, the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels from pa≈ø≈øing, ≈øhould they attempt it.</p>
                     <p>A magazine of wood ≈øhould be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a ≈øtick upon the Mount.‚ÄîAll the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwi≈øe be nece≈ø≈øary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purpo≈øes.‚ÄîWhat can the Quarter-Ma≈øter mean by leaving this place, where ≈øo many works are to be carried on, without ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary an article as draught cattle?</p>
                     <p>The tents here are in general very bad. I mu≈øt beg you, my dear General, to ha≈øten up the new tents, for I ≈øhall get no good of the troops here in any way, whil≈øt they remain in barracks.</p>
                     <p>Our powder magazines are in ≈øo wretched a ≈øtate, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In ≈øhort, every thing is ≈øo much out of order, that I will add no more to this lift of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</p>
                     <p>When I write again, I hope to have ≈øomething more agreeable to entertain you with, and am,</p>

                     <p>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and ≈øtores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is ≈øo drained I thought it needle≈øs to a≈øk for any from him, as he has almo≈øt literally nothing.</p>
                     <p>Since my la≈øt I have had con≈øtant ≈øcouts out, but have made no di≈øcovery of the enemy, ≈øave that four of their ve≈ø≈øels are lying about a mile on the hither ≈øide of the Split Rock; they con≈øi≈øt of two ≈øhips, and two gondolas; and on Friday la≈øt a ≈øchooner beat up within four miles of Crown-Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</p>
                     <p>Ye≈øterday about noon we had two men, who had ≈øtrolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of ≈øavages, who had ≈øtole down to the road ≈øide betwixt M'lnto≈øh's and the bridge, and concealed them≈øelves in the bu≈øhes; they were immediately pur≈øued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be over-taken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, however, they fell in with a ≈øcouting party I had ≈øent down to di≈øcover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and ≈øcalped, and one mi≈ø≈øing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</p>
                     <p>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned la≈øt night on di≈øcovering a large party of Indians on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the lake about four miles above Crown-Point. I think of ≈øending to feel their pul≈øe to-night, as I am ≈øure it would be of con≈øequences to give tho≈øe fellows a drubbing.</p>
                     <p>I am at a lo≈øs to form a judgment of the de≈øigns of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indi≈øcreet to put us on our guard by ≈øuch a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the ≈øavages to come on, unle≈øs they had an army not far off to ≈øupport them.

                        </gap> as it will, I ≈øhall u≈øe every precaution po≈ø≈øible again≈øt ≈øurprize and will endeavour to penetrate their de≈øigns. The ≈øame rea≈øon, notwith≈øtanding our weakne≈øs, ≈øtill prevails again≈øt calling for the militia as when I wrote la≈øt, having as yet received no ≈øupply of meat either fre≈øh or ≈øalt.</p>
                     <p>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was rai≈øed. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promi≈øed his people that they ≈øhould have the ≈øame bounty as the troops of the ≈øtate in which they were rai≈øed, notwith≈øtanding they were not part of their quota. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe has not been complied with, and they are held by a conditional agreement only, which expires this day. I ≈øhall be able to retain them, however, until you favour me with your an≈øwer.</p>
                     <p>I am making ≈øome improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga ≈øide have ≈øuch dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our pre≈øent numbers hold both. I de≈øign, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and after defending Ticonderoga as long as po≈ø≈øible retreat to Mount Independence.</p>
                     <p>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Albany.</p>

                     <p>SERJEANT HEATH, who I ≈øent down the Lake to make di≈øcoveries, returned la≈øt night, and informs me, that on Tue≈øday la≈øt he ≈øaw two birch canoes going down the Lake with ≈øixteen Indians and three white men in them, and ≈øuppo≈øes it was the party that had done the mi≈øchief near the lines the day before‚Äîthat, from a place near the mouth of Otter Creek, he ≈øaw three ve≈ø≈øels under ≈øail beating up, one at anchor about one mile above Split Rock, and the Thunderer behind it‚Äîfrom this place he likewi≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcried an encampment of the enemy on both ≈øides of Gilliland's Creek‚Äîthat from the appearance of it, and the extent, he thinks it mu≈øt contain a great body of men, and that a number of ≈ømoaks aro≈øe at a di≈øtance back, which he ≈øuppo≈øed was from the encampment of the Indians,‚Äîthat on Friday la≈øt, from Pointon, he ≈øaw twenty batteaus come out of Gilliland's Creek, and ≈øail up the Lake pa≈øt the Split Rock towards Ticonderoga‚Äîthat one of the inhabitants in whom he could place confidence informed him the Indians were very numerous‚Äîthat they frequently cro≈øs to the ea≈øt ≈øide of the Lake, and that a party of them had been at his hou≈øe a few minutes before his arrival‚Äîthat he then returned to Otter-Creek, where he propo≈øed to have halted to refre≈øh his party, but on being informed that a large party of Indians were at one Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, he made the be≈øt of his way here‚Äîone of his party this day fell behind a little, and was either taken or de≈øerted; he ≈øu≈øpects the latter, becau≈øe he both waited for him, and ≈øent back to look for him‚Äîthat one Webb, another inhabitant, informed him that the enemy had been four or five days at Gilliland's‚Äî that they came up with a va≈øt number of batteaux and ≈øome gondolas‚Äîthat ≈øome of the troops come over frequently, and ≈øay their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the re≈øt of their ve≈ø≈øels and ≈øtores, when they are to attack this place.</p>
                     <p>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their de≈øign is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harra≈øs us, and give confidence to their ≈øavages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by ≈øome regular troops. Were they in force, it is improbable they would wa≈øte their time at ≈øuch a di≈øtance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refre≈øh them≈øelves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the ea≈øt ≈øide.</p>
                     <p>It is not ea≈øy to judge of the force at a di≈øtant view of an encampment, and Heath mu≈øt have been ≈øix miles or more di≈øtant from that on Gilliland's Point, a di≈øtance too great to determine any thing with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion, although he had a gla≈øs to a≈ø≈øi≈øt his eye; be≈øides, I think the ground is not capable of encamping a great number (for he in≈øi≈øts on it they are not upon the high ground, but upon the beach only) but of this you are a much better judge than me, as I never ≈øaw it but once: Be the matter as it will, I ≈øhall endeavour to guard again≈øt ≈øurprize, and to di≈øcover both them and their de≈øigns; and, if opportunity offers, feel their pul≈øes a little.</p>

                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016141_0007_0F9C7A4DA6A007F0"/>I had all the ground between this and Crown-Point, from the Lake ≈øome di≈øtance over the mountains, well examined ye≈øterday with a heavy ≈øcout, but they di≈øcovered no enemy, nor appearance of any: Whitcomb ≈øays he is certain there has not been an Indian but three in that quarter ≈øince the pri≈øoners were taken, and that it was three or four days ≈øince the≈øe three had been there; ≈øo that the Indians ≈øaid to have been about us, and fired at, were, I believe, the children of a di≈øturbed imagination.</p>
                     <p>You had an exceeding bad time to cro≈øs the Lake, but I hope you got well over, and without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to your health, though it mu≈øt have been expo≈øed, as I doubt if you were not obliged to be out a ≈øecond night.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I INCLOSE you a return of the troops at this po≈øt, by which you will ≈øee that our effective numbers are very little more than two thou≈øand, a force greatly inadequate to its defence, which, ≈øhould the enemy attack it in force, would require at lea≈øt four times that number. In that two thou≈øand are included a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of artificers, who are unarmed, and many of the ≈øoldiers are in the ≈øame condition, and the whole in very great want of cloathing, accoutrements and bayonets.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence I have received of the enemy's approaching, I have from time to time tran≈ømitted to General Schuyler, of which I make no doubt he has appri≈øed Congre≈øs. It is now pa≈øt a doubt that they are moving towards us, but whether in force or not I have not yet been able to di≈øcover. Seven of their ve≈ø≈øels came up to Crown-Point la≈øt night, and others of their fleet are about three or four miles lower down, as we judge from their morning guns. They have al≈øo landed ≈øome troops, who are encamped upon Chimney-Point, which lies on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the Lake, directly oppo≈øite to Crown-Point. If the militia were called in, they might po≈ø≈øibly enable us to keep po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but I have not yet ventured upon that ≈øtep, on account of the low ≈øtate of our provi≈øions, there not being more than thirty-five days meat tor the troops now here, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in which we were with regard to the enemy's de≈øigns.</p>
                     <p>No army was ever in a more critical ≈øituation than we now are; and, ≈øuppo≈øing that this motion is only a feint to favour the operations of General Howe, which I ≈øtill ≈øu≈øpect it to be, we may, and probably will, be reduced to the greate≈øt di≈øtre≈øs, the ≈øupplies being derived from ≈øuch a di≈øtance, and the communication ≈øo difficult, that it is next to impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øupport it. The exten≈øivene≈øs of our works adds greatly to our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barra≈ø≈øment, and will demand ≈øo great con≈øtant guards, as mu≈øt in a very ≈øhort time wear down our troops, and do the enemy's bu≈øine≈øs for them; and ≈øhould we give up one ≈øide of the Lake, and confine our≈øelves to the defence of the other, they would infallibly cut off our communication, and reduce us by famine.</p>
                     <p>My duty to my country, and to my≈øelf, obliges me to make the≈øe repre≈øentations; neverthele≈øs, I ≈øhall leave nothing undone within my power to fru≈øtrate the attempts of the enemy, nor leave any means untried to penetrate their real de≈øigns. If I am happy enough to make any material di≈øcovery, I ≈øhall take the earlie≈øt opportunity to give information to Congre≈øs; and although I may at la≈øt be obliged to evacuate this place, I hope to make them pay dear enough for it, to repent of their bargain.</p>

                     <p>THIS morning ≈øome of the enemy's gun boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could ≈øee them di≈øembark a number of men, and the boats increa≈øed to eighteen, which are now lying a brea≈øt from the hither ≈øide of the point to about half way acro≈øs the lake. The batteaus in which they tran≈øported their troops are not come in ≈øight, lying on the far ≈øide of the point, under cover of it.</p>
                     <p>Soon after their landing a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, pu≈øhed towards our lines. As we had a ≈øcout down the lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately ≈øent out two parties to ≈øupport and bring them off. The ≈øcout fell in with the enemy, and after a few ≈øhot, in which they ≈øay ≈øome of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, di≈øper≈øed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greate≈øt part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that ≈øome of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but it was occa≈øioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</p>
                     <p>My people are in the be≈øt di≈øpo≈øition po≈ø≈øible, and I have no doubt about giving a good account of the enemy, ≈øhould they think proper to attack us; and if the per≈øon I mentioned to you in my la≈øt pur≈øues the opportunity that now pre≈øents it≈øelf, they will go back fa≈øter than they came on.

                              <hi>Fourth.</hi> That ≈øuch cannon and ≈øtores as are not immediately nece≈ø≈øary on the Ticonderoga ≈øide be removed, without delay, to Mount Independence.</p>

                              <hi>Fifth.</hi> That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient; and that the repairing the old, and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be directed to repair and make the nece≈ø≈øary fortifications.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sixth.</hi> That the ob≈øtructions in the Lake to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off all ≈øupplies, or preventing a retreat, if ≈øuch a mea≈øure ≈øhould unhappily become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpen≈øably nece≈ø≈øary, ought to be compleated with all imaginable di≈øpatch.</p>

                              <hi>Seventh.</hi>That ≈øo much remains to be done effectually to compleat the ob≈øtruction, that with the few troops we have, there is no great probability that it can be done in le≈øs than ≈øix weeks.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eighth.</hi> That although our force may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unle≈øs a ≈øufficient ≈øtock of provi≈øion can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days provi≈øion of meat kind, we think it would be imprudent to expo≈øe the army to be made pri≈øoners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prudent to provide for a retreat, to effectuate which, that all the batteaus now at this po≈øt be immediately repaired, and as many as can be ≈øpared out of the Lake George be brought hither.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ninth.</hi> That a quantity of provi≈øion of the meat kind ≈øhould, if po≈ø≈øible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or el≈øe-where.</p>

                           <p>GENERAL ST. CLAIR repre≈øented to the Council, that as there is every rea≈øon to believe that the batteries of the enemy are ready to open upon the Ticonderoga ≈øide, and that the camp is very much expo≈øed to their fire, and to be enfiladed on all quarters; and as there is al≈øo rea≈øon to expect an attack upon Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and Mount Independence at the ≈øame time, in which ca≈øe neither could draw any ≈øupport from the other; he de≈øired their opinion, whether it would be mo≈øt proper to remove the tents to the low ground, where they would be le≈øs expo≈øed, and wait the attack at the Ticonderoga lines, or whether the whole of the troops ≈øhould be drawn over to Mount Independence, the more effectually to provide for the defence of that po≈øt. At the ≈øame time the General begged leave to inform them, that the whole of our force con≈øi≈øted of 2089 effectives, rank and file, including 124 artificers unarmed, be≈øides the corps of artillery, and about 900 militia who have joined us, and cannot ≈øtay but a few days.</p>
                           <p>The Council were unanimou≈øly of opinion, that it is impo≈ø≈øible with our force to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and ≈øtores, ≈øhould be removed this night, if po≈ø≈øible, to Mount Independence.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016141_0011_0F9C7A4CE6FD3380"/>
                              <hi>Second.</hi> Whether, after the divi≈øion of the army at Ticonderoga have retreated to Mount Independence, we ≈øhall be in a ≈øituation to defend that po≈øt; or, in ca≈øe it cannot be defended, if a retreat into the country will be practicable.</p>
                           <p>The Council are unanimou≈øly of opinion, that, as the enemy have already nearly ≈øurrounded us, and there remains nothing more to inve≈øt us compleatly but their occupying the neck of land betwixt the Lake and the Ea≈øt Creek, which is not more than three quarters of a mile over, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing them≈øelves of the Narrows betwixt and Skeen≈øborough, and thereby cutting off all communication with the country, a retreat ought to be undertaken as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, and that we ≈øhall be very fortunate to effect it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Avery, Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary General in the Northern Department, being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity of provi≈øion was at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence the 13th of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot particularly a≈øcertain the quantity of provi≈øion, as I had no particular return at that time, but to the be≈øt of my recollection General St. Clair wrote me the 15th or 16th of June, that there was ≈øeven weeks provi≈øion on hand at Ticonderoga, Mount Independence and its dependencies.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What was the general purport of my letter to you?</p>
               <p>A. The general purport was informing me that there was ≈øuch a quantity of provi≈øion there. That you thought it too ≈ømall a quantity; and if I did not forward on more, you would leave me to judge what the con≈øequence would be to my≈øelf.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you receive a letter from General Schuyler about the ≈øame time, and upon the ≈øame ≈øubject?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the purport?</p>
               <p>A. Much the ≈øame as your's was; complaining of the quantity of provi≈øion at that po≈øt being too ≈ømall, and urging an immediate ≈øupply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Yancey, who ≈øuperintended the I≈ø≈øuing Commi≈ø≈øary's Department at Ticonderoga and Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>Q. Were any ≈øupplies of provi≈øion received at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence between the 20th of June and 6th of July, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. I left Ticonderoga the 21≈øt of June in order to purcha≈øe cattle. I purcha≈øed my≈øelf twenty-one cattle, and ≈øent forward to Ticonderoga twenty of them. The other I ≈øent forward, with thirty oxen and ≈øteers delivered me by Mr. Avery's order, all to Ticonderoga. There were a few cattle al≈øo ≈øent on in company with the≈øe for the ho≈øpital. I do not know their number. The fir≈øt was ≈øent on the 26th of June; the place from where they were ≈øent was called Paulett. The next was the 27th of June, place called Manche≈øter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the≈øe cattle arrived at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. Not from my own knowledge. I under≈øtood that one, two or three of the cattle were made u≈øe of by Colonel Warner, who took them under his care to drive them into Ticonderoga, and I under≈øtood that they arrived there, but only from information.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What quantity of provi≈øion was i≈ø≈øued the 20th of June as a ration?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, at pre≈øent, exactly know what quantity was i≈ø≈øued as a ration at that time. The artificers received one ration and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What quantity of provi≈øion was daily i≈ø≈øued by the General's orders, and to the general ho≈øpital?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know. The general ho≈øpital was ≈øometimes ≈øupplied by my magazine, but not ≈øteadily. The general officers and their families, and ≈øeveral of the field and ≈øome other officers, drew what they plea≈øed on account.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Where could the general ho≈øpital have been ≈øupplied with provi≈øion, unle≈øs it was from your magazine?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know from any place with re≈øpect to fre≈øh provi≈øion, unle≈øs they ≈øent out and purcha≈øed it. The ≈øalt provi≈øion and flour could be got from me only.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was there any country in the neighbourhood from which they could have been ≈øupplied?</p>
               <p>A. None nearer than the Hamp≈øhire Grants.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. When you made the return of the 20th of June, did you count the barrels of provi≈øion your≈øelf, or did you make up your return from the returns made to you?</p>
               <p>A. I did not count the barrels of provi≈øion. I made the return from the entries of my peoples receipts and deliveries.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. When did the book of accounts commence from which you made your return?</p>
               <p>A. I believe the fir≈øt of December<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 1776.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Had there not been, from time to time, a con≈øiderable quantity of provi≈øion condemned at this po≈øt?</p>
               <p>A. I ≈øent ≈øome packers to Ticonderoga in March, 1777, to repack the provi≈øion. They returned to me I think in April, and I ≈øaw when I got up to Ticonderoga an account of damaged provi≈øion among≈øt my papers, amounting to about twenty-eight barrels of beef or pork, but I am pretty confident the twenty-eight barrels of beef or pork were not included in the general return of the 20th of June, but I cannot undertake to ≈øay there was no damaged provi≈øion among≈øt the quantity mentioned in the return of the 20th of June.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you know, when you were ≈øent to purchase fre≈øh provi≈øion, of any magazine of ≈øalt provi≈øion in the vicinity of Ticonderoga, from which you could have ≈øupplied that garri≈øon?</p>
               <p>A. I knew of ≈øalt provi≈øion having been carried forward from Bennington and William's-Town to St. Coack, but I do not know the quantity.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Mr. Avery. Did you order ≈øalt provi≈øion from St. Coack or Stillwater to Albany?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016141_0012_0F9C7A50A42382B8"/>A. I ordered a ≈ømall quantity from Stillwater, the magazine at Albany being empty of ≈øalt provi≈øion at the time. It was ≈øome time in the month of June, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Que≈øtion to Mr. Avery. How long did the magazine at Albany remain empty, and did any ≈øupply of provi≈øion arrive between that time and the 6th of July?</p>
               <p>A. There was ≈øome provi≈øion arrived at Albany, but what quantity I cannot tell, but not much more than was ≈øufficient for the ≈øupply of the troops that were there.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Mr. Avery. Did you write to General Schuyler, that you were deceived by your Purcha≈øing Commi≈ø≈øaries?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember that I did; but I do not know but I might have wrote to General Schuyler that they had not collected the quantity that I expected.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow, nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>Mr. Leavenworth, being ≈øworn, ≈øays: I arrived at Ticonderoga the 9th of March, and tarried there until the retreat. About three weeks before the retreat, as near as I can remember, it was reported that the enemy were at Split Rock, and I heard guns ≈øome days that were ≈øaid to be their evening and morning guns. I al≈øo heard General St. Clair give out he thought that the enemy were between ≈øix and ≈øeven thou≈øand ≈øtrong. On the 26th of June I made report to General St. Clair of the tallow in my po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, the quantity being great. He ≈øaid he would give directions about it, and ≈øaid al≈øo that the Commi≈ø≈øary ought to have taken care of it, and had it worked up. General St. Clair took occa≈øion to mention that the Commi≈ø≈øary had not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected his duty in that in≈øtance, but al≈øo had neglected it in not ≈øending on the ≈øupplies of provi≈øion. I did not hear any thing more about it, and on Wedne≈øday before the retreat I went to General St. Clair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecting it, who ≈øaid it was the Commi≈ø≈øary's bu≈øine≈øs, and he ought to have taken care of it, and blamed him again on account of provi≈øion, and ≈øaid there were but a few days provi≈øion. I told him I thought there was more. All the provi≈øion had been removed from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence, and on Thur≈øday or Friday I went to Mount Independence to ≈øatisfy my≈øelf re≈øpecting the quantity of provi≈øion there, and I think there were full three thou≈øand barrels of beef, pork and flour there, from the appearance of them. I did not count them. This was a larger quantity than appeared to be there on the twenty-≈øixth of June. On Wedne≈øday before the retreat I was at Head-Quarters, and ob≈øerved it was entirely ≈øtripped of the baggage, and in con≈øequence of it I put my baggage in a boat, and ≈øent it to Mount Independence. Having received no orders about the tallow, I de≈øired ≈øome gentlemen to ≈øpeak to the General about it, and on Saturday morning the enemy made their appearance on Mount Defiance, when, talking to ≈øome gentlemen re≈øpecting the tallow, one of them ≈øaid I had done enough to exculpate my≈øelf re≈øpecting it, and gave me to under≈øtand that we were to retreat that evening, and told me not to let it be known by words or actions, and told me not to regulate my conduct by it ≈øo that it might be known. It was General Poor who told me of it. On Saturday evening, at gun firing, I went into my boat with my people, and went to the ≈øouth-we≈øt point of Mount Independence, and I continued in my boat and on the point of Mount Independence all night. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eleven and twelve o'clock at night, one Serjeant Bond came down, who told me that he came down to ≈øee what boats were there. That between twelve and one o'clock, a party of men came down to the Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, and took the boats up to the Crane, as they ≈øaid, to load with provi≈øion, and at day light began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and I went off with my boat in company with the fir≈øt boats. The cannon began to be removed (when General Schuyler was pre≈øent) from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence, and continued to be removed after General Schuyler's departure, as were quantities of artillery ≈øtores.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016141_0013_0F9C7A516462CDD8"/>Q. Did any quantity of provi≈øion arrive at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence from the 20th of June to the time of the evacuation, either from Fort George or Skeen≈øborough!</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any number of cattle arrive at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence between the 20th of June and the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I ≈øaw cattle that Colonel Warner ≈øaid he brought in with him. I thought I ≈øaw (from the idea I now have) about forty head.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any parties ≈øent out to annoy the enemy, by order from General St. Clair, in their advance again≈øt, and inve≈øtiture of, the po≈øts under his ca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e, to your knowledge?</p>
               <p>A. The enemy came to Three Mile Point, and I have ≈øeen parties go out of about twenty men in a party. I know of none ≈øent out to oppo≈øe the enemy's progre≈øs.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What kind of ground was it between Three Mile-Point and Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I have not been over the whole of the ground, but over part of it; there are ≈øome cleared fields next to the Lake, and woods back. This is all the de≈øcription I can give of the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the troops under General St. Clair healthy, courageous, and de≈øirous of improving every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage again≈øt the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What rea≈øon had you to think the troops were healthy, courageous, and de≈øirous of improving every advantage again≈øt the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. In the fir≈øt place, with regard to their being healthy, I had occa≈øion to be at the ho≈øpital ≈øeveral times after the enemy came near to us, and I did not ≈øee many ≈øick there, and it was generally reported that the army was healthy. After I was apprehen≈øive that we were to retreat, I took pains to enquire of a number of officers of my acquaintance, indirectly, whether the troops were courageous, and determined to fight, ≈øhould the enemy come on, and they all an≈øwered in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was it your opinion, and the opinion of the officers you indirectly a≈øked whether the troops were courageous and determined to fight, that the place was defen≈øible?</p>
               <p>A. I did not a≈øk any of the officers whether the place was defen≈øible. It was my own opinion that the place was not defen≈øible in the circum≈øtances it then was.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What do you mean by the circum≈øtances it was then in?</p>
               <p>A. In the fir≈øt place, the lines were very exten≈øive, ≈øo that there were not men enough on the ground to man them: Another circum≈øtance was, the enemy had got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the heights about us: Another was, the heavy cannon, artillery ≈øtores, and all the provi≈øion, were removed from Ticonderoga to Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and the rea≈øon why Mount Independence could not be defended was, that there were not works thrown up ≈øuitable to cover the men. Great part of the provi≈øion that was carried over to the Mount was, at the time of the retreat, at the foot of the Crane. The di≈øtance from the place the provi≈øion lay, to the top of the Mount, was about two hundred feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done at Mount Independence between the 20th of June and the 6th of July, 1777, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repairing the old works there, and adding new works?</p>
               <p>A. I was not at the ≈øouth end of Mount Independence, but I heard there were ≈øome ≈ømall works flung up there. The north end of Mount Independence appeared to me as u≈øual on the Thur≈øday or Friday preceding the evacuation. I ≈øaw no new fortifications on it, nor any additional works. I know there were no new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications where I expected there would have been ≈øome built.</p>
               <p>Q. Did General St. Clair ≈øend his ≈øon and baggage to Fort George, as a place of ≈øafety, before his evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know that he did of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the ≈øick, the public ≈øtores of ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing left behind, when the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated?</p>
               <p>A. Some of the ≈øick were carried off, which I ≈øaw. I know nothing re≈øpecting the other particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you heard General St. Clair give out that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 ≈øtrong?</p>
               <p>A. It was ≈øaid by General St. Clair while the enemy lay at Split Rock. I believe about a fortnight before the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Would the provi≈øion be (lying at the foot of the Crane) under the enemy's fire, after Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga ≈øhould be in their hands?</p>
               <p>A. They were within cannon ≈øhot of Ticonderoga, and the enemy mu≈øt have commanded the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were there not parties con≈øtantly at work, getting up the provi≈øion from the bottom to the top of the Mount?</p>
               <p>A. There was a party at work when I went to ≈øee what provi≈øion was there, and I ≈øuppo≈øe there was a party con≈øtantly at work. It was reported ≈øo.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. At what time of the day was it on Saturday that General Poor gave you the information of the evacuation being likely to take place?</p>
               <p>A. It was in the morning before breakfa≈øt. I don't know the time of the day. I took it General Poor was going to Head-Quarters.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What quantity of tallow had you in your po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion?</p>
               <p>A. One hundred and fifty-four barrels. If I remember right, there were 34<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 345 lbs.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Had you ever made any report of the tallow to me before the 26th of June?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. You have mentioned ≈øeveral times that I gave out that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 ≈øtrong. I ≈øhould be glad to know whether it was to you I told it, or how you came to be acquainted with it?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect the circum≈øtances but at one time; that was on the day it was ≈øaid the ≈øcout returned from Split Rock. I was at Head-Quarters, and I heard you ob≈øerve to ≈øeveral officers who were there, that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 ≈øtrong.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the company who were there?</p>
               <p>A. I can't recollect any per≈øon particular, but I think General Patter≈øon was there.</p>
               <p>

               <p>A. You did not ≈øay that the enemy lay at Split Rock, but that they con≈øi≈øted of about the number before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know of any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> between any of the parties from Ticonderoga and the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I heard of ≈øome people being killed and ≈øcalped between the brea≈øt-work and Ticonderoga landing, and I think there was a ≈øcalp brought in by ≈øome of Whitcomb's people.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know of any larger parties than twenty men being ≈øent out?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect any.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. You have mentioned Head-Quarters being ≈øtripped of baggage. I ≈øhould be glad to know what kind of baggage you ob≈øerved had been removed from thence?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect particular things.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What kind of baggage<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> had you ever ob≈øerved there?</p>
               <p>A. I had ob≈øerved uten≈øils, ≈øuch as drinking gla≈ø≈øes, one chair, a table and a vallefe; but all the uten≈øils I ≈øaw in the room at this time was one bowl, except a table and ≈øtools.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you ever ≈øee any thing removed from Head-Quarters?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øay ab≈øolutely that I did.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know whether there were parties employed in forming an abbitis about Mount Independence, at any time between the 20th of June and the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you ever ≈øee parties of axe-men ≈øent over there?</p>
               <p>A. I ≈øaw parties of axe-men go off the parade often, but I did not know where they went, nor did I a≈øk them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know whether the parties of axe-men you ≈øaw go off the parade were employed on the Ticonderoga ≈øide?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Mr. Yancey. Did you ever report to me that there was an ounce of tallow at Ticonderoga, or did it appear in any return of your's?</p>
               <p>A. I don't believe that I ever told you any thing about it, or made any return to you of it.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn to the hou≈øe of Capt. Rathburn, in King-Street, until Friday next, at nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>The Court met at Captain Rathburn's, in King's-≈øtreet, according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair admits that he wrote a letter to the Hon. John Jay, dated July 25th, 1777, in which there was a ≈øentiment, in ≈øub≈øtance, that if the General Officers had been again≈øt the evacuation of the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, it would have taken place, as he knew it would be impo≈ø≈øible to defend the po≈øts with his numbers.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Hale being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence when the evacuation of tho≈øe po≈øts took place?</p>
               <p>A. I was on Mount Independence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you command a regiment?</p>
               <p>A. I was Lieutenant Colonel of Colonel Leonard's regiment of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the time of ≈øervice of this regiment nearly expired when the evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence took place?</p>
               <p>A. It was nearly expired, as they viewed it, and I think within two or three days from the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the terms, as they viewed it?</p>
               <p>A. I mean the men viewed their time of ≈øervice to have commenced from the time they were rai≈øed, and the time they drew pay from. They, I under≈øtood, founded this belief from the order of the Brigadier, which was that they were rai≈øed for two months ≈øervice; which, when I ≈øhewed General St. Clair, he ≈øaid it was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the order of the Court. The order of the Court was, that they ≈øhould ≈øerve two months from the time of their being on the ground, to the be≈øt of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform General St. Clair that the men viewed their time of ≈øervice to be nearly expired, and when it took place were determined to go home?</p>
               <p>A. After I had heard ≈øomething ≈øaid among the people that they viewed their time of ≈øervice as nearly out, and it was talked among them if they ≈øtaid they ≈øhould get no pay, I ≈øpoke to them that the enemy were near, and that was the only time, if they came to do any thing, that it was to be done. I al≈øo ≈øpoke to ≈øome of the officers, with regard to the time of ≈øervice being nearly out, and told them I would inform the General of the circum≈øtances. After this, on Saturday preceding the evacuation, I waited on General St. Clair, to let him know what the regiment thought re≈øpecting the≈øe matters, and invited Lieut. Colonel May, the Colonel of the other Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts regiment, to go with me. We went, and I informed General St. Clair of the circum≈øtances I have related, and told him their unea≈øine≈øs with re≈øpect to drawing their money on the ground; who told me, that if they made up their rolls their money was ready for them. Lieutenant Colonel May and my≈øelf ≈øhewed the General the Brigadier's order, and the General ≈øaid it was different from the order of the Court. The men al≈øo made an excu≈øe that they had not been invited to ≈øtay. When we informed General St. Clair of the circum≈øtances, he ≈øaid the men mu≈øt not go away by any means if they were di≈øpo≈øed to go, and told me to write a certificate of the matter, and ≈øaid perhaps I ≈øhall give them a ≈ømall bounty, and ≈øaid your certificate will ju≈øtify me for ≈øo doing. The General ≈øaid he would let the matter re≈øt till morning and think on it, and would ≈øend word to me in the morning what propo≈øals to make to the regiment. I went and told the officers of it that night, who appeared to be well ≈øatisfied. It was near night when we parted from the General.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016141_0015_0F9C7A52E4B1FB60"/>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you not recollect your mentioning to me, or Lieutenant Colonel May, that the men con≈øidered their time nearly out, and were determined to go home when it was out, and ≈øugge≈øted to me that probably a ≈ømall bounty might induce them to ≈øtay?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What do you conceive the men under≈øtood by their ≈øaying that they were not invited to ≈øtay?</p>
               <p>A. Upon ≈øome of the men ≈øaying that their times were nearly out, I told them they mu≈øt ≈øtay longer if there was an occa≈øion for it. They ≈øaid they had not been invited to ≈øtay, and ≈øuppo≈øed, if they ≈øtaid, they ≈øhould get no pay for it. I con≈øidered it only as an excu≈øe of theirs, that they ≈øhould not get pay if they ≈øtaid after their time was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Had you ever before the Saturday informed General St. Clair of the mens opinion of the ≈øhort time they had to ≈øtay?</p>
               <p>A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What was your inducement for going to the General that day?</p>
               <p>A. Upon hearing what I have before related among≈øt the men, that they con≈øidered their time of ≈øervice as nearly out, and that ≈øome of them talked of going home, and to remove all unea≈øine≈øs about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What Rea≈øons have you to ≈øuppo≈øe the men would have ≈øtaid, had General St. Clair given them an invitation?</p>
               <p>A. The conver≈øation I had with them induced me to think ≈øo.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were you at Ca≈øtle-Town the day after the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did not both your's and Colonel May's regiment determine to leave the army that day?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were you pre≈øent when I had the two militia regiments drawn up, and ≈øpoke to them on that ≈øubject?</p>
               <p>A. No; but I knew that you were ≈øpeaking to one of the regiments. I was at a di≈øtance, and ≈øaw a parade of men, and you among≈øt them. The regiments were intermixed, and ≈øome of my men likely were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Did you know at the time what General St. Clair ≈øaid to them?</p>
               <p>A. I was unwell at a di≈øtance at the time, and did not know, but I under≈øtood afterwards, but don't know from whom, that he was ≈øaying ≈øomething to them about keeping with the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. When did the regiments leave the army?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was the fourth day at Manche≈øter.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Did the regiments go off by order?</p>
               <p>A. We were marching rather in di≈øorder, when General St. Clair a≈øked me whether I commanded that regiment? I told him I did, part of them; and he ≈øaid, By God, I wi≈øh you would embody them, and march them home.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did I not, in the cour≈øe of the march, frequently complain of the di≈øorder of the two regiments, and reprove them for it?</p>
               <p>A. Not in my hearing?</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were they not di≈øorderly on the march?</p>
               <p>A. They did not keep rank and file.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you remember of Colonel May's having reported to me that the men were willing to ≈øtay, but the officers were not?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did your regiment keep their ≈øtation that was a≈ø≈øigned them in the line of march?</p>
               <p>A. I know of no ≈øtation that was a≈ø≈øigned them but one day: Whether they kept it that day or not I don't remember.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did not your regiment break the line of march, and were you not halted by General Poor ju≈øt after leaving the picketted fort, who ≈øaid he would turn out a party of men, and order them to fire upon them?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the regiment Colonel May belonged to in the ≈øame ≈øituation with re≈øpect to the opinion of the men, that their time of ≈øervice was nearly expired, as your's was?</p>
               <p>A. Much the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>Q. When Colonel May went with you to General St. Clair, did he inform him that his men viewed their time of ≈øervice nearly expired, and were determined to go as ≈øoon as it was expired?</p>
               <p>A. We related what I have before mentioned.</p>

               <p>Major General Gates being ≈øworn, ≈øays, Some time in April, in the year 1777, I made a requi≈øition from Congre≈øs for the defence of the Northern Department, and e≈øtimated the troops nece≈ø≈øary for that ≈øervice as follows: Two Major Generals; ≈øix Brigadiers; one battalion of artillery, 600; twenty-five battalions of infantry, 12,500; two companies of rangers, 100; ≈øtaff, batteau-men, &amp;c. 400; total 13,600. At that time I did not expect General Burgoyne would have landed between 10 and 11,000 men. If I had, I ≈øhould have required more men for the defence of that department.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. During the time I had the honour of ≈øerving under you, did you ever di≈øcover in me cowardice, treachery, or incapacity as a general officer?</p>
               <p>A. From my long acquaintance with you as an officer, and particularly your u≈øefulne≈øs to me as a Brigadier General in the campaign of 1776, it excites my a≈øtoni≈øhment that there ≈øhould be ≈øuch charges as cowardice, treachery, or incapacity, exhibited again≈øt you. From any knowledge of you, both as an officer and a gentleman, I have the highe≈øt opinion of your courage, honour, capacity and fidelity.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion of the≈øe troops ought to be at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. At Fort Schuyler, 500. The intermediate po≈øts between Albany and Fort Schuyler inclu≈øive, 500. The po≈øts between Albany and Fort George inclu≈øive, 600. At Fort Ann and Skeen≈øborough, 300. The remainder at Ticonderoga and its dependencies. Be≈øides the≈øe, I expected aid from the Militia of the country, having unlimited powers from Congre≈øs for that purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What number of men would you have thought nece≈ø≈øary, had you been fully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the force of General Burgoyne?</p>
               <p>A. Three to two.</p>
               <p>Dr. Brown being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were the ≈øick removed from the ho≈øpital at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. All except four, whom it was un≈øafe to remove, as there was a chance of their recovery by remaining, and if they were removed, it was my opinion they would not have ≈øurvived to have reached Skeen≈øborough.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was any part of the medicines and ho≈øpital ≈øtores removed?</p>
               <p>A. A day or two days before the communication was cut off with Fort George, all were removed, except what was wanted for an immediate ≈øupply, which were all ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was any part of what was left at Ticonderoga ≈øent off?</p>
               <p>A. There was; but I cannot ≈øay what proportion was ≈øaved. There was an officer and fifty men given us, and boats ≈øufficient, and had they done their duty, it is my opinion we could have ≈øaved all the medicines and ≈øtores.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. How long before the evacuation took place were the ≈øick ≈øent off?</p>
               <p>A. There were a number of ≈øick ≈øent off ≈øome days before the evacuation took place; about the time the enemy appeared at Three Mile Point: The re≈øt, except the four, were removed at the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know whether there was a magazine of flour appropriated for the u≈øe of the ho≈øpital, ≈øeparate from the general magazine?</p>
               <p>A. I believe there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any provi≈øion arrive for the ho≈øpital, particularly, ≈øome days before the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. There were ≈øome ≈øheep, beeves and milch cows. I do not recollect the number.</p>
               <p>Q. In what ≈øituation was the army at the time of the evacuation, with re≈øpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. There were very few in the ho≈øpital, not above 100; a great proportion of them wounded. There were a number in the regiments not fit for duty, on account of the mea≈øles, and the con≈øequences of that di≈øorder, which had prevailed much; but not proper objects for the general ho≈øpital.</p>
               <p>Dr. Town≈øhend being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were the ≈øick removed from the ho≈øpital at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. All that could be removed with any degree of ≈øafety to them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was any part of the medicines and ho≈øpital ≈øtores removed?</p>
               <p>A. A day or two before, to the be≈øt of my remembrance, the communication with Fort George was clo≈øed, there was a large proportion carried over to the ≈øtore there, and only what was judged ≈øufficient was left for tho≈øe that remained on the ground.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was any part of what was left at Ticonderoga ≈øent off?</p>
               <p>A. Yes. Early in the evening, about dark, preceding the evacuation, we had a number of men ≈øent to carry the ≈øtores down to the landing on the ≈øouth ≈øide of Mount Independence. They worked very indu≈øtriou≈øly the fir≈øt of the evening, and packed nearly the whole, and the chief of them was carried to the landing, my≈øelf a≈ø≈øi≈øting; but the men, when they found the place was to be evacuated, de≈øerted us. We got the greater part into the boats, and went off to Skeen≈øborough in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. How long before the evacuation took place were the ≈øick ≈øent off?</p>
               <p>A. About the time the medicines were ≈øent off to Fort George. The ≈øick, that were not likely to recover in a few days, that could be ≈øent off without injuring them by tran≈øportation, were ≈øent to the ho≈øpital at Fort George.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know whether there was a magazine of flour appropriated for the u≈øe of the ho≈øpital, ≈øeparate from the general magazine?</p>
               <p>A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what ≈øituation was the army at the time of the evacuation, with re≈øpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. The army was healthy, except with re≈øpect to the mea≈øles, which had prevailed very generally through the camp. They had recovered of the mea≈øles at the time of the evacuation, but they had left many of them languid with coughs.</p>
               <p>Q. What ≈øituation was the army in a few days previous to the evacuation, with re≈øpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. Much in the ≈øame ≈øituation as they were at the time of the evacuation, except a number more had the mea≈øles then than had at the time of the evacuation. I examined a number of regiments a little before the evacuation particularly, and there were in general between thirty and forty unfit for duty, but not fit objects for the general ho≈øpital.</p>
               <p>

Que≈øtion to Dr. Brown. What ≈øituation was the army in a few days previous to the evacuation, with re≈øpect to health?</p>
               <p>A. I believe they were not quite ≈øo healthy as at the time of the evacuation, and not ≈øo many fit for duty, as they were recovering daily from the mea≈øles and its effects. I examined the regiments my≈øelf a few days before the evacuation, and the pre≈øcriptions of the ≈øurgeons, and found but very few but had from twenty to thirty unfit for duty. Some had more.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Dr. Brown. Were not the ho≈øpital ≈øurgeons frequently required to in≈øpect into the ≈øtate of the ≈øick in each regiment, and was it not done with a view that I might not be impo≈øed on by the regimental returns?</p>
               <p>A. They were de≈øired to do it frequently, and I have ≈øome idea of ≈øome conver≈øation pa≈ø≈øing between Dr. Potts and my≈øelf about the intention of doing it, but I do not recollect the particulars of it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Dr. Town≈øhend. The ≈øame as the la≈øt to Dr. Brown.</p>
               <p>A. We were directed to do it frequently, and there was ≈øcarcely a day pa≈ø≈øed but ≈øome of the regiments were examined by ≈øome of the ≈øurgeons of the general ho≈øpital.</p>
               <p>Colonel Hay, who acted as Deputy Quarter-Ma≈øter General for the army at Ticonderoga and Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, being ≈øworn, ≈øays: On Saturday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the day preceding the evacuation, I was ≈øent for by General St. Clair, who informed me that a Council of General Officers had been held, and they had determined to evacuate the garri≈øon next morning. I then took the liberty of a≈øking the General if he had received orders from General Schuyler? He told me he had not. To which I took the liberty of ≈øaying I was extremely ≈øorry for it. The General ≈øaid he knew very well what I meant, and he had ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øidered the con≈øequences of the ≈øtep he was taking. If he remained there, he would ≈øave his character and lo≈øe the army; if he went off, he would ≈øave the army and lo≈øe his character; the la≈øt of which he was determined to ≈øacrifice to the cau≈øe in which he was engaged. The General then de≈øired me to prepare every thing for the removal of as many of the ≈øtores as po≈ø≈øible. I then told the General, that as the wind blowed hard from the north-ea≈øt, and the batteaus were lying at the ≈øouth end of Mount Independence, it would be impo≈ø≈øible to get them round to remove the greate≈øt part of the ≈øtores. The General ≈øaid it mu≈øt at all events be attempted; for if the enemy knew of our de≈øign to evacuate the place, they would certainly cut off our retreat; but, on further con≈øideration, ≈øaid he would take the opinion of the General Officers, and let me know the re≈øult. In the mean time, that I was to prepare every thing po≈ø≈øible for carrying off the ≈øtores, which I did as far as the wind, which ro≈øe much higher, would permit. I ≈øaw the General afterwards at ≈øun≈øet, who told me that Generals Poor and Patter≈øon were of opinion the evacuation ought not to be retarded. What few boats were near Ticonderoga ≈øide were then given to the artillery men, and the mo≈øt valuable ≈øtores on that ≈øide carried down to the wharff on that ≈øide. About nine the General ≈øent for me again, and having a≈øked what I had done, de≈øired me to go as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible to Mount Independence, order as many boats as could be brought from the ≈øouth ≈øide of the Mount to bring off the provi≈øions that were lying near the Crane, leaving a proper proportion for the medicines, ammunition, and other mo≈øt valuable ≈øtores, which were to be carried down to the ≈øouth ≈øide. About, I think, one o'clock, I ≈øaw the General again on Mount Independence, who begged that we would make all the di≈øpatch po≈ø≈øible, and carry off all that we could in boats by day light. I then went down to where the provi≈øion laid, and got a very con≈øiderable number of boats loaded, which at break of day were taken round to the ≈øouth end of the Mount by the General's order. When I got there I found the ≈øoldiers in the utmo≈øt confu≈øion, and could not by threats or promi≈øes prevail on them to unload from the waggon, and embark on board the boats the mo≈øt valuable part of the General's baggage. Nearly about ≈øun-ri≈øe the General him≈øelf came up, and begged, if po≈ø≈øible, I would ≈øave his papers, and pay no attention to the re≈øt of his baggage I ≈øpoke to Colonel Long, who, I under≈øtood afterwards had received orders from the General, was to command by water, and went off him≈øelf after the army that had marched ≈øome ≈øhort time before. Some days before the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being at Head Quarters after dinner, there were three field officers there (I think Colonels, but am not certain) who had lately arrived with a ≈øtrong reinforcement of militia. Being a≈øked by the General what time they could po≈ø≈øibly ≈øtay? they replied, it would be impo≈ø≈øible to detain them but a very few days, as they had not a ≈øecond ≈øhirt to their backs, having fir≈øt turned out with no other view than driving a party of the enemy from Otter-Creek. I went off by water.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair produces a return made to him by Colonel Hay, which Colonel Hay acknowledges was made by him to General St. Clair, and which Colonel Hay thinks mu≈øt have been made by him about the 21≈øt of June, 1777; which, being read, is as follows:</p>

               <p>UDREY HAY, D. Q. M. G.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know whether the men, returned by you as con≈øtant fatigue-men, were not included in the daily details for fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. I am certain they were not included in the daily details for fatigue, being appropriated entirely to my department, and under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the greater part of the provi≈øion and ≈øtores were got off from the garri≈øon?</p>
               <p>A. The greater part of the provi≈øion, I am certain, was not. I cannot an≈øwer with re≈øpect to the ≈øtores, as when we arrived at Skeen≈øborough I had no time to examine them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the body of the militia that arrived ≈øome days before the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the number.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know of more than one body of militia arriving?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was there a ≈øufficient number of boats at the po≈øt to carry off all the provi≈øion?</p>
               <p>A. There was not a ≈øufficient number to have carried off the provi≈øion and the other ≈øtores.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many ox-teams were employed at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence at the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell, having lo≈øt all my returns; but the number was not large, as in that wilderne≈øs there was not gra≈øs to maintain them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. In what condition were the ox-teams that were employed at the≈øe po≈øts?</p>
               <p>A. The oxen were in poor working order, but might probably have brought the provi≈øion from the landing, had they no other garri≈øon duty to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know of any parties having been ≈øent out by General St. Clair to di≈øcover the enemy's numbers, or to annoy them in their progre≈øs again≈øt the garri≈øon?</p>
               <p>A. To di≈øcover their numbers, I know of parties having been frequently ≈øent out, and the General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained they were in ≈øuch dread of the ≈øavages, he could not get proper intelligence from them. I know of none ≈øent out to annoy the enemy in their progre≈øs, but the regular pickets that were ≈øent out.</p>
               <p>Q. How large were the≈øe parties that were ≈øent out to di≈øcover the enemy's numbers?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot an≈øwer with any exactne≈øs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:016141_0019_0F9C7A55E60CB130"/>Q. Court. Do you know whether the troops were courageous, and had a de≈øire to improve every advantage again≈øt the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. Their own words, and the facts which aro≈øe when they were ≈øent out, were ≈øo very different, that it was difficult to judge, as they were generally beat back again.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn till to-morrow, nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn, by his Excellency's de≈øire, until Thur≈øday next, at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourn, by his Excellency's de≈øire, until Monday, nine o'clock, to meet in camp.</p>

               <p>The Court met in Camp according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Colonel Ko≈øeiu≈øzko being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect what the ≈øtrength of the fatigue parties was, that were employed on Mount Independence on or about the 23d day of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. About five or ≈øix hundred men were employed on the batteries at Mount Independence as fatigue men, after General Schuyler had been at Ticonderoga, and had given directions to put new works on Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. There was al≈øo a party employed in front of the works, in a thick wood, cutting abbatis; I do not recollect the number. I remember that General Fermoy's brigade was employed in the wood cutting abbatis. General Fermoy him≈øelf was there two or three days. Be≈øides the≈øe, I always ≈øent a fatigue party to cut the abbatis.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know whether there was a fatigue party likewi≈øe employed at the time on the Ticonderoga ≈øide?</p>
               <p>A. I know there was a fatigue party employed on the brea≈øt-work.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you not, by my orders, make ≈øome additions to the works on the Ticonderoga ≈øide?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; between the we≈øt end of the French lines and the Lake. It was not quite fini≈øhed at the time of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Suppo≈øing Ticonderoga to have been abandoned, and the enemy to have been in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, would it have been po≈ø≈øible to have maintained the works on the point of Mount Independence, that were made for the command of the Lake and the defence of the bridge?</p>
               <p>A. No; as the ground overlooked them about fifty feet.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect where the place from which we got our water was, on Mount Independence ≈øide, and the ≈øituation of it?</p>
               <p>A. On the we≈øt ≈øide of Mount Independence, on the low ground, near the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Could we ea≈øily get at the water?</p>
               <p>A. No; It was very ≈øteep, and I think about one half a mile di≈øtant from the fort.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Suppo≈øing the enemy had pa≈ø≈øed ≈øome of their ve≈ø≈øels into South-Bay, would it not have been wholly in their power to have cut us off from the water?</p>
               <p>A. The ≈øpring would have been expo≈øed to the fire of the enemy.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the di≈øtance from the Lake to Ea≈øt-Creek, beyond the ≈øouth end of Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. About one half a mile or three quarters.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Would it not have been in the enemy's power to have annoyed, from the ve≈ø≈øels from South-Bay, any troops that might have been marching acro≈øs the I≈øthmus to the relief of Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. It would have been in the enemy's power to have done it on account of the pa≈ø≈øage being narrow, a thick wood, and the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect whether any works were begun to improve the redoubt on the high ground, on the point of Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; by your order I marked out the lines, and prepared the fa≈øcines; which was after General Schuyler left Ticonderoga.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. In what condition was the fort upon Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. It was a picketted fort, only for ≈ømall arms. Picketted all round, ≈øome good and ≈øome bad.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. How many men could the fort contain with convenience for the defence of it?</p>
               <p>A. About 1000 men.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What batteries had the enemy erected again≈øt Ticonderoga at the time, or before the evacuation took place?</p>
               <p>A. One battery was erected again≈øt the Jer≈øey redoubt on the oppo≈øite ≈øide of the Lake, about half a mile di≈øtant, and on higher ground. They had made ≈øome works where they had an encampment again≈øt the French lines, about half a mile or three quarters di≈øtant. The enemy had al≈øo taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Mount Hope, a retrenched camp, which had been occupied by us the campaign before, by which the communication with Lake George was cut off. They had taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the mill, burnt the block-hou≈øe, and pa≈ø≈øed on the other ≈øide of the creek, where they took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a hill which commanded all Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and had begun a firing on the ≈øloop that was ≈øtationed for the defence of the pa≈ø≈øage from Lake George. They had al≈øo begun ≈øome works on a point on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the Lake, oppo≈øite to the bridge.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect Colonel May's having told me, after I had ≈øpoke to the militia at Ca≈øtle-Town, that the men would ≈øtay, but the officers would not?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect Colonel May's having told you of it, but I met ≈øome of the militia on the retreat, and having expre≈ø≈øed my ≈øurprize at their not ≈øtaying to fight for their country, they an≈øwered, they were willing to ≈øtay, but their officers would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Could the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels lie in South-Bay, in a ≈øituation to command the ≈øpring, and not be expo≈øed to our batteries on Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. There was high ground, and batteries could have been placed there to prevent them.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Could the enemy's ≈øhips lie in South-Bay, in a ≈øituation mo≈øt to annoy a reinforcement going to Mount Independence, without being expo≈øed to the fire of our batteries from Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. They could.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:016141_0020_0F9C7A56A65C7710"/>Q. Court. Was there any other ≈øpring on Mount Independence, out of the enemy's fire, that the garri≈øon could have been ≈øupplied with water from?</p>
               <p>A. No other la≈øting one.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What kind of ground was it on the height on Mount Independence. Whether ≈øtony, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of rai≈øing a parapet on. or of ≈øinking a ditch?</p>
               <p>A. Very ≈øtony and rocky ground, and would require a great deal of labour to put on the works. A ditch could not be ≈øunk to any proper depth without blowing the rocks.</p>
               <p>Brigadier General Wilkin≈øon being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Do you recollect what means were taken by me to gain intelligence of the approach of the enemy, and their numbers?</p>
               <p>A. By ≈øcouts and detachments, both by land and by water.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Were not there ≈øcouts and detachments ≈øent out frequently?</p>
               <p>A. There was an e≈øtabli≈øhed daily ≈øcout, as well as I recollect, be≈øides many that were ≈øent out occa≈øionally.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Do you recollect the di≈øtance from Ticonderoga to Gilliland's Creek?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot a≈øcertain the di≈øtance.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Do you recollect the nature of the ground between Ticonderoga and Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liland's Creek?</p>
               <p>A. I can judge of it only from ob≈øervation as I pa≈ø≈øed up and down the Lake. On the we≈øt ≈øide it is a mountainous craggy country, the mountains in many places jutting in full upon the Lake. On the ea≈øt ≈øide a flat low country covered with wood.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Could large detachments of troops, had our garri≈øon been in a ≈øituation to have afforded them, march through that country on the we≈øt ≈øide of the Lake?</p>
               <p>A. Not without great difficulty and probable lo≈øs, on either ≈øide of the Lake.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Was there not, notwith≈øtanding the difficulty of the country, frequently ≈ømall parties ≈øent out towards Gilliland's Creek, to di≈øcover the approach and ≈øtrength of the enemy, and were there not parties ≈øent out on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the Lake with the ≈øame view?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. If large detachments had been ≈øent out at ≈øuch a di≈øtance that they could not have been ≈øupported with the whole force of the garri≈øon, could they have retarded the progre≈øs of the enemy, or mu≈øt they not have fallen into their hands?</p>
               <p>A. They might have given a momentary check, but mu≈øt inevitably have been out off.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Do you recollect my ≈øending out ≈øerjeant Heath, with a party, previous to any account we had of the embarkation of the enemy on the Lake, with orders to proceed to Point au-Fer, or whenever he ≈øhould find the enemy, endeavour to make a pri≈øoner, and bring me an account of them?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect the officer's name, but I recollect a ≈øcout was ≈øent out for that purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Do you recollect the account he brought?</p>
               <p>A. I recollect, that he informed that he di≈øcovered the enemy ≈øomewhere about Gilliland's Creek, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and that he conceived them to be in force.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's Que≈øtion. Do you recollect in what part of the country he was when he made the di≈øcovery?</p>
               <p>A. I think he was on the ea≈øt ≈øhore, oppo≈øite to Gilliland's Creek. I do not recollect the di≈øtance.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you hear of any other debarkation of the enemy than at Gilliland's Creek, from the time of their embarkation at Point-au-Fer to their landing at or near the Three Mile Point?</p>
               <p>A. We were informed of their approach to Crown Point, and of their being encamped there. I don't recollect any other particular debarkation until their arrival at or near Three Mile Point.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Had we not information of numerous parties of the ≈øavages being in the country, on the we≈øt ≈øide of the Lake?</p>
               <p>A. We had, and found them ≈øo very numerous that our parties could ≈øcarce ever get in view of the enemy, though many attempts were made to di≈øcover their ≈øituation.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were there actions ≈øeveral times between our parties and the ≈øavages?</p>
               <p>A. There were, and I remember our parties on tho≈øe occa≈øions were routed.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the ≈øtrength of the fatigue parties that were detailed on or after the 20th of June?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot particularly a≈øcertain the number. I remember that the fatigue parties and guards generally amounted to about one fourth of the number of effectives fit for duty in the garri≈øon, and ≈øome times one third.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Be≈øides the number of men for fatigue that was detailed, was there not a con≈øtant fatigue party with the Quarter Ma≈øter General, and a regiment of militia al≈øo employed in con≈øtant fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. The Quarter-Ma≈øter General had a con≈øtant fatigue party, be≈øides the number that was furni≈øhed him by the details. There were be≈øides, 100 men employed on daily duty from two regiments of militia.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect my having ordered the fatigue on Mount Independence to be done by a brigade at a time, under the command of a Brigadier; and was not this number al≈øo exclu≈øive of the detail for fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. I recollect there was, and they were exclu≈øive of the detail for fatigue, except the proportion from the brigade ordered on duty.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the dimini≈øhing the camp guards, and was it not done on account of the ≈øeverity of duty, by having ≈øo many men on fatigue?</p>
               <p>A. I recollect it, and it was done upon that principle.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. As you lived with me, you mu≈øt be acquainted with the baggage I had. I wi≈øh you would mention it.</p>
               <p>A. You had a portmanteau, and a che≈øt which contained your baggage; al≈øo ≈øome kitchen furniture.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was any part of my baggage ≈øent off from Ticonderoga previous to the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016141_0021_0F9C7A5764CC5D48"/>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What age was my ≈øon, who left Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. He was a mere child; about ten or twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was any part of my baggage ≈øent off with him when he was ≈øent to Fort George?</p>
               <p>A. No part of it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Could any of my baggage have been removed without your being acquainted with it?</p>
               <p>A. I don't think it po≈ø≈øibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was any part of the furniture belonging to Head-Quarters removed to any other place previous to the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect what orders were given to the troops on the evacuation being determined upon?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, as I was then employed in fixing an occa≈øional picket, but I believe the orders were given to the Brigadiers.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was there a ≈øtrong picket advanced of the French lines, and the other pickets reinforced, ≈øo as to form a chain of centinels the night of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know it of my own knowledge, as I was ordered to Mount Independence to give orders about loading the battea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>; but, from every information I received, I am induced to think there was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was not the order for the march of the troops, the ≈øtriking their tents, and loading their baggage, delivered by you to ≈øome of the regiments on Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. The order for ≈øtriking their tents and loading their baggage was delivered by me, and di≈øper≈øed to all the regiments about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. How was the retreat conducted?</p>
               <p>A. The troops pu≈øhed out of Mount Independence without order or regularity, in a great deal of confu≈øion. I remember that, after you had got them ≈øtretched, you rode from the rear to the front, in order to halt and throw them into ≈øome form, but your orders were directly di≈øobeyed, and the militia would not halt, but pu≈øhed on, and drew after them many of the continental troops. When we arrived at Hubbarton, the army halted, and was refre≈øhed as well as our circum≈øtances would admit. After waiting a length of time, two or three hours, for the rear guard and ≈øtragglers, you moved on with the main body, leaving the command with Colonel Warner, with orders to follow as ≈øoon as the whole came up.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were not many of the continental regiments got into good order ≈øoon after they left Mount Independence, and did not the rear guard come off in very good order?</p>
               <p>A. There were ≈øeveral regiments got into tolerable good order by your halting them, and other attempts, and the rear guard under Colonel Francis came off in very good order.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the daily ≈øcout that was ≈øent out to gain intelligence of the enemy's approach and ≈øtrength?</p>
               <p>A. From fifteen to twenty-five. It was a ≈øubaltern's light command.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the ≈øtrength of tho≈øe that were ≈øent out occa≈øionally for that purpo≈øe?</p>
               <p>A. Their numbers varied. I remember one which amounted to 100.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the time this ≈øcout, con≈øi≈øting of 100, was ≈øent out?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect the day, but the occa≈øion was the enemy had made a couple of pri≈øoners, and fell in with a returning ≈øcout of ours which they routed; in con≈øequence of which this party was detached to come up with them if po≈ø≈øible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where the enemy lay at the time?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot recollect particularly, but believe at Gilliland's Creek.</p>
               <p>Q. After the enemy had landed at Three Mile Point, were any parties ≈øent out to annoy them in their approach towards the garri≈øon?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. How large were the≈øe parties?</p>
               <p>A. There were two ≈ømall parties ≈øent out. I believe they might have been about 60 men. They were routed and pur≈øued by the Indians.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any orders given for the de≈øtruction of the barracks at the time of the evacuation of the garri≈øons of Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, or before?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge. The rea≈øon General St. Clair a≈ø≈øigned for not ≈øetting them on fire was, it would have betrayed our movement to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you ≈øuppo≈øe it would have had that operation?</p>
               <p>A. It mo≈øt certainly would.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the number of men returned on command in your return of the 28th of June, on command in the garri≈øon, or where?</p>
               <p>A. There were many of them on command in the garri≈øon. I do not recollect the number. Some were on command at Fort Schuyler; ≈øome at Albany, and on the communication to Ticonderoga; at Skeen≈øborough, Fort-Ann, Lake-George landing, and at the block-hou≈øe at the ≈øaw-mill.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. During my command at Ticonderoga, or at the time of the evacuation, did you perceive any in≈øtances of cowardice in me?</p>
               <p>A. No; but I have upon every occa≈øion ob≈øerved a direct contrary conduct.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were you with me at Princeton and Trenton, and did you ob≈øerve any in≈øtance of cowardice in me there?</p>
               <p>A. I was. I ob≈øerved no in≈øtance of cowardice in you, but, on the contrary, upon every occa≈øion of danger, you manife≈øted the utmo≈øt coolne≈øs and intrepidity.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. At the affair of Princeton do you recollect your riding up to me, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me that our troops had given way in the centre; and do you recollect what pa≈ø≈øed between me and you upon that occa≈øion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016141_0022_0F9C7A5B256C75A8"/>A. I recollect your begging me to take no notice of it, left it ≈øhould communicate a pannic to the troops we were with.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. At the time the picket was attacked at Ticonderoga, which occa≈øioned ≈øome firing from the lines, and at every other time when there was firing, did I not transport my≈øelf to the place with the utmo≈øt expedition?</p>
               <p>A. You did; and your po≈øitive injunctions to the officers and exhortations to the ≈øoldiery were, to re≈øerve their fire until the enemy came within a very certain ≈øhot.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were there any other pickets placed by you be≈øides tho≈øe mentioned in the orderly book?</p>
               <p>A. There was an additional picket of 50 men po≈øted on the left of the French lines, without them, every night, which came off in the morning; and a ≈øimilar picket, ≈øubject to the ≈øame orders, was po≈øted on the point to the right of the Jer≈øey redoubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. During the time you were with General St. Clair at Ticonderoga, did you ob≈øerve any conduct of his that induced you to think him treacherous to the United States?</p>
               <p>A. No; but he did, upon every occa≈øion, manife≈øt the mo≈øt enthu≈øia≈øtic zeal for the good of the cau≈øe of the United States.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know the particular period when General St. Clair had compleat information of the number and de≈øigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. The fir≈øt information of their number and de≈øign which he received, that could be relied on was, I think, two days before the evacuation. This intelligence was by ≈øtratagem obtained from a pri≈øoner.</p>

                     <p>NOT finding a convenient opportunity to ≈øend off my letter, I have the plea≈øure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th. The ≈øucce≈øs of General Wa≈øhington over General Howe is an event of ≈øuch importance, as mu≈øt de≈øtroy every pro≈øpect of the enemy's carrying their plans into execution, ≈øhould they ≈øuccced here. I have ordered a feu-de-joye upon the occa≈øion, and will find ≈øome way to communicate the intelligence to the enemy. We have now two ≈øhips, eighteen gun boats, and three ≈øloops, lying off the Three Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the point, and retrenching it. This does not look like their being ≈øtrong. Other matters I hope to manage to-morrow morning, but cannot be particular for fear of accidents.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YESTERDAY at noon, in the very in≈øtant of the feu-de-joye, which con≈øi≈øted of thirteen pieces of cannon (the mu≈øketry might have di≈øcovered to the enemy our numbers) forty-one batteaus appeared of me Three Mile Point, cro≈ø≈øed the Lake, and landed troops on the ea≈øt ≈øide, in the Bay formed behind the Long Point, oppo≈øite to the Three Mile Point. I ob≈øerved them very attentively, and am certain they did not contain on an average above twenty men. It is not improbable, however, that part of the troops tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in them from Canada may have landed on the we≈øtern ≈øide, ≈øo low down as to be out of our ≈øight, and I am rather inclined to think this the ca≈øe, from their camp extending a con≈øiderable di≈øtance down the Lake, and its being much too large for the number of men we ≈øaw debark at the Point.</p>
                     <p>I am in great pain for the batteaus and ≈øtores at the Landing. We cannot po≈ø≈øibly get them over (the enemy having po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves of Mount Hope) without ri≈øking ≈øuch large detachments as might oblige us to come to action in the open field, which would not be altogether prudent. I had ordered a party to bring them off this morning, but the e≈øcape of ≈øome of the cattle, and the ≈øtupidity of the drivers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded us ≈øo much that day appeared, and it was then too late to attempt it. The de≈øign was therefore laid a≈øide, and a party ≈øent to reinforce the party at the Landing, with orders to take back the ≈øtores to Fort-George, and all the batteaus, de≈øtroying the block-hou≈øe, and ≈øuch batteaus as they might not be able to carry off. At the ≈øame time I ≈øent orders to the block-hou≈øe at the mills, which has been attacked ≈øeveral times, and was ≈øurrounded ye≈øterday all day, for the officer to ≈øet fire to it and the mills, and to retire to camp, which he has this moment effected. The party gone over with the boats I have de≈øired to return by Skeen≈øborough. It will be of the utmo≈øt importance to ≈øecure that communication, which I have no doubt of your being able to do; and when the Grant people come in, I hope to keep open that by Ca≈øtle-Town. A party of them, with cattle, ≈øhould have been here ye≈øterday. I hope no accident has happened them.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants who live between this and the bridge, I found it nece≈ø≈øary to bring within the lines, and have now ≈øent them to Skeen≈øborough, with directions to Captain Gray to forward them to Albany by the fir≈øt opportunity. I do not know that they are our enemies, but they are certainly not our friends; and when the enemy fir≈øt pre≈øented them≈øelves they were through their hou≈øes, and they gave us no intelligence of them</p>
                     <p>I am ≈øtill of opinion that the enemy have no great force here, but whether the whole of their army may as yet be come up I am not certain, but la≈øt night they tired their evening gun from three different places, farther down the Lake than their po≈øt at Three Mile Point. A little time will clear up this matter.</p>
                     <p>I am not ≈øufficiently acquainted with this country to form any judgment how a body of men can be ≈øent out to our relief, in ca≈øe the enemy po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of the ≈øhores of the Lake above Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016141_0023_0F9C7A6126094E00"/>
which they certainly will by means of their ≈øavages; but if they can be brought by land in their rear, a ≈ømall party would oblige them to quit the Lake, and con≈øequently leave the communication Open.</p>

The enemy's lo≈øs we are not apprized of, but we have one pri≈øoner of the 47th regiment, and two de≈øerters from the corps of Jagers. The pri≈øoner was very ≈øulky, and would give no information whatever; but by di≈øgui≈øing an officer, a countryman of his, and confining him in the ≈øame room with him, with the help of a little rum, we got out all he knew, which have here inclo≈øed, as al≈øo the examination of the de≈øerters.

I have wrote very pre≈ø≈øingly for the people to come on, and for the pre≈øent leave the cattle to be brought up by tho≈øe who ≈øucceed them.

                     <p>CONGRESS may probably think it extraordinary that ≈øo much time ≈øhould have elap≈øed before they heard from me, after a ≈øtep of ≈øuch con≈øequence as the evacuation of the po≈øts that had been entru≈øted to my care, but it was not in my power to write whil≈øt on the march to this place. I am ≈øorry to find that my letter to General Schuyler, the night the evacuation took place, has not come to his hands; as, for want of that, tho' he has doubtle≈øs informed Congre≈øs of the matter, he could not give them the rea≈øons that induced it. They were the≈øe:</p>
                     <p>Seeing that the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were nearly inve≈øted, and having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by my ≈øpies that they would be compleatly ≈øo in twenty-four hours, when we ≈øhould be cut off from all po≈ø≈øibility of ≈øuccour; that the batteries of the enemy were ready to open, and the whole of our encampment, on the Ticonderoga ≈øide, expo≈øed to their fire; con≈øidering, at the ≈øame time, the weakne≈øs of the garri≈øon, that the effective numbers were not ≈øufficient to man one half of the works, and that, con≈øequently, the whole mu≈øt be upon con≈øtant duty, which they could not po≈ø≈øibly long ≈øu≈øtain, and that of cour≈øe the places, with the garri≈øon, mu≈øt inevitably in a very few days fall into the enemy's hands; I ≈øaw no alternative but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to evacuate them and bring off the army. Whereupon I called the General Officers together, to take their ≈øentiments. They were unanimou≈øly of opinion that the places ≈øhould be evacuated without the lea≈øt lo≈øs of time; and it was accordingly ≈øet about that night, the 5th in≈øtant, after embarking in boats as much of our cannon, provi≈øion and ≈øtores, as was po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                     <p>With the boats, which were ordered to Skeen≈øborough, I ≈øent Colonel Long, an active, diligent, good officer, to take the command there, with his regiment and the invalids, until I ≈øhould join him with the army, which was to march to that place by Ca≈øtle-Town. The body of the army reached Ca≈øtle-Town the next evening, thirty miles from Ticonderoga, and twelve from Skeen≈øborough; but the rear guard, under the command of Colonel Warner, which, with the ≈øtragglers and infirm, amounted to near 1200, ≈øtopped ≈øhort of that place ≈øix miles, and were next morning attacked by a ≈øtrong detachment the enemy had ≈øent to hang upon our rear and retard our march. Two regiments of militia, who had left us the evening before, and halted about two miles from Colonel Warner, were immediately ordered to his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; but, to my great ≈øurprize, they marched directly down to me. At the ≈øame time I received information that the enemy were in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Skeen≈øborough, and had cut off all our boats and armed ve≈ø≈øels. This obliged me to change my route, that I might not be put betwixt two fires, and at the ≈øame time be able to bring off Colonel War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to whom I ≈øent orders, if he found the enemy too ≈øtrong, to retreat to Rutland, where he would find me to cover him, that place lying nearly at an equal di≈øtance from both. Before my orders reached him his party was di≈øper≈øed, after having for a con≈øiderable time ≈øu≈øtained a very warm engagement, in which the enemy ≈øuffered ≈øo much, that they pur≈øued but a very ≈ømall di≈øtance. Our lo≈øs I cannot a≈øcertain, but believe it does not exceed 40 killed and wounded. About 200 of the party have joined me at Rutland and ≈øince, but great numbers of them are ≈øtill mi≈ø≈øing, and I ≈øu≈øpect have got down into New-England by the way of No. Four. After a very fatiguing march of ≈øeven days, in which the army ≈øuffered much from bad weather and want of provi≈øion, I joined General Schuyler the 12th in≈øtant.</p>
                     <p>It was my original plan to retreat to this place, that I might be betwixt General Burgoyne and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and that the militia might have ≈øomething in this quarter to collect to. It is now effected, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia are coming in, ≈øo that I have the mo≈øt ≈øanguine hopes that the progre≈øs of the enemy will be checked, and I may yet have the ≈øatisfaction to experience, that, altho' I have lo≈øt a po≈øt, I have eventually ≈øaved a State.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps I may be cen≈øured, by tho≈øe who are unacquainted with the ≈øituation I was in, for not ≈øooner call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the militia to my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. I think I informed Congre≈øs that I could not do that for want of provi≈øion; and as ≈øoon as I got a ≈øupply I did call for them, and was joined by near 900 the day before the evacuation, but they came from home ≈øo ill provided, that they could not, nor did not, propo≈øe to ≈øtay with me but a few days. The two Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts regiments of militia likewi≈øe, which compo≈øed part of the garri≈øon, gave me notice that their time expired in two days, and they intended then to go home. In vain did I beg of their officers to exert every influence they had over them, and, from their ≈øub≈øequent behaviour, I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded the officers are mo≈øt to blame. They kept with me, however, for two days on the march, but their conduct, was ≈øo licentious aud di≈øorderly, and their example beginning to affect the continental troops, I was con≈øtrained to ≈øend them off.</p>
                     <p>Inclo≈øed is a copy of the Council of War, in which you will find the principles upon which the retreat was undertaken. As I found all the General Officers ≈øo fully of opinion that it ≈øhould be done immediately,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016141_0024_0F9C7A61E6231B78"/>
I forbore to mention to them many circum≈øtances which might have influenced them, and which I ≈øhould have laid before them, had they been of different ≈øentiments. For I was, and ≈øtill am, ≈øo firmly convinced of the nece≈ø≈øity, as well as the propriety of it, that I believe I ≈øhould have ventured upon it, had they been every one again≈øt it.</p>
                     <p>I have the utmo≈øt confidence in the candour of Congre≈øs, and per≈øuade my≈øelf, notwith≈øtanding the lo≈øs they have ≈øu≈øtained, when they have impartially con≈øidered that I was po≈øted, with little more than 2000 men, in a place that required 10,000 to defend it‚Äîthat the≈øe 2000 were ill equipped and wor≈øe armed, not above one bayonet in ten, an arm e≈ø≈øential in the defence of lines‚Äîthat with the≈øe 2000 I have made good a retreat from under the no≈øe of an army at lea≈øt four times their numbers, and have them now betwixt the enemy and the country, ready to act again≈øt them‚Äîthat my conduct will appear at lea≈øt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving cen≈øure.</p>

               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Varrick being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mu≈øter the troops at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence in the month of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; except Colonel Long's regiment, which was mu≈øtered before I arrived there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the continental troops with re≈øpect to arms?</p>
               <p>A. Some of them very indifferent. The three New-Hamp≈øhire regiments, Colonel Scammel's, Colonel Cilley's and Colonel Hale's, had pretty good French arms, and chiefly bayonets. I believe a majority of the other regiments had not bayonets. The militia regiments had arms, but very indifferent, but no bayonets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the corps of artillery or artificers any arms?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lines and redoubts at Ticonderoga furni≈øhed with ≈øpears?</p>
               <p>A. They were furni≈øhed with ≈øome ≈øpears and ≈øharp pointed poles, but whether there were ≈øufficient or not for them I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did General St. Clair inform you on or about the 26th or 27th of June, 1777, of the quantity of provi≈øion he had in the garri≈øon?</p>
               <p>A. I think he mentioned to me he had about thirty-≈øix days of the meat kind. Flour, I do not know what quantity he had.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were there not a great many boys among≈øt the troops?</p>
               <p>A. There was a number of boys, old men and negroes. I di≈ømi≈ø≈øed at the mu≈øter 50, as po≈øitively unfit for any kind of ≈øervice, and would have di≈ømi≈ø≈øed more, had you not de≈øired me to be very tender, as you had ≈øo few troops in garri≈øon.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did not my ≈øon pa≈øs the Lake from Ticonderoga with you?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; he pa≈ø≈øed the Lake at my reque≈øt. I urged the matter to you.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did any part of my baggage go over when he went with you?</p>
               <p>A. None. Some of your ≈øon's clothes were left behind.</p>
               <p>Major Hull being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. How was the retreat in General from Mount Independence conducted?</p>
               <p>A. The general plan of the retreat, I think, was very well, though there was ≈øome part of the troops that behaved di≈øorderly.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. During the time of my command at Ticonderoga, did you ever ob≈øerve any kind of cowardice, treachery, or inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy in me?</p>
               <p>A. Not the lea≈øt appearance of either.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the circum≈øtance of my ordering a ≈øtrong picket out the night of the evacuation under Colonel Francis, and that it was directed to be of picked men?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What was the general plan of the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. General Poor's brigade was ordered in front, the militia next, General Patter≈øon's brigade next, General Fermoy's brigade after him, and the rear guard, con≈øi≈øting about 450 men, under the command of Colonel Francis. Over the fir≈øt part of the ground we marched in file, owing to the nature of the country; where the ground would admit of it we marched in platoons. General Poor's brigade, as far as I was capable of ≈øeeing, when they fir≈øt marched off from Mount Independence, marched off in good order.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. How were the invalids di≈øpo≈øed of at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. Tho≈øe who were not able to march were ≈øent by water. The others marched with their re≈øpective regiments.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What quantity of provi≈øion was ordered for the troops to take with them before they left the garri≈øon?</p>
               <p>A. I think eight days; principally pork and flour, and ≈øome hard bread.</p>
               <p>Brigadier General Poor being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know what means were taken to di≈øcover the approach and ≈øtrength of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. By continually ≈øending ≈øcouts by land on both ≈øides of the Lake, and by water.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you ever hear of any landing the enemy made but at Gilliland's Creek, until they came to Crown-Point?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect my ≈øending out ≈øerjeant Heath, with a party, to make di≈øcoveries?</p>
               <p>A. No; but I recollect your ≈øending out Lieutenant Lifer, who returned with two pri≈øoners. I remember your ≈øending out a per≈øon with orders to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy were, who brought intelligence that the enemy were on the well ≈øide of the Lake at Gilliland's Creek.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:016141_0025_0F9C7A5CA8BEB5B8"/>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the general ≈øtrength of the parties that were ≈øent out?</p>
               <p>A. Sometimes a Subaltern's command, ≈øometimes a Captain's command, Captain Whitcomb being out frequently; ≈øometimes by twos and threes, merely as ≈øpies.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Would the ≈øending of larger parties have an≈øwered a better purpo≈øe than of ≈øending the parties that were ≈øent, and could larger parties have been ≈øent without great danger of lo≈øing them?</p>
               <p>A. For the ≈øake of gaining intelligence of the approach of the enemy, or to a≈øcertain their numbers, could have been much better attained by ≈ømall parties than by large ones, as any con≈øiderable number of men marching in that woody country, where the ground is covered with mo≈øs, might ea≈øily be di≈øcovered, and of con≈øequence would be expo≈øed to have been cut off by the enemy.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect whether the working parties were increa≈øed on or after the 20th of June?</p>
               <p>A. If I remember right, the detail was taken off, and we were ordered to work by brigades, to turn out in the brigade every officer and man who were off duty and able to work, to throw up lines on Mount Independence, and al≈øo to fell the trees on the ≈øides and at the bottom of the hill. Near twenty acres of trees were felled.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was there any wood on Mount Independence, to have ≈øupplied the garri≈øon in ca≈øe of a ≈øiege, or was there a magazine of wood laid in?</p>
               <p>A. There was no magazine of wood laid in. There was ≈øome ≈øcattering logs upon the top of the hill, and ≈øo much upon the ≈øides, that I believe we ≈øhould not have been put to any difficulty in getting wood, in ca≈øe we had been be≈øieged.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. How long do you ≈øuppo≈øe the wood that was on the Mount would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed firing for the garri≈øon we had?</p>
               <p>A. At that ≈øea≈øon of the year it might have la≈øted us a fortnight.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Could we have ≈øpared men from the works that we were engaged in, to have laid in a further ≈øupply of wood, or had we a number of draught cattle ≈øufficient to have brought it from any di≈øtance?</p>
               <p>A. At that time we had not half men enough to man our works. I never under≈øtood we had many teams, but I do not recollect the number. What few teams we had were employed in tran≈øporting the ≈øtores from Lake George Landing to Lake Champlain.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect, after the enemy landed at Three Mile Point, and before they broke ground, my ordering the men to lie a night or two on their arms?</p>
               <p>A. I do.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you not under≈øtand the rea≈øon of that order was, that tho' I did not think the enemy were in force, yet I thought they might attempt to carry us by a coup-de-main?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was our force in any degree adequate to the defence of the places?</p>
               <p>A. No; I think that the places could not have been maintained unle≈øs with at lea≈øt 10,000 good troops, and we ought to have had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of two hills without the French lines, as al≈øo the one on the other ≈øide of the Lake, known by the name of Mount Defiance.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair produces a paper, and a≈øks General Poor whether the matter therein contained was the order of march and di≈øtribution of batteaus, that was agreed upon at the Council on the 5th of July?‚Äî The paper is as follows:</p>

                           <p>160 from General Poor's brigade, commanded by Lieut. Col. Read and Major Durborn‚Äî150 from General Patter≈øon's, commanded by Col. Francis‚Äî6 Captains, 12 Subalterns, and non-commi≈ø≈øioned in proportion‚Äîto advance as a picket in the front of the French lines.</p>
                           <p>ORDER OF MARCH.</p>
                           <p>General Poor to lead the column with his brigade; General Patter≈øon to follow; Colonel Long; Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Fermoy; Robi≈øon to march with his regiment on the left flank; and Colonel Bellows, with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams's regiment, on the right.</p>

               </q>
               <p>A. I very well remember the orders, and I think it to be the paper.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect a picket to be advanced, con≈øi≈øting of the number of men, and under the officers mentioned in the paper?</p>
               <p>A. I well remember it. I was de≈øired by you, when this picket was paraded, to po≈øt them with the other picket, which I think was 150 men, as near the enemy as I could without bringing on an action, and to give them particular orders in the morning, when I was to call them in, that they were to compo≈øe the rear guard, which I did.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you not under≈øtand that the rea≈øon of ordering out that picket was, to prevent any ≈øurpri≈øe happening to us while the men were employed in carrying the ≈øtores and baggage to the landing place?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; and likewi≈øe to form a chain of centinels from water to water, to prevent any of our men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerting to them, and giving them any information.</p>
               <p>General St Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the burning of General Fermoy's hou≈øe?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; before I called in the pickets on Ticonderoga ≈øide I ≈øaw that hou≈øe in flames, which laid the hill that his brigade was on open to the view of the enemy, as I could ≈øee every movement they were making, ≈øtriking their tents and loading and carrying off their baggage, which induced me to order in the pickets one half an hour ≈øooner than I ≈øhould otherwi≈øe have done, as the principal part of the troops on Ticonderoga ≈øide had cro≈ø≈øed the bridge, in order to embark their baggage on board the boats, the wind being ≈øo high the boats could not be brought over.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were not orders given not to ≈øet fire to any of the buildings?</p>
               <p>A. Yes: You gave me particular orders, as ≈øoon as I had po≈øted the pickets, to communicate your orders with re≈øpect to the evacuation of the place to the commanding officers of regiments in my brigade, and de≈øired,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016141_0026_0F9C7A62A46CC888"/>
as ≈øoon as the baggage was packed up, that every light, both from fire and from candle, might be put out, previous to ≈øtriking the tents and putting the baggage on board the boats. I under≈øtood the rea≈øon was, to prevent the enemy from making any di≈øcovery of our intentions; and had not the wind been ≈øo very high, which ob≈øtructed the moving of the boats, we ≈øhould have been able to have left the place by two o'clock, as was determined on.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was not the confu≈øion of marching off the troops from Mount Independence occa≈øioned by that hou≈øe of General Fermoy's having been ≈øet on fire?</p>
               <p>A. I believe that was the principal occa≈øion of it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. How far did the troops march before that confu≈øion was, in a great mea≈øure, remedied?</p>
               <p>A. I marched in front. I frequently fell back to the rear of my brigade, to examine into their ≈øituation, and before we had marched many miles I got them nearly all together; I can ≈øay nothing with re≈øpect to the others; and the fir≈øt halt we made the brigades were all formed in order, and marched ≈øo during the whole retreat, excepting Colonel Leonard's and Colonel Wells's, two militia regiments, who behaved with the greate≈øt di≈øorder.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect of one or both of the≈øe regiments having broke the line of march?</p>
               <p>A. The day after the evacuation, when we arrived at Otter Creek, we were alarmed by a report that the enemy were ju≈øt in our rear. I, being in front, was ordered to cro≈øs the bridge, and draw the men up upon the mo≈øt advantageous ground I could find. I po≈øted the regiment that Lieut. Colonel Hale commanded at a ford; he left it, and went off. In the evening, on our march, about a mile and a half from that place, I came up where Colonel Hale was with his regiment. The regiment had four oxen killed and ≈økinned. I a≈øked him how he came there without leave? he ≈øaid he came to get ≈øome provi≈øion, to prevent his men from ≈øtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I ordered him to cut up his meat, to be ready to fall into the line of march, which he might be in a few minutes; if not, we ≈øhould march but about a mile and a half, and make a halt. I moved on, and in about ten minutes found his regiment running by my brigade, and he nearly at the head of them. He, with about forty of his men, pa≈ø≈øed the brigade. I rode forward, and halted him till part of one regiment of my bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade had pa≈ø≈øed him; he came up again, and in≈øi≈øted on pa≈ø≈øing, as he would not be left in the rear. I turned out about forty men, and ordered them to fire upon them, unle≈øs they would remain on the ground till the line of march came up, where they were to fall in, which halted them. Both regiments frequently broke the line of march.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect, whether the troops, at the time of the evacuation, were ordered to take five days provi≈øion with them?</p>
               <p>A. They were ordered to take ≈øeveral days provi≈øion with them, which was judged ≈øufficient to have carried them to the North River, had we pur≈øued the route we expected to take.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. During my command at Ticonderoga, did you di≈øcover any thing that had the appearance of cowardice in me, or induced you to think me treacherous, or inattentive to the progre≈øs of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I was once with you where you were in danger, and ≈øundry times when we have expected an immediate attack, and never di≈øcovered the lea≈øt di≈øcompo≈øure of mind, but you always appeared with the greate≈øt bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ≈øteadine≈øs, becoming the character of an officer. From your clo≈øe application to your duty by day, before the enemy made their appearance at Ticonderoga, and your con≈øtant application both by day and night, after they came there, gave me every rea≈øon to imagine you left nothing undone that was in your power to contribute to the ≈øtrength of the garri≈øon; therefore I had not the lea≈øt rea≈øon to induce me to think you either treacherous or neglectful of your duty, I remember your ob≈øerving to me, if I evacuate the place, my character will be ruined; if I remain here, the army will be lo≈øt; but I am determined to evacuate it, altho' it will give ≈øuch an alarm that has not happened in the country ≈øince the war commenced.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. At what time did this conver≈øation happen. Was it previous to the re≈øolution that was entered into by the Council of War, or po≈øterior to it?</p>
               <p>A. It was after it. You gave your rea≈øons for it, and ≈øaid that it was to throw this body of troops between the country and Burgoyne, that the militia might have a body to collect to; which, if this body was cut off, they would have none, and of cour≈øe Burgoyne would pur≈øue his operations without any ob≈øtacle, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were you with me at Trenton or Princeton, and what was my conduct at tho≈øe places with re≈øpect to courage?</p>
               <p>A. I was with you at both places. We were not brought to clo≈øe action at either place, but you behaved with the greate≈øt ≈øpirit, and with as much coolne≈øs as at any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. At what time did General St. Clair receive the fir≈øt compleat intelligence of the ≈øtrength and de≈øigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect any that was obtained before the pri≈øoner was taken; he was the fir≈øt per≈øon that gave us intelligence who commanded the enemy's army, of their ≈øtrength and de≈øigns, and that not until the next day after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Was there any other intelligence received, between the time of the pri≈øoners being taken and the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. There was a report in camp, that ≈øome of the inhabitants ≈øaid they were clearing a road through the wood to get into our rear. The Jagers al≈øo mentioned that they were clearing a road.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Do you know whether it was a prevailing opinion, that nothing ≈øerious would be attempted again≈øt Ticonderoga that campaign, and whether it was not expected that the enemy's troops would have been ≈øent round from Quebec to the ≈øouthern army?</p>
               <p>A. A little before General St. Clair arrived at Ticonderoga the enemy made a movement up the Lake, with a number of boats and one or two ve≈ø≈øels, tarried a few days, and returned. I acquainted General Gates of it, and further acquainted him that I was informed they were making preparations at St. John's to proceed with their whole army. He wrote me, that he had the ≈øtronge≈øt a≈ø≈øurances from Congre≈øs that the King's
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016141_0027_0F9C7A5D6638E1B0"/>
troops were all ordered round to New-York, leaving only a ≈øufficient number to garri≈øon their forts, and de≈øire≈øt me to be getting every thing in readine≈øs, that if the enemy went out of one door, we mu≈øt enter the other. He farther mentioned in his letter, that we might daily expect alarms, as they commanded the Lake, and might come up with their ≈øhipping, and that the intelligence he had by a ≈øpy that came from Canada corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ≈øentiment of Congre≈øs.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What orders had the commanding officer of the rear guard, and did he obey the orders he received?</p>
               <p>A. He was ordered upon his coming in to ≈øweep every thing off the ground upon Ticonderoga ≈øide, to bring every man and bea≈øt, which I under≈øtood he effected, and then to fall in the rear of General Fermoy's brigade, as a rear guard to the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What orders did the officer of the rear guard receive at Hubbarton?</p>
               <p>A. The fir≈øt halt that was propo≈øed to be made was at Lacey's camp, which was the fir≈øt cleared land we came to after we left Mount Independence. When I got within about a mile of the place, I met an inhabitant, who informed me there was a large number of the enemy and Indians at Hubbarton, which was two miles farther, which induced me to continue the march until I arrived at Burnam's, in Hubbarton, where it was ≈øaid the enemy were. Upon our arrival we were told that about 500 of the enemy had been there, and had gone to Ca≈øtle-Town. There I marked out the ground for each brigade, po≈øted officers to fall in with his brigade and regiment as they came up. We had then made a march of about twenty miles, which had fatigued many of our feeble men; ≈øo that the officer commanding of the rear guard thought proper to halt at the place fir≈øt propo≈øed, Lacey's camp, two miles in our rear. General St. Clair ≈øent ≈øeveral times to order the rear guard up; the la≈øt me≈ø≈øenger came and ≈øaid they were on their way up. As we tarried there about three or four hours, General St. Clair ≈øaid he would march to Ca≈øtle-Town with his army, and would leave Colonel Hale's and Warner's regiments to cover his retreat, with orders for them to move on moderately. Some time in the evening I heard the General expre≈øs a good deal of unea≈øine≈øs and concern that Colonel Francis did not come up with the rear. Towards morning he ≈øent one of his Aids up to order them down immediately; and, if I mi≈øtake not, ≈øent a ≈øecond time. They did not join the army, but remained until they were attacked by the enemy the next morning.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know whether the rear guard had orders to move on to Ca≈øtle-Town that night?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øay po≈øitively that they had, but I under≈øtood they had.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect my having ≈øent orders to Colonel Pellows and Colonel Halcott's militia regiments, who were halted two miles from Hubbarton, to march up and ≈øupport them upon being attacked?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was that order obeyed?</p>
               <p>A. It was not. The regiments came directly to us at Ca≈øtle-Town.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair produces a map of Ticonderoga, Mount Independence and the adjacent country, with references, which Colonel Ko≈øeiu≈øzko, on his oath, ≈øays is a true one, to the be≈øt of his knowledge and judgment, except as to the di≈øtances, it not having been made from actual ≈øurvey, but taken from view.</p>

               <p>THE Court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Captain Woolcott being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect the orders that were given to Colonel Warner at Hubbarton?</p>
               <p>A. I was in front when we arrived at Hubbarton, laid down, and got a ≈øleep. When I waked, I found the party were nearly all gone. I a≈øked Captain Smith where they were gone to, who ≈øaid to Ca≈øtle-Town; and having a≈øked him whether we were to march, he ≈øaid it was General St. Clair's orders, delivered by General Patter≈øon, that we were to march to Ca≈øtle-Town. I went into the hou≈øe where Col. Warner, Col. Francis and Col. Hale were, and having a≈øked Col. Warner whether he determined to march any farther, he ≈øaid he did not that night; tho' there were orders to march to Ca≈øtle-Town, he did not intend to go on any farther, becau≈øe the men were much fatigued.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What time did the rear guard arrive at Hubbarton?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What time did they leave it the next morning?</p>
               <p>A. They commenced their march about eight o'clock, but before the whole got in motion they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Colonel Warner the commanding officer of the rear guard at the time?</p>
               <p>A. He was.</p>
               <p>Colonel Baldwin, being ≈øworn, ≈øays, On the 5th of July, 1777, about nine o'clock in the evening, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral St. Clair ≈øent for me, and told me that he had determined to abandon the place that night; he would have me with the artificers, get all the intrenching tools, and the carpenters and ≈ømiths tools on board of batteaus that were a≈ø≈øigned me for that purpo≈øe, and be ready by two o'clock in the morning to leave the place. I left him and went to my men, got every thing on board belonging to my department agreeable to order, on Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016141_0028_0F9C7A6365E76650"/>
≈øide, by twelve o'clock. I then went to the ≈øtone redoubt, and a≈øked Captain Win≈ølow if he wanted any a≈ø≈øi≈øtance? He told me that every thing was out of the magazine and on board the boats, there was nothing left but his tents, that were to be carried. I then went to Head-Quarters, and was informed that General St. Clair was gone over to the Mount. I rode over, and met him near the fort, told him what I had done, and a≈øked him if he had any further orders? He ≈øaid that the people were all a≈øleep on this ≈øide, wi≈øhed that I would go and wake General Fermoy. I went, called him up, and returned. General St. Clair then de≈øired I would go, and ≈øee to get the ≈øtores away from the magazine that was not then open. I ≈øoon got a large party of men, went to the magazine, and rolled the barrels from it to the landing (I believe about 100 large barrels of powder.) I then went to the landing, where I found the men in great confu≈øion, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about boats. The wind was high, and it was bad loading them; the men very cro≈øs, and hard to be prevailed with to do their duty. About ≈øun-ri≈øe the army was pa≈øt and the boats put off. There remained only a few barrels of powder and rum, with a ≈ømall matter of baggage on ≈øhore, and there were only two batteaus that lay at a little di≈øtance. I promi≈øed Captain Nicholls, that if he could get the≈øe boats with his carpenters, and carry off what remained at the landing, I would give him a barrel of the rum when he got to Skeen≈øborough; he immediately brought them in, got all on board (except about eight old tents that were not worth carrying, and a howitzer that we run into the Lake and left, with ≈øome carriages for cannon and General St. Clair's waggon) ju≈øt as the enemy came into the works on the hill and fired upon us. The boats pu≈øhed off, and I rode away with Captain Buckland. We ≈øaw none of our people (except General St. Clair's waggoner with his hor≈øes; Captain Buckland rode one of them, and we brought off the other) until we came to the la≈øt hou≈øe; there we found four ≈øoldiers partly drunk. We made them run until we ≈øoon came up with others that were too heavy loaded, and who had ≈øtopped to throw away a part. We endeavoured to bring all up with us, until we came to Colonel Francis, which was about two miles, as near as I can gue≈øs. He had then fell ≈øome ≈ømall di≈øtance in the rear, by rea≈øon of people ≈øtopping to lighten their packs. I marched ≈øome time with him, but he found the front marched too fa≈øt for him. He de≈øired I would ride forward to the General, and de≈øire him to make a ≈ømall halt till he could come up, which was done. We marched to Hubbarton, where the front halted two or three hours. We were informed that a large body of the enemy was ju≈øt gone from the place where we halted as the front came up, and were gone towards Ca≈øtle-Town. After the army had refre≈øhed them≈øelves the General ordered Colonel Warner, with ≈øome others, to wait until Colonel Francis came up with the rear guard, and then march on with them; and then General St. Clair marched with the army to Ca≈øtle-Town, and took twenty-≈øix pri≈øoners on the way‚Äîthere halted for that night, the men very much fatigued. On the morning of the ≈øeventh the rear, with Colonel Warner and Colonel Francis, was attacked at Hubbarton; we heard the guns. General St. Clair immediately ≈øent one of his Aids to order Colonel Bellows, with two militia regiments (that lay two miles on the road towards the rear) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce Colonel Francis, and cover his retreat if it was nece≈ø≈øary; but tho≈øe regiments ≈øoon came down to us, and I heard the Aid ≈øay that he could not by any means prevail with the men to obey the order, and Colonel Bellows did all in his power to get the men to go with him to meet the enemy. The General this morning heard our boats were cut off at Skeen≈øborough, which cau≈øed him to alter his route, and go by the way of Rutland.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect whether the working parties at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were increa≈øed or decrea≈øed on or about the 23d day of June, 1777?</p>
               <p>A. They were con≈øiderably increa≈øed. There were ≈øeveral works that were not fini≈øhed that were ordered to be done, be≈øides a number of new ones laid out that the men were ordered to work upon, and we continued at the≈øe works both at Mount Independence and Ticonderoga until the day we came away, be≈øides a con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reinforcement to the party at work upon the bridge. As the troops increa≈øed the working parties increa≈øed, we having almo≈øt every man upon the ground on duty of one kind or another. There was a regiment of militia con≈øtantly on duty in the woods, under my direction, providing timber for the bridge, that was not included in the details. I had about 100 men, be≈øides the militia on duty with me there, that were not included in the details. I had about 30 out of the militia al≈øo making ≈øhingles, and a party making brick, not included in the details.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was the boom that was laid below the bridge in the Lake fixed in ≈øuch a manner, that it would have been able to have re≈øi≈øted the ≈øhock of a ve≈ø≈øel?</p>
               <p>A. The anchors were chiefly lo≈øt from it, the cables having been broken by the ice. I rather think it would not have ≈øtopped their heavy ve≈ø≈øels, though it might their ≈ømaller ones.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you receive directions for building a general ho≈øpital at Ticonderoga, and were you not employed on that work?</p>
               <p>A. I did, from General Schuyler. I was at work on it about the 23d of June, and the greater part of the fatigue-men were then taken from that work to be put on other works. Some of the artificers were taken off, though the greater part of them continued at work on it.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What di≈øtance is the la≈øt hou≈øe you have mentioned from Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not more than a quarter of a mile from the landing upon the ≈øouth ≈øide of the Mount.</p>
               <p>Captain Win≈ølow being ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What part of the artillery, and at what po≈øt, did you command at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga?</p>
               <p>A. I commanded in a ≈øtone redoubt, where there were thirteen pieces of artillery.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were the artillery and ≈øtores that were in that redoubt removed at the time of the evacuation.?</p>
               <p>A. The ≈øtores were all removed, and ≈øix of the pieces of artillery. I loaded the cannon in a flat bottomed boat that was given me to load them in, and was ordered, I think by General Poor, afterwards to take them out to put the baggage in. There were al≈øo 40 barrels of powder there, which, with the ≈øtores, I loaded my≈øelf in the boats to go to Skeen≈øborough, after I had got tho≈øe articles down. I was then ordered by General St. Clair, as I was coming up from the boats, to ≈øpike up the remainder of the cannon, to go to the old fort to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in removing the ≈øtores from thence.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were the ≈øtores generally removed from the old fort?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:016141_0029_0F9C7A64242138C8"/>A. Every thing of any con≈øequence was. They were all carried down to the boats at lea≈øt, if they were not put on board.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were the cannon all ≈øpiked that were left?</p>
               <p>A. I ≈øpiked all that I had the care of, and ≈øome more that were at the ≈øhore that were brought from the French lines, that could not be embarked.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were you Payma≈øter to the troops at Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was the military che≈øt ≈øaved?</p>
               <p>A. It was. I ≈øent it away the morning of the evacuation, about three o'clock, with four of my men. You ordered me to ≈øend it away ≈øooner, but I could not get a boat to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the ≈øtores that were ≈øent from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, at the time of the evacuation, fall into the hands of the enemy afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. They did, after they arrived at Skeen≈øborough; though there might have been ≈øome boats that fell into their hands before they got up to Skeen≈øborough.</p>
               <p>Q. To Colonel Hay. Did the ≈øtores that were ≈øent from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, at the time of the evacuation, fall into the hands of the enemy afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. They did at Skeen≈øborough, after an engagement between the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels and ours.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Col. Hay. Was not a great part of them de≈øtroyed by fire by our people?</p>
               <p>A. One of the ve≈ø≈øels was blown up.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Col. Hay. Do you recollect the number of batteaus that were at Ticonderoga, fit for ≈øervice?</p>
               <p>A. Not po≈øitively, but I imagine they were about 70</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Col. Hay. Was the boom below the bridge ≈øo ≈øecured, that it could re≈øi≈øt the ≈øhock of a ve≈ø≈øel?</p>
               <p>A. It was ≈øecured with several anchors and cables. It would have ≈øtopped a ve≈ø≈øel's way, ≈øo far as to have expo≈øed her to the fire from on both ≈øides, and made it difficult for her to get back again; but if a ve≈ø≈øel came again≈øt it with a full wind, I never thought it would have re≈øi≈øted her.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Col. Hay. Was the wind fair the night of the evacuation for ve≈ø≈øels to come up again≈øt it?</p>
               <p>A. It was, and blowed very hard.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion to Col. Hay. If the enemy had attempted it that night, was it not probable they would have broke through every ob≈øtruction?</p>
               <p>A. I am of opinion they would have carried away our boom and broke our floating bridge, but mu≈øt probably, by that means, have been thrown athwart ≈øome of the caffoons, and thereby expo≈øed to the fire of our batteries on both ≈øides, until the cannon were removed or ≈øpiked up.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Stevens being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you command the artillery at Ticonderoga at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect what orders were given to you at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. About ≈øeven o'clock in the evening of the 5th of July was the fir≈øt of my hearing of the intended evacuation. You waited on me at my quarters (as I was unwell) and informed me that the retreat was to take place that night. On the information, I told you I had rea≈øon to cur≈øe the day I ever put my feet into the country, there being ≈øo much retreating. Yoy ≈øaid that you had the greate≈øt rea≈øon to cur≈øe the day, and intimated that more blame would fall on you than on me for lo≈øing the artillery. You then advi≈øed with me what artillery to bring off, and was anxious for bringing the whole off, and offered me what a≈ø≈øi≈øtance I wanted. I told you it was impo≈ø≈øible to bring the whole off, on account of the deficiency of boats; and 500 men were turned out to my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. You had agreed to move all the pieces except the eighteen pounders, and tho≈øe above them, which I got to the landing, but the ≈øcarcity of boats was the occa≈øion of my leaving ≈øome of them there. I did make out to get a number of them to Skeen≈øborough, but they were lo≈øt there. I ≈øhould have got the whole there, had not the boats been taken up by General Poor for the men's baggage, into which the pieces were to go. The boats with the ammunition and powder had reached almo≈øt to Skeen≈øborough before the enemy came up with them. One of them we ≈øet fire to, with fifteen tons of powder, which blew up; the re≈øt fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Were not orders given to ≈øpike up all the cannon tha could not be removed?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was that done?</p>
               <p>A. It was. You advi≈øed with me about knocking the trunnions off, but being fearful it would make too much noi≈øe and alarm the enemy, as they were ≈øo near, it was omitted.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was there any artillery ordered to be fired that night, to amu≈øe the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. There were two eighteen pounders in the Jer≈øey battery fired every ≈øeven minutes at their ≈øhipping, and at a battery that the enemy were rai≈øing oppo≈øite to the Jer≈øey battery, which continued till near ≈øun-ri≈øe the next morning, to amu≈øe them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. At the time the enemy moved up with their gun boats, as if they meant to attack the Jer≈øey battery, do you recollect what pa≈ø≈øed at the time between you and me?</p>
               <p>A. You ≈øeemed to be angry at me for firing without your po≈øitive orders, and ≈øaid you would rather give fifty pounds than I ≈øhould have fired.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect my explaining to you the rea≈øon of my ≈øaying ≈øo?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect your explaining to me the rea≈øon. You expre≈ø≈øed in your di≈øcour≈øe to me, that you wi≈øhed they would come nearer, that we might have a fairer chance to ≈øink them; and I judged that it was on account of your thinking they were not near enough.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you receive any orders for di≈ømounting and moving the cannon at Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I did about the latter end of June, or beginning of July, from General Schuyler, and moved all the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016141_0030_0F9C7A64E4998D78"/>
cannon above a twelve pounder, except the two eighteen pounders which were left at the Jer≈øey battery, to Mount Independence, and laid them on ≈økids, with their vents down, which induced the ≈øoldiers to think that a retreat was intended from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence. I moved al≈øo the ammunition by your orders, except about one hundred rounds, to Mount Independence.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was all the fixed ammunition removed at the time of the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. I have the greate≈øt rea≈øon to think that all was brought off.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was there any annoyance given by the artillery to the enemy in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the place?</p>
               <p>A. They were fired upon from the French lines, and from every quarter where they made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by heavy artillery, from the fir≈øt of their approach to the evacuation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyer being ≈øworn, General St. Clair's que≈øtion. In what ≈øtation did you act at Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. As an A≈ø≈øi≈øtant Commi≈ø≈øary of Provi≈øion.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. When I called on you on the 5th of July for a return of provi≈øion, what quantity did you report to me to be on hand?</p>
               <p>A. I imagine there were two thou≈øand barrels of flour, and eight hundred barrels of beef and pork, the greater part was pork, and it was about that quantity I reported to you there was.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you recollect what quantity of provi≈øion was i≈ø≈øued as a ration at Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I think, but am not po≈øitive, there was i≈ø≈øued for a ration, one pound of bread, one pound of beef, or three quarters of a pound of pork in lieu of beef. That was all they daily drew. The other parts of a ration I do not remember.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was there any allowance made to the men for the ≈ømall articles you could not furni≈øh them with?</p>
               <p>A. They had briefs given them for them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. How long were you A≈ø≈øi≈øtant Commi≈ø≈øary at that place?</p>
               <p>A. About ≈øix weeks.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Had you received any directions from any of the principals in the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what quantity of provi≈øion to i≈ø≈øue as a daily ration?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember that I had.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you not i≈ø≈øue the ≈øame ration that had been i≈ø≈øued before you came into office?</p>
               <p>A. I i≈ø≈øued the ≈øame quantity that had been i≈ø≈øued before I came into the office.</p>

                     <p>THIS may certify, that the detachment of Colonel Michael Jack≈øon's regiment, which was under my command at Ticonderoga at the time of its evacuation, was very poorly cloathed, many of their arms out of repair, and about one third of them de≈øtitute of bayonets.</p>

                     <p>I INFORMED you ye≈øterday that an encampment of the enemy had been di≈øcovered at Gilliland's Creek. I a≈øt night two of their ve≈ø≈øels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are ≈øeven lying at that place; the re≈øt of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns di≈øtinctly at different places. They have al≈øo debarked ≈øome troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether

they have landed at Crown Point my ≈øcout-boat did not di≈øcover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpo≈øe, on account of their ≈øhipping; but I have ≈øent a party on this ≈øide the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a ju≈øt account of their ≈øituation.</p>
                     <p>I cannot help repeating to you the di≈øagreeable ≈øituation we are in, nor can I ≈øee the lea≈øt pro≈øpect of our being able to defend the po≈øts, unle≈øs the militia come in; and ≈øhould the enemy protract their operations, or inve≈øt us, and content them≈øelves with a ≈øimple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. I have thoughts of calling for the Berk≈øhire militia, which are neare≈øt to us, and will probably be the mo≈øt alert to come to our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, becau≈øe they are in ≈øome mea≈øure covered by this po≈øt; but on that I ≈øhall con≈øult the other General Officers. This, however, is clear to me, that we ≈øhall be obliged to abandon this ≈øide, and then they will ≈øoon force the other from us; nor do I ≈øee that a retreat will in any ≈øhape be practicable. Every thing, however, ≈øhall be done, that is po≈ø≈øible, to fru≈øtrate the de≈øigns of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred.

                     </opener>
                     <p>THIS moment I have received information from Hoite, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, ≈øuppo≈øed to be five hundred, and are de≈øigned to cut off the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Skeen≈øborough. They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them to about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before ye≈øterday, and killed and dre≈ø≈øed the cattle; and it is ≈øuppo≈øed that to-night they will be at the new road near Ca≈øtle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeen≈øborough. They reported that a very large party were gone on the we≈øt ≈øide of the Lake, to fall on Fort George. That is ≈øaid to con≈øi≈øt of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</p>
                     <p>We have al≈øo had ju≈øt now another attack at the mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The ≈øcene thickens fa≈øt, and Sunday next, it ≈øeems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We mu≈øt make the be≈øt we can of it, and I hope at lea≈øt to cripple them ≈øo as they may not be able to pur≈øue their fortune, ≈øhould it declare in their favour.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øent a party down la≈øt night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me ≈øome unea≈øine≈øs. I hope, however, they are ≈øafe, and will bring me ≈øome intelligence of con≈øequence. I have ≈øome thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the wor≈øt, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many ≈øtill left, to become pri≈øoners.</p>
                     <p>I have ≈øent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to de≈øire that all they can po≈ø≈øibly ≈øpare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</p>

               <p>Major General Schuyler being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. What troops had you e≈øtimated for the defence of the garri≈øons of Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga and Mount Independence?</p>
               <p>A. Ten thou≈øand continental troops. I do not know that I mentioned in my letter to General Wa≈øhington and to Congre≈øs that they ≈øhould be continental troops, but I intended them to have been continental troops.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you think the po≈øts tenable with the force I had?</p>
               <p>In an≈øwer to this que≈øtion, General Schuyler produces an extract from a copy of a letter to Congre≈øs, dated the 8th of June. 1777, which he ≈øays was ≈øent by expre≈øs to Congre≈øs, and was received by them about the 13th of June, but he did not receive any an≈øwer to the letter till late in July.

                        </opener>
                        <p>I DO my≈øelf the honour to advi≈øe you that I arrived here on Tue≈øday, the 3d in≈øtant, and found an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</p>
                        <p>I inclo≈øe you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As ≈øoon as I procure tho≈øe from the other po≈øts, I ≈øhall make out a general return, and do my≈øelf the honour to tran≈ømit copies to you and his Excellency General Wa≈øhington.</p>
                        <p>You will perceive, by the return of the Commi≈ø≈øary of Provi≈øion, which I al≈øo inclo≈øe, that only 337 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of provi≈øion, of the meat kind, have been forwarded to Ticonderoga ≈øince the 26th of March, and no fre≈øh beef; ≈øo that the ≈øtock of ≈øalted provi≈øion ≈øince that time is con≈øiderably dimini≈øhed, nor is there any con≈øiderable quantity provided in the country. I have, therefore, directed the Commi≈ø≈øary to forward an immediate ≈øupply of fre≈øh beef, that as much of the ≈øalted beef and pork may be ≈øaved as po≈ø≈øible, in order to have a ≈øtock on hand, in ca≈øe the enemy ≈øhould be able ≈øo to interrupt the communication, as to prevent cattle being ≈øent on.</p>
                        <p>Inclo≈øe you copy of the in≈øtructions I have given General St. Clair: I have directed that Mount Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ≈øhould be the primary object, of attention.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> Becau≈øe, if the lines on the we≈øt ≈øide ≈øhould be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force de≈øtined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, which it cannot; for the ≈øeveral po≈øts on the Mohawk river, and tho≈øe on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at lea≈øt 2000 men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this ≈øide of the Lake.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Second.</hi> Becau≈øe I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army ≈øhould occupy a po≈øt, which, if the enemy ≈øhould be able ≈øo to inve≈øt, as to cut off the communication with the country on this ≈øide, we might po≈ø≈øibly experience a di≈øa≈øter ≈øimilar to that at Fort Wa≈øhington.</p>

                           <hi>Third.</hi> I am fully convinced that between 2 and 3000 men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and ≈øecure the pa≈øs.</p>

                           <hi>Fourth.</hi> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is po≈ø≈øible that a want of provi≈øion might oblige us to abandon that important po≈øt.</p>

                           <hi>Fifth.</hi> If the enemy ≈øhould attempt to draw their boats over land into Lake George from beyond the Three Mile Point, our naval ≈øtrength on Lake George will prevent their progre≈øs: If it did not, we ≈øhall have a body of troops to oppo≈øe them with.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixth.</hi> Becau≈øe, if Mount Independence ≈øhould be inve≈øted, the militia will readily join when they have an army to join, and the ≈øeige may be rai≈øed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seventh.</hi> Becau≈øe, if they ≈øhould attempt to march a body of troops from Crown Point, leaving Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga on their left (by the road la≈øt year cut by the tories who joined General Carlton) to interrupt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, there will be a force to meet them, and to prevent the evil con≈øequences of ≈øuch a manoeuvre of their's.</p>

                           <hi>Eighth.</hi> Becau≈øe, if a ≈øudden irruption ≈øhould be made on the Mohawk River, or from New-York by Hud≈øon's River, a force will be at hand to face them. Be≈øides the≈øe con≈øiderations, there are oeconomical ones al≈øo to induce me to this di≈øpo≈øition of the army, if it can be done without injury, which I am fully of opinion it may, and will certainly be ≈øo, if General Carlton ≈øent part of the troops, from Canada to New-York or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               <p>General Schuyler ≈øays further, in an≈øwer to the que≈øtion, that when he mentioned in the letter to Congre≈øs that between two and three thou≈øand men were ≈øufficient to have maintained Mount Independence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did you ever give me any orders for evacuating the≈øe garri≈øons?</p>
               <p>A. No. The rea≈øon why I did not give you any orders for evacuating the≈øe garri≈øons was, becau≈øe I had wrote this letter to Congre≈øs, and they did not give me any orders about it; and as the continent conceived them of great importance, and very ≈øtrong, I did not think my≈øelf at liberty to give any orders for an evacuation of them.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Was the defective ≈øtate in which you found the works at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence owing to any negligence in me, or di≈øregard to the orders I received from you?</p>
               <p>A. It could not be owing to any negligence in you, or di≈øregard to the orders you received from me, as you had arrived there but a few days before; not was it owing to the negligence of any officer who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there in the winter or ≈øpring before; nor to the commanding officer of the artiliery or the engineer. I conceive it to be owing to a want of men and a want of materials.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know of any ≈øteps taken by the ea≈øtern ≈øtates to reinforce the≈øe po≈øts, after their inve≈øtiture?</p>
               <p>A. Immediately on my return from Ticonderoga, I wrote to the ea≈øtern ≈øtates to ha≈øten on the remainder of the continental troops. Some troops came up in con≈øequence of my application, but did not reach Albany till ≈øome time after the evacuation of Ticonderoga. Upon receiving the fir≈øt letter from you after I returned from Ticonderoga, I applied to the ea≈øtern ≈øtates, and to this, for reinforcements of militia. The militia from the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts arrived at Fort-Edward, I believe, between the 4th and 7th of July. A few from Connecticut did not join us until towards the latter end of July. Tho≈øe from this ≈øtate got up much about the ≈øame time that the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts did. The Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts militia were up as ≈øoon at Fort-Edward, and tho≈øe from this ≈øtate, as I could rea≈øonably expect them to be. Connecticut, as I was informed by Governor Trumbull, had a call for the militia from General Wa≈øhington, to go to the Highland, or Peeks-Kill. That was the rea≈øon that their militia did not join us ≈øooner.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did the force you had collected, ≈øuppo≈øing the garri≈øons to have held out, put you in a ≈øituation to have rai≈øed the ≈øiege?</p>
               <p>A. I believe that, with all the troops you brought with you, with the reinforcement with General Nixon, and including all the militia, I had not at Fort-Edward, about the 20th of July, more than five thou≈øand men. If the garri≈øon had remained, I ≈øhould have had no more than three thou≈øand militia, before I was joined by General Nixon, to have marched to its relief, which number I conceive very inadequate to have rai≈øed the ≈øiege. General Nixon, I believe, arrived about the 12th or 13th of July; but if I had had a force which I might think was ≈øufficient, yet I ≈øhould not have been able to have rai≈øed the ≈øiege for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion, there being ≈øcarcely any provi≈øion of the meat kind in the department; flour was plenty. Nor was there any ≈øtock of provi≈øion of the meat kind laid in, not even a ≈øufficiency of ≈øalted meat to have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed the ≈øcouts with. We had not lead in the department ≈øufficient for an army any thing like to have rai≈øed the ≈øiege with. At Fort-Edward, on the 7th of July, we were obliged to ≈øtrip the men that were there of every cartridge they had, to ≈øend them to Fort-Ann, and were left without any lead for ≈øome days, excepting a mere trifle I got from Albany, a very ≈ømall quantity brought up by the militia, and by ≈øtripping the windows.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know the u≈øual weight of a barrel of beef or pork in that country?</p>
               <p>A. Barrels of beef or pork ≈øhould weigh, when they are well packed, about 200 weight; but I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complained that the barrels of beef or pork of the Commi≈ø≈øary's were not in well packed as they ought to be, owing to their making u≈øe of ≈øoldiers and others, whom I ≈øuppo≈øed did not under≈øtand the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs ≈øo well, ≈øo that the barrels were but ≈ølighty packed. I have ≈øeen ≈øome that I ≈øuppo≈øe a quarter of meat might have been put in more, others that the deficiency was le≈øs. I ≈øhould imagine, if the re≈øt of the barrels were the ≈øame as tho≈øe I in≈øpected into, they would not have averaged more than 170 pounds each.</p>
               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Did I not, when it was determined in the Council of Officers that was held the 20th of June, 1777, re≈øpecting the holding Mount Independence and evacuating Ticonderoga, expre≈øs my opinion that it would be impo≈ø≈øible to hold that po≈øt, when the other ≈øide of the Lake ≈øhould be abandoned?</p>
               <p>A. I remember perfectly well you did.</p>

               <p>General St. Clair's que≈øtion. Do you know any in≈øtance of cowardice, treachery, or inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, that I was guilty of during my command at Ticonderoga?</p>

               <p>Major Dunn, Aid de Camp to General St. Clair, being ≈øworn, ≈øays:</p>
               <p>I arrived at Ticonderoga about the 18th of June, 1777. A day or two after my arrival I went round the lines on Ticonderoga, and found them much in the ≈øame ≈øituation as they were in November, 1776, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the redoubts on the low ground, which were evacuated, and a chain of new ones erected on the height between the old ≈øort and the right of the French lines. The≈øe were nearly compleated. In ≈øome cannon were mounted, and a party of fatigue at work on the re≈øt. On Mount Independence I found a party of about 100 men, under the direction of Colonel Ko≈øeiu≈øzko, erecting three redoubts in the rear of the Mount, and forming an abbatis, the old one having taken fire ≈øome time before, and was chiefly de≈øtroyed. One other party of about 150 men, under Colonel Baldwin, ≈øinking a number of piers in the pa≈ø≈øage between the two po≈øts. One other fatigue party, employed daily in bringing ≈øtores and provi≈øion from Lake George Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Be≈øides the≈øe, Colonel Hay, the Quarter-Ma≈øter General, had a party of Negroes, taken from the different regiments, as a con≈øtant fatigue, independent of the daily detail. There were two regiments of militia cutting logs for the piers then ≈øinking, the≈øe were likewi≈øe independent of the daily detail, and exempt from all other garri≈øon duty. All the≈øe parties of fatigue were continued as above, with very little alteration, till the evacuation took place. Being the only Aid de Camp belonging to General St Clair's family, mo≈øt of the orders delivered were through me, and therefore I had the greate≈øt opportunities of ≈øeeing all parties that were ≈øent out; and after my arrival, I do not remember a day that parties were not ≈øent out on the ea≈øt or we≈øt, and frequently on both ≈øides of the Lake Champlain, to reconnoitre the Lake and woods. Tho≈øe parties con≈øi≈øted from 15 to 50 men. I do not recollect exactly the time the enemy fir≈øt made their appearance on the Lake, but remember perfectly, after their appearing with their fleet at Split-Rock, that no party could be per≈øwaded (becau≈øe of the ≈øavages) to approach near enough to di≈øcover any thing of con≈øequence. They frequently fell in with the enemy's parties, but were always obliged to retire. In this ≈øtate we remained till the enemy landed on Three Mile Point, I think on the 30th of June; and on this occa≈øion I heard the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral complain that his garri≈øon was not in force to ri≈øque a party large enough to do them any damage. This occa≈øioned the parties being reduced; ≈øometimes not more than one officer, and two or three men, was thought the mo≈øt eligible mode to di≈øcover the movements of the enemy. A look-out boat was al≈øo ≈øtationed between the enemy's fleet and the Jer≈øey redoubt, to apprize the garri≈øon of any movement in the fleet. On the enemy's landing at the point, the General ordered all the provi≈øion and ≈øtores at Lake George Landing immediately removed into the lines; the batteaus and boats to be in readine≈øs to move to Fort George on the ≈øhorte≈øt notice. The enemy, advancing towards the lines, on the fir≈øt or ≈øecond day of July took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the heights between the landing and the old French lines. The boats were ordered to move to Fort George, and the troops po≈øted at the landing and ≈øaw-mills ordered into the garri≈øon, which was effected without any lo≈øs. The communication between the garri≈øon and Lake George was now effectually cut off, the enemy being in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the heights in our front. Their light parties made frequent attacks on our picket, which con≈øi≈øted of fifty men, po≈øted ≈øome di≈øtance in front of the lines. On tho≈øe occa≈øions, and every other alarm that came to my knowledge (and I believe none e≈øcaped me) the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral always appeared at the lines, going from right to left encouraging the troops, putting them in mind of the cau≈øe they were engaged in, telling them to keep them≈øelves cool, and not to throw away their fire if the enemy ≈øhould approach; that he wi≈øhed for nothing more than a ≈øerious attack, and did not doubt but we ≈øhould repul≈øe them if they did attack. Such was the General's per≈øonal attention to the po≈øts, and the movements of the enemy, after they landed at Three Mile Point, that I do not believe he ≈ølept one hour in four and twenty, on an average, till the evacuation took place. As to the quantity of provi≈øion I can ≈øay but little; but I recollect, ≈øoon after my arrival. General Schuyler's expre≈ø≈øing great ≈øurprize that no magazines were formed at Albany, or any other place nearer than that, for the ≈øupply of the garri≈øon. He ≈øent Mr. Yancey immediately to the country, and pre≈ø≈øed him in the ≈øtronge≈øt terms to ≈øpare no pains in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining provi≈øion for the po≈øt; that if the enemy ≈øhould come on, we ≈øhould be reduced by famine; adding, at the ≈øame time, that the neglect of the Commi≈ø≈øaries had been ≈øuch, that he believed it would be ≈øerving the public to hang at lea≈øt one of the department.‚ÄîThe following are the particulars I recollect re≈øpecting the retreat. About eight o'clock in the evening, July 5. I ≈øaw the ammunition and cannon removing on board the ve≈ø≈øels and to Mount Independence. I was at this time ignorant of the retreat. About nine o'clock the ≈øame evening General St. Clair ≈øent me with orders to General Fermoy, that he ≈øhould direct all the ≈øtores, ammunition, cannon, baggage, &amp;c. to be taken to the foot of the hill on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the Mount, where they were to be put on board batteaus for Skeen≈øborough. I returned, after delivering the order, to Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, and was ≈øent by the General with orders to the Officer in the Jer≈øey redoubt, to continue firing his cannon every half hour towards the battery the enemy were erecting oppo≈øite to the redoubt till further orders. About twelve o'clock the ≈øame evening I was again ≈øent to Mount Independence. I found General Fermoy near his hou≈øe, with his own baggage. I went to the landing, where I found Colonel Hay directing the loading the boats, with between three and four hundred men carrying down the ≈øtores, &amp;c. but, for want of proper orders and attention from General Fermoy, every thing appeared in the greate≈øt confu≈øion. About this time they began to ≈øtrike their tents on Mount Independence, all of which, I believe, were put on board the boats. At two o'clock General St. Clair left Ticonderoga, all the ≈øtores, ammunition, artillery and camp equipage from that ≈øide being removed, except the heavy cannon, which, from our ≈ømall number of men and want of draught cattle, could not then be removed. All the tents and ho≈øpital ≈øtores, mo≈øt of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016141_0035_0F9C7A7625004E28"/>
and light cannon, were al≈øo removed from Mount Independence. Some provi≈øion, I cannot ≈øay what quantity, and mo≈øt of the heavy cannon, were left; all the batteaus and boats were however loaded. About three o'clock in the morning the troops were put in motion for the evacuation, but General Fermoy having ≈øet fire to his hou≈øe (contrary to po≈øitive orders) which lighted the whole Mount, and gave the enemy an opportunity of ≈øeeing every movement we made, it damped the ≈øpirits of our own troops; the militia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments pu≈øhed out of the Mount in di≈øorder, and were followed by a number of continental troops; the guards from Ticonderoga had al≈øo to pa≈øs the light, and ru≈øhed forward in confu≈øion. The General at this time rode to the front, and obliged them to halt, and formed a line of march in rank and file, the roughne≈øs of the country and badne≈øs of the road permitting no other. Having effected this, he returned to the rear, which ≈øtill remained at the foot of the Mount. It was near four in the morning when the rear began to march. Colonel Francis, who commanded the rear guard, followed immediately after, and the line continued in good order till we arrived at Hubbarton, where the whole were halted to refre≈øh. The halt was near two hours. Mo≈øt of the ≈øtragglers and rear guard having joined us, the army was again put in motion. The rear guard here was given to Colonel Warner, with orders to halt about one and a half mile ≈øhort of the main body, which would remain that night at Ca≈øtle-Town, about ≈øix miles from Hubbarton, and to march in the morning by four, and join the main body. In the morning the General paraded the army, and waited near two hours for the rear guard. About ≈øeven o'clock a firing began on Warner's party, and on enquiry found he had halted at Hubbarton. The General expre≈ø≈øed his ≈øurprize that his orders were di≈øobeyed. He di≈øpatched my≈øelf and Major Living≈øton to order two militia regiments, that had halted between the main body and Warner, to reinforce him (the≈øe regiments were commanded by Colonel Bellows) and if the enemy ≈øhould appear in much ≈øuperior force, that Warner ≈øhould retreat to Rutland, where the main body would be to cover him. Tho≈øe regiments of militia refu≈øed to go up, tho' po≈øitively commanded, and afterwards intreated, by Colonel Bellows. This delay occa≈øioned Warner's retreat to Rutland, where the main body received him. The militia regiments returned, and although my≈øelf on hor≈øeback, and three miles from the main body, they arrived there with me. I rode expre≈øs.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. Be≈øides the parties you have mentioned on fatigue, do you recollect whether there was a brigade ordered for fatigue on Mount Independence about the 23d of June?</p>
               <p>A. I do recollect there was a brigade ordered for fatigue on Mount Independence about that time, which was exclu≈øive of the parties for fatigue I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the time General St. Clair received information of the ≈øtrength and de≈øigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did General St. Clair remove any of his baggage from Ticonderoga at any time previous to the evacuation?</p>
               <p>A. No part of it. His ≈øon went off, I believe, about a week before, but did not even carry all his own baggage with him. About the time General St. Clair's ≈øon went away, General Fermoy's baggage was removed from Head-Quarters to Mount Independence, he having lived with the General until that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What di≈øtance is Split-Rock from Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. About thirty-≈øeven miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What di≈øtance is Gilliland's Creek from Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. About forty-two miles.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Living≈øton, Aid de Camp to General Schuyler, being ≈øworn, ≈øays:</p>
               <p>About the middle of June, 1777, General St. Clair (agreeable to orders from General Schuyler) took upon him≈øelf the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. A few days after I went to Ticonderoga, in company with General Schuyler. After being there a few days. General Schuyler found it nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øervice to return to Albany, and the command in that department continued in General, St. Clair, with whom I had the honour of ≈øerving during the ≈øiege and on the retreat. Previous to the enemy's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before Ticonderoga, every method was made u≈øe of to gain intelligence of their movements and intentions. For this purpo≈øe ≈øcouting parties, properly officered, were kept out on the ea≈øt and we≈øt ≈øides of Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. The≈øe parties were generally ≈øelected from a corps of rangers, who had been accu≈øtomed to ≈øervices of this kind. The General did not confine his attention to the article of intelligence alone. No mea≈øures were neglected to ≈øtrengthen the works on both ≈øides of the Lake. Fatigue parties were daily employed in this duty, and the direction of them generally committed to Colonel Ko≈øeiu≈øzko, an active officer, who acted as an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant engineer in the northern department. The ob≈øtructions of the navigation at Lake Champlain was al≈øo attended to. Be≈øides a very ≈ølight boom, which had been thrown acro≈øs the Lake during the command of General Gates, large ca≈ø≈øoons were ≈øunk between Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, altho' this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous work was not compleated when the evacuation took place. On the 26th of June, or thereabouts, our ≈øcouts ob≈øerved an encampment of the enemy at Crown-Point, fifteen miles from Ticonderoga. From this time it became exceedingly difficult to procure any intelligence of the ≈øtrength or movements of the enemy, as the woods between us and Crown-Point were ≈øo infe≈øted with ≈øavages as to render it exceedingly hazardous to ≈øend ≈ømall parties that way, and the force of the garri≈øon was too weak to ju≈øtify the detaching a large number. Not many days after, I think it was on the la≈øt of June, the enemy's gun-boats appeared off Three Mile Point. The ≈øame day there was a ≈økirmi≈øh between a ≈øcout from the garri≈øon and the enemy. Our party were wor≈øted, and obliged to retire with a little lo≈øs. A con≈øiderable body of the enemy then took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Mount-Hope. This height commanded the road between Ticonderoga and the North Landing of Lake George. It had been fortified by us the preceding year, but was di≈ømantled long before General St. Clair's arrival in that quarter. The old block-hou≈øe at the north end of Lake George was ≈øtill in our hands. A ≈øubaltern's guard was left in it, to protect the public ≈øtores which were lying at that landing. The enemy did not ≈øuffer this officer to remain long in peaceable po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; they attacked him with ≈ømall arms, and were repul≈øed. The General, aware of the dangerous ≈øituation of the block-hou≈øe, and that the ≈ømall garri≈øon there mu≈øt ≈øoon be overpowered by numbers, or be obliged to ≈øubmit on the appearance of artillery, judged it nece≈ø≈øary to order them within the lines. This was effected ju≈øt in time, and without lo≈øs. The Communication between Ticonderoga and Lake George, by the main road, was now entirely cut off, which rendered it impracticable to bring the ≈øtores from the Lake within the fort. There was now
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016141_0036_0F9C7A77A54AB120"/>
great danger of their falling into the enemy's hands. To prevent a lo≈øs of this kind, the General ordered the ≈øtores to be immediately put on board the batteaus, and carried back to Fort George, on the ≈øouth ≈øide of the Lake. This ≈øervice was executed without lo≈øs, and no further communication po≈ø≈øible between Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and the country by the way of Lake George. The enemy continued to make their approaches on the Ticonderoga ≈øide of the Lake. It was impo≈ø≈øible, from the weakne≈øs of the garri≈øon, and the great extent of works we had to defend, to give them much interruption in their approaches. But the movement of the enemy, which gave the greate≈øt alarm to the garri≈øon, was the very rapid progre≈øs they made in clearing a road, and getting artillery on Sugar Hill or Mount Defiance. This proceeding was the more ≈øurpri≈øing, as it had been in agitation during the command of General Gates (in the fall of 1776, after our misfortune on Lake Champlain, when an attack on Ticonderoga was daily apprehended) to occupy that height with artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, but was judged to be impracticable. This hill had ≈øuch an entire command of Ticonderoga, that the enemy might have counted our very numbers, and enfiladed every part of our works. After po≈ø≈øe≈øing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves of this commanding height, it would have required but a few hours more to inve≈øt us on all ≈øides. This might have been effected by only occupying the ground on the ea≈øt ≈øide of Lake Champlain below Mount Independence, where the pa≈øs from the Lake to Ea≈øt Creek is very narrow. Had this taken place, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the country had been at an end, no further ≈øupplies of provi≈øion or men could have reached us, nor would a retreat, in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, then been practicable. But before this was effected, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a Council of War to retire from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. This re≈øolution was entered into on the evening of the 5th of July, and very early in the morning of the 6th the troops left the ground. Mea≈øures for the evacuation were concerted with the greate≈øt ≈øecrecy, to keep the enemy ignorant of our de≈øigns. The centinels within the works were ordered to challenge no per≈øon that night. This order I carried my≈øelf to the guards on Ticonderoga, though I was ignorant of the rea≈øon of ≈øuch an order. The guns at the French lines were ≈øpiked; but, to amu≈øe the enemy, the Jer≈øey battery kept up a regular fire during the night. The General al≈øo ≈øent me to the old French redoubt, which commanded the bridge between Ticonderoga and the Mount, to order the officer commanding the artillery there not to ≈øpike the guns in that redoubt until further orders, as this redoubt might have been of ≈øervice in covering our troops on their pa≈ø≈øage acro≈øs the bridge; but I found that through ≈øome mi≈øtake tho≈øe guns had already been ≈øpiked. What ≈øtores it was po≈ø≈øible to remove in the cour≈øe of one night, or rather in the ≈øpace of a few hours, were put on board the ve≈ø≈øels and batteaus in Lake Champlain, and ≈øent for Skeen≈øborough under Colonel Long, with the invalids and ≈øick of the ho≈øpital. Many barrels of powder, in particular, I remember were taken from the magazine, and put on board the ve≈ø≈øels, though they afterwards fell into the enemy's hands, or were blown up. The remainder of the army, under General St. Clair him≈øelf, retired by land. The rear guard was under the command of Colonel Francis. The army the fir≈øt day reached Ca≈øtle-Town, about thirty miles from Mount Independence. We made a halt of between one and two hours at Hubbarton, twenty odd miles from the ≈øame place. Before our leaving that town, the General ordered the rear guard to halt a mile or two ≈øhort of Ca≈øtle-Town, where he intended to ≈øtay with the army that night. The General had no rea≈øon to doubt but the≈øe orders would have been attended to, and therefore was not a little ≈øurpri≈øed to find early the next morning that the rear guard was ≈øtill at Hubbarton, which is ≈øix miles di≈øtant from Ca≈øtle-Town. At this di≈øtance from the army, they were attacked by General Frazer's corps. The rear guard was increa≈øed by many who at fir≈øt did not belong to it. This was owing to the exce≈ø≈øive bad roads and very heavy march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which prevented many, who were more feeble than others, from keeping pace with their regiments. The≈øe were picked up by the rear guard, agreeable to orders. At the time of the engagement, I imagine it could not amount to le≈øs than 1000 men. The moment the firing was heard at Ca≈øtle-Town, the General determined to ≈øupport the rear guard at Hubbarton. The troops at Ca≈øtle-Town were already under arms, and ready to march when the firing was fir≈øt heard. They were then ordered to keep their ground, and Major Dunn and my≈øelf were di≈øpatched with orders from the General to Colonel Bellows, who lay with his and another militia regiment between Ca≈øtle-Town and Hubbarton. Our orders were to direct Colonel Bellows to march with tho≈øe two regiments immediately to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Colonel Francis, and to a≈ø≈øure Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows at the ≈øame time that they ≈øhould be farther ≈øupported, if nece≈ø≈øary. In riding towards Hubbarton we were met by the≈øe regiments which were marching with ≈øpeed towards Ca≈øtle-Town. We delivered our orders, but could not prevail upon either regiment to reinforce the rear guard; though, in ju≈øtice to Colonel Bellows, it mu≈øt be ≈øaid, he was in the rear of the regiment, and warmly per≈øuaded them to go to the field of action. an unaccountable panic had ≈øeized his men, and no commands or intreaties had any effect on them. Finding it impo≈ø≈øible to turn the≈øe regiments to this nece≈ø≈øary piece of ≈øervice, we rode on towards the ≈øeene of action, to find how matters were ≈øituated there, and report to the General; but we had not proceeded far before we were met by Capt. Chadwick, with about 30 men. Capt. Chadwick had ju≈øt left the field, and informed us that the action was at an end, that our men were di≈øper≈øed, that the communication between us and Hubbarton was cut on, ≈øo that we ≈øhould run the greate≈øt ri≈øque of being made pri≈øoners if we proceeded any further that way, and that the enemy were in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the field of battle, in great force. The firing (which had heen very ≈ømart) having cea≈øed, countenanced this intelligence, and we returned to Ca≈øtle-Town and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the General of it. General St. Clair now thought it unnece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend any further reinforcement to Hubbarton, and prepared to pur≈øue his march. But here I mu≈øt not forget to mention the conduct of the General towards two ea≈øtern regiments of militia, commanded, I believe, by Hale and Learned. The≈øe regiments had ≈øhewed much di≈øcentent on the march the preceding day, and began now to be very cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous to be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed. The General, apprized of this ≈øpirit of di≈øcontent in the≈øe regiments, ordered them to be paraded at Ca≈øtle-Town, on the morning of the action at Hubbarton, and addre≈ø≈øed them in per≈øon. He ≈øpoke on this occa≈øion in ≈øo forcible and pathetic a manner, that the regiments, a≈øhamed of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, con≈øented to remain with the army as long as there was any pro≈øpect of immediate danger from the enemy; but the plundering di≈øpo≈øition they di≈øcovered on the march, and their other di≈øorderly behaviour, obliged the General a day or two afterwards to di≈ømi≈øs them from the army with di≈øgrace. The army after this continued their route through ≈øeveral towns, ea≈øt of Ca≈øtle-Town, without any further interruption from the enemy, to Hud≈øon's River. I am very well per≈øwaded that it was General St. Clair's intention at fir≈øt to have marched by Skeen≈øborough to Fort Edward; but an officer of one of our gallies on the Lake arrived
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016141_0037_0F9C7A7926E0D1E0"/>
at Ca≈øtle-Town before we left it, and informed the General that the enemy were pur≈øuing in force that way, who would reach Skeen≈øborough before he could po≈ø≈øibly get there, and that ≈øome ve≈ø≈øels had already fallen into their power. This determined the General to change his intended route, and take the road he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did. Before we reached Hud≈øon's River, General St. Clair di≈øpatched me to inform General Schuyler of the ≈øituation of his army. So far as I had an opportunity of ob≈øerving General St. Clair's conduct, it reflects high honour on him. Previous to, during the ≈øiege, and on the retreat, he gave proofs of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, activity and courage. The garri≈øon were always under arms at their proper po≈øts before ≈øun-ri≈øe, and frequently before day-break. The General was always out on the≈øe occa≈øions him≈øelf, and was an example of vigilance to the ≈øoldiery. I do not remember, tho' I lived in the ≈øame quarters with him the greater part of the time during the ≈øiege, that he ever undre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf at night. All night, indeed, he would ≈øcarcely ever permit him≈øelf to ≈øleep. If he did, it was not above an hour or two, tho' the gentlemen about him would frequently ob≈øerve that he would certainly injure his health unle≈øs he indulged him≈øelf with more ≈øleep. In ca≈øe of alarms, which were very frequent, he always appeared at the lines, encouraging the ≈øoldiery by his pre≈øence and exhortations. On the retreat, he pre≈øerved as much order in the army as was po≈ø≈øible thro' ≈øuch bad roads, and ≈øo rough a country.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the time General St. Clair received information of the ≈øtrength and de≈øigns of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair, having concluded the te≈øtimony in his behalf, de≈øires the Court to give him time to make his defence.</p>
               <p>The Court, taking into con≈øideration the General's de≈øire, do give him till the 21≈øt in≈øtant for that purpo≈øe.</p>

It ≈øeems to me a very extraordinary proceedure, to be tran≈øporting provi≈øion from Fort Edward to the Lake, and then bringing it back for the u≈øe of that garri≈øon, and mu≈øt ari≈øe from the greate≈øt inattention in the Commi≈ø≈øary.

                     <p>MY ≈øcout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It con≈øi≈øted of three men only, the be≈øt of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for the purpo≈øe. The woods are ≈øo full of Indians that it is difficult for parties to get through. I ≈øhall ≈øend off Whitcomb him≈øelf pre≈øently, for intelligence I mu≈øt have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, left he ≈øhould fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no ≈ømall de≈øire to have him in their power.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øent Colonel Warner to the Grants ye≈øterday, to rai≈øe a body of men to oppo≈øe the incur≈øions of the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages that are gone by Otter-Creek, and have ordered him to attack them, and join me again as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible. I am very happy to find the country was apprized of the march of that party before Colonel War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner got to Skeen≈øborough, as it will probably prevent their ≈øucce≈øs, and may end in their ruin.</p>
                     <p>We are going on with the nece≈ø≈øary works on the Mount as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible, and have removed the mo≈øt valuable of the ≈øtores and provi≈øion to that ≈øide. The bridge is in very little more forwardne≈øs to appearance than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will fini≈øh the getting timber for it. The boom is likewi≈øe placed, but very feebly ≈øecured, for want of cables.</p>
                     <p>I could wi≈øh the batteaus were all over ≈øoon, or that you would not ≈øend them. I am extremely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øive the enemy will po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of the Landing, in which ca≈øe they might fall into their hands. We cannot venture the teams now without a ≈øtrong guard, and ≈øo many parties as we are obliged to make, with the fatigues, will very ≈øoon wear down our men.</p>
                     <p>We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I cannot find a ≈øingle per≈øon, on whom I can depend, to venture among≈øt them for intelligence; but, from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclude that they are either in full force, or very weak, and hope by letting loo≈øe the Indians

to intimidate us. I incline to believe the la≈øt, but have as yet no certain rule to go by; however, we mu≈øt know ≈øoon, and it is ≈øaid they have marked to-morrow to attack. I beg leave <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Major General St. Clair, being reque≈øted to make his defence, ≈øays as follows:</p>
               <p>HOWEVER di≈øagreeable it may be to appear before a Court, a pri≈øoner, and in the light of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, I am happy that my conduct, which has been ≈øo much cen≈øured at large, is at la≈øt to be enquired into by a proper judicatory, and that, after ≈øo long a delay, and ≈øo injurious a di≈øcrimination, public ju≈øtice will be done upon a full, an impartial, and di≈øpa≈ø≈øionate examination, and that it will be pa≈ø≈øed upon by men equal to the ta≈øk of inve≈øtigating the truth, however artfully concealed, and determining upon the intrin≈øic merit of military actions, ≈øtripped of the glare that is ≈øometimes thrown upon them by ≈øucce≈øs, or the fal≈øe lights in which they are often placed by con≈øequences. If I am guilty of all, or any of the charges again≈øt me, I wi≈øh not to e≈øcape puni≈øhment; but, con≈øcious of no crime, I hope by your ≈øentence, upon a candid compari≈øon of the te≈øtimony, to have tho≈øe ≈øtains wiped from my character, with which it has been ≈øuffered to remain too long blotted, and to be re≈øtored with honour to the arms of my friends and of my country. I ≈øay a proper judicatory, in contra-di≈øtinction to that before which the matter has been ≈øo long hung up, and which, from the proceedings, ≈øeems to have con≈øidered it≈øelf as analogous to a grand-jury, and has ≈øtrictly followed the ill example of grand juries in latter times; I mean their calling for, or admitting, ≈øuch evidence only as might ≈øerve to criminate, not con≈øidering how much the bare accu≈øation affects the reputation, or, where the per≈øon has any ≈øen≈øibility, how deeply it cuts into the ≈øoul.</p>
               <p>The in≈øtances of di≈øcrimination are ≈øo many, it is painful to mention them. But has it not taken place in the ca≈øes of General Sullivan. General Wayne, General Maxwell, General Putnam, and others? They have all been accu≈øed of mi≈øconduct, but General Schuyler and my≈øelf only have been forced to langui≈øh, in torpid inactivity, under the weight of the accu≈øation.</p>
               <p>The charges again≈øt me are of a very general and criminal nature, and have been ≈øtated by a Committee of Congre≈øs, upon the evidence collected by another Committee, appointed for the purpo≈øe of collecting evidence again≈øt the General Officers, who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated. Sir, all this formal interference of Congre≈øs, or Committees of Congre≈øs, gives the matter an air of va≈øt importance, and impre≈ø≈øes on the public an idea of great criminality. It will, therefore, be nece≈ø≈øary for me, whil≈øt I defend my≈øelf again≈øt the charges directly, to take ≈øome notice of the rea≈øonings of the Committee, and to ≈øhew in ≈øome in≈øtances their fallacy, in others their futility. For which rea≈øon I beg leave to read the report.</p>
               <p>THE Committee, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and ≈øtate charges, again≈øt the General Officers, who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated, Report.</p>
               <p>That, having examined the papers to them committed, relative to the ≈øubject in que≈øtion, they find</p>
               <p>That, on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, Major General St. Clair took upon him the command at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that tho≈øe po≈øts were, by his orders, evacuated to the enemy on the 6th day of July following.</p>
               <p>That, by Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary Avery's return of provi≈øion at Ticonderoga on the 25th of May, 1777, there were at that po≈øt 1400 barrels of flour, and 661 barrels of beef; which he ≈øtated as ≈øufficient provi≈øion in flour for 4000 men during 66 days, and in beef for 75 days.</p>
               <p>That, by Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary Yancey's return of provi≈øion remaining on hand at Ticonderoga the 20th of June, 1777, there were 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, 784 barrels of pork, and 48 barrels of hard bread, be≈øides pea≈øe, Indian meal, ≈øugar, coffee, chocolate, mola≈ø≈øes, wine, rum, ≈øalt, candles and hog's-lard.</p>
               <p>That, on or about the 5th of July, 1777, as appears by Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth's affidavit, a con≈øiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fat cattle arrived at Ticonderoga.</p>
               <p>That, by the general return of the troops on the 14th of June, 1777, pre≈øent at Ticonderoga and on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and which we ≈øuppo≈øe to be in the <hi>environs,</hi> there were

               <p>That General St. Clair informed the Council of War held on the 5th of July, 1777, that 900 militia had joined him. That Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth ≈øwears they were of the Grants; and General St. Clair, in his letter to Congre≈øs, July 14, ≈øays they joined on the 5th. That the whole force in Ticonderoga, on the 5th of July, 1777, was 5639 men and officers, of which a number, not exceeding 639, could be con≈øidered as ≈øick.</p>
               <p>That, on the 13th of June, 1777, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that two men from Canada, taken pri≈øoners, informed him that the Briti≈øh army in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada were a≈ø≈øembling, to the amount of about 10,000 men, as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible, to cro≈øs the Lake, and attack Ticonderoga; and that he might depend upon it their fleet would appear in a fortnight at farthe≈øt.</p>
               <p>That, on the 18th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that four of the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels were lying within a mile of the hither ≈øide of <hi>Split-Rock</hi>; that on the day before the enemy's Indians had taken two pri≈øoners, who had ≈øtrolled from his camp unarmed; and that he thought the enemy's main army was not far off.</p>
               <p>That, on the 14th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that the evening before he had received information, from a ≈øcouting party, the enemy were encamped on both ≈øides of Gilliland's Creek, and that they were very numerous.</p>
               <p>That, on the 25th of June, General St. Clair wrote to Congre≈øs, that he was not able to di≈øcover whether the enemy were in force or not; that ≈øeven of their ve≈ø≈øels arrived at Crown-Point the preceding evening; and that others of their fleet were four or five miles lower down.</p>
               <p>That, on the 30th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that the enemy having advanced to the Three Mile Point, the alarm was given; that his people were in the be≈øt di≈øpo≈øition po≈ø≈øible; and that he had no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, ≈øhould they think proper to attack him.</p>
               <p>That it does not appear the enemy did attack General St. Clair; yet, neverthele≈øs, on the 5th of July he called a Council of War, and de≈øired their opinion, whether he ≈øhould wait the attack at the Ticonderoga lines, or whether the whole of the troops ≈øhould be drawn over to Mount Independence, the more effectually to provide for the defence of that po≈øt. Whereupon the Council were unanimou≈øly of opinion, that it was impo≈ø≈øible, with their force (then ≈øtated by General St. Clair to be 2089 rank and file, be≈øides the corps of artillery, 900 militia, and 124 artificers unarmed) to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and ≈øtores ≈øhould be removed that night, if po≈ø≈øible, to Mount Independence. That the General al≈øo put another que≈øtion, whether, after a retreat to Mount Independence, they ≈øhould be in a ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion defend that po≈øt? or, in ca≈øe it could not be defended, whether a retreat into the country would be practicable? Upon the≈øe points, the Council unanimou≈øly concluded that a retreat ought to be undertaken as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, and that they ≈øhould be very fortunate if it could be effected. And in pur≈øuance of this determination Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were abandoned between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 6th of July, 1777, General St. Clair having, as appears by Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth's affidavit, eight days before ≈øent his ≈øon and baggage from Ticonderoga to Fort George.</p>
               <p>That General St. Clair, in his letter to the Hon. John Jay, <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> dated July 25, 1777. writing of the evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, ≈øays, That had the opinion of the Council been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it was, it (meaning the evacuation) would neverthele≈øs have taken place, as he knew it to be impo≈ø≈øible to defend the po≈øts with their numbers.</p>
               <p>That the ≈øick at Ticonderoga, and the public ≈øtores of ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing, were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> behind, or lo≈øt upon the precipitate retreat of the 6th of July.</p>
               <p>That on the 20th of June, 1777. a Council of War was held at Ticonderoga, Generals Schuyler and St. Clair being pre≈øent, wherein it was determined, that Ticonderoga and Mount Independence ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as long as po≈ø≈øible, con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øafety of the troops and <hi>≈øtores</hi>; that, if either of tho≈øe po≈øts mu≈øt be evacuated, the former ≈øhould be evacuated; that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient; and that repairing the old and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention.</p>
               <p>That, by Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth's affidavit, it appears there was not a ≈øtroke ≈øtruck to fortify Mount Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that no parties were ≈øent to annoy the enemy, though the troops were healthy, courageous, and de≈øirous to improve every advantage again≈øt them.</p>
               <p>That, by the determination of the Council of War on the 5th of July, it appears the enemy had then nothing more to do to compleat their inve≈øtiture of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, than to occupy the neck of land, a ≈øpace of three quarters of a mile between the Lake and the Ea≈øt Creek, and to po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of the Narrow, between them and Skeen≈øborough.</p>

               <p>That, on the 23d of June, the abovementioned guards were reduced from 178 to 95 men; the fatigue party from 326 to 250 men; and 78 privates, under proper officers, were ordered for the detail of guards at Mount Independence; all to continue till further orders.</p>
               <p>That the 26th of June was the fir≈øt day the troops were drawn up at their alarm-po≈øts, ordered to di≈øcharge their loaded pieces, and to clean them; and it was but on this day that a ≈øignal was given in orders, in ca≈øe of an attack at the French lines, or at Mount Independence.</p>
               <p>That, on the 29th of June, it was ordered that a ≈øcout, con≈øi≈øting of a ≈øubaltern, a ≈øerjeant, and twenty privates, ≈øhould be ≈øent out every morning, one hour before gun-fire; the fatigue party being then increa≈øed to 310 privates, the other guards continuing as before, 173 privates, without any addition till the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the po≈øts.</p>
               <p>Upon which ≈øtate of evidence, your Committee, in order to ground their charges again≈øt Major General St. Clair, beg leave to remark;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> That, on the 13th of June, General St. Clair was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an information, from two pri≈øoners taken in Canada, that the Briti≈øh forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible again≈øt him, and that he might expect their arrival in three weeks at farthe≈øt. That as, on the 18th of June, four of the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels were lying on the hither ≈øide of Split-Rock, and on the 24th ≈øeven of them were at Crown Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both ≈øides of Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Creek, and he was informed by his ≈øcouts that they were very numerous; ≈øo from the≈øe circum≈øtances it appears General St. Clair had ≈øub≈øtantial rea≈øon to confide in what the pri≈øoners had told him relative to the intentions and ≈øtrength of the enemy, and that he ought at this time to have taken his final re≈øolution, either to ≈øtand an attack, or to retreat with his ≈øtores, the pre≈øervation of which was a principal object in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Council of War on the 20th of June. Therefore it appears that General St. Clair's neglecting to form his deci≈øive opinion at this time, or at a later day, ≈øo as to allow him a ≈øufficient opportunity to retreat with his troops, ≈øick, ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> deprive the enemy of ≈øhelter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That General St. Clair, on the 24th of June, was informed by his ≈øcouts the enemy were very numerous, and yet, neverthele≈øs, on the next day he wrote to Congre≈øs, that he was not able to di≈øcover whether the enemy were in force or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> That it General St. Clair found ≈ømall ≈øcouts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was his duty in due time to have ≈øent out reconnoitring parties, in ≈øuch force as might have a≈ø≈øured him whether or not the enemy were in ≈øtrength, this being a mo≈øt important point, as upon this he was to regulate his motions; and therefore his failure in ≈øending out ≈øuch parties in due time was a neglect, of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> That as Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth ≈øwears General St. Clair did not annoy the enemy in their advance again≈øt, and inve≈øtiture of, the po≈øts under his care, although the troops were healthy, courageous, and de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of action, it appears the General did not to the utmo≈øt of his power oppo≈øe the operations of the enemy; and therefore that he is liable to the charge of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth.</hi> That as it was determined in the Council of War on the 20th of June, approved by General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention; and Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth ≈øwears not a ≈øtroke was ≈øtruck for tho≈øe purpo≈øes; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea≈øed in number, and ≈øo continued at a time when it ≈øhould have been abundantly increa≈øed; ≈øo on the≈øe points the General is liable to be charged with a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, and with treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth.</hi> That as on the 25th of May, the Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary rated that 1400 barrels of flour would, at an allowance of one pound each man <hi>per diem,</hi> ≈øerve 4000 men 66 days, and that 661 barrels of beef would ≈øerve the ≈øame number of men 75 days; and ≈øuppo≈øing that, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu≈øive, there were in Ticonderoga and Mount Independence 4739 men, and there does not appear to have been at any time between tho≈øe periods a greater number; ≈øo, e≈øtimating the con≈øumption of 4739 men, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu≈øive, upon the 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork, on the twentieth of June returned by Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary Yancey as then actually remaining on hand, there did on the fourth of July remain, or ought, if provi≈øions had been regularly and properly i≈ø≈øued, to be then remaining 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; a magazine of provi≈øions ≈øufficient to afford to the army on the 5th of July, amounting, by the arrival of the militia of the Grants, to 5639 men of all ranks, <hi>full allowance</hi> of provi≈øion in flour for 52 days, and in beef and pork for 32 days, exclu≈øive of the con≈øiderable number of fat cattle that arrived at Ticonderoga on the fifth of July, the teams of oxen nece≈ø≈øarily attending the po≈øt, and other ≈øtores ≈øpecified in the Commi≈ø≈øary's return on the twentieth of June, and even ≈øuppo≈øing, as may not rea≈øonably be done, that no ≈øupply of flour had arrived after that day. And as this calculation has been liberally made, upon the quantity of provi≈øion
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:016141_0041_0F9C8035A59B1340"/>
actually in Ticondero on the twentieth of June, for the expenditure of which General St. Clair, at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander at the po≈øt, ought to be held re≈øpon≈øible; therefore it clearly appears Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not abandoned upon a ju≈øt principle of a want of provi≈øion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh.</hi> That as General St. Clair informed the Hon. Mr. Jay, that at the time of holding the Council of War on the 5th of July, he knew it to be impo≈ø≈øible to defend the po≈øts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point at early at the 29th of June, the day that he ≈øent his ≈øon and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate effects from Ticonderoga to Fort-George, as a place of ≈øafety: That being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken at effectual mea≈øures for the pre≈øervation of the public property, at lea≈øt equally with his own, claiming his earlie≈øt attention: That on the 30th of June, the enemy being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced again≈øt him ≈øo near as the Three Mile Point, it is incredible that he did not then know that they were in force: That it was his duty, <hi>at that point of time,</hi> to have finally determined either to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire: That if the la≈øt re≈øolution was taken, and, from his ≈øending off his ≈øon and baggage the day before, there is the ≈øtronge≈øt pre≈øumption that this re≈øolution was <hi>then</hi> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to ≈øend off the public ≈øtores, to de≈øtroy the works, and to evacuate the po≈øts without lo≈øing a moment of time: And that by deferring to take any mea≈øures to retire till the la≈øt moment when he could po≈ø≈øibly retreat oven with his effective troops, a moment when the ≈øick, ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing of the army mu≈øt be abandoned and lo≈øt, be≈øides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, General St. Clair appears chargeable with inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General, and with ≈øhamefully abandoning the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge. Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wi≈øhes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too exten≈øive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if ≈øuch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehen≈øible point of view, at the weakne≈øs of his defence being more obvious, his retreat ≈øhould have been earlier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon and made.</p>
               <p>Your Committee, having thus ≈øtated the points principally re≈øulting from the evidence collected again≈øt General St. Clair, recommend that a general court-martial be ordered to fit for the trial of Major General St. Clair, for the lo≈øs of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, with the public ≈øtores; and that he be charged</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt. With Neglect of Duty</hi>; under the 5th article of the 18th ≈øection of the rules and articles of war‚Äî and that the charge be founded upon the fir≈øt, third, fourth and fifth Remarks, re≈øpectively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second. With Cowardice, with Treachery, with Incapacity as a General,</hi> re≈øpectively; under the 5th article of the 18th ≈øection of the rules and articles of war‚Äîand that the charge be founded upon the fourth remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third. With Treachery</hi>; under the 5th article of the 18th ≈øection of the rules and articles of war‚Äî and that the charge be founded upon the fifth remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth. With inattention to the Progre≈øs of the enemy, with Treachery, with Incapacity as a General,</hi> re≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; under the 5th article of the 18th ≈øection of the rules and articles of war‚Äîand that the charge be founded upon the ≈øeventh remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth. With ≈øhamefully abandoning the Po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge</hi>; under the 12th article of the 13th ≈øection of the rules and articles of war‚Äîand that the charge be founded upon the ≈øeventh remark.</p>
               <p>Finally, upon the ca≈øe of Major General St. Clair, your Committee recommend that authenticated copies of the returns, letters, and determinations of courts-martial, referred to, be tran≈ømitted to the Judge-Advocate-General; that Eli≈øha Avery, James Yancey, Richard Varrick, Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth, and the Colonels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the two battalions of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts militia, who≈øe time of ≈øervice was nearly expired at the evacuation of Ticonderoga, be ≈øummoned to give evidence at the trial of Major General St. Clair; and that he be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed with a copy of the remarks and charges again≈øt him.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt ob≈øervation that naturally offers is, that the charges which have been exhibited to this Court have all been founded upon the <hi>ex parte</hi> affidavit of a Mr. Leavenworth, which (in mo≈øt in≈øtances) he has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in open Court, and con≈øequently is entitled to no degree of credit, and upon my own letters to Congre≈øs and to General Schuyler, the Officer who commanded in chief in the northern department. It is ≈øingular, however, that charges of ≈øo high a nature again≈øt an officer of my rank ≈øhould be attempted to be ≈øupported (for ≈øupported I tru≈øt they are not) by no other living witne≈øs than Mr. Leavenworth, a private man! a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the army! in ≈øome of the lowe≈øt and vile≈øt occupations! who, if he had had capacity to judge, could not po≈ø≈øibly have had proper information; that not an officer, of any rank what≈øoever, has been called upon; and yet, had treachery, had neglect of duty, been committed,‚Äîhad I been inattentive to the progre≈øs of the enemy,‚Äîhad the po≈øts in my charge been ≈øhamefully abandoned,‚Äîor had I been guilty of cowardice,‚Äîthey could not have e≈øcaped their notice altogether; nay, it was by them only they could probably hate been di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. But this by the bye. Previous to any remarks upon, or application of, the te≈øtimony, I beg leave to inform the Court, that, before I left Philadelphia to take upon me the command of Ticonderoga, Congre≈øs had received information, which they credited, that the principal part of the enemy's troops in Canada were ordered round by St. Lawrence to join General Howe; that no ≈øerious attempt would be made upon Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga; at mo≈øt, it would be a diver≈øion only. This was communicated to me by Mr. Hancock, then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øident, and I have his authority to mention it to this Court. This circum≈øtance will ≈øerve as a key to many of my letters, and will account for my doubts about ≈øome intelligence I received after my arrival at Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga. And it appears from General Poor's te≈øtimony, that General Gates had likewi≈øe, from them, received the ≈øame account.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt charge is neglect of duty, founded upon the fir≈øt, third, fourth and fifth remarks, re≈øpectively.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt remark is, "that on the 13th of June I was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an information, from two pri≈øoners taken in Canada, that the Briti≈øh forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible again≈øt me, and that I might expect their arrival in three weeks at farthe≈øt; that as, on the 18th of June, four of the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels were lying on the hither ≈øide of Split Rock, and, on the 24th, ≈øeven of them were at Crown-Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both ≈øides Gilliland's Creek,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016141_0042_0F9C8036970591E8"/>
and that I was informed by my ≈øcouts they were very numerous; ≈øo, from the≈øe circum≈øtances, it appears I had ≈øub≈øtantial rea≈øon to confide in what the pri≈øoners had told me relative to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> and ≈øtrength of the enemy, and that I ought at this time to have taken my final re≈øolution either to ≈øtand an attack, or to retreat with my ≈øtores, the pre≈øervation of which was a principal object in the determinations of the Council of War on the 20th; therefore it appears, that neglecting to form my deci≈øive opinion at this time, or at a later day, ≈øo as to allow my≈øelf a ≈øufficient opportunity to retreat with my troops, ≈øick, ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing, and to deprive the enemy of ≈øhelter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty."</p>
               <p>It is true, that on the 13th of June I was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an information, from two pri≈øoners, that the Briti≈øh army amounted to about 10,000 men, and that they were making every preparation to cro≈øs the Lake, to attack my po≈øts; but it is al≈øo true, that I con≈øidered the≈øe per≈øons as ≈øpies; that their information was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by two Frenchmen, who had been ≈øent into Canada by General Gates, for the expre≈øs purpo≈øe of gaining intelligence of the enemy's de≈øigns; that the information of the≈øe Frenchmen arrived at the ≈øame time, and was tran≈ømitted by the ≈øame conveyance to General Schuyler; as appears from my letter to him of June 13th.</p>
               <p>The information, Sir, of pri≈øoners is generally doubtful; but that of per≈øons con≈øidered as ≈øpies mu≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ≈øu≈øpected. I would therefore have been ju≈øtifiable in not giving them credit, if I had not received contradictory intelligence. But when the Court con≈øider the opinion of Congre≈øs above-mentioned, and that the per≈øons actually were ≈øpies (the letter from Mr. Livius to General Sullivan, that has been publi≈øhed by the General, having been found upon one of them) and that their intelligence was contradicted by per≈øons of credit, they will think the conclu≈øion I drew the natural and proper one‚Äîthat they were ≈øent to deceive us, and were unworthy of belief. They will think that the enemy's advancing their ve≈ø≈øels to Crown-Point and Split Rock, and forming an encampment at Gilliland's Creek, as they did on the 18th and 24th of June (that place being at a di≈øtance, out of the reach of our parties, but not out of the way of ob≈øervation) thereby to induce the divi≈øion of our troops, to reinforce the places on which they had no de≈øign, and to le≈ø≈øen the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition where their army was to act effectually, was the very thing they ought to have done; and we all know the appearance of a great encampment can be made with very few troops. And this ≈øentiment at cofor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the po≈øition of their camp, which was a ≈øandy beach upon the ≈øhore of the Lake, where the creek falls into it, forty-two or three miles di≈øtant from Ticonderoga, as has been proven by General Wilkin≈øon, Major Dunn, and others, with a rough, broken, woody country betwixt them.</p>
               <p>But it ≈øeems I ought then, or at a later day, to have taken my deci≈øive re≈øolution to retreat, ≈øaving to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf a ≈øufficient opportunity to bring off my troops, and every thing that was at the po≈øts, and to deprive the enemy of ≈øhelter at Ticonderoga, and that the not doing ≈øo was a neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>I ≈øu≈øpect, Sir, the Committee, who formed the≈øe charges, had no idea of the nature of a ≈øubordinate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. They would otherwi≈øe have known, that I had no power to form or execute any ≈øuch re≈øolution, and that my ju≈øtification for evacuating the po≈øts at all mu≈øt depend upon the nece≈ø≈øity of the ca≈øe. I did what my duty required me. I gave the earlie≈øt notice to the Commanding Officer of the department, and ≈øtood ready to execute his commands. But I am per≈øwaded that, had it been in my power to have taken my final re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, and upon the intelligence I had received I had abandoned the po≈øts, altho' every thing had been ≈øaved which has ≈øince been lo≈øt, the charges of treachery and cowardice would have been rung much louder, and pre≈ø≈øed home more ≈øtrongly, and with more virulence, if po≈ø≈øible, than in the pre≈øent ca≈øe. I ≈øhould have heard, that no deci≈øive operation ≈øhould be founded on the vague report of pri≈øoners or de≈øerters, often ignorant, almo≈øt always ill informed; but that to abandon a po≈øt on the information of per≈øons I ≈øu≈øpected to be, and actually were, the enemy's ≈øpies, or from the view of an encampment upwards of forty miles off, and that only ≈øeen acro≈øs a lake ≈øix or eight miles broad, could proceed from no other than one of tho≈øe ≈øources, or from perfect ≈øtupidity; and this Court, from whom I expect a very different deci≈øion, would have joined in that opinion, and condemned me to the puni≈øhment I had ju≈øtly merited. But, be≈øides all this, if the Council of War was to guide, it was out of my power to take any ≈øuch mea≈øure; for the re≈øolution of the Council is, that both Ticonderoga and Mount Independence are to be held as long as they can be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øafety of the troops and ≈øtores. When the ≈øafety of the troops and ≈øtores became doubtful, Ticonderoga, not Mount Independence, was to be evacuated.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond article upon which the charge of neglect of duty is founded is, "That if I found ≈ømall ≈øcouts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was my duty, in due time, to have ≈øent out reconnoitring parties, in ≈øuch force as might have a≈ø≈øured me whether or not the enemy were in ≈øtrength, and that this was not done."</p>
               <p>Had not the Committee been totally ignorant of the nature of the country in which the≈øe parties were to act‚Äîhad they given any attention to the returns of my army, which were before them, or credit to my letters to General Schuyler, of which they had the peru≈øal, this article would never have made its appearance. Had it ever occurred to them that the enemy proceeded by water, and that the only debarkation we hear of was at Gilliland's Creek, forty miles and upwards from Ticonderoga, and that they proceeded from thence by water again, we ≈øhould not have heard this ≈øtory of reconnoitering parties, of which, I am morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they them≈øelves had no determinate idea. My whole army would not have formed one party ≈øuch as they ≈øeem to think ought to have been ≈øent out frequently. I have proven that ≈ømall parties were ≈øent out, not only frequently but con≈øtantly; and altho' they were but ≈ømall parties, they were as ≈øtrong as the ≈øtate of my garri≈øon, and the works in hand, would allow. It is true, indeed, I obtained by them no certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the enemy's force until they landed at Three Mile Point, nor was it po≈ø≈øible before; they po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed neither the gifts of divination, nor walking upon the water; but they could give me information if any part of the enemy's army were advancing by land, and this was all I could expect from them, except that, in that ca≈øe, they might have brought off ≈øome pri≈øoners.</p>
               <p>The returns prove the ≈øtrength of my army‚Äîthe orderly book the daily guards‚Äîand I have proven, by General Poor, Colonel Baldwin, Colonel Ko≈øeiu≈øzko, General Wilkin≈øon, and almo≈øt every witne≈øs, the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous fatigue parties and pickets. I leave it to the Court to judge if larger parties could have been ≈øpared to make di≈øcoveries. But ≈øuppo≈øing, for argument ≈øake, that my army would have afforded ≈øtronger reconnoitring parties, I contend that, until the enemy were landed, they would have been u≈øele≈øs, and afterwards highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:016141_0043_0F9C803728851F88"/>
and that the ≈øending ≈øuch would have argued great want of Judgment. It would have been ≈øending two or three hundred men (and that number would perhaps have been thought a pretty good recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitring party) to certain de≈øtruction. They could not have marched thro' thick woods and rank herbage without being di≈øcovered, if the enemy's parties were the lea≈øt vigilant. If they were attacked at a di≈øtance, as they could not be ≈øupported, they mu≈øt inevitably have fallen into the enemy's hands; if attacked within ≈øupporting di≈øtance, they mu≈øt ≈øtill have fallen, or a general action been brought on; for they could no otherwi≈øe have been ≈øupported, but by marching out to ≈øu≈øtain them, and then all the expence and time that had been laid out on the fortifications were thrown away. A General, entru≈øted with the defence of a po≈øt, who reduces him≈øelf to the nece≈ø≈øity of fighting the enemy to ≈øupport his detachments, or who, by making large detachments and lo≈øing them, puts it out of his own power to maintain his po≈øt, certainly di≈øcovers very little knowledge, and would ju≈øtly be the object of cen≈øure at lea≈øt, if not of puni≈øhment. Had ≈øuch detachments been made from my army, one or other of the≈øe con≈øequences mu≈øt have followed; they mu≈øt have been when<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or I mu≈øt have ri≈øked an action to bring them off: But I had not a force ≈øufficient for the defence of my po≈øts, much le≈øs to cope with the enemy in the field, therefore no ≈øuch detachments, as ≈øhould lay me under the nece≈ø≈øity of attempting it, or be of any great moment if a misfortune happened to them, were made. But further, as very ≈ømall parties, three men for example, can approach an enemy without much danger of being di≈øcovered, which large parties cannot, and that the≈øe ≈ømall parties, from that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance, have a better chance to make pri≈øoners, to take off a centinel for example, to which they are fully adequate, and that the intelligence to be obtained from reconnoitring parties mu≈øt depend, in a great mea≈øure, upon the pri≈øoners they make, it follows that ≈ømall parties are the mo≈øt proper, and fully an≈øwer every purpo≈øe of gaining intelligence that can be derived from the larger, without being ≈øubject to the ≈øame dangers. It likewi≈øe follows, that there was no neglect of duty in this in≈øtance, but, on the contrary, that the mo≈øt proper methods for obtaining certain intelligence of the motions and force of the enemy were taken and pur≈øued.</p>
               <p>The charge of neglect of duty is further grounded upon the affidavit of Mr. Leavenworth, who, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, ≈øwears that the enemy were not annoyed by me in their advance again≈øt, and inve≈øtiture of, the po≈øts under my care, though the troops were healthy, courageous, and de≈øirous of action, and therefore I am liable to the charges of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General. The Committee ≈øeem to be in doubt on which of the four to ≈øix, it is one or t'other, but, to make ≈øure of the matter, and ≈øwell the black li≈øt, they have directed that I be pro≈øecuted upon each. It has been proven by Dr. Brown and Dr. Town≈øhend, the ho≈øpital ≈øurgeons, that the troops were not healthy, and their te≈øtimony will have weight. The Court will plea≈øe to ob≈øerve the contradiction betwixt what the Committee ≈øay Mr. Leavenworth ≈øwore, and what he actually ≈øwears before this Court; here he ≈øwears that he has ≈øeen parties go out of about twenty men, and that he once heard of a ≈øcalp being brought in; there he ≈øwore that they were not annoyed at all; perhaps he thought killing and ≈øcalping the ≈øavages employed by the enemy no annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! But it is needle≈øs to dwell upon this man's te≈øtimony, as, from his ≈øtation, he could not know much, and, from his ob≈øervation, he actually knows very little.</p>
               <p>It is in proof to the Court, by a number of witne≈ø≈øes, that parties were con≈øtantly out, and that they frequently were engaged with the enemy; and, by Colonel Stevens, that every annoyance was given to the enemy by the artillery, from every quarter, from the fir≈øt of their appearance until the evacuation. But if the Committee meant that no large detachments were ≈øent to annoy the enemy, it is granted; and the rea≈øons that have been already given for not ≈øending out large reconnoitring parties apply ≈øo directly, it would be tre≈øpa≈ø≈øing on the patience of the Court to repeat them.</p>
               <p>The la≈øt ground for the charge of neglect of duty is, "that, notwith≈øtanding it had been determined in a Council of War on the 20th of June, that the repairing the old works, and adding new ones on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention, Mr. Leavenworth ≈øwears not a ≈øtroke was ≈øtruck for the≈øe purpo≈øes." Here Mr. Leavenworth gives the Committee the ≈ølip again; for he ≈øwears before the Court, not that there was not a ≈øtroke ≈øtruck for the≈øe purpo≈øes, but that he has heard there were many ≈øtrokes ≈øtruck; he has heard of what he calls ≈øome ≈ømall works flung up on the ≈øouth end of Mount Independence; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the map, and explanation by Colonel Ko≈øeiu≈øzko, the≈øe were lines and three redoubts, for 1500 men at lea≈øt. But, for≈øooth, there were none erected where he expected, and <hi>he</hi> did not think the works ≈øuitable to cover the men. He acknowledges he has ≈øeen parties of axe-men ≈øent from the parade. He could not ≈øuppo≈øe they were ≈øent to ≈øtrike no ≈øtrokes; and it is ≈øcarce conceivable that a per≈øon, who on other occa≈øions, as much out of his way, was ≈øo very inqui≈øitive, ≈øhould not have had the curio≈øity to a≈øk ≈øome one what tho≈øe men were going to do with their axes, if his occupation as a ≈øuttler had not given him an opportunity to know it.</p>
               <p>The≈øe palpable contradictions betwixt the evidence this man has given to the Committee, and what he has declared to the Court, will, I hope, put a ≈øtop to all <hi>ex parte</hi> enquiries for the future; in which ca≈øe, I ≈øhall the le≈øs regret the injuries I have my≈øelf ≈øu≈øtained from them. But the Committee go on, and ≈øay, in further ≈øupport of the charge, "that from the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea≈øed, and continued ≈øo at a time when it ought to have been abundantly increa≈øed." It is true the parties furni≈øhed by the daily details were decrea≈øed; but I have proven, by a cloud of witne≈ø≈øes, that circum≈øtance notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the fatigue parties were abundantly increa≈øed, and continued ≈øo; nay, that almo≈øt my whole army were con≈øtantly employed in repairing the old and con≈øtituting new works; and that, ≈øo far from being guilty of a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, in that re≈øpect, I did every thing in my power to put the po≈øts in a proper po≈øture of defence.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond charge is cowardice, treachery, and incapacity as a General, directed to be tried upon the 5th article of the 18th ≈øection of the Rules and Articles of War, and founded on the fourth remark of the Committee.</p>
               <p>By Mr. Leavenworth's te≈øtimony again are the≈øe horrid accu≈øations to be ≈øupported; not in a direct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but by inference and deduction from that part of it, which the Committee in the above remark ≈øay he gave them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> viz. "that the enemy were not annoyed in the advance to, and inve≈øtiture of, the po≈øts;" but which he, in part, has contradicted here, as I ob≈øerved before, and which, by Colonel Stevens, General
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:016141_0044_0F9C8037E34CE550"/>
Wilkin≈øon, Colonel Living≈øton, Major Dunn, and others, I have proven to be fal≈øe. The inferences of con≈øequence are fal≈øe likewi≈øe, and of cour≈øe the charges groundle≈øs. But I believe it is the fir≈øt in≈øtance where charges of a capital nature have been brought again≈øt an officer by deduction, without a ≈øhadow of proof to ≈øupport them; and cowardice and treachery are capital crimes, although the Committee have directed them to be tried by an Article of War to which no capital crime whatever can be referred, having been expre≈øly provided for crimes not capital. I wave, however, any advantage that might be taken of this. My reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or my ≈øafety, ≈øhall never depend upon the blunders of any ≈øett of men who may think proper to accu≈øe me; but, when proof is wanting, candour will never attribute actions to the wor≈øt cau≈øe from which they could po≈ø≈øibly flow; good-nature will ever a≈øcribe them to the be≈øt. Hitherto, however, I have experienced very little of either. But my birth, Sir, my education, my connections, both in this country and in Britain, my ≈øtation in life, my children (if to the≈øe had not been added the habitudes of early life) as they were the be≈øt pledges, ≈øo they ≈øhould have ≈øecured me from the imputation of tho≈øe mo≈øt ≈øhameful vices, from which the meane≈øt of the people are generally free. But my reputation re≈øts not on that bottom. I am happy in the general good opinion of the army, which is never be≈øtowed upon cowards, nor has all the calumny that I have been loaded with ≈øhaken me a ≈øingle friend. The Court have the fulle≈øt evidence, that on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion I have given demon≈øtrations of an active, as well as pa≈ø≈øive, courage; my conduct in that re≈øpect has been uniform on all occa≈øions; and this is confirmed by the concurring te≈øtimony of many of the principal officers of the army, with ≈øome of whom I have been, per≈øonally, in almo≈øt every action that has happened during the war. From thence they mu≈øt conclude, that, whatever might have been the motives for my evacuating Ticonderoga, it could not have been owing to cowardice, and chat the charge is fal≈øe, malicious and ≈øcandalous.</p>
               <p>Treachery, Sir, is a crime it is impo≈ø≈øible to prove, po≈øitively, not to have been committed. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nece≈ø≈øary, in order to fix it, that ≈øome actual commi≈ø≈øion ≈øhould be proven; but as this has not been attempted, it is enough alone to overthrow the charge. But I beg leave to inform the Court, that when Congre≈øs appointed me to the command of a regiment, I con≈øidered it as the call of my country, that could admit of no refu≈øal. I reflected that ≈øome knowledge acquired by ≈øtudy, and the ≈øervice of the whole la≈øt war (during which I was in almo≈øt every ≈øiege and every action of con≈øequence) put me in a ≈øituation to be of ≈øome u≈øe to our army in its infant ≈øtate. My country, I thought, had a right to my ≈øervices, and to every advantage that could be derived from my experience. I therefore, without he≈øitation, re≈øigned an honourable and profitable employment I then held under the crown, to qualify my≈øelf for that offered to me by Congre≈øs, notwith≈øtanding it was not of one half the yearly value. I quitted die ≈øweets of a retirement I was fond of, the plea≈øures of dome≈øtic life, and the care of the education, and provi≈øion for a ri≈øing family, (both of which claimed my clo≈øe≈øt attention) for the toils, the hard≈øhips, and the extraordinary expences of war. Had this the appearance of treachery? And yet, for the≈øe, I have met with the ungracious return of tho≈øe cruel accu≈øations, though, ≈øurely, they were not the natural returns to ≈øuch a conduct. What farther promotion Congre≈øs were plea≈øed to confer upon me was totally un≈øolicited. I received it with gratitude, determined that my actions ≈øhould be the be≈øt proof of the ≈øen≈øe I had of the honour they had done me; nor have I been therein di≈øappointed. My country now reaps the ≈øolid advantages of my conduct, whil≈øt I am loaded with obloquy and abu≈øe. I forgive it, however, but I can never forget that the channels of ju≈øtice have been ≈øhut again≈øt me, and that for thirteen long, long months, I have been hung up to be ≈øtung by the envenomed tongue of malice, and pointed at by the finger of folly. But the ≈øentence of this Court will, I tru≈øt, place me once more in that honourable point of view, from which I have not de≈øerved to be removed, having been careful to ob≈øerve that maxim of Horace, <hi>Nil con≈øcire ≈øibi, nulla palle≈øcere culpa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How incapacity came to be a crime, unle≈øs in tho≈øe who made the appointments (for I mu≈øt repeat it, no office I have ever held, or now hold, under Congre≈øs, was ever ≈øolicited by me) or by what Article of War it is triable, I own I do not know. But this charge, with the others, has been made upon a ≈øuppo≈øition that I did not do every thing in my power to oppo≈øe the operations of the enemy in their advance again≈øt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øtiture of, the po≈øts in my charge; but it is in full proof to the Court that every thing was done, which pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dictated, and circum≈øtances would allow. It follows, that this is equally groundle≈øs with the others.</p>
               <p>The third charge is treachery again, under the ≈øame Article of War, to which, at I ob≈øerved before, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred, and grounded upon the fifth remark of the Committee, which is, "that as it had been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a Council of War on the 20th of June, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence claimed immediate attention, and Je≈ø≈øe Leavenworth ≈øwears not a ≈øtroke was ≈øtruck for the≈øe purpo≈øes; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea≈øed in number, and ≈øo continued, at a time when it ≈øhould have been abundantly increa≈øed, I am liable to be charged with treachery." I have already ≈øo fully refuted the≈øe matters in the charge for neglect, of duty, which is founded on the ≈øame allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that I think it unnece≈ø≈øary to take up the time of the Court with a repetition of the ≈øame arguments. But as it may, perhaps, appear odd, that the number of men actually employed on the≈øe duties differs ≈øo widely from the orderly book, I will here, once for all, account for it. I never approved of putting all orders into the book. Accidents frequently happen to the copies; de≈øerters carry them off to the enemy, who thereby become perfectly acquainted with every thing you are doing; to prevent which, as our works were ≈øo very incompleat, a great many of my orders were verbal. Yet I dare ≈øay, had the Committee attended to it, they would have found in the orderly book frequent orders for whole brigades (be≈øides the daily details) to parade at certain hours, and take their orders from their re≈øpective Brigadiers; and had they called upon any officer of the army, they would have been informed the≈øe brigades were ≈øent upon fatigue, repairing the old and con≈øtructing new works, which has been proven to the Court in the fulle≈øt manner.</p>
               <p>The fourth charge is, inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, treachery, and incapacity as a General again, founded on the ≈øeventh remark of the Committee; which is, "that as General St. Clair informed the Honourable Mr. Jay, that, at the time of holding the Council of War on the 5th of July, he knew it to be impo≈ø≈øible to defend the po≈øts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point as early as the 29th of June, the day that he ≈øent his ≈øon and private effects from Ticonderoga to Fort George, as a place of ≈øafety. That, being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken as effectual mea≈øures for the pre≈øervation of the public property, at lea≈øt equally with his own, claiming his earlie≈øt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016141_0045_0F9C8039032F75D0"/>
That on the 30th of June, the enemy being advanced to Three Mile Point, it is incredible that he did not then know they were in force. That it was his duty, <hi>at that point of time,</hi> to have finally determined to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire. That if the la≈øt re≈øolution was taken, and, from the ≈øending off his ≈øon and baggage the day before, there is the ≈øtronge≈øt pre≈øumption that this re≈øolution was <hi>then</hi> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to have ≈øent off the public ≈øtores, to de≈øtroy the works, and to evacuate the po≈øts without lo≈øing a moment of time; and that by deferring to retire till the la≈øt moment when he could po≈ø≈øibly retreat even with his effective troops, a moment when the ≈øick, ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing of the army mu≈øt be lo≈øt, be≈øides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, he appears to be chargeable with inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General." They appear to be again uncertain upon which charge to fix; but, to make ≈øure work of it, direct, as in the former ca≈øe, that I be pro≈øecuted for each, and upon the beforementioned Article of War, which certainly cannot be applied to treachery. Bnt let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what all this amounts to. The Committee ≈øay that becau≈øe I wrote to Mr. Jay, that on the 5th of July I knew it to be impo≈ø≈øible to defend the po≈øts with my numbers, it is natural to conclude that I knew it to be impo≈ø≈øible to defend them with my numbers ≈øo early as the 29th of June; for that they mu≈øt mean (if they mean any thing) by being "decided upon this point." But this is by no means the natural conclu≈øion; the natural and candid conclu≈øion is, that circum≈øtances might have changed betwixt the≈øe periods, and matters have come to my knowledge on or before the 5th of July, of which I was ignorant on the 29th of June, and which would fully ju≈øtify a change of mea≈øures. But the rea≈øon they conclude in that manner is, that on that day I ≈øent my ≈øon and private effects to Fort George, as a place of ≈øafety; and this, I find by a former part of their report, is al≈øo the information of Mr. Leavenworth upon oath. Now it happens that, although I ≈øent my ≈øon on that day to Fort George, I ≈øent no part of my baggage there then, or at any other time; and this very re≈øpectable witne≈øs, Mr. Leavenworth him≈øelf, ≈øwears that I did not, to his knowledge. The account he has given of Head-Quarters being ≈øtripped, as he calls it, is ≈øo ab≈øurd, that was there no other te≈øtimony to di≈øprove it, it would de≈øtroy it≈øelf. But his te≈øtimony before the Court contradicts, in almo≈øt every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, that the Committee ≈øay he has given to them. My ≈øon was a boy betwixt eleven and twelve years of age, who, on the information I have mentioned to have received from the Pre≈øident of Congre≈øs, that there was no probability of an active campaign<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I had taken with me, that I might ≈øuperintend his education. He remained with me at Ticonderoga until matters wore a gloomy a≈øpect, and was then ≈øent to Fort George, on his way to Albany, where he was put to ≈øchool. In ca≈øe of an attack, he would naturally have di≈øtre≈ø≈øed me, and divided my attention; and this is the dreadful affair of ≈øending my ≈øon, that has been ≈øo often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and upon which ≈øo many ba≈øe ungenerous comments have been made. I have proven beyond the po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a doubt, that I never ≈øent away ≈øix-pence worth of my private effects, and that I took the mo≈øt effectual mea≈øures for the pre≈øervation of the public property, great part of which was brought off, whil≈øt my own was left a prey to the enemy. But it ≈øeems it is incredible that the enemy ≈øhould be at the Three Mile Point, where ≈øome of their ve≈ø≈øels arrived on the 30th of June, and that I ≈øhould not <hi>then</hi> know whether they were in force or not. The Committee have again forgot that the enemy were water-borne, and that at this time they had not debarked. Had that occurred to them, they would not have thought the matter ≈øo very incredible. I believe they would have thought it very probable. But they ≈øeem to have viewed one ≈øide of the picture only. I have proven to the Court, that from the number of ≈øavages, who kept my parties at a di≈øtance from the ≈øhores of the Lake, it was impo≈ø≈øible to obtain any ≈øatisfactory account of the enemy's numbers until they were landed, which they began to be on the 30th of June, and with ≈øo much caution, as appears by my letter of that date to Gen. Schuyler, that I had very good rea≈øon to conclude they were not in force, and to exult in that con≈øideration too, hoping for an opportunity not only to have ≈øerved my country, but in ≈øome mea≈øure to have filled the expectations I knew the public had formed from me. The re≈øolution to retire was therefore not "<hi>then</hi> fully taken." But what idea of military movements mu≈øt the≈øe gentlemen have? who conclude that an enemy at three miles di≈øtance is not immediately upon you, or who imagine that works may be de≈øtroyed, and ≈øtores, ammunition and cannon, &amp;c. removed, under the eye of a ≈øuperior and collected force. Sir, had a retreat been attempted upon the enemy's landing at Three Mile Point, and the ≈øteps pur≈øued which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee have enumerated above, it is impo≈ø≈øible, in the nature of things, but the army mu≈øt have been cut off, or fallen pri≈øoners into their hands. But, by our putting a good face upon the matter, and ≈øhewing a determination to hold both po≈øts, they were induced to divide their force, in order to inve≈øt us and reduce us by the more ≈ølow, but certain, method of regular approach; not that this method was nece≈ø≈øary to them, for they might mo≈øt certainly have carried us by a≈ø≈øault at any time: But a≈ø≈øaults are frequently very bloody things! and on that circum≈øtance I chiefly depended for rendering my ≈ømall garri≈øon ≈øerviceable to their country. I was in hopes the enemy would a≈ø≈øault us, and ≈øome accounts that I had, that they were ≈øhort of provi≈øions, gave me ≈øome rea≈øon to expect it. I depended upon my troops‚ÄîI was per≈øwaded they were brave, and I believe they too had confidence in me. Every order and every advice I gave them pointed directly to that object‚Äî and I ≈øtill believe that, had they attempted it, we ≈øhould have given ≈øo good an account of them, that the conque≈øt of Ticonderoga would have terminated the operations of that campaign‚Äîbut conquered it would have been, after all our exertions. Every letter I have wrote holds up the ≈øame idea, and I always ≈øpeak of an attack as contra-di≈øtingui≈øhed from a ≈øiege; and the character of the General I was oppo≈øed to gave me rea≈øon to expect ≈øomething by a≈ø≈øault or ≈øurprize. I mentioned to Congre≈øs, ≈øo early as the 25th of June, the great deficiencies in troops and provi≈øion, and the probability of my being obliged from the≈øe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances to evacuate. The moment I was informed, with any tolerable degree of certainty, of their numbers, which I was not until the 3d of July from a pri≈øoner and ≈øome de≈øerters (their information was confirmed by a ≈øpy I ≈øent into their camp the 3d and returned the 5th) and ≈øaw that they meant a regular ≈øiege, I was certain the defending the po≈øts effectually was impo≈ø≈øible. The moment, however, which I cho≈øe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, as it was the only one was ever in my power to chu≈øe, ≈øo it was almo≈øt the only one after the enemy's landing at Three Mile Point in which the retreat could have been effected. I have fully proven that the ≈øick were not left behind nor lo≈øt, that great part of the cannon, all the ammunition, the baggage and tents of the army, the ho≈øpital ≈øtores and part of the provi≈øion, were removed from Ticonderoga‚Äîas much as could at once have been removed at any prior time. Every boat was loaded. I think I have proven it to have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary

and well conducted, and that the confu≈øion, occa≈øioned principally by the burning of General Fermoy's hou≈øe, and his not circulating the orders to his brigade in proper time, was ≈øoon remedied.‚ÄîI beg the Court to reflect one moment upon what was to be done, and now ≈øhort the time to do it in!‚Äîfor, though the evacuation was re≈øolved on about three o'clock in the afternoon, we could not begin to carry it into execution until night came on, the enemy being in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a high hill on the oppo≈øite ≈øide of the Lake, from whence they could ≈øee our every movement,‚Äîthat it was the ≈øea≈øon when the nights are at the very ≈øhorte≈øt, and that it was moreover moon-light,‚Äîand that the nece≈ø≈øity of keeping the matter a ≈øecret, until the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evacuation, prevented any preparatory ≈øteps being taken to expedite the bu≈øine≈øs, and they will be of the opinion that more was never done, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> in equal time; and if, in the different embarkations, ≈øome irregularities did happen, when every circum≈øtance is taken in‚Äîthe ≈øuddenne≈øs of the thing‚Äîthe di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition every man would naturally have to ≈øave perhaps his little all‚Äîthe confu≈øion the night alone is apt to occa≈øion‚Äîthe di≈øtance every thing had to be carried, and their variety, the candid mind will be more apt to wonder that any order could be pre≈øerved, than that ≈øome irregularities ≈øupervened. On this occa≈øion it would be great inju≈øtice not to acknowledge, that the officers were in general diligent and attentive, and the men ≈øilent and obedient to a wonder; the continental troops I mean; for the militia, Bellows's and Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon's regiments excepted, held a very different conduct. Colonel Bellows exerted him≈øelf greatly in removing the cannon from the lines and embarking them, which he effected, notwith≈øtanding ≈øome difficulties that, I have ≈øince heard, were thrown in his way by an officer of the artillery. I was in a very particular manner obliged to General Poor, Colonel Long, Colonel Hay, and Colonel Stevens, to who≈øe pains and a≈ø≈øiduity it was chiefly owing that ≈øo much of the public property was taken off. It is true, however, the greate≈øt part of it fell afterwards into the enemy's hands at Skeen≈øborough, but not from any fault of mine. That was the only place to which they could have been removed; and had not my march been delayed, as has been ≈øhewn, by Colonel Warner's unfortunately taking upon him≈øelf to judge of and di≈øobey his orders, I ≈øhould have arrived at Skeen≈øborough time enough to have protected the ≈øtores, and probably to have cut off that party of the enemy which pur≈øued them. I agree perfectly with the Committee, that the po≈øts, as the proper number of men for their defence were not ≈øent to them, ≈øhould have been evacuated earlier. But I did my duty. I apprized both Congre≈øs and General Schuyler of my ≈øituation, and the probable con≈øequences; and from one or other of them, if it was thought proper to evacuate the po≈øts, my orders were to come<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> From the≈øe circum≈øtances, it appears that I have not been guilty of treachery or incapacity. But it is truly ≈øurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that gentlemen, who had the peru≈øal of my letters to General Schuyler, ≈øhould have alledged inattention to the progre≈øs of the enemy, as in every one of them, viz. tho≈øe of the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1≈øt, 2d and 3d of July, I make particular mention of their progre≈øs, and the ≈øteps taken to obtain a knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>The fifth and la≈øt charge is, "Shamefully abandoning the po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in my charge," and this is directed to be founded upon the ≈øeventh remark, which has ju≈øt been under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration. The puni≈øhment of this crime, Sir, is death, without alternative. No pre≈øumptive evidence, therefore, can be admitted, no con≈øtruction can be allowed, to fix it; but the fact mu≈øt be proven in the cleare≈øt and mo≈øt po≈øitive manner. But in the remark of the Committee referred to, I do not find a ≈øingle circum≈øtance that relates to it, except a loo≈øe a≈ø≈øertion, for which I am bold to ≈øay they had no warrant either from rea≈øon or evidence. It is this: "Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wi≈øhes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too exten≈øive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if ≈øuch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehen≈øible point of view; as, the weakne≈øs of his defence being more obvious, his retreat ≈øhould have been earlier determined upon and made." I have proven by General Gates, General Schuyler, General Poor, and Colonels Baldwin and Ko≈øeiu≈øzko, the engineers, and a number of other witne≈ø≈øes, that the works were much too exten≈øive for my numbers; by General Gates, that the numbers were not one fourth of what he demanded, and Congre≈øs had voted, at a time he did not expect the enemy would have come on with 10 or 11,000 men, and not much more than a fifth of what he would have demanded in that ca≈øe, exclu≈øive of the militia, which he had powers to call for, in any number he thought proper; by General Schuyler and General Poor, that they would at lea≈øt have demanded 10,000 good troops; by Major Hull's certificate, and the returns of arms from the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers commanding regiments, that many of the men were very badly armed. And, with the Committee's good leave, although the weakne≈øs of my defence was certainly from the≈øe circum≈øtances the more obvious, yet, as proper notice thereof was in due time given both to Congre≈øs and General Schuyler, neither of whom gave any directions about the matter, and I had no power of my≈øelf to order the evacuation until the la≈øt extremity, I cannot thereby be placed in a point of view reprehen≈øible in any degree what≈øoever. As the proof here fails entirely, the charge mu≈øt fail with it. But, Sir, the po≈øts were not ≈øhamefully abandoned. The retreat was undertaken upon the ju≈øte≈øt principles, and, I hope the Court will bear with me when I ≈øay, upon the mo≈øt honourable and ingenuous motives; the mea≈øures to effect it were taken with judgment; the orders were pertinent and clear; and the whole, notwith≈øtanding ≈øome cro≈øs accidents, which it was not po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible to fore≈øee, was conducted with a degree of art, that reflects ≈øome credit upon both the General and the troops. I need not tell this honourable Court that a retreat, with an inferior army, from before a ≈øuperior one, is perhaps the mo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> delicate and dangerous undertaking in the whole circle of military operations, and that it never will be effected without prudence, fortitude and ≈øecrecy. I hope I have ≈øatisfied the Court, that I could not order the evacuation until the la≈øt moment, when I ≈øaw no alternative betwixt that and the certain lo≈øs of the army. I think I have proven that that moment was arrived, as one day more would probably have compleated the inve≈øtment of the po≈øts, and then it would have been impo≈ø≈øible. I have proven that my motive was not to avoid the enemy, but to ≈øave the army, and by removing them to a place where rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements could reach them, to make them ≈øerve as the ba≈øis of a force ≈øufficient to cover the country, and check the progre≈øs of the enemy; and this I did with the certainty of a lo≈øs of reputation, a price few people are willing to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

of the 14th of July, proves, that I fore≈øaw the events that would probably happen, and which mu≈øt have had ≈øome effect upon my determinations.</p>
               <p>Indeed, from the knowledge I had of the country through which General Burgoyne had to advance,‚Äîthe difficulties I knew he would be put to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The event ju≈øtified my conjecture, but attended with con≈øequences beyond my mo≈øt ≈øanguine expectations. A fatal blow given to the power and in≈øolence of Great-Britain, a whole army pri≈øoners, and the reputation of the arms of America high in every civilized part of the world! But what would have been the con≈øequences had not that ≈øtep been taken, and my army had been cut to pieces or made pri≈øoners? Di≈øgrace would have been brought upon our arms and our coun≈øels,‚Äîfear and di≈ømay would have ≈øeized upon the inhabitants, from the fal≈øe opinion that had been formed of the ≈øtrength of the≈øe po≈øts,‚Äîwringing grief and moping melancholy would have filled the now chearful habitations of tho≈øe who≈øe deare≈øt connections were in that army,‚Äîand a lawle≈øs ho≈øt of ru≈ø≈øians, ≈øet loo≈øe from every ≈øocial tie, would have roam'd at liberty through the defencele≈øs country, whil≈øt bands of ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages would have carried havoc, deva≈øtation and terror before them! Great part of the ≈øtate of New-York mu≈øt have ≈øubmitted to the conqueror, and in it he would have found the means to enable him to pro≈øecute his ≈øucce≈øs. He would have been able effectually to have co-operated with General Howe, and would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have ≈øoon been in the ≈øame country with him‚Äîthat country, where our illu≈øtrious General, with an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force, made ≈øo glorious a ≈øtand, but who mu≈øt have been obliged to retire if both armies came upon him at once, or he might have been forced, perhaps, to a general and deci≈øive action in unfavourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, whereby the hopes, the now well-founded hopes of America, of liberty, peace and ≈øafety, might have been cut off for ever. Every con≈øideration ≈øerves to prove the propriety of the retreat, that I could not undertake it ≈øooner, and that had it been delayed longer it had been delayed too long. But it may ju≈øtly be matter of wonder why Congre≈øs, who, ≈øo early as the twenty-ninth of April, declared their opinion, as appears by the re≈øolve of that date, which has been read, that unle≈øs certain mea≈øures were pur≈øued by the ea≈øtern ≈øtates for compleating and forwarding without delay the troops ordered for that ≈øervice, the important po≈øts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence mu≈øt inevitably be lo≈øt, and who mu≈øt have known from the returns, if it can be ≈øuppo≈øed they knew through no other channel, that no ≈øuch, mea≈øures had been pur≈øued, nor even any taken to replace the corps of militia who≈øe times of ≈øervice had expired, and had left the po≈øts, it may be ju≈øtly matter of wonder, I ≈øay, that they ≈øhould not have ordered the evacuation, in proper time to have ≈øaved every article of public property. It has been proved that my numbers were greatly inadequate to the defence of the po≈øts. But I mu≈øt acknowledge a mi≈øtake I made with re≈øpect to the≈øe numbers. At the Council of War held on the 5th of July, I ≈øtated them at 2089 rank and file, fit for duty; to which ≈øhould have been added 457 of tho≈øe returned on command, and who were within the garri≈øon, which brings them up to 2546. I took the account from the general return, and did not recollect that the regiments had a cu≈øtom of returning men on particular duties in camp as on command, nor was this noted at the foot of die general return. It was a mi≈øtake, but not ≈øuch a one as would have made any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, had it not happened. It has been proven by General Schuyler, that, had the garri≈øon held out, he could not have rai≈øed the ≈øiege, as he had not been able to collect a ≈øufficient force, and that, if a ≈øufficient force had been collected, the ≈øiege could not have been rai≈øed for want of ball. But, had the po≈øts been eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated ≈øooner, I am per≈øwaded there would have no little been ≈øaid about the va≈øt numbers of militia that would have come to my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, had the po≈øts been held longer; and the≈øe reports would have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and added no little to the opprobrium under which I ≈øhould have lain. I am, however, of the ≈øame opinion with my late worthy friend Mr. Living≈øton, then a Member of Congre≈øs, who u≈øed to ≈øay‚Äîthat, had I left Ticonderoga one week ≈øooner, I ≈øhould certainly have been hanged, and probably without the ceremony of a court-martial. But, Sir, if it is ≈øhameful for an inferior army to retreat before a ≈øuperior one, we mu≈øt begin and unlearn what we have been ≈øpending years in reading to acquire; and hi≈øtory, in≈øtead of being a faithful guide to the unexperienced, has been hanging out fal≈øe lights for many centuries, to mi≈ølead the unwary traveller. According to this doctrine, ≈øome of the mo≈øt famous actions of antiquity, and which we have been taught to con≈øider as ma≈øter-pieces of ≈økill, were ≈øhameful retreats, and founded in cowardice, treachery or incapacity. The famous retreat of Brafidas, with his Lacedemonians‚Äîthe retreat of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øul Attilius Colatinus, among≈øt the Romans‚ÄîMar≈øhal Banier, among≈øt the Sweedes‚ÄîMar≈øhal Bellei≈øle, among≈øt the French‚Äîand, to add to the catalogue one of our times, that of his Excellency General Wa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington from New-York‚Äîwere all ≈øhamefully abandoning po≈øts.

               <p>I have admitted Mr. Yancey's return of the 20th of June, which ≈øtates that there was on hand at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and its dependencies at that time 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; on which the Committee, having taken an e≈øtimate of Mr. Avery's (which ≈øtates that 1400 barrels of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:016141_0048_0F9C803AE31CDC70"/>
flour, and 661 barrels of beef, would afford ≈øufficient provi≈øion in flour for 4000 men for 66 days, and in beef for 75) for a foundation conclude, that there did on the 4th of July remain, or ought to be, if provi≈øions had been properly and regularly i≈ø≈øued, then remaining, 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; which, they ≈øay, was a magazine ≈øufficient to afford <hi>full allowance</hi> of provi≈øion to 5659 men of all ranks for 52 days in flour, and 32 days in beef and pork.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Avery's ≈øtatement is egregiou≈øly wrong; 1400 barrels of flour, averaging them at 200 lbs. and 651 barrels of beef, averaging them at 212 lbs. ≈øuppo≈øing the ration to be a pound of each, will afford 4000 rations of flour for 70 days, and of beef for 35 days only. But in 4000 men there will be 322 officers (I have taken the proportionate number of officers to the troops at Ticonderoga as the foundation) who, on an average, are entitled to draw three rations, and con≈øequently for 4000 men, who have that proportion of officers, 4644 rations mu≈øt be i≈ø≈øued daily, which the ≈øtock above-mentioned would afford no longer than 60 days of flour, and 30 days of meat.</p>
               <p>But the ration at Ticonderoga was a pound and a half of flour, and a pound of fle≈øh (beef or pork) the addition having been made in lieu of vegetables and other articles, to which the ≈øoldier was entitled, but which the Commi≈ø≈øary could not furni≈øh. This Mr. Avery mu≈øt have been acquainted with, and ≈øhould have taken into the account; and this reduces the magazine to 40 days flour in≈øtead of 66, and 30 days meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of 75. As the≈øe are matters in which there is not the lea≈øt intricacy, depending upon the mo≈øt ≈øimple calculation, the Committee ≈øhould certainly have ≈øatisfied them≈øelves Mr. Avery's e≈øtimate was right, before they adopted it as a principle: As the principle is fal≈øe, all the ≈øuper≈øtructure they have rai≈øed upon it falls to the ground. But the quantity is ≈øtill over-rated; for it is certain, that in the divi≈øion and di≈øtribution of provi≈øion they ≈øuffer con≈øiderable wa≈øte.‚ÄîI believe an allowance of five <hi>per cent.</hi> is made to the Commi≈ø≈øaries on that account, therefore five <hi>per cent.</hi> is to be deducted from the whole quantity, viz.

Let us ≈øee what light a little arithmetic will throw upon this matter.</p>

and the above quantities of flour and beef, divided by 7000 for the beef, and 10,500 for the flour (one half mu≈øt be added for the half-pound) leaves of flour for twenty-nine days, and of beef for nineteen nearly; an ample provi≈øion for a ≈øiege! Neither is this calculation made upon a liberal plan, with re≈øpect to Ticonderoga, but a very narrow one, indeed a very narrow one any where, as neither the ho≈øpital, the ≈øailors, the batteau-men, or any followers of the army are taken into the account; nor any notice taken of the inhabitants who

had been driven from their hou≈øes, and were nece≈ø≈øarily furni≈øhed with provi≈øions at that po≈øt, to enable them to reach the inhabited parts of the country; neither is there any notice taken of the real weight of the barrels, which, from the manner of packing them, fall greatly ≈øhort, both flour and meat, of what I have calculated upon. I have proved by General Schuyler that the barrels of meat are generally about 170 pounds, which would reduce that article to about ten days provi≈øion. I have never pretended, for all this, that the want of provi≈øion obliged me to evacuate the po≈øts, but the low ≈øtate of the magazines, and the little pro≈øpect which it has been proven I had of an effectual ≈øupply, prevented me from calling in the militia: The Court will judge if it would not have been madne≈øs to have done it in the≈øe circum≈øtances, and they will plea≈øe to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that it is in proof, that although ≈øome provi≈øion was forwarded from Fort George after the 20th of June, the greate≈øt part of it was ≈øent back, the enemy having cut off the communication betwixt Ticonderoga and the landing previous to its arrival. I grant that an officer commanding at a po≈øt is in ≈øome mea≈øure re≈øpon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the expenditure of the provi≈øion; and I am bold to ≈øay, that during my command, as far as it depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, provi≈øion was i≈ø≈øued with great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>conomy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery ≈øays that he did not know what quantity of provi≈øion was on hand at Ticonderoga on the 13th of June, the time I took the command there, but that on the 15th or 16th of June I wrote to him that there was provi≈øion at the po≈øts for ≈øeven weeks. From his manner of mentioning this, one would imagine I had wrote merely for his information, and all was well; but the fact is, and he has owned it, though with apparent reluctance, that the de≈øign of my letter to him was, to complain of the ≈ømall quantity of provi≈øion, and pre≈øs a further ≈øupply in a decent, at the ≈øame time the ≈øtronge≈øt manner, by putting him in mind of the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences to him≈øelf that might attend a failure. This letter he never thought proper to an≈øwer, or give me the lea≈øt ≈øatisfaction whether I might expect ≈øupplies or not. It has been proven that the magazine at Albany was empty, and part of the provi≈øion that had been forwarded to Still Water, on its way to Ticonderoga, was carried back for the ≈øupply of that po≈øt. Upon my way from Albany to Ticonderoga I found the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine at Fort Edward in the ≈øame ca≈øe, and the provi≈øion that had been forwarded from thence to Fort George bringing back to ≈øupply the troops at that po≈øt; as appears by my letter to General Schuyler of the 10th of June, from Fort George. Mr. Yancey indeed ≈øays, he had heard of ≈øalt provi≈øion having been ≈øent from Bennington to St. Coak, but is ignorant of the quantity, but does not pretend to ≈øay there was any magazine from which the po≈øts at Ticonderoga could have been ≈øupplied. That very provi≈øion ≈øent from Still Water to Albany was part of that which came from Bennington; but why ≈øhould I multiply words, Mr. Avery acknowledges he was deceived by the people he had employed to purcha≈øe provi≈øion, "they did not collect the quantity he expected." It is true, ≈øome cattle arrived at Ticonderoga the day before the evacuation, I believe about forty,‚Äîthey arrived too late to be of any u≈øe in the garri≈øon, but they were of great u≈øe on the retreat.</p>
               <p>I have ≈øaid the ration at Ticonderoga was a pound and a half of bread and a pound of beef or pork, but I am not able to prove it. The march of a part of the army has deprived me of ≈øeveral witne≈ø≈øes I intended to have examined. I know it, however, to have been the ca≈øe. The Commi≈ø≈øaries who≈øe bu≈øine≈øs it was to be perfectly acquainted with what was i≈ø≈øued as a ration, know nothing about the matter, neither Principal nor Deputy. Mr. Avery knows nothing about it, for he was at Albany; Mr. Yancey knows nothing about it, for he was purcha≈øing cattle; and Mr. Boyer, the I≈ø≈øuing Commi≈ø≈øary on the ground, is not certain what it was: He ≈øays, he believes it to have been a pound of bread and a pound of beef, or three-quarters of a pound of pork. He acknowledges the men did not receive the other component parts of a ration. They got briefs for them. He likewi≈øe acknowledges, that during the time he was at the po≈øt the ≈øame quantity of bread and meat war i≈ø≈øued as a ration, that had been cu≈øtomary before and at the time he came into office. Now it is certain that a pound of bread and a pound of beef, or three-quarters of a pound of pork, is not a ≈øufficient allowance for a ≈øoldier, e≈øpecially when, as was the ca≈øe at Ticonderoga, he is kept con≈øtantly to hard labour; his brief he cannot eat; and it is al≈øo certain that the Commi≈ø≈øaries did not furni≈øh them with vegetables and the other ≈ømall articles; it is therefore probable that the quantity of bread and meat was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed. But in June, 1776, in Canada, General Sullivan ordered that, where milk could not be procured, the troops ≈øhould have a pound and a half of beef or eighteen ounces of pork <hi>per diem,</hi> be≈øides mola≈ø≈øes, rice, Indian meal and pea≈øe; and this continued to be the allowance in meat until ≈øome time after General Gates took the command, who altered it from a pound and a half of beef, or eighteen ounces of pork, to a pound of either, and added half a pound to the quantity of bread; and this alteration was induced, chiefly, by the prevalence of bilious complaints, which it was expected le≈ø≈øening the quantity of animal and increa≈øing the quantity of vegetable food would help to abate: That continued to be the ration at the≈øe po≈øts until the evacuation, ≈øome temporary alterations excepted, when the troops were ≈øupplied with vegetables. And this rea≈øoning is confirmed by General Wayne's orderly book, by which it appears, that on the 30th of December he reduced the quantity of flour to one pound and a quarter, and of meat to one pound, vegetables being then i≈ø≈øued by the Commi≈ø≈øary, agreeable to the re≈øolve of Congre≈øs of the 28th of December, 1776; and, doubtle≈øs, when the≈øe were expended, the ration returned to its former ≈øtandard.</p>

               <p>The attention of the Court has been a good deal taken up with a quantity of tallow that was in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Mr. Leavenworth. He ≈øays, I think, that he informed me of it on the 26th of June, and it may be that he did ≈øo; but as I knew Leavenworth to be a private per≈øon, and as I had no official account of any tallow, I concluded it was altogether a private affair, ≈øome money-making job betwixt him and the Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary. Reflecting, however, on the quantity, which was ≈øurprizingly great, 34,345 pounds, and finding it was public property, I determined to have ≈øent it to Fort George by the fir≈øt opportunity; but before any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered, that communication was cut off. Mr. Yancey acknowledges he had never made any return of this tallow, tho' it mu≈øt have been great part of a year on hand. If he had, I ≈øhould not have ≈øuffered it to remain there; tho' it might perhaps have been worked up at that place more to his profit, had he been allowed to employ ≈øoldiers, which ≈øeems to have been his expectation. As he never did make any return of it, and the only account I ever had was from a private per≈øon, a very ≈øhort time before the communication with Fort George was ≈øtopped, the lo≈øs of it is ju≈øtly chargeable to his negligence, and he ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpon≈øible for it.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond remark of the Committee is a mi≈ørepre≈øentation of my letter to General Schuyler of the 24th of June. They ≈øay I was on that day informed by my ≈øcouts that the enemy were very numerous, and on the next wrote to Congre≈øs that I was not able to di≈øcover whether the enemy were in force or not. Let the letter ≈øpeak for it≈øelf. "Serjeant Heath, who I ≈øent down the Lake to make di≈øcoveries, returned la≈øt night, and informs me that, from a place near the mouth of Otter-Creek, he de≈øcried an encampment of the enemy on both ≈øides of Gilliland's Creek; that, from the appearance and the extent, <hi>he thinks</hi> it mu≈øt contain a great body of men; and that a great many ≈ømokes aro≈øe at a di≈øtance back, which he ≈øuppo≈øes was from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments of the Indians;" and again, "that one of the inhabitants, in whom he could place confidence, informed him the <hi>Indians were very numerous</hi>;" and in another place, "that another inhabitant informed him, that ≈øome of the enemy's troops had ≈øaid their whole army was there," that is, at Gilliland's Creek. Now, Sir, is there any thing in all this like po≈øitive intelligence that the enemy were <hi>very numerous?</hi> No, Sir, there is not. The encampment was ≈øeen from a very con≈øiderable di≈øtance, acro≈øs the Lake, and the ≈øerjeant <hi>thinks</hi> that, from the <hi>appearance</hi> of it, it might contain a great body of men. An inhabitant, indeed, <hi>told</hi> him the <hi>Indians</hi> were very numerous. Four or five hundred, Sir, is a large body of Indians, and what the inhabitants any where would call very numerous, but ten times that number is not a great body of troops; and for aught I knew, and had rea≈øon to believe, the whole of their army left in Canada did not amount to that number. There was therefore no incon≈øi≈øtency in my writing to Congre≈øs on the 25th of June, that I was not able to di≈øcover whether the enemy were in force or not, notwith≈øtanding the information I received by my ≈øcouts on the 24th. But, in the ≈øame letter, I gave General Schuyler my rea≈øons for not believing that there was a great body of men in that encampment (of which the Committee do not think proper to take any notice) viz. that it was improbable the enemy would wa≈øte their time at ≈øuch a di≈øtance from the object again≈øt which they were to act, in a country that afforded them nothing (the inhabitants had all left that ≈øide of the Lake the year before) and they had been there four or five days; and I thought the ground, on which Heath de≈øcribed the encampment to be, incapable of containing a great number of men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was more probable that it was a party only ≈øent to amu≈øe, and to give confidence to the ≈øavages. Had I given Congre≈øs other information than I did on the 25th of June, it had been a fal≈øhood.</p>
               <p>I have now got through the whole of this matter, and it clearly appears there is not the ≈ømalle≈øt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for all, or any of the charges again≈øt me.‚ÄîOn the contrary, it has been proven beyond the po≈ø≈øibility of a doubt, that I did every thing which my duty required, and that circum≈øtances would allow. I have therefore good rea≈øon to expect the deci≈øion of this Court in my favour. Yet I ≈øtill ≈øhall have it to regret, that the accu≈øations have ≈øpread far and wide, and been greedily ≈øwallowed for truth, whil≈øt few, comparatively very few, will ever hear of the honourable acquittal.</p>
               <p>If in the cour≈øe of this bu≈øine≈øs I have appeared with confidence, I hope I have not with arrogance; and though I have examined the report of the Committee of Congre≈øs with freedom, I have not forgot to do it with decency. No man can have a higher ≈øen≈øe than I have of the re≈øpect in which Congre≈øs ought to be held; but a dignified conduct can alone ≈øecure re≈øpect to any man, or body of men. That conduct this Congre≈øs will, no doubt, ever pre≈øerve. But ≈øhould ≈øome future Congre≈øs depart from the great bu≈øine≈øs of watching over the affair of a whole continent, to hunt down an individual‚Äî≈øhould factions ari≈øe among≈øt them, and local intere≈øts take place of the general intere≈øt‚Äî≈øhould their time be wa≈øted in frivolous and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs di≈øputes, where the object is a mere boyi≈øh de≈øire of victory, whil≈øt the public ≈øervice ≈øtands ≈øtill, and its hone≈øt ≈øervants tired out with tedious and expen≈øive waiting‚Äîand ≈øhould they create offices with great ≈øalaries, where tho≈øe who hold them may rob the public at their plea≈øure, without a po≈ø≈øibility of detection, and cabal among≈øt them≈øelves for the di≈øpo≈øal of them‚Äîand ≈øhould they pa≈øs re≈øolves, ridiculous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves and impo≈ø≈øible to be carried into execution‚Äîthen will Congre≈øs ≈øink into contempt, nor will all the importance they may endeavour to a≈ø≈øume, nor the fa≈øtidious pomp they may di≈øplay, ≈øupport them, and then will the misfortunes of America begin.</p>
