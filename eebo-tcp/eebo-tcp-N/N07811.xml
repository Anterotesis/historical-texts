            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And of the children of Iſſachar, which were men that had underſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>CCORDING to the original conſtitution of the Hebrew polity, "each tribe was under it's own proper and diſtinct government; and order'd it's affairs by it's own princes, heads of families, elders and courts". At the ſame time, there was a union of all the tribes, the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation had a right to meet together, either perſonally or by their repreſentatives, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the common good and the proſperity of the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009964_0005_0F7B3C608BB55850"/>After the death of Saul there ſeems to have been a breach in this general union. The tribe of Judah ſet up David to be king, the other tribes adhered to Iſhboſheth the ſon of Saul. Iſhboſheth being dead, the other tribes, ſenſible how prejudicial ſuch a diſunion was to their common intereſt, by mutual conſent made David king over all Iſrael. This was done, it's like, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the ſtates from each province, or an aſſembly of the heads of each tribe.</p>
            <p>David had long before I been anointed, by a ſpecial commiſſion from God, to be king of Iſrael. This was only an intimation from heaven of what would certainly take place. Neither David nor Saul before him claimed any authority in virtue of this divine appointment, until they were elected by the people, and ſolemnly inaugurated in their high office.</p>
            <p>Among others, who came to Hebron to make David king, were the children of Iſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char, who appeared by the heads of the tribe; of theſe it is particularly ſaid, they "were men that had underſtanding of the times, to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009964_0006_0F7B3C613B024708"/>
know what Iſrael ought to do, they were in number two hundred, and all their brethren were at their commandment."</p>
            <p>It is an excellent character that is given of the heads of Iſſachar, and it was a ſingular favor to this tribe, that they had ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who were able to guide them at this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſeaſon.—You are told the good effect of their wiſdom and prudence, there was an entire union between them and the reſt of the community. They who were in government were poſſeſſed of talents which qualified them for their truſt, and their brethren were ſo ſatisfied of their prudence and integrity, that they repoſed an entire confidence in them, and ſubmitted to their authority without murmuring or oppoſition.</p>
            <p>You have here the model of a happy, ſtate: What a proſpect of peace and laſting proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, where rulers are wiſe and good, and the people are quiet and ſubmiſſive!</p>
            <p>What I propoſe in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009964_0007_0F7B3C63D6118170"/>Firſt, To conſider the character of a good ruler as it is drawn in the text. And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To point out the duty of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their rulers.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that preſents itſelf to our conſideration, is the character of a good ruler. And in order to determine when men are qualified to govern, it is neceſſary to take a general view of the great end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is not to be ſuppoſed that mankind would reſign their natural freedom only for the ſake of pomp and appearance, much leſs to gratify the pride and avarice of thoſe they place in authority over them. The only rational view they can have is the common good. If men could ſubſiſt as well in a ſtate of independency and abſolute liberty, there is nothing in reaſon or conſcience to oblige them to ſubjection. The neceſſity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ariſes wholly from the diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which, in the preſent imperfect ſtate of human nature, would be the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of unlimited freedom. This neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009964_0008_0F7B3C649911C538"/>
is ſo apparent that the moſt ſavage and barbarous of mankind have been convinced of it; and wherever they have formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſociety, have erected ſome kind of government. In this ſenſe all power is from God, as that conſtitution, which makes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neceſſary, originates with him who is the author of nature; and ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is as certain an intimation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, as an expreſs revelation. There is no poſitive appointment or command; we argue the deſign of heaven that there ſhould be civil government, becauſe it is apparently for the advantage of mankind. "He is the miniſter of God to thee for good".</p>
            <p>If the public good is the great, the only end of magiſtracy; it follows that they only are worthy to be entruſted with the powers of government, who know what the public intereſt is, and are capable of advancing it. The heads of every community ſhould, like the heads of Iſſachar, "have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009964_0009_0F7B3C65002DEDD0"/>This character ſuppoſes, that rulers have a good degree of wiſdom and knowlege—That they are particularly acquainted with the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country they are called to govern— That they are men of virtue and religion— And that they have prudence to conduct af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in ſeaſons that are critical and alarming.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Wiſdom and knowledge are very neceſſary qualifications of a public ruler. The ends of government will not be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by committing the adminiſtration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to one or more men, but by committing it to thoſe who are capable of diſcharging the truſt repoſed in them. The meaneſt office requires talents ſuited to that office, but when men are put in places of extenſive authority, they ought to have extenſive abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom and knowlege are ſo neceſſary for every one who has a ſhare in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that nothing can ſupply their place. The experience of all ages evidences the juſtice of that exclamation of king Solomon. "Wo to thee, O land, when thy king is a child!" If weak or ignorant men are entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power, what can you expect but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009964_0010_0F7B3C6669B4C9D0"/>
univerſal confuſion! If men were not wiſe before, they are not like to become wiſe by being placed in a ſtation of eminence. Such exaltation will rather make them giddy and vain, and deprive them of the little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had before.</p>
            <p>If ſuch magiſtrates mean ever ſo well, yet they know not how to execute their good purpoſes, and their adminiſtration is like to be a ſeries of the moſt fatal errors. If they depend on others to manage the affairs of government, the event will not be better. Men of weak minds can ſeldom bear the checks and counſels of plain honeſt men, who know not how to diſguiſe the truth, or to ſpeak that which they do not think in their hearts. Paraſites and flatterers eaſily gain their favor, who will ſooth their vanity, and accommodate themſelves to their foibles. And the ſtate of ſuch a people is often worſe than where rulers are men of capacity, even tho' they are very deficient in their principles of action.</p>
            <p>Bad men who can look to conſequences are often under the reſtraint of fear, where
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009964_0011_0F7B3C66DDCBEE00"/>
they have no other. They are aware of danger from the reſentment of an injured people, if they abuſe their power. But men without knowlege are devoid of ſuch fears; and they who have the management of them endeavour artfully to conceal their own ſhare in the public miſconduct, and make uſe of the power with which they are veſted to gratify their baſe and ſordid paſſions, to the ruin of the community, and often of thoſe who veſted them with it.</p>
            <p>It is not every kind of genius or of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege that qualifies a man to govern. Many a one has made a ſhining figure as a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or mathematician, who has had no turn for politics, and been intirely ignorant of the art of governing. It is frequently the caſe, that great ſcholars have no acquaintance with men, than which no branch of knowlege is of greater importance in a public ruler. It is neceſſary to know the various tempers of thoſe he has to govern, to penetrate their particular views and intereſts, and even their foibles and paſſions, that he may make them all ſubſervient to the public good. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſcern their different talents and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009964_0012_0F7B3C6801A036C8"/>
that he may know whom to put into places of profit and truſt, and may employ thoſe who are fit to be employed.</p>
            <p>Is a ruler called to act the part of a legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator? What need of a ſound and exact judgment, that the laws he makes may be good and wholeſome, accommodated to the temper and circumſtances of the people for whom they are made; and that while he endeavors to reſtrain vice and licentiouſneſs, he may not unreaſonably infringe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the community?</p>
            <p>When laws are made, it requires no ſmall degree of underſtanding and of ſtudy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their true ſpirit, to know how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them in every caſe that occurs, and to execute them with prudence and impartiality.</p>
            <p>Where government ſubſiſts, there muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be burthens laid on the people to defray the charges of it. There is nothing that affects men more than when you touch their intereſt; people in general find it hard to procure the conveniencies of life; nothing will ſooner alienate their minds from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009964_0013_0F7B3C68BAE37080"/>
than when rulers needleſly deprive them of that which they have dearly earn'd, and wantonly diſſipate the public treaſures. Rulers ought ever to proceed in this part of their duty with caution and prudence, that people may ſee the taxes they impoſe are not to gratify their pride, their avarice, or any other paſſion; not to carry on any private deſign; but that they are neceſſary for the ſupport of government and the exigencies of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>Every large community is conſtituted of a number of little ſocieties, in which there will be different branches of buſineſs. Theſe, whatever pains are taken to prevent it, will have their different connections, and form ſeparate intereſts; it is vaſtly difficult for thoſe who govern, to keep the balance ſo exactly poiz'd that neither part may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; but much more, to prevent jealouſies and ſuſpicions that things are carried by favor and affection.</p>
            <p>The rulers of a people are ſeldom ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to pleaſe all who are under their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: They have often perſonal enemies;

or crafty and ambitious men find fault with government becauſe they are not in place: They had need be wiſe as ſerpents as well as harmleſs as doves to counterwork the machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of ſuch men, to give no occaſion of offence to thoſe who ſeek occaſion, or to prevent the bad effect of the miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they will induſtriouſly ſpread.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every ſtate has it's neighbours, who watch for a favorable opportunity to encroach on it's territories, or to gain ſome other advantage.

In theſe caſes there is need of a thoro' acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance both with their ſtrength and our own; that we may not by an ill-timed oppoſition expoſe ourſelves to greater injuries, or by mean ſubmiſſions encourage them to deſpiſe and abuſe us.</p>
            <p>A ruler who ſuitably attends to the great end of government muſt look beyond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances, and carefully conſider the tendency and conference of every meaſure.

He conſults the good of diſtant generations, leaves as little as poſſible for them to correct, and as far as human wiſdom can, lays his plans, not meerly to keep things quiet while he is on the ſtage, but that the happineſs of his country may be of long duration, may be perpetual.</p>
            <p>You eaſily ſee by theſe hints of the buſineſs and duty of rulers, that every man is not fit to govern; there muſt be a genius for government, and there muſt be conſtant ſtudy and application.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto conſider'd the wiſdom and knowlege which are neceſſary for rulers in

            <p>Secondly, It is neceſſary they ſhould have a particular acquaintance with the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country they are called to govern.</p>
            <p>Reaſon we ſay dictates that there ſhould be government; and the voice of reaſon is the voice of God. But what form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they will be under is left to the choice of thoſe who are to be governed. God has never determin'd this. It becomes thoſe who claim a divine indefeaſible right, to make out their claim in a better manner than they have ever yet done, or it is abſurd to ſuppoſe any, who have common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or a tolerable ſenſe of liberty, will ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p>All power has it's foundation in compact and mutual conſent, or elſe it proceeds from fraud or violence. Where the latter take place, the dominion which men claim is no better than uſurpation; and they, who by theſe methods raiſe themſelves above their brethren, are ſo far from having a right to govern, that they ought to be puniſhed as

            <p>When government is founded in mutual conſent, it is the undoubted right of the community to ſay who ſhall govern them; and to make what limitations or conditions they think proper. Perhaps the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is not beſt for all ſocieties, or for the ſame ſociety at all times. Be this as it may; it is very certain that mankind have eſtabliſhed different forms of government, according to their own will and inclination: "Some have ſet up one or a few men to govern them, others have ſeen fit to retain the power themſelves:—In ſome the ſupreme magiſtrates have been annually elected; in others the power is for life. In ſome they are merely elective, in others hereditary under certain rules or limitations". In GREAT-BRITAIN there is a happy mixture of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ariſtocracy, and democracy. This is perhaps the moſt perfect form of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is the glory of Britons and the envy of foreigners.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:009964_0018_0F7B3C6D3AA8D0B0"/>But whatever form of civil government men have choſe, there are certain conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are the baſis and foundation of the ſtate, and which are obligatory on thoſe who govern, as well as thoſe who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. Theſe conſtitutions are a ſort of fundamental laws, which cannot be violated without the greateſt danger to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. When either part attempts to invade the rights of the other, it uſually produces convulſions, which ſooner or later overturn the ſtate.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary they who are in authority ſhould be well acquainted with theſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws; they ought to make them one main part of their ſtudy; and ſhould not without the utmoſt neceſſity depart from them. If ſuch a ſtrict adherence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is ſometimes attended with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009964_0019_0F7B3C70520B8990"/>
yet a departure from it will be attended with much greater. Magiſtrates ought to know their own power, and not tamely give up thoſe prerogatives with which the conſtitution has veſted them. Such mean condeſcenſion will only expoſe them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and further encroachments, till not even a ſhadow of authority is left. On the other hand, they ought to be tender of the privileges of thoſe they govern. Even in abſolute monarchies, the people may by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and tyranny come to know that they have rights, and to aſſert them in a way not very pleaſing to thoſe, who have inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and unjuſtly invaded them.</p>
            <p>In free governments people are apt to feel much quicker. To touch their liberties is to touch the apple of their eye; every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt alarms them, makes them jealous of further deſigns, and often throws them into the hands of factious demagogues, who hate government, and are ever watching for oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to embarraſs public meaſures, and to introduce anarchy and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Where ſo much depends, and the danger of acting wrong is like to have ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009964_0020_0F7B3C7116716C20"/>
to the community, and perhaps to themſelves; rulers ought to know very well what it is to act right, where power ends and liberty begins. The more difficult it is to ſettle this point, ſo much the more wiſdom and prudence do rulers need, and ſo much the more cautious ſhould they be in acting; and where people obſerve ſuch caution and tenderneſs in their rulers, they will make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for miſtakes, and even for faults.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay, that they who are in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may not propoſe an alteration in the conſtitution, when they ſee manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies; every member of the ſtate may do this; and there may be extraordinary caſes wherein it may be neceſſary to deviate from common rules; in ſuch caſes the ſafety of the people is to be preferred to every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration. But no wiſe ruler would deſire a general power of diſpenſing with the laws; nor is it poſſible to proceed with too much caution in making any great alteration in the civil conſtitution of a ſtate; eſpecially when it has been long eſtabliſhed, and the wiſdom of ages has been employed to confirm it. Where there ſeem to be defects, there me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

may often prove worſe than the diſeaſe; and by attempting to guard againſt one inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we may open the way to a great many which we do not now foreſee. When a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is eſſentially bad, rulers &amp; every one elſe ought to run every riſque to make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But where the conſtitution is tolerably good, it is generally the wiſdom of thoſe in power, to maintain a ſacred regard to it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to endeavour that it may not be violated by others. This is their ſafety, and very often the ſafety of thoſe they govern. When a humour of changing once begins, no mortal can tell where it will end. One can ſcarce conceive of an alteration more juſt, more neceſſary, and that could tend more to ſecure the public liberty, than the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tribunes at Rome; and yet this very regulation, ſeemingly ſo wiſe and good, laid the foundation of the deſtruction of their liberties, and the ruin of the common-wealth.<note n="*" place="bottom">"The people by means of the tribunes, gradually uſurped the authority of the ſenate.

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:009964_0022_0F7B3C7280E83938"/>Thirdly, Rulers cannot come up to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the text, unleſs they are men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and virtue. Every condition has its temptations, none are expoſed to more or greater, than thoſe who are advanced to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of power and eminence; none have greater need of a ſettled principle of action, and the aſſiſtance of divine grace. If there is no regard to God or the rules of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, wiſdom degenerates into cunning, and rulers inſtead of endeavouring to know what Iſrael ought to do, only conſider what they have to do themſelves; inſtead of aiming at the public good, they conſult only what is like to promote their own private intereſt, ſupport their adminiſtration, and continue them in power. The ſelfiſh paſſions will have the dominion; and men will ſacrifice conſcience, and fell their country, to carry a favourite point, or gratify their vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. The intereſt of ſuch rulers, or what they imagine to be their intereſt, preſently becomes ſeparate from that of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; of conſequence they are obliged to make uſe of every art, to keep the people quiet; to make them inſenſible of their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, or to compel them to bear it; to put
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009964_0023_0F7B3C7353B70710"/>
a falſe gloſs on their flagitious actions, or to ſecure a powerful party, who will ſupport their meaſures, and be the inſtruments of their iniquity. They will chooſe thoſe for their companions and counſellors, who will flatter their vanity, feed their avarice, or provide for their pleaſures. Theſe are the men they will endeavour to promote; whilſt they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard perſons of a different character, who feel for their country, and have courage to oppoſe thoſe meaſures which tend to deſtroy it. Vice contracts the mind, and quenches every ſpark of public ſpirit; it fills the ſoul with criminal prejudices, and the higher it is exalted, the miſchief is ſo much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive.</p>
            <p>The caſe is quite different when power is in the hands of men of virtue and religion.</p>
            <p>By religion I intend ſomething more than an external ſhew, or a mere appearance of goodneſs. Hypocriſy is not only a character moſt deteſtable to God, but it makes a man more extenſively miſchievous to ſociety. His ſanctimonious pretences procure him the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and confidence of his brethren, by
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009964_0024_0F7B3C7400266420"/>
which means he has it in his power to deceive them, and to betray their intereſts. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration can be of force ſufficient to bind him, who dares to prevaricate with heaven, and to trifle with the Lord his maker. The greateſt prodigies of wickedneſs have been thoſe who have put on the guiſe of religion: For a pretence they have made long prayers, that they might, with the greater eaſe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their deteſtable deſigns. Nor do I call it religion to contend for a few little rites and ceremonies, which are of no importance in themſelves, and will not make men either wiſer or better. It does not conſiſt in nice metaphyſical diſtinctions, and in loud and cruel anathemas againſt all who will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe them. Much leſs is it religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to invade the rights of conſcience, and to inflict pains and penalties on thoſe who are not of the magiſtrates ſentiments, or preſume to diſſent from the principles eſtabliſhed by law. On the other hand, no one can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there is any religion in a careleſs indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about all principles; or in clamors for charity and forbearance, while malice reigns in the heart, and we can cenſure, revile and perſecute thoſe whom we eſteem leſs catholic than ourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:009964_0025_0F7B3C761C672610"/>I call that religion which Jeſus Chriſt taught, and which is made known to us in the ſacred oracles. It is a belief of the truth, and a temper of mind correſpondent to it.</p>
            <p>A religious man, or which is now the ſame thing, a ſincere chriſtian, is purified in ſome meaſure from thoſe corrupt principles, which too eaſily find a place in the human heart, and is deeply penetrated with the things of God. He has a ſupreme affection to this greateſt and beſt of beings, and maintains a conſtant regard to him in all his actions. He remembers the divine preſence and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count every one muſt give to this Lord and judge of all. He heartily ſubmits to Chriſt as his prince and ſaviour: He has ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that mind which was in Chriſt Jeſus: He deſires to approve himſelf to him, and is animated by thoſe glorious proſpects which the goſpel opens to our view.</p>
            <p>The religion of Jeſus enlarges the mind; it diveſts us, ſo far as it prevails, of every cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal prejudice; it makes us willing to deny ourſelves, to ſacrifice our worldly eaſe, our temporal intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the honor of God and the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009964_0026_0F7B3C76BAD75EA8"/>
good of men. It fortifies againſt temptation, it curbs our paſſions, it regulates our deſires, it produces noble and generous ſentiments, it inſpires love and univerſal benevolence; it teaches us to look not every one on his own things, but on the things of others; not to confine our charity to ourſelves, but to do good to all with whom we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and eſpecially to aim at the public advantage, in which the comfort and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of multitudes are involved.</p>
            <p>This chriſtian temper, which is produc'd by the Spirit of God, will more than any thing help us to diſtinguiſh between right and wrong; when private intereſts and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate views are removed, "the public good appears naked and open, free from all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and embarraſſments". When rulers have ſuch a happy diſpoſition, they will ſtudy the true intereſt of thoſe they govern, which is the way to underſtand it; they will watch againſt a little party ſpirit and every ſelfiſh ſiniſter view; they will ſuppreſs the dictates of pride, covetouſneſs, and ambition; and while with a manly firmneſs they ſupport their own dignity. they will not invade the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009964_0027_0F7B3C774B05BF30"/>
privileges of thoſe who are ſubject to them; they will not hearken to the inſinuations of flattery, nor meanly court the favor of the populace; they will not have reſpect to perſons, nor take a gift; and will ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frown on thoſe, who have the inſolence to affront their virtue, or attempt to pervert their judgment. No motive, no temptation will allure them to join in making bad laws, or to wreſt the true intention of thoſe that are in force. Their whole ambition will be to diſcharge their truſt with fidelity, and to make the people happy who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their care.</p>
            <p>I own there are other principles which may have very ſalutary effects. There is in ſome men a certain benevolence and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, which leads them to do many worthy deeds, that others perform from a principle of religion. There are remains of conſcience in men, who cannot be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated ſincere diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. Even their ambition and ſelf-intereſt may prompt men to actions which are greatly beneficial to the community, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the truſt repoſed in them with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009964_0028_0F7B3C780B449908"/>
and fortitude. But the better the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo much the greater, at leaſt ſo much the more certain will be the effect. When the love and fear of God reign in the heart, men will riſe to nobler heights, and to more diſtinguiſhed acts of virtue, than from any other motive. When they conſider the whole community as brethren, they will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſeek the common good. When they ſet before them the example of our bleſſed Saviour, when they contemplate his ardent love to mankind and diſintereſted benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, their minds will be inflamed with a holy ambition, to emulate the virtues of this amiable, this excellent perſon. When the greateſt men carry their thoughts to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant hour, when they muſt leave theſe tranſitory ſcenes, and their honors will be laid in the duſt, how ſollicitous will they be that they may finiſh well, and have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their own minds, when they have nothing elſe to ſupport them! When they look forward to that illuſtrious day, in which the Lord will be revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the great as well as the ſmall muſt ſtand before his tribunal; what a check is this to every ſiniſter view and every iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009964_0029_0F7B3C7893645718"/>
practice! What an incentive to juſtice, to integrity and univerſal virtue! If other qualities may render a ruler uſeful to ſociety, yet ſurely nothing but religion, a regard to God in his public conduct, will enſure him the acceptance of heaven, and the plaudit of the great ruler and judge of all.</p>
            <p>I am far from ſuppoſing that religion is the only thing to be regarded in a ruler. The moſt religious character will appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in a public ſtation, if there are not other accompliſhments: But whatever qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities a man has, it can by no means be ſafe, to entruſt our lives, our eſtates, our liberties, every thing that is dear and valuable, to one who evidences by his converſation, that he has no regard to God, and is deſtitute of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodneſs. What can we expect, but that he, who will ſacrifice his own moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intereſt, will ſacrifice the intereſts of others, if at any time they are oppoſite to his vicious inclinations?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another accompliſhment very neceſſary for a good ruler, is prudence to conduct affairs in ſeaſons that are critical and alarming. Such a ſeaſon it was in Iſrael
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009964_0030_0F7B3C794C1FA728"/>
when Iſhboſheth was ſlain. And then it was that the heads of Iſſachar diſcovered their underſtanding and addreſs, by conducting with ſuch prudence as to ſtill every oppoſite faction, and bring their brethren quietly to ſubmit to king David, which was the only expedient to ſave the kingdom from ruin. Affairs in a kingdom or in a province are ſometimes brought to a dangerous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant criſis, from foreign enemies or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tumults; from the miſtakes of thoſe who wiſh them well, or the intrigues of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men; from their own vices and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or the wickedneſs of others. In ſuch a critical ſituation, the friends of a people are called to ariſe, and to exert themſelves to ſave them from impending ruin. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſpecially belongs to thoſe who are in authority, the eyes of others are naturally to them, under that God who has the hearts of all men in his hand; from them they expect relief; and happy the people, whoſe rulers have at ſuch time wiſdom to diſcern, and virtue to purſue thoſe meaſures, that tend to promote their welfare, and to prolong their tranquility.</p>

This is a talent very different from that wiſdom which is profitable to direct in a common ſtate of things. A man may be a good pilot in a moderate gale, who can do nothing in a ſtorm. Some men who would make very good rulers in a time of proſperity, are quite unfit to lead in times that are intricate and perplexed. They loſe the poſſeſſion of themſelves; they are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and irreſolute, and ſo neglect to do what ought to be done; or they are raſh and violent, and by their imprudence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate the ruin they intend to prevent. It is of the greateſt importance that rulers have underſtanding of the times in ſuch critical ſeaſons. While others are hurried by their fears and paſſions, and know not what to do, they ought ſedately to conſider the tendency and conſequences of preſent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009964_0034_0F7B3C7CC7980010"/>
events, and ſhould endeavor to guide into meaſures, that will be moſt likely to prevent the evils that are feared, or to make them tolerable if they muſt come.</p>
            <p>There is one courſe, which if it will not be a certain cure, will yet be a great relief in the moſt dangerous ſtate we can be in; and that is the practice of piety and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal virtue. Virtue does in itſelf tend to promote public happineſs. Frugality, temperance, induſtry will extricate us out of moſt difficulties that can ariſe; and if we are actuated by religion, God will be our God, our protector, and friend; "it will be well with us and our children for ever." Whatever he does elſe, if a ruler has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the times, he will promote the fear of God and obedience to his laws.</p>
            <p>I have now conſidered ſome of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing qualities of a good ruler. It is not to be expected, in the preſent imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate, that rulers will be free from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes or faults; whoever looks for ſuch a behaviour from any man or from any ſet of men, will undoubtedly be diſappointed.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009964_0035_0F7B3C7D38D97398"/>
But though you may not expect a perfect character, yet the great author of nature, whoſe tender mercies are over all his works, "has thought fit to mingle from time to time among the ſocieties of men, a few of thoſe on whom he is graciouſly pleaſed to beſtow a larger proportion of underſtanding and integrity, than is given in the ordinary courſe of his providence to the ſons of men. There are ſuperior ſpirits, men who are born to guide, to inſtruct, and to preſerve"; their abilities and their virtues denote that they were formed for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, and it would be a fault not to improve thoſe talents, with which the great Lord of all has entruſted them. They ought not to let ſlip any opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that preſents to ſerve their country, or to do good to mankind.</p>
            <p>There are indeed arts and intrigues, by which ſome men intrude themſelves into ſtations of dignity, which are below one of a great and generous mind, and which no conſideration will perſuade him to make uſe of. But to ſay that men ought always to avoid ſuch ſtations thro' a modeſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009964_0036_0F7B3C7EDA12DDA0"/>
of their own abilities; or that a people ought to reject thoſe, who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a willingneſs to be employed, is to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the matter much too far; and a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent practice might have very bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It might deprive ſocieties of the beſt heads and hearts, and leave them a prey to crafty and ambitious men, whoſe only care would be to aggrandize and enrich themſelves. A true patriot cannot do his country a more important ſervice, than by taking it out of the hands of ſuch devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harpies. Conſcious of his own ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and a generous regard to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, he ought to deſpiſe the little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of thoſe who are only uneaſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not in place, and cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their baſe deſigns. The hiſtory of Rome ſcarce affords a more illuſtrious character than that of Fabius Maximus. This great man, having finiſhed the year of his conſulate, when Rome was engaged in dangerous wars, found that the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for a new conſul were like to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of one, who was quite raw and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. He ſtop'd their proceedings, ſet before the electors the danger of ſuch a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009964_0037_0F7B3C7F8AA5FF78"/>
choice at ſuch a time, and drew a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the perſon they ought to chooſe, which they could apply to none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the aſſembly was convinced, recalled their votes, and unanimouſly elected him. Such was the exigency of affairs, ſays the hiſtorian,<note n="*" place="bottom">Tempos ac neceſſitas belli, ac diſcrimen ſummae rerum faciebant, nequis aut in exemplum exquireret, aut ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectum cupiditatis imperii conſulem haberet, quin lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant potius magnitudinem animi, quod quum ſummo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratore eſſe opus republicae ſciret, ſeque eum haud dubie eſſe; minoris invidiam ſuam, ſiqua ex re oriretur, quam utilitatem reipublicae feciſſet.

               </note> that no one attended to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the precedent, or had the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that the conſul was actuated by a luſt of dominion, but all rather extolled his greatneſs of mind, that when he knew the commonwealth ſtood in need of it's greateſt commander, and that he was without exception the man, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run the hazard of the moſt invidious reflections, than miſs an opportunity of ſerving his country.</p>
            <p>It is however much more agreable to a generous mind, to be called out by others to public ſervice, than in any ſort to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf: And a people who have any
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009964_0038_0F7B3C80019AC058"/>
regard to their own ſafety, will endeavor to find out merit where ever it is hid, and to confer their honors on thoſe who know how to improve them.</p>
            <p>So far indeed, as government is by the conſtitution hereditary, a people are obliged to ſubmit to the diſpoſals of providence, and to pay homage to the lawful heir, whether his abilities are great or ſmall: And in large communities, the advantage of hereditary monarchy is generally ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to balance every inconvenience; and where it is not, it is in their own power to do themſelves juſtice, as they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally done ſooner or later. Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other inſtances, the glorious revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in BRITAIN, to which noble exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of national virtue, we owe the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our liberty, and the preſent happy eſtabliſhment of the houſe of HANOVER.</p>
            <p>When a people immediately appoint their own rulers, they are to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree infatuated, if they fix on thoſe, who are not capable of ſeeing with their own eyes, but are obliged to move by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009964_0039_0F7B3C80C1DF9570"/>
of others, or who get into power to gratify their vanity, their luxury, or their avarice; and it requires no ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to foreſee, that a community who are ſo loſt to public virtue, are nigh to deſtruction. A people may be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may be betrayed, by men in whom they put confidence. But they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be abandoned by providence, if they truſt their intereſt with men, whom they know to be either weak or wicked.</p>
            <p>I am in the ſecond place to ſpeak of the duty of ſubjects to their rulers; and the illuſtrating this will ſhow, at the ſame time, the happy influence which good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is like to have on the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. "The heads of Iſſachar were men that had underſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do, <hi>and all their brethren were at their commandment.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The duty of rulers and ſubjects is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; rulers ought to love their people and to ſeek their welfare; and the people on their part, ought to be ſubject; to the higher powers, to obey magiſtrates, and to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009964_0040_0F7B3C8182C66360"/>
ſubmit to their lawful commands, both are neceſſary to the public happineſs. If people will not ſubmit to thoſe who are placed over them, there is an end of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to all the happy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which it was inſtituted; the whole is thrown into a ſtate of anarchy and confuſion, which will ſoon terminate in the other extreme, tyranny and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Submiſſion to authority is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the very nature of government, it is founded in the higheſt reaſon; without it, the moſt perfect virtue in rulers will not anſwer any valuable end.</p>
            <p>Obedience to rulers is a matter of ſo much importance, that our Saviour and his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, who meddled very little with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, thought it neceſſary to enjoin it on chriſtians. <q>Render ſays our Lord, to Caeſar the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxii.21.</note>

               <q>Let every ſoul, ſays St. Paul,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.1.2.</note> be ſubject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God, whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009964_0041_0F7B3C823AA1B078"/>

St. Peter directs, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii.13, 14, 15.</note>
               <q>ſubmit yourſelves to every <hi>human conſtitution</hi> for the Lord's ſake; whether it be to the king as ſupreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well; for ſo is the will of God.</q>
From ſuch paſſages as theſe, ſome have argued the doctrine of paſſive obedience and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance in all caſes whatſoever; or that we are not to oppoſe thoſe who are in authority, although they evidently act contrary to the deſign of their inſtitution, and are bent to ruin the ſociety, which it is their duty to defend and promote. A doctrine ſo big with abſurdity, that one would think no one of common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding could embrace it; certainly he muſt have the temper of a ſlave that can practice upon it. St. Paul very plainly teaches us how far ſubjection is due to a civil magiſtrate, when he gives it as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this ſubjection,
<q>for he is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God to thee for good <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.4.</note>.</q>
The end for which God has placed men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009964_0042_0F7B3C85363CA0D8"/>
is, that they may promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs: When they improve their power to contrary purpoſes, when they endeavour to ſubvert the conſtitution, and to enſlave a free people, they are no longer the miniſters of God; they do not act by his authority; if we are obliged to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is only for wrath and not for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, and they who ſupport ſuch rulers betray their country, and deſerve the miſery they bring on themſelves. Happy would it be if it was confined to them!</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, it is difficult to ſtate this point with preciſion; to determine where ſubmiſſion ends and reſiſtance may lawfully take place, ſo as not to leave room for men of bad minds unreaſonably to oppoſe government, and to deſtroy the peace of ſociety. Moſt certainly people ought to bear much, before they engage in any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt thoſe who are in authority; they ought to conſider their rulers as frail and fallible men, who are liable to miſtakes and faults, when their general aim is good and right; they ſhould overlook their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and even their vices, if they are not
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009964_0043_0F7B3C85474298C8"/>
ſuch as tend directly to overturn the ſtate, and to bring diſtreſs and ruin on the whole community. Better a particular perſon, yea many individuals ſhould ſuffer, than to encourage civil broils and a public diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
            <p>When rulers are wiſe and good, oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an high crime; men ought not to make their own jealouſies, reſentments, or private intereſt, a pretence for reſiſting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or to ſtir up factions and ſeditions againſt their rulers. Such men will be the faulty cauſes of the evils that follow, and will have an awful account to give at the bar of God;
<q>whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Men of ſuch perverſe and turbulent minds may poſſibly, by dark intrigues and falſe inſinuations, raiſe ſuſpicions of evil deſigns, and of ſchemes that never entered into any one's head but their own; and as rulers are imperfect, they may find op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities from, their miſtakes, to fill the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009964_0044_0F7B3C86020A5E90"/>
minds of people with prejudices and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; they may poſſibly prevail to raiſe tumults and diſturbances; but very often they fall into the pit they digged for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; God in his providence brings to light their dark deſigns, and they become the objects of univerſal contempt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</p>
            <p>People are generally capable of knowing when they are well uſed. Public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is eaſily felt. Men cannot but perceive, when they enjoy their rights and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; when they ſit at quiet under their own vines and fig-trees, and there is none to make them afraid; when the laws of the land have their courſe, and juſtice is impartially adminiſtred; when no unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable burthens are laid upon them; when their rulers are ready to hear their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and to redreſs their wrongs; when they treat them with condeſcenſion, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection; when they ſympathiſe with them under their difficulties, and like their great maſter are afflicted in all their afflictions. Such a temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in rulers are eaſily perceived without any extraordinary penetration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:009964_0045_0F7B3C86D01B69C0"/>It is not without deſign, that the ſacred hiſtorian ſpeaks of the heads of Iſſachar and the reſt of the tribe as <hi>brethren</hi>; and this ſuggeſts a good reaſon for their ſo ready ſubjection,
<q>and all their brethren were at their commandment.</q>
When a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perceive, that they who have power in their hands ſtill treat them as brethren, as partaking of the ſame common nature, and as having a right to their liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; they will have a reciprocal affection to their rulers, they will be loth to grieve and offend them, they will be quiet and peaceable, and will do what they can, to render their adminiſtration eaſy, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their power only to make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. If at any time the people clamour and find fault, as they ſometimes do under the beſt government, in conſequence of real or imaginary miſconduct, or when heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are laid upon them, they ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their temper, they forget the faults of their rulers, they remember only their good deeds, and there is danger that to make amends for their paſt miſtakes, they will run mad with loyalty and ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:009964_0046_0F7B3C87863FC6F8"/>Rulers have ſo many ways of keeping up their influence, that it is not eaſy to effect a general oppoſition, even where they have the moſt pernicious deſigns. A good ruler is almoſt ſure of love and eſteem, of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience. "Men love their happineſs too well to deſtroy and ruin it, by oppoſing thoſe from whom they know it is derived to them." Experience ſhows, that if they, who are veſted with power, have but a moderate ſhare of public virtue, they are admired and honored while they live, and their memory is bleſſed long after they are dead. Rulers therefore always have it in their power, to ſecure the people in their intereſt, and to gain a place in their hearts. By attending to their duty, they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of the people, and at the ſame time fix their own authority. If the heads of a community have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the times to know what Iſrael ought to do, they will be like to have all their brethren at their commandment. But where men are groſly of a contrary charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pervert their power to tyrannical purpoſes; ſubmiſſion, if it can be avoided, is ſo far from being a duty, that it is a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009964_0047_0F7B3C8900487AB0"/>
crime. It is an offence againſt the ſtate of which we are members, and whoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we ought to prefer to our chief joy. It is an offence againſt mankind, whoſe rights we meanly betray. It is an offence againſt God, who is good to all, and who has appointed government for the welfare and happineſs, and not the deſtruction of his creatures.</p>
            <p>How happy is GREAT-BRITAIN in a Prince, who accounts it his glory to reign over a free people, and who, we truſt, will always make the laws of the land the rule of his adminiſtration! How ſtill more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in a conſtitution that ſcarce admits of tyranny, unleſs the people themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come corrupt and venal; and when that is the caſe, nothing but omnipotence can ſave them!</p>
            <p>It is the ſafety of the Britiſh nation that it's monarchy is hereditary, as that right is now underſtood. It is a favor of heaven, that our lawful Sovereign is poſſeſs'd of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which enſure him the love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſubjects.
<q>Becauſe the Lord
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009964_0048_0F7B3C89F13AB4F8"/>
hath loved his people he hath made thee king over them.</q>
May that kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which has ſo often appeared for our nation, ſtill watch over it for good; diſappoint every attempt to ſubvert their liberties, and preſerve them from thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal vices and corruptions, which they have more reaſon to fear than any foreign enemy, or open violence!</p>
            <p>The form of government in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is a little model of the Britiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Our commander in chief, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the King, is not elected by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We do not complain of this as an infringement of our liberties, it rather frees us from many inconveniencies, which would attend frequent popular elections. Eſpecially may we eſteem it a privilege, while we have a Gentleman at our head, who ſo well underſtands our civil conſtitution, and who, we perſuade ourſelves, ſincerely aims at the happineſs of the people he is appointed to govern. May his Excellency's ſervices for the public always find acceptance with an obliged and grateful people! and may
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009964_0049_0F7B3C8A846240E0"/>
he have the approbation of his great Lord, when he gives an account of the talents committed to him!</p>
            <p>The other branches of our legiſlature are choſe by ourſelves. It refreſhes our hearts to ſee the return of this anniverſary, and we hope fills them with thankfulneſs to God. The preſence of our General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and the buſineſs of this day, put us in mind of the liberties we enjoy, while more than nine-tenths of mankind are in the moſt abject ſlavery, and multitudes of them, to the baſeſt and worſt of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. We conclude it is from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience their conſtituents have had of their wiſdom and integrity, that ſo many are returned to ſerve in the preſent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, who have formerly had a ſeat there. We cannot think this people are yet ſo corrupt, as generally to be influenced in their elections by other conſiderations. We truſt that they, whom they have hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this mark of their confidence, will have a ſacred regard to their intereſt, and will not ſuffer any ſiniſter views to byaſs or govern them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:009964_0050_0F7B3C8B3B5168D8"/>One of our valuable charter privileges is this day to be exerciſed. A privilege, to which it is owing, that the province has of her ſons at the council-board; men who naturally care for our ſtate, and who are deeply intereſted in the conſequences of every public meaſure. God grant that this privilege may never be wreſted from us! One way to prevent ſo fatal an event, is to make a wiſe uſe of this important truſt, to chooſe
<q>out of all the people able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs;</q>
who underſtand our intereſt, and have virtue to purſue it. If our preſent Councellors are ſuch men, their experience in public buſineſs will doubtleſs give them a great advantage.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom and integrity are always neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſtitute a good ruler; but when the ſtate of a people is perplexed and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, it requires more attention, and a greater exertion of abilities; and by their prudence and ſteadineſs at ſuch times, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers make it evident, that they are qualified for the truſt repoſed in them. Such a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſeaſon, if I miſtake not, is the preſent;
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009964_0051_0F7B3C8CC6C611E0"/>
and I cannot eaſily be miſtaken, when all orders of men are ſo generally alarmed, in this and the other colonies, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their moſt valuable privileges in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>I am far from impeaching the juſtice of the Britiſh Parliament. If any acts have paſs'd that ſeem hard on the colonies, we ought to ſuppoſe, they are not owing to any deſign formed againſt them, but to miſtakes and miſrepreſentations.—To you, our honored rulers, it belongs to rectify ſuch miſtakes, in ſuch ways as you ſhall think decent and proper.</p>
            <p>Our fathers dearly bought the privileges we enjoy. It is evident, when they left their native land, they thought the rights of Engliſhmen would follow them wherever they ſat down, and be tranſmitted to their poſterity; and we hope their poſterity have done nothing to forfeit them. It was kindly and juſtly ſaid by Biſhop Burnet to a New-England agent, as I find it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before his excellent Son and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Aſſembly of this province <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Prince's Sermon preached before Governor Burnet and the General Aſſembly, July 25, 1728.</note>. "That
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009964_0052_0F7B3C8D9F0A8498"/>
he would openly ſtand up for us, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the obloquy that would be caſt upon him for it, he would plead our cauſe; and when our charter ſhould come to be conſidered in the houſe of Lords, he would there publickly declare, that there was a greater ſacredneſs in the charter of New-England, than in thoſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in England; for thoſe were only acts of grace, whereas the charter of New-England was a contract between the King and the firſt patentees; wherein they had promiſed to enlarge the king's dominions on their own charges, provided that they and their poſterity might enjoy ſuch and ſuch privileges: and now they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their part, for the king to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive their poſterity of the privileges gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, would carry a face of injuſtice in it." Thus that great and good man.</p>
            <p>We highly value our connection with Great-Britain, there is perhaps not a man to be found among us, who would wiſh to be independent on our mother-country, we ſhould regret the moſt diſtant thought of ſuch an event; we are grieved that there is any thing to create the leaſt ſuſpicion of want of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009964_0053_0F7B3C8E43439628"/>
tenderneſs on their part, or of duty on our's. We hope there is no ground for either. We truſt our King and his Parliament will yet hear us and confirm our liberties and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to us. And we earneſtly pray that a happy union may ſubſiſt between Great-Britain and her colonies to the lateſt poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Our rulers are a part of ourſelves, they look on the whole community as their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they have one common intereſt with us. We doubt not they feel for their people in this difficult day, and will exert all their abilities in the preſent exigency. Time has been, when even darker clouds hung over the Britiſh colonies than thoſe which now threaten us; and the God of heaven has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and diſſipated them. His arm is not ſhortned that he cannot ſave, his ear is not heavy that he cannot hear. The friends of Zion will not ceaſe to pray, that our rulers may be lead in a ſafe and plain path; and we truſt they will themſelves implore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſſiſtance of him, who
<q>giveth wiſdom to the wiſe, and knowlege to them that know underſtanding.</q>
Happy will it

be for you, our honored fathers, if you are the inſtruments of prolonging our tranquility. It will be an honor put upon you by the God of heaven: It will render you accepted of the multitude of your brethren: You will be eſteemed and bleſs'd while you live; and your names will be had in grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance long after you have enter'd the world of ſpirits.</p>
            <p>But whatever aſpect this important affair may have on our preſent or future proſperity, it is not all that calls for the attention of our rulers. He muſt have but little underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the times, who does not ſee that we are in more danger from our internal vices, than from any external impoſitions. Our lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, extravagance and intemperance threaten our ruin. We live above ourſelves, we have forſaken the ſimplicity of our fathers in our dreſs, our furniture and our tables. We im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port much that is abſolutely ſuperfluous, that tends only to feed our pride and vanity. Some little private efforts have been made to reform theſe evils, poſſibly the legiſlature may find out ſome more effectual method to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our vices, and to encourage induſtry, frugality and ſobriety.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:009964_0055_0F7B3C8FC9980A18"/>There was much enquiry, I am informed, in the laſt aſſembly, how they might raiſe a revenue from the ſpirituous liquors that are expended among us. Can nothing be done to prevent the ſo free uſe of them? if not, the glory is departed, we need nothing elſe to make us a poor miſerable people. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>"Of all the miſeries and plagues" ſays the late excellent Dr. <hi>Stephen Hales,</hi> "that unhappy man has been incident to, none was ever ſo effectually deſtructive as this not even thoſe three ſore judgments of war, peſtilence and famine; which after having raged for ſome time, ceaſe. But this evil ſpirit is an unrelenting mercileſs enemy, that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens deſtruction from generation to generation.—And yet, has not this calamity made a ſurprizing advance within twenty or thirty years? And is it not daily ſpreading far and wide, both at home, and in our colonies abroad? What then muſt be the end thereof (avert it good God!) but the final ruin of this great and trading nation."</p>
                  <p>The Dr. adds the following note. The terrible deſtruction of human lives by the prevailing uſe of <hi>Spirituous Liquors,</hi> appears from the following accounts.</p>

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:009964_0056_0F7B3C90DEEEBB50"/>Our fathers in the civil government can ſcarce be ſenſible how far and wide intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance has ſpread, eſpecially among the lower ſort of people. I doubt not their readineſs to apply a remedy, if it is in their power; whether any can be found, is not for me to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:009964_0057_0F7B3C914841FBB0"/>While our rulers are conſulting the public good, and enquiring what this people ought to do, it becomes us to ſubmit to their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty; we ought to be ſubject to theſe miniſters of God, not only for wrath but for conſcience ſake. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to rulers enters into religion; by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable oppoſition to them, we diſpleaſe God by whoſe providence they are placed over us.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of rulers is difficult enough in itſelf, we ought not to encreaſe their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by a factious turbulent behaviour. No good ruler will be averſe to have his public conduct: examined, or find fault with decent remonſtrances when they act contrary to the ſenſe of the community. But it is hard, when they have done their beſt, to be cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reviled, and to have government made uneaſy by the jealouſies and intrigues of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented men, who think nothing right but what they do themſelves; and delight to raiſe ſuſpicions of deſigns which are the product of their own vain imaginations. We ſhould remember that rulers are men of like paſſions,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009964_0058_0F7B3C9201370518"/>
and are in a ſtate of peculiar temptation. We ought not to magnify their faults, but to bear with their infirmities and overlook their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, when we have reaſon to think they do not proceed from a bad heart. When God has honored them by making them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of good, we ought not only to reverence, but to eſteem and love them for their works ſake.</p>
            <p>It would be well, if both rulers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would conſider the brevity and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of human life, and that account which they muſt all give of the things done in the body. What a happy influence would this have on their temper and conduct! It would lead rulers to improve every talent to the honor of God and the good of men. It would lead ſubjects ſo far as is poſſible, and as much as in them lieth, to promote peace and union. It would make us all ſollicitous to approve ourſelves to God, and to get that ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which only can make us meet for the inheritance of the ſaints in light.</p>
