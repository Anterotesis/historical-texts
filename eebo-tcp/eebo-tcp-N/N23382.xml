            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the contempt in which you are held by Mr. Burke, and men like Mr. Burke, yet, as the following publication is calculated principally for your uſe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, I think it proper to dedicate it to you. Indeed, I ſuppoſe, that thoſe gentlemen, who, with their ariſtocracy of power, titles, wealth, places, penſions, &amp;c. conceive that they poſſeſs alſo an ariſtocracy of underſtanding, and that you were born only for their uſe, will not deign to caſt their eyes on ſo vulgar a performance. For theſe <hi>great</hi> men I write not; but if I can afford <hi>you</hi> any amuſement or any inſtruction, I ſhall have accompliſhed my end.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected to the title of this pamphlet, that <hi>Tom Paine</hi> is no <hi>Jeſter</hi>—that his works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>ſerious truths: but you,</hi> I am certain, will allow, that they contain <hi>many good things;</hi> and even his enemies (both thoſe formerly in power, and thoſe received into power and favour, for their oppoſition to his doctrines, even Mr. Burke himſelf) muſt confeſs, that they contain <hi>ſmart things;</hi> for if theſe <hi>gentlemen-placemen</hi> had not <hi>ſmarted</hi> under them, we ſhould not have ſeen the long liſt of proſecutions which have taken place againſt Mr. Paine and the bookſellers who ſold his works. In ſome of theſe proſecutions the juries have found the books to be libels, and in others, the juries have found them not to be libels. This is what is called, in that equitable place, Weſtminſter Hall, the <hi>glorious uncertainty of the law.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. A DROLL blunder was made in the Daily Advertiſer, in the month of May laſt. It ſtated, that a bill was brought into parliament, to ſecure the rights of <hi>potentates,</hi> inſtead of <hi>patentees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The following notice was, for many months, advertiſed on a board, at the Surry end of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Bridge:—"<hi>Rubbiſh may be ſhot by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Thomas Paine.</hi>" It has been lately taken down, at the requeſt, it is ſaid, of a <hi>Lord of the Bedchamber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A gentleman (an enemy to <hi>anarchiſts</hi>) lately ordered a glaſs of brandy in a coffee houſe, adding, "Take care there is none of your damned <hi>French</hi> ſtuff in it."—The waiter replied, "<hi>Genuine Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, Sir, I aſſure you.</hi>"</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was obſerved, ſome time ago, in a mineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial newſpaper, that 5000 Hanoverians were on their march, to <hi>increaſe</hi> the number of <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops quartered at Tournay.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Lord Howe, in the month of Auguſt laſt, made the beſt of his way into port after he had <hi>got ſight</hi> of the French fleet, one of his officers,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030952_0005_0FE9FD2702715208"/>
not remarkably correct in his orthography, wrote to a correſpondent, that he expected they would ſoon go to SEE again.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A workman, lately diſmiſſed from his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment at Mancheſter, was told at the ſame time, that the war was not the cauſe of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. "Now, to me (ſays the man bluffly) the caſe appears directly contrary;—are we not at this moment employed in <hi>ſhooting our cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi>"</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Some wags in Dublin lately gave informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a magiſtrate, that a Mr. Scanlon had three <hi>mortars</hi> in his poſſeſſion. The magiſtrate, attended by a party of dragoons, ſurrounded the houſe, and demanded the <hi>mortars</hi> to be delivered to him in the name of the King. Mr. Scanlon, who is a reſpectable apothecary, immediately produced them, adding, that as they were uſeleſs without the <hi>peſtles,</hi> theſe were alſo at his Majeſty's ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. At a late Kent aſſizes, an action was brought for ſlander, in which an attorney was plaintiff, and an honeſt farmer defendant. The action was brought to recover damages, for calling the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney a <hi>rogue</hi> and a <hi>thief.</hi> The verdict of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was, that <hi>as the plaintiff was an attorney, the action did not lie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Soon after Mr. Dundas's late marriage, a perſon obſerved that he wondered that gentleman held ſo many offices, for that he imagined it would be enough for him to do the <hi>duties</hi> of the <hi>home department.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. An Iriſh officer had the misfortune to be dreadfully wounded in one of the battles in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica laſt war. As he lay on the ground, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſoldier, who was near him, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo ſeverely wounded, made a terrible howling; when the officer exclaimed, "<hi>Damn your eyes,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030952_0006_0FE9FD290497CBE8"/>
what do you make ſuch a noiſe for? Do you think there is nobody killed but yourſelf?</hi>"</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Firſt Lord of the Admiralty, out of compliment to his talents, is commonly called in the office the <hi>late</hi> Lord Chatham.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. In an old church hiſtory, we meet with the following curious article: "The church of Witham Friary is a ſmall ſtructure ſupported by a <hi>nave.</hi>"</p>
                  <p n="13">13. His Grace of Richmond being aſked, why he ordered a captain's guard to mount in the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en? replied, that he wiſhed to accuſtom the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of militia to <hi>ſtand fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Some time ago a gentleman in Devonſhire thought he could not give a greater proof of his loyalty, than by employing a number of perſons to burn Tom Paine in effigy. At the concluſion, one of the fellows waited on him, to know if there was any other <hi>gemman</hi> among his friends, whom he would wiſh to have burned, as they were ready to do it for the ſame quantity of beer.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. A royal publican in Saint George's fields advertiſes his houſe by the title of <hi>the Princeſs Royal's Tap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. During the riots in 1780, ſeveral perſons, in order to ſave their houſes, wrote on their doors '<hi>no popery.</hi>' Grimaldi, the dancer, to avoid all miſtakes, wrote on his, '<hi>no religion.</hi>'</p>
                  <p n="17">17. One of Mr. Reeves's men was lately ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguing the people, in a barn in the country, on the bleſſings of our conſtitution, our paucity of taxes, &amp;c. When an aſs, who had borne many <hi>heavy burdens,</hi> in the midſt of the oration, put his head in at the window and began a braying. The company ſeeming divided in their attention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two orators, a wag obſerved, <hi>only one at a time, if you pleaſe, gentlemen.</hi>

                  <p n="18">18. The oath of allegiance (ſays Algernon Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) binds no private man to more than the law directs; and has no influence upon the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the nation. Many princes are known to their ſubjects only by the injuries, loſſes, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs they bring upon them. Rebellion itſelf is neither good nor bad more than any other war; but is juſt or unjuſt, according to the manner of it.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Notwithſtanding the ſtretches that have been lately made as to libels, it is hardly credible, but it is certainly true, that a man was lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in Dublin as a libeller, for ſhewing a print of Mr. Paine to ſome people around him.</p>

to the moſt <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>happy Conſtitution!</hi>—Take a view of each well conſtructed ſyſtem in each department of government; and you <hi>may</hi> be aſtoniſhed at the ſcene thrown open before you! The whole is a Paradiſe of Delights!</p>
                  <p>Look into the STATE!—'Tis true it has <hi>corruptions</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> as <hi>poor Edmund</hi> ſays, and you muſt peep at them with <hi>due caution</hi>—But ſee your <hi>Liberties</hi> defended, your property pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, by men of the moſt <hi>unſullied virtue.</hi> The great Treaſury of the Nation, which is accumulated from <hi>your</hi> hard labour and induſtry, is entruſted to <hi>integrity</hi> itſelf; and diſtributed with the moſt ſcrupulous exactneſs, on the pure principles of the RIGHTS OF MAN. The moſt favourite <hi>Perſioners</hi> cannot finger a guinea till he has <hi>earnt it;</hi> nor has the moſt exalted man in office a ſingle <hi>ſhilling more</hi> than his <hi>merit</hi> entitles him to. What is £.4000 per anmum to one <hi>great man,</hi> for introducing another great man to kiſs a <hi>Third Great Man's Hand?</hi>—'tis cheap as dirt. Nay it is worth half the money to ſee them at work!—in time of war you pay double taxes, and is it not neceſſary the expences of war ſhould be defrayed?—In time of peace you alſo pay double taxes, to <hi>defray the expences of Peace.</hi> Ye ſenſeleſs idiots! Theſe, and ſuch like things, <hi>conſtitute</hi> the chief <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>State!!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look again into the Law; the ſcene ſtill brighters before you! <hi>Engliſhmen!</hi> you have the <hi>cheapeſt market for Juſtice</hi> in the whole univerſe! how happily adjuſted are the laws between <hi>debtor</hi> and <hi>creditor!</hi> no unneceſſary delay attends the action; no anxiety of mind between the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties; no <hi>neglect</hi> of buſineſs; so <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> expences;—O! what a glorious purchaſe of <hi>parchment</hi> and <hi>ſtamps</hi> do you make here! with
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030952_0034_0FE9FDE9348A4970"/>
what compoſure do you look forward from term to term! in the hands of Mercy and Juſtice, what can you fear! nothing in the final deciſion of the court, to ruffle your ſpirits, or break the repoſe of your family! like fat oyſters ye are gently opened and ſeparated, that the <hi>happy ſtuff,</hi> which lies between, may be applied to enrich the <hi>glorious Conſtitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now take a view of the Church! and ſee the angelical life of the Holy Prieſthood; here is Paradiſe Regained!—by divine permiſſion, here is heaven itſelf let down upon earth! an aſſemblage of all the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>virtues</hi> which dignify and adorn human nature—how equally proportioned is the hire to the labourer! No lazy Biſhops, no ſinecure places, no diſſipated Prieſts, no <hi>ſtarving Curates</hi>—O no, no!—Juſtice, temperance, truth, and brotherly love, animate and pervade the whole; here is a <hi>ſcourge</hi> for the wickedneſs of men in high life, and a conſolation for the miſcries of the poor—here is religion taught by the <hi>beſt maſters</hi> with able aſſiſtants, on the moſt <hi>reaſonable terms!</hi> a little entrance money only is required; marrying, chriſtening, confirming, viſiting and burying, almoſt for an old ſong; and tithes exactly according to circumſtances! Thrice <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>glorious Conſtitution!!!</hi> we are loſt in the contemplation of thy <hi>manifold</hi> bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Hear then, ye "SWINISH MULTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUDE!" the Stateſmen at Whitehall, the Judges on the Bench, all the Pariſh Officers in the nation, their dependants and expectants, proclaim aloud that ye are HAPPY! and who ſo competent to judge of your <hi>happineſs?</hi> Beware of that fatal error of judging for yourſelves. What! think for yourſelves! O let me intreat, nay let me inſiſt upon it, that you never think of <hi>thinking
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030952_0035_0FE9FDEF2EF6FAD0"/>
for yourſelves;</hi> for the more you <hi>think,</hi> the more you will differ from theſe <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> men in your way of thinking: Think alſo, how many mild, happy and glorious Conſtitutions have been ruined by men thinking <hi>for themſelves!</hi> Let your betters, therefore, think for you; becauſe it ſtands to reaſon, they muſt think <hi>beſt;</hi> and if the phantom ſhould again ſeize your brain, and tempt you to conceive you are not <hi>happy,</hi> you muſt petition the <hi>happy Conſtitution</hi> to furniſh you with ſome <hi>patent engines, pullies</hi> and <hi>ſcrews,</hi> whereby you may at any time wind up your imagination to their pitch, dance to their muſic, and be as happy as themſelves.
