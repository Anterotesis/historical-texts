            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Doctrine of Univerſal Salvation Examined and Refuted.</head>
            <p>SOLOMON, after a vaſt and extenſive ſearch into the nature of things, ſays, <hi>lo, this only have I found, that God made man upright; but they have ſought out many inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> How many he could not tell, nor any other man. Had the inhabitants of New-England been told, ten years ago, that ſaid doctrine would ſoon be preached up, and have an extenſive ſpread among them, who could have believed it? Yet this is now become a notorious fact, by the following means: Mr. John Murray, from England, having preached for ſome time in places ſouth of New-York, came from thence into New-England in the fall of the year 1772; and has preached in theſe parts to the preſent time. For a while he concealed his deſign under many good words and fair ſpeeches; and when he began plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preach general ſalvation, his greateſt admirers rather wiſhed than believed the doctrine to be true. At length they procured the re-printing of a pamphlet from London, in 1779, which was privately diſperſed in the country, and has intangled many ſouls. Since which Mr. Elhanan Wincheſter, who was born near Boſton, and, by his itinerations from thence to South-Carolina, had obtained an extenſive fame for being a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſucceſsful preacher of the goſpel, has fallen in with ſaid doctrine, under another form, which has cauſed its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to extend much farther than it had before. And its advocates now glory in it as unanſwerable, becauſe a diſtinct anſwer thereto has not appeared among us. A ſight of this, and not hearing that any others were engaged therein, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me to offer my mite in the affair; hoping that it may encourage and excite others to ſtep forward in the cauſe of truth to better purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The pamphlet referred to, which was re-printed at Boſton, is entituled,
<q>UNION: Or, a Treatiſe of the Conſanguinity and Affinity between Chriſt and his Church. By James
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017464_0004_0FA12169EFF20858"/>
Relly.</q>
UNION is the life of the univerſe, and to act againſt it is an infinite evil; but though his title is ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, yet if the treatiſe ſhould be found to contain a ſcene of diſunion and confuſion, all lovers of truth and peace will ſee cauſe to reject it. Whether it be ſo or not, we are now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. The rule he preſcribes for us to go by is thus expreſſed: Says he,
<q>if mankind have any true notion of juſtice and equity, though but in the ſmalleſt degree, then what is contrary to <hi>this,</hi> is much <hi>more ſo</hi> to God, whoſe juſtice and truth is infinite, pure and eternal.</q>
               <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 9.
<q>This ſimple voice of nature differs from revelation only as the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer light which rules the night, differs from the greater which rules the day. If it is poſſible thoſe our ideas of the divine perfections ſhould be wrong, then have we <hi>no rule,</hi> whereby to diſcern between good and evil.</q>
               <hi>Book,</hi> p. 45. If he meant that, like the moon, we are always to receive light from the ſun, and to let the ſame ſhine before others, in word and practice, Jeſus has inculcated this duty upon us in a clear manner. But to imagine that our ideas of the divine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may not be entirely wrong, or that, if they were ſo, we ſhould have <hi>no rule</hi> left to correct and direct us, is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deluſion. Mat. vi. 23. 1 John ii. 4—11, and iii. 20, 21. Jude 10. All men of ſenſe know, that <hi>written laws and contracts,</hi> which ſhall be their own interpreters, are very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the adminiſtration of juſtice; and that a <hi>diſcretionary</hi> power ought not to be allowed to the beſt of judges, without great caution and circumſpection. And if <hi>a gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the righteous,</hi> how can debtors and criminals be ſuitable judges in their own cauſes? And theſe are the caſes before us.</p>
            <p>Proteſtants, as this author obſerves, generally hold,
<q>that man, being a debtor and tranſgreſſor, and unable to ſave himſelf, Jeſus Chriſt became his <hi>ſurety,</hi> under an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pay his debts, and to bear his puniſhment; the <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of which is generally reſolved into the <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of God, or accounted for from the willingneſs of Chriſt (as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent DIVINE PERSON) to ſuffer in the ſinner's ſtead.</q>
               <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 9. Theſe ideas Relly rejects,
<q>1. Becauſe (ſays he) contrary to truth, which declareth that every man ſhall die for his own ſin. 2. It is contrary to <hi>juſtice</hi> to afflict the innocent: To puniſh and deſtroy him is <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>injuſtice.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Book,</hi> p. 3.4. To confirm theſe ſtrange aſſertions, he ſays,
<q>I know not of any human laws, which admit of ſuretyſhip in capital offences; and ſin is not only a debt, for which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017464_0005_0FA1216AAFC2CE80"/>
ſuretyſhip is ſometimes admitted, but a tranſgreſſion, a crime, capital in the higheſt ſenſe, only atoned for by the ſhedding of blood; by the death, yea, by the eternal death of the ſinner; which juſtice muſt inflict, before it can be properly ſatisfied; nor can it poſſibly admit of a ſurety here.</q>
P. 5. Truth is here held in unrighteouſneſs to a moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing degree! The nature of ſin, and its juſt deſert, are well expreſſed; but how daring is it for a guilty criminal to aſſert, that JEHOVAH cannot poſſibly admit of a ſurety here! Did he never read, that <hi>Jeſus was made a</hi> SURETY? <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Heb. vii. 23, 25. If men ſhould admit of ſureties in capital caſes, a double injury would enſue; namely, the loſs of an innocent perſon out of the community, and the continuance of a guilty one therein, who would be likely to do more miſchief himſelf, and alſo to encourage the like in others; which are ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they do not admit of ſureties in ſuch caſes. But infinite wiſdom has cauſed mercy and truth, righteouſneſs and peace, ſo to meet in Jeſus, who had power to lay down his life, and power to take it again (John x. 18.) that no loſs is ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the community; while the evil of ſin appears greater in his ſufferings, than it could have done in the eternal damnation of all the human race. O! how gloriouſly does a true fight of him relieve the guilty polluted criminal, raiſing his ſoul up to union and grateful obedience, while it demonſtrates that ſin cannot go unpuniſhed, ſince it could not eſcape the vengeance of the Father, when found upon his darling Son! But how far was our opponent from ſuch views, union, or obedience?</p>
            <p>Becauſe Adam was created with the whole of human nature in him, and after Eve was formed ſhe became one fleſh with him, called by one name, and under one law, Relly ſays,
<q>ſimilar with this, the church exiſted in Chriſt; <hi>according as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world,</hi> having this purpoſe and grace given us in him, before the world began. The man and woman, under this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had but one name: He called <hi>their name Adam.</hi> So Chriſt and his church in this union bear one name; both are called the Lord our righteouſneſs. He, Jer. xxiii. 6; ſhe, Jer. xxxiii. 16: We the righteouſneſs of God in him. 2 Cor. v. 21. The Lord God covenanting with Adam, as the head of the earthly creation, as having the woman in himſelf, drew a <hi>figure</hi> of his covenant with Chriſt, as having the church exiſting in him, he as the head engaging for his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017464_0006_0FA1216B7010CF40"/>
members; as the huſband for his wife, as the king for his ſubjects, as the root for its branches,</q>
&amp;c. P. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>How ſurprizing is this! Union in nature, prior to choice, and union by choice and free contracts, are as diſtinct things as any in the world; yet here they are <hi>confounded</hi> together, and his whole ſcheme is built upon this <hi>confuſion.</hi> The original of all union is the SACRED THREE, who are eternally one in nature, prior to any idea of choice, and ever freely act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that nature. In ſix days he created the heavens and the earth, and all things therein, <hi>by the word of his power.</hi> Of the earth it is well ſaid, that,
<q>ever ſince the week of creative wonders, God hath ordered all theſe creatures to fill the world with inhabitants of their own kind; and they have obeyed him in a long ſucceſſion of almoſt ſix thouſand years. And it is evident, that he has kept a reſerve of <hi>ſovereignty</hi> to himſelf, and has diſplayed the enſigns of it in ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant hours. Nature is the art of God, and it muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be unrivalled by the ſons of men. <hi>Yet man can produce a man.</hi> Admirable effect, but artleſs cauſe! A poor, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, inferior agent! The plant and the brute in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are his rivals, and his equals too. The human parent and the parent-bird form their own images with equal ſkill, and are confined each to his work.—Let the atheiſt then exert his utmoſt ſtretch of underſtanding, let him try the force of all his mechanical powers, to compoſe the wing of a butterfly, or the meaneſt feather of a ſparrow; let him labour and ſweat, and faint, and acknowledge his own weakneſs; then let him turn his eye, look at thoſe wondrous compoſures, his ſon or his little daughter; and when their infant tongues ſhall enquire of him, and ſay, <hi>father, who made us?</hi> let him not dare to aſſume the honor of that work to himſelf, but teach the young creatures that <hi>there is a God,</hi> and fall down on his face, and repent and worſhip <note n="*" place="bottom">Wa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The man I am anſwering was very far from ſuch diſtinct views or diſpoſitions; for having quoted 1 Cor. xi. 11, and 1 Tim. ii. 14, he ſays of Adam and Eve,
<q>his union unto her made it equitable for the curſe and condemnation of her folly to fall upon him; and that <hi>without</hi> the conſideration of <hi>his conſent</hi> and compliance with her. In like manner, Chriſt the huſband <hi>was not deceived</hi>; but his wife, the church, being deceived, was in the tranſgreſſion. Yet as the union was ſuch, that Chriſt was not without the church, nor the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017464_0007_0FA1216C2ECDD3A8"/>
church without him <note n="‖" place="bottom">Had the creature a real exiſtence from eternity!</note>, <hi>at any time,</hi> it was equitable for her curſe and condemnation to fall upon him.</q>
P. 13. To which I anſwer, that to pretend that after Eve was formed ſhe became one fleſh with Adam, without mutual choice, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural and irrational; and it is more ſo, to imagine that her ſin could have become his without his conſent; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that our ſin and its curſe could have fallen upon Chriſt, without his free choice, is ſuch an abſurdity and ſuch blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as will forever want a name! A man cannot be made <hi>one fleſh</hi> with a harlot without his conſent; but he that is joined to the Lord is <hi>one ſpirit.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 16, 17. And though men commit <hi>adultery,</hi> yet Chriſt never will. No ſoul can ever be married to him, till it is delivered from pre-engagements. Naturally we are all <hi>wedded</hi> to <hi>do and live,</hi> as much as ever a wife was to an huſband; but we muſt become dead to that, and that to us, in order to be married to Chriſt. The conceit of ſome life in us, at leaſt to make an honeſt cry for mercy in diſtreſs, is never given up, till the holy Spirit demonſtrates to the ſoul, that the <hi>law is holy, and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good</hi>; and that in us there is <hi>no good thing.</hi> In this way <hi>ſin revives, and we die.</hi> By the body of Chriſt, <hi>that alſo becomes dead wherein we were held.</hi> Viewing how he bear our ſins in his own body on the tree, our imaginary life expires; and the proceſs againſt us is alſo at an end; ſince Chriſt is <hi>the end of the law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi> Thus we become dead to the law by the body of Chriſt, that we ſhould be married to him who was raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God; we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in <hi>newneſs of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter.</hi> Rom. vii. 1—12, and x. 4. The oldneſs of the letter gives no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come to God, without holineſs and obedience in ourſelves; the newneſs of the ſpirit teacheth ſouls to come through Jeſus, for pardon, cleanſing and ſtrength to live to him. According to the oldneſs of the letter, every defect in us lays a bar in the way of coming; but by the newneſs of the ſpirit, every ſin and every enemy are ſo many reaſons to move us to <hi>come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy; and find grace to help in time of need.</hi> Heb. iv. 16.</p>

entertain ſuch a notion. Yet Relly ſays;
<q>man being the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel marred between the potter's hands, was not rejected, but here was made another and better veſſel; where the nature, once ſpoiled by ſin, was born into the world pure and ſpotleſs, and called the Son of God.</q>
P. 27.
<q>As the head was never without the body, nor the body without the head, in the Lord, the body hath always been, by union with the head, entitled unto all the bleſſings, honors, and glories thereof. If it is not true until our believing, and by means thereof, then doth believing make that a truth which was not a truth, and faith creates its own object, and then embraces it. This looks like the heathen idolatry, firſt making their gods, and then truſting in them.</q>
P. 35. This is a darling topic with him; but I am quite willing to meet him, and to try the matter out fairly upon his own ground; in order whereto we muſt remember the difference there is betwixt faith and hope. Hope is fixed upon promiſed bleſſings; but faith regards all revealed truth, be the ſame deſirable or terrible to us. The creation, ſupport, government, and final diſſolution of this world, by the <hi>word of God,</hi> are all objects of faith; as alſo are everlaſting puniſhments to the wicked, and eternal life to the righteous. But of this the <hi>ſcoffers</hi> of theſe laſt days are <hi>willingly ignorant.</hi> Heb. i. 3, and xi. 1—6. 2 Pet. ii. 3—7. Becauſe the word goſpel ſignifies good news, they imagine that none preach it, but ſuch as prophecy <hi>ſmooth things,</hi> and cry, <hi>peace, peace,</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men. Iſai. xxx. 8—11. Jer. viii. 11. The latter part of the pamphlet before us turns entirely upon this point; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit whereof is eaſily diſcovered.</p>
            <p>For to hear of the heaven ſerpent was very good news to the poiſoned Iſraelites, and ſo was the city of refuge to the manſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as pardon alſo was to criminals <hi>juſtly condemned,</hi> and free forgiveneſs to debtors who had <hi>nothing to pay.</hi> But, according to the above reaſoning, they muſt have been told, that health was as really theirs before they looked as afterwards, or elſe looking made the object they looked to! John iii. 14, 15. Safety is as truly yours before you fly as afterwards, or elſe fleeing to the city, makes the city you fly to, which had no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before! Heb. vi. 18. Pardon and forgiveneſs were as really yours before you received them as ſince, or elſe giving in to the equity of the indictment and the accounts, and receiving a diſcharge therefrom, created the whole affair, which had no exiſtence before! Pſalm li. 3—8. Luke vii. 41, 42. Yet, ſpeaking of Adam and his poſterity, Relly ſays,
<q>his ſin, its curſe and fruit, was theirs, before they felt it, knew it, or ever
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017464_0009_0FA1216DAEE956A0"/>
were conſcious of exiſtence. Thus, by one man's diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, many were made ſinners. In like manner, Chriſt's righteouſneſs is upon all his ſeed, by his <hi>ſingle act,</hi> before they had any capacity of obeying, after the ſimilitude of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or of aſſenting to what he did, or ſuffered: This mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts ſuch an union to him, ſuch an incluſion of the whole ſeed in him, as renders his condition theirs, in every ſtate which he paſſes through—<hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
               </q>
P. 14.</p>
            <p>The words of the text contradict the poſition he would prove by it. For it ſpeaks of our concern in Adam's ſin as a <hi>paſt event,</hi> but of life by Chriſt as what <hi>ſhall be</hi> hereafter. And in Rom. v. 12—20, while the ſacred writer declares a likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our two public heads in ſome things, he repeatedly aſſerts an unlikeneſs in others. What they each did as public heads, belongs to all their ſeed; but as to what they did, and the way how it comes to their ſeed, there is an infinite diſparity betwixt them. By <hi>one offence</hi> Adam brought us all into a ſtate of revolt from God, ſo that as we come into the world we all love the creature more than the Creator, love ſelf above him, till we are born again, and death comes upon us by <hi>law</hi> as a juſt <hi>debt</hi>; but <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and abundance of <hi>grace</hi> are <hi>received</hi> as a <hi>free gift.</hi> As ſoon as Adam fell, he ceaſed to be our covenant head, ſo that we are not anſwerable for any of his after ſins, any more than for the ſins of other men that we allow of; but Chriſt is the unchangeable ſurety of all his choſen, and is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt. From a ſtate of union and communion with God, and lordſhip over the earth, Adam by <hi>one act</hi> ruſhed into rebellion and miſery; but by freely aſſuming our nature, and taking our law-place, Jeſus ſaves from the dreadful guilt and power of <hi>many offences.</hi> By one act a fire might be kindled, enough to lay a city in ruins, and a little infection might ſpread the plague through a kingdom; but how great muſt the work be to ſtop the conflagration or contagion, and to reſtore health and proſperity again? Therefore it is ſtrictly true, that <hi>where ſin abounded, grace</hi> DID MUCH MORE <hi>abound.</hi> The word <hi>as,</hi> in 1 Cor. xv. 22, plainly points to the two heads, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that proceeds therefrom. <hi>As</hi> by Adam's ſin a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is communicated to his poſterity, which cauſes the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies; <hi>even</hi> ſo is the gift of righteouſneſs, a new nature, and the reſurrection of the body, communicated by Chriſt to his ſeed. <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> And let it never be forgotten, that death comes upon all as our <hi>juſt wages</hi>; but eternal life as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017464_0010_0FA1216E6F284400"/>
a <hi>free gift.</hi> Rom. vi. 23. No two ideas are more diſtinct, nor more eaſily underſtood by common people. All the bleſſings of ſalvation were provided by covenant in Chriſt, before the world began; but the only way for any to enjoy them, is by receiving them freely by faith.</p>
            <p>Upon this Relly ſays,
<q>believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved, is certainly ſimilar unto, <hi>do this and live</hi>; man, in himſelf, being as capable of doing the one as the other.</q>
P. 42. I am ſenſible that many would have it ſo; but they can never accompliſh their deſire, till they can make wages and a free gift to be the ſame thing; nor till partaking freely of a rich feaſt, can be the ſame as working hard to earn it. Neither can the plea of inability excuſe thoſe who <hi>make light</hi> of the goſpel call, till their natural faculties of hearing, ſeeing and taſting, are gone, inſtead of being fixed upon objects oppoſite to what they ſhould be. Mat. xiii. 15, and xxii. 1—12. Luke xiv. 16—24. Natural inability often excuſes from blame; but moral inability is the very ſoul of iniquity. The cauſe why we cannot love God ſupremely, is becauſe we love the creature above him, which is the eſſence of idolatry; and the reaſon why we cannot believe his truth, is becauſe it reproves our evil deeds, the works of darkneſs, which we <hi>love rather than light.</hi> Hence moral impotency to love God, and to believe the record he has given of his Son, is <hi>the condemnation</hi> which all unbelievers are under; and his <hi>wrath abideth on them</hi>; from which nothing but a <hi>receiving his teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>ſetting to their ſeal that he is true,</hi> can deliver any ſoul. John iii. 18—21, 34—36. Our perſonal intereſt is not the direct object of faith, but the conſequence and privilege which is received by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as looking is the way of enjoying the light, and looking to the object that Moſes ſet up by divine direction, was the way whereby the poiſon of the fiery ſerpents was expelled. If any who were bitten refuſed to look to that object, the poiſon killed them, while the nature and efficacy of the remedy was as good to thoſe who looked, as if none had refuſed it.</p>
            <p>Material bodies are dark things, and are often made uſe of to ſhut out the light, by ſuch as hate it, and love darkneſs rather than light. And is not this the labour of the writer I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering? The head, ſays he, was never without the body in the Lord; as if the creature was co-exiſtent with the Son of God! David ſays, <hi>Thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being</hi> IMPER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECT, <hi>and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance</hi> WERE <hi>faſhioned, when as yet there was</hi> NONE OF THEM. Pſalm cxxxix. 16. The whole plan of all his works
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017464_0011_0FA1216F2E529CB0"/>
and diſpenſations, and their ultimate end, is abſolutely perfect. <hi>Nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God doth it, that men ſhould fear before him.</hi> Eccl. iii. 14. Should <hi>ſerve him acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Heb. xii. 28. But Relly's ſcheme is ſo contrary hereto, that he ſays,
<q>the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of fear is diametrically oppoſite to the obedience of faith, —for where the fear of puniſhment is judged neceſſary to obedience, unbelief is eſtabliſhed.—But the obedience of faith is genuine, free from artifice, <hi>without fear,</hi> Jude 12, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on the perfect amity of God.—The true obedience of faith, is ſo far from being urged <hi>by fear,</hi> Heb. xi. 7, that it would <hi>annihilate it.</hi>
               </q>
P. 38, 39. He knew this to be contrary to the plain language of revelation; but ſays he,
<q>unto the right underſtanding of the ſcriptures, it is neceſſary to know, that they conſiſt of two parts, <hi>letter</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or <hi>law</hi> and <hi>goſpel.</hi>
               </q>
P. 39.
<q>The goſpel gives us all, without requiring aught of us <note n="*" place="bottom">The truth is, that the goſpel requires all, and gives all; it ſays, <hi>I will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—and they ſhall.</hi> Heb. <hi>viii. 8—12.</hi>
                  </note>; but the law, giving us nothing, requires all of us. And thus diſtinguiſhing them in the ſcriptures, we appeal from the law unto the goſpel; our authority for ſo doing is founded on what follows; whatſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith unto them that are under it: But Jeſus was made of a woman, made under the law, therefore the law ſpeaks to him, and commands him to perfect obedience. But, the law can only curſe the ſinner: God ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, he was made ſin for us, Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us: The equity of which proceeding, appears from the union ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Chriſt and the church, of which I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſpoken. Nor dare we read any one threatening in the ſcriptures, againſt the ſinner and ungodly, <hi>unto ourſelves,</hi> out of him, becauſe we <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>cannot endure it.</hi>
               </q>
P. 40. And ſpeaking of the ſword of the ſpirit, he ſays,
<q>Jeſus, ſheathing it in his own heart's blood, the divine glutinating power thereof hath rendered it impoſſible to draw it again to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther execution: God is juſt and true, and will not; men or devils cannot.</q>
P. 48.
<q>In this light we can read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with pleaſure—we alſo read them profitably, foraſmuch as ſpeaking thus of Chriſt, they <hi>huſh and baniſh the fears</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from nature or temptation.</q>
P. 49.
<q>Did men but know what ſafety and peace we have here, they would deſpair
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017464_0012_0FA12170EFE707F0"/>
of terrifying us, as they hope to do, by their writings and preachments; loading us with opprobrious names, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly levelling the <hi>threatenings</hi> and <hi>curſes</hi> in the ſcripture againſt <hi>us</hi>; beholding <hi>him</hi> to be the death of death, and victory of hell.</q>
P. 48.</p>
            <p>This is the object of his worſhip, the faith he has eagerly embraced; but the difference between his god and the God of Iſrael, is very great. For the God of Iſrael connected his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and promiſes together, and called it <hi>preſumption,</hi> and <hi>tempting</hi> of him, to expect the latter without regarding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And when the <hi>god of this world</hi> came to <hi>tempt</hi> our Saviour, he made juſt ſuch a diſtinction in the ſcriptures as this writer does; but he had <hi>nothing in Jeſus</hi> that could <hi>reconcile</hi> him to ſuch an object of worſhip. No, Jeſus ſtill kept to what was <hi>written,</hi> comparing one part with the other, and ſaid, <hi>the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be broken.</hi> Deut. i. 43, and vi. 16, 17. Pſalm xci. 11, 12. Mat. iv. 6, 7. John x. 35. 2 Cor. iv. 4. Therefore, <hi>their rock is not our rock, even our enemies themſelves being judges.</hi> Deut. xxxii. 31—33.

                        <p n="10">10. Where mankind are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſcriptures—they look into themſelves; thus enquiring, have I Chriſt? do I love God, and hate iniquity? am I changed? am I humble, heavenly-minded, thirſting to be more holy, and lamenting my faults? do I increaſe in light, knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?

<q>hath introduced groſs enthuſiaſm, ſelf-righteouſneſs, bigotry and ſuperſtition, among the more zealouſly religious part of mankind; and among ſuch who are leſs concerned, deiſm, with all the pride of moral virtues. This (ſays he) is that ſpirit which I ſet my face againſt.</q>
P. 58. Upon which I would obſerve, that when John ſent two of his diſciples to Jeſus, to enquire whether he was the Meſſiah or not? though Jeſus had the beſt right to be believed of any man in the world, yet he referred them to evidence, inſtead of ſtrong aſſertions. Mat. xi. 4—6. Which is a precious example for us all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and if we do ſo, will not the characters Relly has caſt upon others turn back upon himſelf! What is enthuſiaſm, but a conceit of knowing the will of God better than he has declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in his written word, and an obſtinate and unreaſonable attachment to inward imaginations and ſuggeſtions of a contrary nature? And what is deiſm, but the ſetting up of our reaſon above divine revelation, ſo as to receive nothing for truth but what ſuits this <hi>inward rule?</hi> And is not Mr. Relly guilty of theſe evils? He glories in the ſyſtem he has publiſhed, as being a <hi>new diſcovery,</hi> the like whereto he had never before ſeen; and he denies the poſſibility of his being an enemy to <hi>morally</hi> good works, while in the ſame place he aſſerts that mankind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing works <hi>ſpiritually good</hi> at any time. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> p. 4, 5, 14. And he has diſcovered ſuch meekneſs, humility, and freedom from bigotry, towards ſome of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, that he ſays,
<q>they did not underſtand the matter they wrote againſt, and therefore treated that with contempt which was <hi>above them,</hi> being not afraid to <hi>ſpeak evil of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi> I would always (unprovoked by their petulancy) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe with ſilence, as being <hi>beneath</hi> MY attention. I would harden my ear againſt the roarings of ignorance, and be utterly inſenſible of their invectives; it being ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to fret at the <hi>barkings of a our,</hi> when it is the nature of the animal to be noiſy.—For my part, after having ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the Pope of Rome, I can never ſubmit to any infallible chair of an <hi>inferior</hi> ſort.—Reſpecting the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>ſcope</hi> of the following treatiſe, I AM ABOVE UNCERTAINTY THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IN.</q>
               <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 5, 6, 20. But if thoſe who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much above their neighbours, as champions for wiſdom

            <p>Their ſcheme is ſo far from UNION, that <hi>theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the ſpirit.</hi> They reject his operations, and turn off into ſenſuality; being ſo oppoſite to union with Jeſus, that they turn all the precepts and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſcriptures upon him, while they claim all the promiſes as their own; and ſo would make him to <hi>ſerve with their ſins, and weary him with their iniquities.</hi> Iſai. xliii. 24. They <hi>deſpiſe government.</hi> For authority to command, and ſubjects to obey, or to ſuffer for their diſobedience, is the eſſence of all government. No government can be maintained in civil ſtates, without appeals to God to avenge injuſtice, perjury and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs; therefore the teaching that his ſword cannot be drawn to another execution, is an attempt to tear up all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the root. <hi>Wo unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and periſhed in the gainſaying of Core.</hi> Theſe, and other parts of their character, are to be ſeen in the ſecond epiſtle of Peter, and in that of Jude. Wherein are alſo plain directions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, how to guard againſt them, to build up themſelves on their moſt holy faith, and to labour earneſtly to <hi>pull ſleepy ſouls out of the fire.</hi> The <hi>unlearned and unſtable wreſt the ſcriptures unto their own deſtruction.</hi> 2 Pet. iii. 16. And who they are may be clearly gathered from other paſſages. For to love God ſupremely, and to love our neighbours as ourſelves, are the two points whereon <hi>hang all the law and the prophets.</hi> And to cover <hi>ſelf-love</hi> with <hi>a form of godlineſs,</hi> is the practice of thoſe who are <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Mat. xxii. 37—40. 2 Tim. iii. 2, 5, 7. When Felix the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ſent for a priſoner, and heard him <hi>concerning the faith in Chriſt,</hi> the ſcene was ſuddenly changed in ſuch a manner, that the governor was arreſted as a priſoner of divine juſtice, by a warrant which was ſerved (ſo to ſpeak) by his priſoner. Felix felt himſelf <hi>unable</hi> to yield thereto, which doubtleſs proved his ruin. Acts xxiv. 24—27. Such <hi>inability</hi> is ſo far from afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any juſt excuſe, that it is a ſoul-damning crime. John iii. 18, 19, and v. 44—47. Chriſt ſays, <hi>if thine eye be evil, thy whole body ſhall be full of darkneſs. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs!</hi> Mat. vi. 23. In a very dark night glow-worms and box-fire will ſhine to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance; which in the day-light are found to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017464_0017_0FA12461B0C55230"/>
but <hi>dark inſects</hi> and <hi>rotten wood.</hi> And is Relly's ſcheme any better?</p>
            <p>Truth ſays, <hi>there is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 5. Man is the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, and the only way for <hi>reconciliation</hi> is through this mediator, whom God <hi>made ſin for us, who knew no ſin; that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 18—21. <hi>And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes.</hi> Acts xiii 39. <hi>Him that believeth on him that juſtifieth the</hi> UNGODLY, HIS <hi>faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. iv. 5. But the faith taught by Relly is oppoſite thereto, in the eſſential points following. 1. The faith of the goſpel is built upon the free mercy of the Father, through the merits of the Son, by the influences of the Holy Spirit; which is the only way of acceſs to God. John xiv. 6. Eph. ii. 18. But Relly ſays,
<q>the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of juſtice is always its own rule of acting; and it cannot admit of the innocent's being puniſhed, nor of the tranſgreſſor's being acquitted.</q>
P. 4. If ſo, then Chriſt could not have <hi>ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> 1 Pet. iii. 18. Therefore, 2, the faith of the goſpel moves the believer to take all the ſhame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ever to give all the glory of his ſalvation to God, in practice as well as pretence. But while Relly pretends to do ſo, he in reality would have people <hi>crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> For if juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not puniſh the innocent, he would have people treat Jeſus as a guilty perſon from day to day, ſince he teaches them, as I have proved, to turn all the precepts, threatenings and curſes of ſcripture upon him. And, under pretence of aſcribing great honor to Jeſus, Relly mentions Noah, Lot, Abraham, Sarah, Moſes, David, Solomon, and Job, who are honorably ſpoken of in ſcripture, while ſtill their imperfections are expoſed; and ſays thereon,
<q>thoſe men were all types of Jeſus, their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters figurative of his.</q>
P. 53. But leſt he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from hence of making their virtues no more than figures, he ſays,
<q>thoſe perſons were really what the ſcriptures ſay they were, that is, righteous, faithful, meek, holy, wiſe, patient, &amp;c. without any exception; they were ſo in Chriſt.</q>
P. 54. That is, as they were imperfect, they were types of Chriſt; but at the ſame time they were really perfect in him! I challenge all Relly's admirers to make any better ſenſe of his words than this if they can; which is ſo oppoſite to the truth that no prieſt in Iſrael, who had any blemiſh in his birth or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017464_0018_0FA124626FA7EBB0"/>
might approach to God's altar. Levit. xxi. 9—23. Nehem. vii. 64, 65. And thoſe who offered any creature upon it that was defective, were <hi>curſed deceivers.</hi> Mal. i. 13, 14. 3. The faith of the goſpel teaches miniſters rightly to <hi>divide the word of truth,</hi> and to give each of their hearers <hi>their portion of meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 15. Luke xii. 42. But Relly, through his whole treatiſe, takes paſſages of ſcripture which are peculiar to the ſaints, or the church of God which he hath choſen out of the world, and applies them to all the human race without diſtinction; and his main ſtrength lies in this <hi>confuſion,</hi> together with an appearance of oppoſing many dangerous errors. And ſays he,
<q>where people are taught to diſtinguiſh between ſaints and ſinners, and to think themſelves holier than their neighbours, it is not ſtrange that they uſe them ill.—And to talk of <hi>practice,</hi> without keeping the <hi>whole law,</hi> is ſuch a deception, where ſcripture authority is admitted, yea or even what reaſon ſuggeſts of the nature of the divine Being, as cannot be accounted for, but by the pride, bewitchery and madneſs, which we are naturally involved in.</q>
               <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> p. 13.</p>
            <p>But one ſhort queſtion may turn theſe characters back upon him who caſt them out; which is this; are ſouls reconciled to God as his ſubjects, or not? While he remains the Sovereign of the Univerſe, no rational ſoul can ever think, ſpeak, or act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his holy law, without contracting guilt to itſelf; which can only be removed by the atonement of Chriſt, applied by the Holy Spirit; who calls us daily to pray, <hi>forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</hi> But Relly ſays,
<q>we claim no good out of him, nor <hi>will</hi> we acknowledge the evil, foraſmuch as in him we <hi>have been purged.</hi>
               </q>
P. 53. This may well remind us of them who <hi>ſpeak evil of the things which they know not; but what they know naturally as brute beaſts; in thoſe things they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves.</hi> Jude 10. Oxen know their owners, and not only come daily to their maſters for food, but alſo do them great ſervice; and ſome will come many rods at a call or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and put their necks under the yoke. A loud reproof to our diſobedient ſouls. Iſai. i. 3, 4. Jer. xxxi. 18—20. The laſt of theſe paſſages plainly opens the way of <hi>repentance,</hi> and how mercy is received and enjoyed. Again it is ſaid, <hi>he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.</hi> 1 John v. 10, 11.
<q>From whence it is plain (ſays Relly) that he who believeth not, hath eternal life given him in the Son of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017464_0019_0FA124632DF2D910"/>
God, as fully as him who believeth; elſe it doth not appear how he could make God a liar, by not believing; nor how the unbeliever can be <hi>cenſured</hi> for not believing what was not true.</q>
P. 67. His whole ſcheme turns upon this point; therefore let the following things be carefully obſerved. 1. That all our righteouſneſs and ſtrength is <hi>in the Son; and he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.</hi> 2. He who hath it, <hi>receives it</hi> by faith as a <hi>free gift.</hi> 3. <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in earth, the ſpirit, the water, and the blood:—And he that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs</hi> IN HIMSELF. 1 John v. 8—12. Where then is the proof that Relly would draw from hence? Is not he a liar, in aſſerting that eternal life is <hi>as fully</hi> given to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, as to the believer! Sin is the worſt of poiſon, and can only be expelled by looking to the antetype of the brazen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and it is the ſpirit only that enables any to look thereto; and no other water could remove filth, or blood remove guilt, like the <hi>change</hi> which is now wrought in the believer. 2 Cor. iii. 14—18. And <hi>the ſpirit itſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit that we are the children of God.</hi> But how came any to be ſo? Anſwer, <hi>ye were the ſervants of ſin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</hi> Rom. vi. 17, and viii. 16. Such are the only perſons that Paul ſpeaks to when he ſays, <hi>reckon ye yourſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin.</hi> Rom. vi. 11. Which words Relly applies to ſuch as have a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the "life and love of ſin" in themſelves, p. 49, while he declares thoſe to be the diſciples of the falſe Chriſt, who ſay,
<q>I am converted, I believe, I bear the fruits of the ſpirit, I have the marks of grace in me.</q>
P. 56. That many ſpeak ſo, who have not the truth in them, is readily granted; and alſo that great modeſty and caution are called for in ſuch affairs. Yet God himſelf warns men againſt glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their wiſdom, might, or riches; and requires his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>glory in this, that they underſtand and know him.</hi> Jer. ix. 23, 24. 1 Cor. i. 31.</p>
            <p>Relly would be thought to be exceeding evangelical, and for that end he expoſes many dark legal things in others; and yet he was ſo oppoſite to the goſpel way of ſalvation, as to declare that God could not love any, but ſuch as
<q>he ſaw in a ſinleſs ſtate—as branches hidden in the ſtock—before their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to <hi>render</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> them objects <hi>worthy</hi> of the divine love and favour.</q>
P. 34. This may do for <hi>dreamers</hi>; but to ſouls well awake, it is harder to be receiv<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

an one could more eaſily believe, that what taſtes like bread is really fleſh and blood, than to believe that God ſees him to be in a ſinleſs ſtate, <hi>worthy of the divine favour.</hi> Thoſe who thus teach, like the Jewiſh lawyers, <hi>take away the key of knowledge.</hi> Let the ſtore be ever ſo full of bleſſings, if the creature muſt ſee ſomething to render him <hi>worthy</hi> of the divine love before it is opened, thoſe who ſee ſin as it is muſt ſink in deſpair. But when the ſoul is brought to know that God <hi>hath mercy on whom he will have mercy</hi>; and has proclaimed the ſame to the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> and that Chriſt <hi>died for his enemies, and while they were ſuch,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 15, 16. Rom. v. 8—10, this opens a glorious door of hope. Sin firſt came into our world by calling in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the verity of <hi>God's ſayings</hi>; and it has prevailed by the ſame means ever ſince. Gen. iii. 1. Deut. xxix. 19.

               <head>An Anſwer to Mr. Wincheſter.</head>
               <p>In March, 1781, we were ſurprized with a report, that Mr. Elhanan Wincheſter, who went from hence the autumn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, had fallen in with Murray's doctrine. This report he contradicted in letters to ſome of his friends, which held many in ſuſpenſe about the matter, till he publiſhed a pamphlet upon it at Philadelphia in September. I ſoon had a glance of it, but no opportunity deliberately to peruſe it till February, after which was the firſt ſight I had of Relly's treatiſe. By compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together, an eſſential difference appears betwixt them, though tending to much the ſame end; for Relly builds upon an imaginary union with Jeſus, but Wincheſter upon the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent nature of the Deity. Relly declares ſin to be an infinite evil, deſerving of infinite puniſhment; but Wincheſter treats it as a natural, and not a moral evil; as a calamity rather than a crime. Relly holds that ſalvation is already compleat in Chriſt, ſo as to exempt men from all future puniſhment; but Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter denies the need of Chriſt's blood to appeaſe any wrath in the Deity, and holds it as a medicine to purge away diſorders in nature, which are ſo great as to require the ſufferings of many ages before all will be removed. Relly rather takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all men are in Chriſt, than attempting any fair proof of it; but Wincheſter ſtates plain arguments upon it, and anſwers objections. Relly's ſcheme did not permit him to ſpeak of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for devils; but Wincheſter's points thereto. Relly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his performance as a new diſcovery, of which he had not ſeen the like; but Wincheſter makes no ſuch pretence, it being a collection out of myſtic writers; and indeed it is in nature the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017464_0021_0FA124659FA7A340"/>
ſame with the <hi>philoſophy and vain deceit</hi> of the ſecond and third centuries, which brought on the antichriſtian apoſtacy.</p>
               <p>Origen, in the third century, went a ſtep further therein than any in our land have yet done, as I have heard of.
<q>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted by the charms of the Platonic philoſophy, he ſet it up as the teſt of all religion.</q>
Said he,
<q>the ſource of many evils lies in adhering to the carnal or <hi>external</hi> part of ſcripture. Thoſe who do ſo, ſhall not attain to the kingdom of God. Let us, therefore, ſeek after the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial fruit of the word, which are <hi>hidden and myſterious.</hi> The ſcriptures are of little uſe to thoſe who underſtand them as they are <hi>written.</hi>
                  </q>
One of the errors that this carried him into was to ſay,
<q>that the torments of the damned will have an end; and that as Chriſt has been crucified in this world to ſave mankind, he is to be crucified in the next to ſave the devils<note n="*" place="bottom">Moſheim's Eccl. Hiſt. vol. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>219, 223, 476.</hi> Dublin edition.</note>.</q>
From this ſource came the doctrine of monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, purgatory, prayers for the dead, and all the reſt of the corruptions and tyrannies of Rome. Well therefore did the apoſtle ſay, to the chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt, <hi>I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 3. To admit of a <hi>duplicity</hi> of meanings in his word, which cannot be learned from what is <hi>written,</hi> by comparing one place with another, <hi>ſpiritual things with ſpiritual,</hi> raiſes ſuch <hi>miſts</hi> and <hi>clouds</hi> in the minds of men, as intercept between them and the light of truth. And when any are reſolved to proceed in that way, diſputes with them are as vain as it would be to diſpute with <hi>clouds carried about of winds,</hi> or with <hi>raging waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 13, 14. Jude 12, 13. It is alſo forbidden, becauſe it <hi>genders ſtrifes; and the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. ii. 23—26. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that an inſpired apoſtle cried, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things!</hi> May all our eyes be to heaven for direction, while we attempt ſomething of this nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> ſaid the ſerpent to our mother Eve: Which the Baptiſt church in Philadelphia publiſhed as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt Mr. Wincheſter's ſcheme, four months before his pamphlet came out. Yet he paſſed it over, till he came near to a cloſe, and then ſaid,
<q>I hardly think that thoſe who make this objection think it is any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q>
P. 53. And after ſome reaſoning upon it he ſays,

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:017464_0022_0FA1246631F77D18"/>now let the candid unbiaſſed reader judge, who moſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſerpent, thoſe who believe and teach that all the promiſes of God ſhall be fulfilled as they are ſpoken, or thoſe who explain away almoſt all their apparent meaning.</q>
P. 54. This is a proper key, to open the nature of the myſtic ſcheme. All promiſes that ſuit them, muſt be taken as they are ſpoken; their <hi>literal apparent meaning</hi> muſt be carried beyond any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions; and thoſe who would explain and limit the ſenſe, by the precepts they are connected with, or by the hiſtorical and prophetical parts of ſcripture, will ſoon be cenſured as not having "candid and unbiaſſed minds." Of this the reader may take the following ſpecimen.</p>

               <p>How could any man talk at this rate, who pretended to regard the truth of ſcripture, if he was not involved in a great miſt of darkneſs! And ſince his deſign led him to ſay ſo much about the original of things in general, and of darkneſs in particular, a few queſtions that God once put to a better man than he is, call for his notice. Says God, <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel, by</hi> WORDS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE! <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou haſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkneſs, where is the place thereof?</hi> Job xxxviii. 2—19. Such queſtions brought Job to cry, <hi>I abhor myſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> And may the writer before us ſoon meet with ſo happy a change! To promote which, or if not, to hold up light to others, I ſhall attempt briefly and plainly to explain the nature of this myſtery of iniquity. Some may think that what he has written is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that it deſerves no notice; and did all ſee the ſame as it is, I ſhould be of their mind. But the caſe is far otherwiſe. The turning points in both of theſe pamphlets have cauſed the greateſt controverſies that the world or the church have ever been perplexed with.</p>
               <p>The word arbitrary ſignifies
<q>whatever depends upon one's own <hi>will and pleaſure,</hi> any thing that may be done without giving <hi>an account of to another</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Dyche's Dictionary, at the word arbitrary.</note>.</q>
And for men to aſſume ſuch a power one over another, is very odious and pernicious; and why? becauſe darkneſs and corruption prevail moſt terribly in fallen nature. Fury, wrath and anger, make moſt horrid work in the world; and the ruling powers of the earth have often acted more like beaſts than men, for theſe fifteen hundred years;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017464_0025_0FA124686EFF6AF8"/>
yea, like the worſt ſort of beaſts; leopards, bears, and lions. Rev. xiii. 2. And who can think of attributing any thing of like nature unto God! Our feeble minds ſhrink away, and would rather believe almoſt any thing elſe, than to entertain ſuch thoughts within us. How can a Being of infinite goodneſs and love make any creature, who ſhall be miſerable without end? How can any, who receive great favours from the mediation and merits of Chriſt, be eternally loſt? And how can it be juſt with God to damn men forever for not believing his goſpel, when Adam in innocency could have no idea of atonement for the guilty, or cleanſing for the filthy? Rather than anſwer either of theſe queſtions in the affirmative, men will rack their invention, and ſtrain their thinking powers to ſuch a degree, that, like our ſtraining our ſight by looking upon the ſun, we cannot ſee the plaineſt objects. This is often the caſe with myſtic writers, and is very conſpicuous in Mr. Wincheſter. And, while he has broken himſelf againſt the rock moſt terribly, many ſerious perſons feel a trembling about the matter, not knowing what will be the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Having read his text, which is Gen. iii. 15, he ſays,
<q>theſe words contain the firſt opening of the glorious goſpel day to poor loſt man.—In order to have proper ideas of the glorious Deity, we muſt conſider him as a Being poſſeſſed of infinite wiſdom, power, and goodneſs.</q>
But immediately goes on to deny that fury, wrath, or anger, could ever dwell in him; for, ſays he,
<q>wherever fury is found, ſelfiſhneſs, envy and pride; are joined therewith: Theſe are the four elements of hell, or fallen nature, and mutually generate each other.</q>
P. 3. All this is in one page, at his beginning. But as we muſt look cautiouſly towards the ſun, if we would enjoy its light and benefits, inſtead of being ſo haſty in determining what is not in God, let us look a little into ourſelves. Is it poſſible for a man to love his wife, children or friends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hating the wretch that would murder them? And is it poſſible for any ſoul to love truth and goodneſs, without hating deceit and cruelty? And are not love and hatred acts of will? And when we are enabled to accompliſh any work we engage in, are we not pleaſed with it? Yea, and if the work be right, is it not right to be pleaſed with it? And, if wicked wretches oppoſe what is right, is it not right to hate ſuch oppoſition? How then could a man read thoſe words of God, <hi>I will put en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and then go on and aſſert four times over in his ſermon, that there was nothing arbitrary, that is, nothing of <hi>will or pleaſure</hi> in the whole affair! Adam's trial was not arbitrary, the threatening was not arbitrary, the remedy was not arbitrary,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017464_0026_0FA1246933EA19A0"/>
and puniſhment upon ſinners is not arbitrary! Immediately after the laſt of theſe aſſertions, he ſays,
<q>Oh, would they conſider that the ſcripture never repreſents the atonement of Chriſt, as intended to quench or put out a wrath that was riſen in the Deity; but to break the power of death in us, and to overcome the wrath of fallen nature; to raiſe a new life in our ſouls, and to bring both fallen nature and creatures back into their firſt ſtate of purity and perfection.</q>
To confirm which he ſays,
<q>it was evident when our Saviour died, that his blood had a phyſical power over nature, by the effects it produced, in cauſing the earth to ſhake, the rocks to rend, and the graves to open.</q>
P. 16. Before this he had mentioned our Saviour's warning againſt deceivers, who cried, lo, here, or lo, there. Luke xvii. 20, 21. Upon which Wincheſter ſays,
<q>here Chriſt himſelf called the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees to behold, that the kingdom of God was <hi>within them</hi>; and if within thoſe, who are elſewhere called ſerpents and vipers, and threatened with the damnation of hell, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in all mankind. This divine ſeed is the only begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and poſſibility of a new life; and unleſs the means of grace can reach that hidden ſpark, they can do us no good. And it is alſo certain, that unleſs there was a ſeed hidden in our ſouls, capable of being raiſed up by the power and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Chriſt, nothing from without could take any effect upon us, or raiſe up the <hi>divine life in us,</hi> any more than the ſun, air and water, of this world, could cauſe a flint to vegetate like a corn of wheat, or any other ſeed.</q>
P. 8, 9. He is ſo far from denying that God has a will, that he ſays he
<q>continually manifeſts a will of infinite goodneſs towards all his creatures, according to their various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; ſeeking their recovery and compleat reſtoration.</q>
P. 3. Without which he ſays,
<q>the good news which Chriſt commanded to be preached to every creature is mockery, inſult, and inſincerity.</q>
P. 17.</p>
               <p>Here is a lively ſpecimen of myſtic philoſophy, and myſtic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. And it has two things in it, that are very charming to many. One is, that it is calculated to guard againſt thinking that either God or man act with bad deſigns towards each other. The other is, that it raiſes a hope that they will all be reconciled, and come into perfect agreement and happineſs at laſt; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding very bad things have <hi>inevitably</hi> interrupted their peace, and made dreadful works between them, which are not likely to be all removed for many ages to come. If ſo great a good can be obtained, who would not exert all his powers to promote it, and to guard againſt things that contradict it, and would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017464_0027_0FA12469EF62B4F0"/>
it? As I take it, theſe are the principal cauſes for the prevalence of that ſyſtem in the world, for ſo long a time, and to ſo great a degree; and alſo why thoſe who appear againſt it are called noiſy curs, and by many other hard names. But when men have done their beſt, and done their worſt, one great difficulty has ſtill lain in their way, which they never could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and it is not likely that they ever will. And that is, that God has ſaid, <hi>I will put enmity between the two ſeeds</hi>; and there it remains, in ſuch a fixed manner, that the labours of near ſix thouſand years have not removed it, nor brought the two parties a whit nearer together than they were when the war began. Neither is it within my power to believe, that the enmity will ever be removed to eternity. And I think that Paul was of the ſame mind. Rom. ix. 13—23. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the ſame objections were then made againſt his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as are often made in this day; which all centre to this point, <hi>why doth he yet find fault? for who hath ever reſiſted his will?</hi> If he doth his will and pleaſure through the univerſe, and is not obliged to give us any better reaſon therefor than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ſo it ſeemed good in his ſight,</hi> Mat. xi. 26, then why does he find fault with any for acting as they pleaſe? Since theſe things have perplexed the greateſt minds, and puzzled the greateſt capacities upon earth, it certainly becomes ſo poor a creature as the writer is to proceed with great reverence and caution.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I take notice, that the arguments upon this ſublime ſubject are generally from the leſs <hi>againſt</hi> the greater; but that there have been a few in every age, who have argued from the leſs <hi>to</hi> the greater; and the latter appears the prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way to me, eſpecially when I ſee what approbation my Saviour gave to it. When he was perſonally upon earth, a Roman captain had a ſervant that was dear to him, who was taken ſick; therefore the captain ſent to Jeſus for his help, which he was ready to grant; upon information whereof the captain ſent again, ſaying, <hi>Lord, trouble not thyſelf, for I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt enter under my roof. Wherefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought I myſelf worthy to came unto thee: But ſay in a word, and my ſervant ſhall be healed. For I alſo am a man ſet under authority, having under me ſoldiers, and I ſay unto one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my ſervant, do this, and he doth it.</hi> Luke vii. 6—8. Now it appears to me that the captain, like other rational men, received the thinking reaſoning faculty in a natural way; but I am perſuaded that he had not ſo much as the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>this</hi> way of reaſoning, till it was <hi>given him from above.</hi> And the foregoing treatiſe of Mr. Relly
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017464_0028_0FA1246AB19DA518"/>
confirms this ſentiment; ſince, as has been obſerved, after all his high notions of union, he denies the poſſibility of God's loving any but ſuch as he ſaw <hi>worthy</hi> of it. If ſo, the Roman captain could not have been highly commended by Jeſus, for twice over denying that himſelf was <hi>worthy</hi> of God's free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And I remember that a perſon of good credit in old times ſaid, <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not</hi> IN HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF. Jer. x. 23. And that another, by good authority, called the ſinner to <hi>forſake his way and thoughts,</hi> and to <hi>turn to</hi> HIM, whoſe <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>ways</hi> are as <hi>high above ours,</hi> as the heavens are above the earth. Iſai. lv. 7—9. And, if I miſtake not, the very nature of faith carries us off from ſelf, to the truth of another; from truſting in an arm of fleſh, to truſt wholly in the Lord. And perſons of a contrary character <hi>ſee not when good cometh.</hi> Jer. xvii. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>This was the caſe with the Phariſees. Though they were at the head of the only church of God then in the world, yet they were ready to liſten to the lo, here, or lo, there, of deceivers, at the time when the promiſed Meſſiah was <hi>within them</hi>; or in the <hi>midſt of them,</hi> as others render the words. He was then within that church, perfectly obeying all the laws which God had given to it, and fulfilling the prophecies concerning him. By his <hi>kingly power</hi> he daily cauſed the blind to ſee, the lame to walk, lepers to become clean, the deaf to hear, the dead to live, and the poor to have the goſpel preached to them. All which gave <hi>offence</hi> to thoſe who imagined that they had an <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent power</hi> to walk to the temple, to cleanſe themſelves, to hear and live. Mat. xi. 3—19. If the ſeed ſpoken of in the firſt promiſe of ſalvation, meant any intellectual power in every man, no reaſon can be given for its being called the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> the weaker veſſel. But when we ſee Jeſus, who was born of a virgin, without the knowledge of man, the words appear full of important meaning. To prepare his way in Iſrael, <hi>all fleſh was cried down as fading-graſs</hi>; yea, as <hi>leſs than nothing, and vanity,</hi> before him. And Peter aſſures us, that ſouls are <hi>born again of this ſeed.</hi> Iſai. xl. 6—17. 1 Pet. i. 23—25. The change is wrought by <hi>receiving with meekneſs the ingrafted word.</hi> James i. 21. Each metaphor beſpeaks and vital union with the truth we were ſtangers to before <note n="*" place="bottom">Relly ſeems to be fond of the ſimilitude of the vine and its branches; but his ideas roſe no higher than "native branches." P. <hi>22.</hi> Whereas we can have no good hope through grace, without being ingrafted <hi>contrary to nature,</hi> ſo as to <hi>ſtand by faith.</hi> Rom. <hi>xi. 20, 24.</hi> No branch can grow and be fruitful, but by union and communion with the vine; and Chriſt aſſures us how that is. For, ſays he, <hi>if ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</hi> This is <hi>holding the head.</hi> Profeſſors of a contrary character will be caſt into the flames. Iſai. <hi>xxvii. 4—11.</hi> John <hi>xv. 6, 10.</hi> Col. <hi>ii. 10, 19.</hi>
                  </note>. And it might as well be argued, that a woman may bear children without the knowledge of man, or that a rich ſoil can bear wheat without ſowing any therein, as that any ſoul can be

ſaved without <hi>ſupernatural revelation.</hi> The angels of light ſaw much more of God, after he was <hi>manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> than they ever did before. 1 Tim. iii. 16. Eph. iii. 10; 11. What madneſs muſt it then be in fallen men, to ſet up reaſon againſt the word of God! But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How can it be, that a God of infinite love ſhould give exiſtence to any creatures who ſhall be miſerable without end? If any aſk this queſtion without due fear and reverence, let them turn and conſider how they can anſwer God's queſtions to them. Iſai. xl. 12—28. Rom. ix. 20—23. The command is, <hi>let all things be done decently and in order</hi>; but this word has often been perverted, to promote the greateſt diſorders upon earth. Glaſs is the beſt medium we have to let light into our dwellings, and fire will penetrate into rocks, and break them to pieces. Therefore theſe metaphors are made uſe of to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the excellency of the word of God. 2 Cor. iii. 18, and iv. 2—4. Jer. xxiii. 29. When the earth intercepts between us and the ſun, it is dark in our windows, as well as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And ſuch is the effect, when human inventions, or any earthly object, gets between our ſouls and the Son of righteouſneſs. The number of the beaſt is the <hi>number of a man</hi>; and John ſaw <hi>as it were</hi> a ſea of glaſs mingled with fire; and thoſe who had gotten a compleat victory over that number ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon, <hi>having the harps of God.</hi> And they ſing the ſong of Moſes, lawgiver to Iſrael, and the ſong of the Lamb, who is our lawgiver, judge, and king. Rev. xiii. 18, and xv. 2, 3. Iſai. xxxiii. 22. <hi>As it were,</hi> plainly ſhews that the words are to be taken in a figurative ſenſe; but the myſtics take them <hi>literally,</hi> for the <hi>matter</hi> that angels and men were made out of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This <hi>confounding</hi> of matter and mind together, is no little part of <hi>myſtery Babylon.</hi> Though a ſtill more horrid part is, their <hi>confounding</hi> of creatures with their Creator! Fire, light, and animal ſpirits, are all objects of ſenſe: Yet the myſtics aſſert, that they are <hi>images</hi> of the Triune God. P. 4. This is ſo oppoſite to truth, that he ſaid to Iſrael, <hi>ye ſaw no manner of ſimilitude on the day that the Lord ſpake unto you in Horeb, out of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017464_0030_0FA1246CEFE49308"/>
the midſt of the fire; take heed therefore leſt ye corrupt yourſelves.</hi> Deut. iv. 15, 16. Yet men, even to this day, are bewitched with ſuch corruptions. The conceit that <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> was Adam's firſt wife, and that meats and a woman were afterwards given him to ſatisfy his <hi>luſts,</hi> and to prevent worſe evils, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried many gloomy heads, in eaſtern climes, away from human ſociety, and the duties thereof, into ſolitary places, in ſearch after that wiſdom. By degrees this was improved into nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, celibacy of the clergy, and their arbitrary prohibition of meats—Canons which were often diſpenſed with for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and meats and women were allowed of, to prevent worſe evils. Thus <hi>many departed from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of devils; ſpeaking lies in hypocriſy, having their conſcience feared with a hot iron: Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them who believe and know the truth.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 1—3.</p>
               <p>A ſpirit can think, ſpeak and act; and the actions or works of God are evidently intended by his <hi>back parts,</hi> which are plainly ſeen by believers, though no man can <hi>ſee his face and live.</hi> Exod. xxxiii. 20—23. When a creature's thoughts, words and actions, exactly agree together, he exhibits the brighteſt image of God that we know of; but to talk one thing, while they think and act the reverſe, is preciſely the image of the devil. A notable inſtance hereof appears in a company from Europe, with a woman at their head, who began openly two years ago to propagate the above <hi>doctrine of devils</hi> in the county of Albany, with great <hi>power, ſigns, and lying wonders.</hi> 2 Theſſ. ii. 7—12. They prevailed ſo far thereby laſt ſummer, as to make their head-quarters at Harvard, in Worceſter county, at a houſe where Shadrach Ireland had been at the head of a like deluſion for many years before. The doctrine, both of Balaam and Jezebel, was to draw people into ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and worſhip objects of ſenſe. <hi>To ſeduce my ſervants,</hi> ſays Jeſus, <hi>to commit fornication, and to eat things ſacrificed unto idols.</hi> Rev. ii. 14—20. The reaſon why God has ſo exactly deſcribed theſe, and all other events, in his word, even from the beginning of time, is this, ſays he, <hi>becauſe I knew thee that thou waſt obſtinate, and thy neck an iron ſinew, and thy brow braſs. Leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay, mine idol hath done them,</hi> &amp;c. Iſai. xlviii. 4, 5. In general their idols are <hi>their own inventions.</hi> Some have <hi>gain</hi> for their god, others their <hi>belly</hi>; and, to eaſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, many have their <hi>idol ſhepherds</hi>; truſt other men to ſee for them. Eph. v. 5. Phil. iii. 19. Zech. xi. 16, 17. And the fartheſt that human invention could ever go in this reſpect,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017464_0031_0FA1246DB1177D58"/>
was to <hi>ſacrifice their ſons and their daughters unto devils.</hi> Pſalm cvi. 35—39. Mic. vi. 7. And it is a mean piece of diſhoneſty for any to ſteal a finer dreſs than this for human wiſdom, from the divine oracles, and then to uſe the ſame againſt the infallible inſpiration of the book they took it from. Theſe things being premiſed, I come to offer a direct anſwer to the above queſtion.</p>
               <p>As the powers of thinking and choice are eſſential to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirits, they muſt neceſſarily deſire the knowledge and enjoyment of the beſt good; and as all finite knowledge is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by certain limits, they would ever be liable to err, if they had not ſome ſufficient guard againſt it. And the beſt guard which we can conceive of, is to have the infinite excellency of all God's perfections diſplayed before us in the cleareſt light, ſo as fully to demonſtrate, that every deſirable good is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the way of obedience; and that diſobedience to him is infinitely hateful and dreadful. The more deeply theſe ideas are fixed, and the ſtronger the perſuaſion is that he cannot err. and that all his requirements are holy, juſt and good, the more earneſt will be the deſire to know and do his will continually. Mutual eſteem and confidence conſtitute the ſtrength and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any community. Deluſion has often done much this way; but what diſcord and reſentment has enſued, when the deceit has been detected! Who then can tell how ſtrong the bond of peace is, where a full aſſurance is granted of eternal ſecurity againſt any ſuch thing! As I take it, all the ſacred volume, and every event that has ever happened in the univerſe, have been ordered ſo by infinite wiſdom, as forever to fix theſe ideas in every believing mind, and the endleſs torments of the wicked anſwer the ſame end; and reaſon moſt ſurely teaches, that none could deſire to break God's laws, or to neglect his grace, if they did not imagine to get ſome good, or to avoid ſome preſent evil, by ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since Adam in innocency could have no idea of atonement for the guilty, or cleanſing for the filthy, how can his fallen children be juſtly damned for not believing the goſpel? Anſwer, divine revelation was the only means whereby Adam knew that he ought not to eat of the forbidden tree; and nothing is more contrary to the law of ſupreme love to God, than a diſbelief of his teſtimony. And in every nation where his goſpel has come, he has given ſufficient witneſſes of its verity; and if we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is infinitely greater. His witneſſes, it is true, have long propheſied in ſackcloth; that is, men and devils have caſt a diſagreeable covering over them; but I truſt the time is haſtening, when it ſhall be taken entirely off. Permit me therefore to make a little attempt towards ſo
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017464_0032_0FA1246E6EC488C0"/>
deſirable an end. Though many pretend that the doctrine of the Trinity is ſuch as we can have no intelligible ideas of; yet believers know the contrary. For, take away the ſucceſſion of time, and the mode wherein earthly relations commence, which have no place in the Deity, and we may eaſily conceive of a Father and Son perfectly equal in capacity and excellency, with ſuch an oneneſs in nature, and peculiarity of relation, as no others have; and alſo that they have their breath or ſpirit by which they act. And when the Jews pretended that Jeſus had but one witneſs, which is not a ſufficient proof in law, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, by appealing to the <hi>works</hi> done by him and his Father, which demonſtrated his divine miſſion; and which were done for this end, <hi>that all men ſhould honor the Son,</hi> EVEN <hi>as they honor the Father.</hi> John v. 17—37. Thoſe works were all effected by the Holy Spirit, which I take to be the reaſon why thoſe who, againſt light, with a deſpiteful mind, aſcribed his <hi>good works</hi> to a <hi>bad cauſe,</hi> could never have forgiveneſs, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Mat. xii. 24—32. Heb. x. 29, which, by the way, is a moſt explicit teſtimony againſt the conceit of univerſal ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Witneſſes are to prove points that are diſputed; and ever ſince the ſerpent beguiled Eve, the greateſt conteſt has been upon theſe two points, viz. whether all that God ſays is <hi>true?</hi> or if true, how it can be <hi>equal?</hi> Now the cleareſt light which has ever been held up in this dark world about theſe matters, has been in and by the church of God, repreſented in the old teſtament by one candleſtick, and in the new teſtament by two. The twelve patriarchs conſtituted the firſt, and the twelve apoſtles the other; and both incorporated together ſeem to be intended by the twenty-four elders; as the four beaſts or living creatures mean their miniſters in the four quarters of the earth. This united candleſtick ſtands upon the holy writings; and the apoſtles appear to be put firſt, becauſe they explain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; which order appears both in the firſt building of the Chriſtian church, and alſo in her triumph over myſtery Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Ep. ii. 20. Rev. xviii. 20. The veil that Babylon has drawn over the nations, has been principally by darkening the truth with old teſtament figures, inſtead of explaining them by new teſtament light. That none can ſee Chriſts kingdom without regeneration, and that no ſtriving about who ſhall be greateſt can be allowed of therein, are two of the moſt eſſential articles in his kingdom. Every thing therefore of a contrary nature, which any have called religion, has been a veil and covering over the nations, to ſhut out the light of truth. The Father's love is as free as water, and as beneficial too; and the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017464_0033_0FA1246F2F7717B0"/>
obedience and blood of the Son demonſtrate that it flows to men in a way of perfect <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>equity</hi>; and it is the Holy Ghoſt that diſcovers and communicates theſe infinite bleſſings; theſe I take to be intended by the three witneſſes in 1 John v. 8. And the works of the Father and the Son, wrought by the Holy Ghoſt, I believe are intended by the two witneſſes, and the <hi>golden oil,</hi> which they empty into the church <hi>out of themſelves.</hi> For it is <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by</hi> MY SPIRIT, <hi>ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Zech. iv. 3—14. Rev. xi. 3—19. And every unbeliever <hi>ſtrives</hi> againſt, and <hi>reſiſts</hi> this ſpirit; for which therefore the finally impenitent will juſtly be damned. Gen. vi. 3. Acts vii. 51. For, ſays God, <hi>they hold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return. Through deceit they refuſe to know me.</hi> Jer. viii. 5, and ix. 6. They love darkneſs rather than light. And when a regard to <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> is entirely ſhut out by men in power, the witneſſes appear to be killed. Iſai. lix. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But how can any periſh who have received great benefits by Chriſt's mediation and merits? Can he loſe any that he has <hi>bought?</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 1. This is a text that Mr. Wincheſter lays ſtreſs upon. P. 32. But let him remember that the ſame word is uſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic ſong of Moſes, concerning ſome who did not eſcape divine <hi>vengeance,</hi> which Paul applies to ſuch as ſin <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>ſpitefully,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiving the <hi>knowledge of the truth,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. xxxii. 6, 35. Heb. x. 26—29. And thoſe whom God <hi>ſaved</hi> out of Egypt, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>deſtroyed</hi> for their unbelief, are named as a leading evidence againſt men who turn grace into laſciviouſneſs. Jude 5. Indeed what good is there in this lower world which does not come by the mediation and merits of Chriſt? By ſin every favour was forfeited, and he is the <hi>Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 10. The rock which all Iſrael drank of was Chriſt. 1 Cor. x. 4, 5. And it was the <hi>ſpirit of Chriſt</hi> that preached in Noah, when the <hi>long ſuffering</hi> of God waited upon the old world; who were <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in priſon,</hi> when Peter wrote his firſt epiſtle. 1 Pet. i. 11, and iii. 19, 20. Which words were perverted by antichriſt, to prove the doctrine of purgatory, and are now brought to prove general ſalvation. But Chriſt aſſures us, that if any one is not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled before he be <hi>caſt into priſon,</hi> he ſhall <hi>by no means come out thence, till he has paid the uttermoſt farthing.</hi> Mat. v. 25, 26. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſalvations to all, as well as <hi>ſpecial</hi> ones to believers, are all from Chriſt; and to conceit that the former are to be looked for elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, has ruined multitudes. We are warned againſt <hi>oppoſition of ſcience, falſely ſo called.</hi> The conceit, that ſcience for time, and ſcience for eternity, are oppoſite things, is a moſt fatal deluſion. 1 Tim. iv. 7—9, and vi. 1—21. Do not err, my beloved brethren, every good gift comes from the Father of lights. Jam. i. 16, 17, and iv. 13—17. The prince of darkneſs could not touch a hoof of Job's cattle, nor of the Gadarenes ſwine, without divine permiſſion; and that was exactly limited, and alſo over-ruled for great good.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017464_0034_0FA1246FEEDBC9E0"/>
Job i. 10, 12, and xlii. 10—12. Luke viii. 32—39. What fools then are all they who yield to deceit and cruelty (which is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the devil) to obtain any earthly good! In the ſecond and third centuries he prevailed with Chriſtian teachers to adopt it as a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that it was a virtue to <hi>deceive and lie</hi> for a good end. And in the fourth century Conſtantine was drawn into this ſcheme; when they added, that it was a virtue to inflict <hi>temporal penalties, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral tortures,</hi> for the ſame end. And this veil has been ſpread over the nations ever ſince. Indeed it would have ſpoiled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to have proclaimed it to all the people. Much pains were taken to keep it as a ſecret, betwixt civil and religious officers. But the terrible ſhakings that have lately taken place, in earthly ſtates, and religious communities, have diſcovered this deceit, and cauſed mens hearts to fail them. For if a man may lie for a good end, he muſt neceſſarily be the judge of that end; therefore when it is perceived that he acts upon ſuch a principle, others never know when to believe him, nor how to truſt him. And what diſtreſs does this now cauſe through the world! This leads me to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious promiſe, which Mr. Wincheſter builds much upon, in his arguments againſt us, viz. <hi>death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God being the fountain of life, the firſt ſenſe of the word death is loſs of union and communion with him. Three points are moſt ſtrongly aſſerted of his character, which are, that it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for him to <hi>lie,</hi> to <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> or to <hi>entice</hi> any into ſin. 2 Tim. ii. 13. Heb. vi. 18. James i. 13. Every thing that happens of this nature proceeds from fallen angels, and fallen men, who are much alike. The ſecond ſenſe of the word death is the diſſolution of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, including the means of it, as diſorders in ourſelves, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from others. <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> form the character of the devil and his children. John viii. 44. And the infliction of juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefor, compleats the full ſenſe of thoſe dreadful terms, <hi>death</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> as they are uſed in ſcripture. And the indulgence of known deceit and cruelty appears to be the covenant with death, and agreement with hell, that ſcornful men in power have often imagined to ſecure themſelves by. Such have frequently treated the warnings of truth with <hi>mockery</hi>; and thereby the <hi>bands</hi> of many have been <hi>made ſtrong.</hi> They reaſon thus, <hi>is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.</hi> From a negative propoſition they form a poſitive concluſion. For any ſoul to profeſs that Chriſt is <hi>in him,</hi> and that he has the <hi>witneſs of it in himſelf,</hi> this they cannot endure, and why? becauſe, if that be neceſſary and attainable, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned without it, and in neglect of it. Self-defence, therefore, moves them to oppoſe ſuch things, and to ſay, <hi>when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come unto us.</hi> But God has promiſed to eſtabliſh the mountain of <hi>his houſe above</hi> all ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to make a glorious feaſt there. Even a feaſt which ſhall cauſe many nations to <hi>flow</hi> thereto, as freely as the waters ever
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017464_0035_0FA12470B3E13448"/>
ran; with this language, <hi>come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of</hi> HIS <hi>ways, and we will walk in</hi> HIS <hi>paths.</hi> The effect whereof will be the turning of ſwords into inſtruments of agriculture, and bringing wars to an end. The <hi>covering</hi> and <hi>veil</hi> over the nations ſhall be deſtroyed, and <hi>death ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> 1 John ii. 21, and iii. 14. Prov. viii. 36. Iſai. xxv. 6, 7, and xxviii. 14—22. Micah iii. 11, and iv. 1—5. The only lawful uſe of the ſword before is to defend the injured againſt thoſe who would <hi>hurt or deſtroy.</hi> Iſai. xi. 9, 10. Rom. xiii. 1—10. To the redeemed death will then be entirely ſwallowed up; their enemies all be diſarmed and ſubdued, and their ſorrows turned into joy. Mal. iv. 1—3. 1 Cor. xv. 54—58. But at the ſame time God will lay judgment to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet, in ſuch a manner, that impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſcorners will have neither <hi>covering</hi> nor <hi>reſt</hi>; but a perpetual <hi>vexation, only to underſtand the report.</hi> Which <hi>report</hi> plainly intends the goſpel that they rejected. Iſai. liii. 1. Rom. x. 16. <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>triumph</hi> mean honor and joy to the victors; but when were the words ever uſed, either for the annihilation or for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all enemies? Can ſuch a ſenſe of thoſe terms be found in language? If not, it is arbitrary with a witneſs to impoſe ſuch a ſenſe upon the word of God. See 2 Cor. ii. 14—17. Col. ii. 15. Pſalm xlvii. 1—3, and lxviii. 18. If Iſai. xxviii. 14—22, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Mat. vii. 24—27, it appears, that while believers who hear Chriſt's <hi>ſayings, and do them,</hi> will enjoy eternal ſecurity, all that are of the oppoſite character will be overthrown by the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>The miſery of fallen men lies greatly in this; they firſt ſet up the idol in their heart, and then come to enquire of God. This was the error of Balaam. But if we were willing to learn of Jeſus, and to do his ſayings; to take all our ideas from the word of truth, and to act accordingly, how happy ſhould we be? Chriſt calls us <hi>this day to work,</hi> as much as ever Moſes did; but the latter ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the price for it; the other promiſes the ſoul that it ſhall <hi>receive what is right,</hi> he being the judge. Debt is a reward promiſed for a certain ſervice; and which may be claimed when the ſervice is performed, whatever difference there may be in value betwixt the ſervice and the reward. God, as the moral Governor of the world, never fails to pay all his debts; that is, to reward every one for any ſervice that is in any ſenſe good; but man would claim more, and, like Cain, are often filled with wrath, becauſe others are accepted and they not. But in the great day he will ſtop every mouth with this queſtion; <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good?</hi> Mat. xx. 1—16. All the conteſt turns upon that point. To name ſuch a thing as his <hi>choſen,</hi> or his <hi>elect,</hi> as intending a certain number of the human race that he will ſave, while he inflicts deſerved puniſhment upon the reſt, this many cannot endure; and why? becauſe if his will,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017464_0036_0FA124716DAF4830"/>
his choice, muſt determine the whole matter, it is infinitely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for me to ſet up my will againſt him. And it is alſo certain from hence, that if I do ſo, I cannot poſſibly ſucceed; and when I am entirely defeated, it will lie wholly with him whether he will ſhew me any mercy or not. Dreadful thought! Who can bear it! Any thing muſt be liſtened to rather than this. In July, 1780, I heard Mr. Wincheſter preach in Boſton, from Rom. x. 4; when he ſpake againſt univerſal ſalvation, and obſerved, that if men ran to ſuch horrid extravagances as they did, in times when it was not diſputed but that ſuch as died in ſin would have endleſs miſery, what would they do if they were taught that every one ſhould finally be ſaved? Among the many objections that he has now attempted to anſwer, I think he has paſſed this over in ſilence, which is no clear proof that he thought it could be anſwered. But if God is continually ſeeking to make every creature happy, why does he not do it? If obſtructions thereto have aroſe that he did not foreſee, where was his wiſdom? If he foreſaw them, and could not prevent them, where was his power? And if he could have prevented them, and did not, where was his goodneſs? A fair anſwer to theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will ſettle the whole controverſy.</p>
               <p>A clear right to property, and a good right to govern, are two very plain ideas. And it is alſo well known, that property cannot be holden, nor government maintained, without ſome token of acknowledgment is paid, by the tenant and the ſubject. For this token from Adam, God reſerved but one tree to himſelf; therefore by eating of it man rebelled againſt heaven, and ſeized upon the earth for his own. And when God had uſed ſuch other methods as he pleaſed, he ſent his only begotten Son, to demand his due; but the tenants ſaid, <hi>this is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance.</hi> Mat. xxi. 38. And the ſame diſpoſition of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and violence is viſible through the world to this day. And now it is openly declared, that God did not act arbitrarily in thoſe affairs. If he could have had his own will and pleaſure, he would never have put man to ſuch a trial; and does not arbitrarily inflict puniſhment upon him, poor creature, now he has fallen, and has got into ſuch a terrible labyrinth! However, he intends yet to deliver him before he quits his purſuit, though it will be "ages of ages before the work is perfected!" If this does not diſcover an infinite malignity in ſin, what can it be!</p>
               <p>We muſt deny that there is an infinite dignity in the perſon of Jeſus, or elſe allow that there was an infinite merit in his death. And to deny his right to beſtow the fruits thereof upon whom he pleaſeth, would be to deny him that right to property, which is claimed by every freeman upon earth. To ſay that he owes us thoſe fruits, is the height of madneſs! And he declares to all what will be the iſſue of the conteſt, with thoſe who ſay, <hi>we will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> Luke xix. 14—27. Let all wake up then,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017464_0037_0FA124722FAF2F10"/>
and ſee where we are! The whole diſpute that we have been upon is about the extent of promiſed ſalvation. Who has promiſed any ſuch thing? Anſwer, all the promiſes of God are in Jeſus Chriſt, yea, and in him amen, to the glory of God, by his church. Did why prince ever iſſue a proclamation of grace to rebels, without any reſtrictions? And was it ever thought among men, that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with juſtice, truth or mercy, to give exact deſcriptions of ſome particular characters of rebels, and to except ſuch out of the general act of grace? and was it ever called mockery, inſult, and inſincerity, to call all the reſt to come in, with a free promiſe of pardon and life, if they came in by the certain time that was ſee? Is not juſtice and truth as much concerned in vindicating the rights and honor of government, by exemplary puniſhment upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners thereof, as in ſhewing mercy to penitents? And can there be any dependence made upon what Chriſt has ſaid, if he has not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſort of ſinners out of his goſpel proclamation? yea, and declared that ſuch will have a much ſorer puniſhment than ſinners againſt the light of nature, or the law of Moſes? Luke x. 11—16. Heb. vi. 6, and x. 28, 29, and xii. 25, 26. No pardon was ever promiſed to men who <hi>preſumptuouſly</hi> and <hi>deſpitefully</hi> acted againſt the light. Num. xv. 27—31. Pſalm xix. 13. Mat. xii. 31, 32. And the cauſe why Paul obtained mercy was his ſinning <hi>ignorantly,</hi> and not <hi>preſumptuouſly.</hi> 1 Tim. i. 13. Now it has been proved, that to expect and claim promiſed bleſſings, in a way of diſregard to his precepts, is preſumption, and tempting of God. Concerning ſuch, he ſwore that they ſhould not enter into his reſt. A chief leader in this way ſaid to Moſes and Aaron, <hi>all the congregation are holy, every one of them; wherefore then lift you up yourſelves?</hi> But the command to the people was, <hi>depart from the tents of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs.</hi> Num. xvi. 3—26. Which things are recorded for a warning to all. Jude 11.</p>
               <p>Fury in men often operates unreaſonably; of this there is nothing in God. And his debates with his vineyard are in exact <hi>meaſure,</hi> and to <hi>purge away ſin.</hi> But <hi>withered boughs</hi> will be caſt into the <hi>fire; for it is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> Iſai. xxvii. 4—11. This appears to be the only place in the bible where fury is ſaid not to be in God; while the word is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to his righteous vengeance upon the wicked near fifty times therein. And though Wincheſter has referred us to above ſixty places, to prove that the words everlaſting, forever, &amp;c. are uſed in a limited ſenſe, p. 37, 38, yet all but two of them are in the old teſtament, when they were under ſhadows which were to end, while the ſubſtances they typified were to continue. And his two proofs out of the new teſtament are theſe, viz. Paul ſpeake to Philemon of receiving his ſervant forever. But how? not now as a ſervant, But as a beloved brother; and will that relation ever end? Again, in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017464_0038_0FA12473F7EB8958"/>
Rev. xiv. 6. the word everlaſting is evidently connected with the word goſpel, and not with the preaching it upon earth; and is not the goſpel of an endleſs nature? Theſe are his only proofs from the new teſtament, to limit the ſenſe of thoſe words. And his party are forced to confeſs that the duration of miſery, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of happineſs, are both expreſſed by the ſame Greek word in Mat. xxv. 46. And if the words uſed in Rev. xx. 10, to expreſs the continuance of puniſhment in the <hi>burning lake,</hi> do not mean endleſs duration, Dr. Doddrige ſays, it is hard to ſay what words can do it. And by ſuffering ſinners, in various ways, to exert themſelves as far as creature power can poſſibly go, how will their defeat and confuſion demonſtrate the folly of not following divine direction entirely! And while their defeat, confuſion and miſery, are ever viſible to the bleſſed, what reverence, eſteem, joy, and praiſe to their God and Saviour, will it ever excite in redeemed ſouls! And angels will join their ſong. Iſai. lxvi. 24. Luke xiii. 27—29. Rev. xiv. 10, and xix. 1—6.</p>
               <p>In a word, if any one of the human race is finally loſt, the ſcheme we oppoſe muſt be falſe. And he who cannot err ſays of one of them, <hi>good were it for that man if he had never been born.</hi> The way Wincheſter takes here, is to prove that Job and Jeremiah wiſhed that they had not been born, whoſe ſufferings were light and ſhort to what Judas's will be. P. 42, 43. But will he lift up his head, and argue again, that becauſe good men were miſtaken, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt was alſo! In the next page he mentions what Solomon ſays, about an extraordinary long life, and large family, to a wicked man; and that an untimely birth would be better than his. Eccl. vi. 3—6. From whence he argues, that Chriſt's meaning was, that if Judas had died in the womb, it would have been good for him; that then
<q>he would have been at reſt, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the weary are at reſt.</q>
But as certainly as the Bible is true, all things do <hi>work together for the good</hi> of all the objects of <hi>God's love.</hi> Rom. viii. 28. Therefore if Judas had been an object of that love, it would have been good for him to have been born, and to go through all that he did; as it real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was for Job and Jeremiah, though they once thought otherwiſe. Till a fair anſwer can be given to this argument, I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to follow my opponent any further. And ſhall cloſe with naming a few plain ſcripture rules of decency and goſpel order, with ſome motives to enforce them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is head of all principality and power, and the church is compleat in him; and every ſoul who truly receives him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him as ſuch; and is commanded to walk in Chriſt <hi>as he received him, as he has been taught.</hi> Therefore we are required, not to let men or angels intrude their commands or judgments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the believer and his glorious head. Gal. 1.8, 9. Col. ii. 6—23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In admiſſion of members, let every church be careful that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017464_0039_0FA12474722134C8"/>
they receive none but ſuch as give a perſonal credible profeſſion of a ſaving union to Chriſt by faith. Luke vi. 45. John i. 12—14. Acts ii. 47. Rom. x. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let all teachers endeavour to uſe ſound ſpeech, which cannot be condemned; words eaſy to be underſtood, and which give a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and certain ſound; and be as willing that others ſhould judge, as they are to ſpeak. 1 Cor. xiv. 7—40. Titus ii. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In public communities, let men ever have the lead and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that when women are heard, and all due regard is paid to them in their places, it may be done in ſuch a manner, that it ſhall ſtill be evident that they are not heads and governors of public aſſemblies, but under covert. Luke ii. 38. 1 Cor. xi. 3—16, xiv. 34, 35. 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Exclude all ſtriving about who ſhall be the greateſt, and by love ſerve one another. Let due eſteem and aſſiſtance be given to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in their places; while all are ſubject one to another, and be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humility: For God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Luke ix. 46—50. Heb. xiii. 7, 17. 1 Pet. v. 1—5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let all be upon their guard againſt teachers who are fond of addreſſing the paſſions, and putting animal nature into motion, without enlightening the underſtanding, convincing the conſcience, and eſtabliſhing the judgment. Jer. iii. 15. Acts xxv. 18. 2 Cor. iv. 2. Eph. iv. 14—16. Heb. xiii. 9.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord; and indulge not the diſpoſition of eating any man's bread for naught. Rom. xii. 2 Theſſ. iii. 6—12.</p>
               <p>With regard to this laſt rule, two great extremes have long ſerved to uphold each other. Miniſters who have been ſupported by tax and compulſion have frequently eat other men's bread for naught. Seeing of which has carried many into the oppoſite extreme. Some have gone ſo far as to elect paſtors, and to partake of the fruit of their labours from year to year, without thinking themſelves under obligation to ſupport them in their work, or to reward them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for. Neither honor nor conſcience would have permitted either party to act as they have done, if it had not been in religious affairs. When believers view the glory and <hi>authority</hi> of their Lord and Saviour, it moves them moſt <hi>freely</hi> and faithfully to attend to the duties of their ſtation, be they in office or out of it, in church or ſtate. They <hi>chooſe the things that pleaſe him</hi>; and to fill up their places with duty and uſefulneſs is their greateſt concern; knowing that ſuch labour cannot be in vain in the Lord. But violence has ſo long been connected with <hi>authority,</hi> on one hand, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs with the word <hi>freedom</hi> on the other, that it is not an eaſy matter to ſeparate them in the minds of men. But what worſhip muſt it be, that can influence any to lay ſuch a claim to the goods or labours of others, as truth and equity between man and man will not give! Much light in theſe things is already granted in our land,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017464_0040_0FA124752E8E9828"/>
and it is hoped that a greater reformation is before us. To promote which, the following conſiderations may be ſerviceable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Only by pride cometh contention, and the love of money is the root of all evil. Prov. xiii. 10. 1 Tim. vi. 10. Which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently are imaginations that we can do better for ourſelves, than God would do for us, if we were entirely directed by him; and that we have a better right to power and property, than our neighbours have. But how great is this deluſion! When ſouls are reconciled to God, and act in union and communion with him, their greateſt trials and afflictions work together for their everlaſting good. Whereas each man who regards ſelf above God, all that he gets in that way increaſes his miſery: For the more he has got of a ſeparate intereſt of his own, the more he has to take care of and defend, both againſt God and man; a woful taſk indeed! The great events of a ſeven years war now hold up a ſtriking demonſtration of this truth to all the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Self-condemnation of all things is the moſt oppoſite to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And though men have various ways to blind or bribe their conſciences now, in violating the golden rule, yet the day is haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that will remove all ſuch coverings forever. It will then be ſaid, to ſuch as die in their ſins, <hi>remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things; but now—a great gulf is fixed. How much ſhe hath glorified herſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row give her.</hi> Luke xvi. 25, 26. Rev. xviii. 7. And never will they be again able either to conceal their ſhame, or to be inſenſible of their guilt. In vain do ſome pretend that the rich man had a good ſeed within him, becauſe he was ſo earneſt that his brethren might not come to that place of torment; which, they ſay, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the temper of devils. For the devils are deceived, as well as men; and pray as earneſtly as they againſt torment, when in their immediate view. Luke viii. 28—31. And it is as vain to argue, that there cannot be different degrees of puniſhment, if hell-torments are without end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every ſoul now is either a ſlave to ſin, or a ſervant of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; either under the <hi>bondage of corruption,</hi> or in the <hi>liberty of God's children,</hi> in a greater or leſs degree. Rom. vi. 16, and viii. 9—21. Our preſent as well as eternal welfare is therefore what immediately concerns this preſent argument. The more we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of victory over corruption, and of real conformity to the will of God, the happier we are here. Great peace have all they who love his law, and nothing ſhall offend them; but they who walk after their own luſts, are <hi>murmurers</hi> and <hi>complainers.</hi> Jude 16. Could it therefore be poſſible, that the torments of the damned would have an end, yet we are certainly as ſafe as our opponents; but, on the other hand, what a riſk do they run in their way! If reaſon can be heard, it will make every one in earneſt to know and live to GOD.</p>
