            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>ON the 24th day of March, 1794, the brig Falmouth failed from Port Royal, Jamaica, beund to Belfaſt, in Ireland, to which place ſhe belonged. At the time ſhe failed, the following perſons were on board —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Gordon,</hi> Maſter; <hi>Francis Turner,</hi> Mate; <hi>Henry Gihnote, John Doutbard, — Povd, — Carrol, Joſeph York,</hi> (Mariners) <hi>William Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iams,</hi> a Cabin Boy; <hi>Joſeph Porter,</hi> a paſſenger;</p>
            <p>Nothing material happened on the voyage, 'till two of the hands, Boyd and Carrol, were taken ſick. and died, apparently of a violent fever, the one immediately after the other.—During their illneſs, the Captain uſed to enquire after their ſituation, and to look at them down the hatchway, and ſend them frequently from the cabin both Soup and Coffee.</p>
            <p>After the death of theſe men, which happened previous, to the 2d of May, there appeared an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent difference in the conduct of the Captain, which ſhewed itſelf in particular inſtances of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> treatment towards one another of the crew, whom he charged with an intention to poiſon him, and to run away with the veſſel.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of May, he took from the Mate a Quadrant, which he had given to him ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their failing; and likewiſe took from him his books of Navigation; taking into his own hands the entire navigation of the veſſel.</p>

Mr. Porter, the paſſenger, was in an extreme ill ſtate of health, and was ſo feeble as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his bed, which was in the ſtarboard ſtate-room. In this ſituation helay till the 24th of May, when the Mate being in the larboard ſtate-room, and the Capt. and Mr. Porter's ſervant in the cabin, the Mate heard Capt. Corran in warm lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, abuſing Mr. Porter ſwearing that he ſhould not ſtay any longer in the ſtate-room, and ordering his Black Boy to go immediately and bring his maſter into the cabin. This the boy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; but finding himſelf unable to effect it; and Mr. Porter at the ſame time, begging for God's ſake, that he might be ſuffered to lay where he was; the Capt. entered the ſtate-room, and with the aſſiſtance of the black boy, took Mr. Porter, by force, out of his bed, and ſupporting him, himſelf under one arm, und the Black Boy under the other, they brought him into the cabin he being unable to walk himſelf) and ſat him down on a chair. The Captain then ordered the Black boy to bring out his maſters bed, and to make it up in the cabin, upon two cheſts belonging to Mr. Porter. This being done he compelled the black boy to lay his maſter on the bed, and then ſent for one of the top-gallant ſtudding ſails, with which he made a ſort of a curtain to ſurround the bed. After this tranſaction, he ordered the black boy out of the cabin, and going upon deck, gave a general order, that neither the black boy, nor any other perſon, ſhould come into the cabin without his leave, and that no perſon ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf with Mr. Porter, as he would take care of him himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026820_0004_0FD1D5C11CF6C3B0"/>
The 27th of May between 10 and 11 at night, the Capt. called Henry Gilmore, and ordered him to bring a light. When Gilmore came with the light, the Capt. gave him a drink of grog, and told him that he hoped he would be in his favor, and that he was not afraid of the law. Gilmore replied that he did not wiſh to be againſt him or any other perſon. The captain ſoon after came upon deck, and deſired that no perſon ſhould be permitted to come into the cabin, without orders from him, that the watch then on deck, ſhould give the ſame charge to the watch which was to ſucceed them. About a quarter paſt 12 o'clock the whole crew were alarmed with the cries of Mr. Porter, exclaiming "Murder, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!!" Through a whole in the bulk head which parted the ſteerage from the cabin, and by looking down the companion door into the cabin ſeveral of crew ſaw captain Corran ſtriking at Mr. Porter as he lay in his bed, with a remarkable large and heavy cutlaſs. After ſtriking him for ſome time, he deſiſted for a ſhort ſpace, and coming up the companion ladder, began to abuſe Mr. Porter, damning him. and declaring he was not worth five pounds in the world. He then returned into the cabin again, and began to cut Mr. Porter as he had done before. Mr. Porter again cried out and begged the captain not to cut him ſo, but to take a piſtol and ſhoot him. He damned him and ſaid he would not ſhoot him, but would cut him every half hour till day light. In a ſhort time, Mr. Porter begged him to deſiſt, as he was dying; and it is ſuppoſed he expired about this time, as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026820_0005_0FD1D5C270CA72B0"/>
his cries were heard no more. Between one and twoo'clock, the captain came again upon deck, with a cutlaſs in his hand, and ſtruck Mr. Porter's black boy, acroſs the ſhoulders, and bid him go down and dreſs his maſter's wounds. He alſo called for a light and went down with the boy into the cabin, and made ſeveral ſtrokes at Mr. Porter's body with the cutlaſs, exclaiming, "What, damn you, are you aſleep?";</p>
            <p>About day light the captain called John Douthard into the cabin, who on his entering it, found Mr. Porter with his knees on the cabin floor, and his face reſting on the bed; apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lifeleſs. Capt. Corran ordered him to take hold of Mr. Porter's legs, and lift him on the bed. While Douthard was in the act of doing this, he made ſeveral ſtrokes at the body over his head, which ſo intimidated Douthard, that he dropped the body and ran upon deck, acquainting his companions that the captain had murdered their paſſenger. At 4 o'clock the captain came upon deck, and ordered Douthard to go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cabin, and ſew Mr. Porter up in a blanket, and told him that Mr. Porter's ſervant ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him. Douthard refuſing, he ſeized him and compelled him to go down into the cabin. By the captain's order, with the aſſiſtance of the boy, he laid Mr. Porter on one of his own blankets, ſewed him up in it, and tied a white handkerchief round his head. The body was mangled in a manner ſhocking to humanity; there were large gaſhes about the hips, above a foot long and three or four inches deep, one car totally cut off, the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026820_0006_0FD1D5C413F7D100"/>
noſe almoſt cut through, the right eye forced out of the ſocket and hanging down the cheek ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by a bloody membrance; the arms had upwards of twenty wounds from one to three inches deep: The ſheet was very bloody, and much clotted blood on the cabin floor. The corps was brought on deck, and laid upon a board in the gangway. From the companion door to the gangway, there was a conſiderable quantity of blood which had ran through the blanket as they were carrying the body along. While the corps was lying in the gangway, the captain came on deck, leaned over the quarter rail, covered his eyes with his hands, and appeared for ſome minutes much confuſed. He was rouſed from his reverie by John Douthard, who aſked him if he ſhould heave the deceaſed overboard. He ſeemed ſtarted by the queſtion—but bid them <hi>"away with him."</hi> The body was accordingly committed to the ſea; immediately after this he ordered the veſſel to be kept away N. W. and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſtudding ſails.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of May the capt. ſent ſeveral meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the mate, deſiring him to come upon deck, and declaring that he would not hurt him. The mate at length came on deck, and being afraid to go aſt. remained before the windlaſs: capt. Corran obſerving his ſhyneſs, and that his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

that that courſe would fetch no port in Europe, and that he was apprehenſive that the captain had ill deſigns both on them and the veſſel. The mate then conſulted as in my of the crew as he conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iently could, who agreed to take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſecure the captain. About an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the captain came on deck, and having walked to the tiller ropes, and turned round to proceed down the deck, Joſeph York, who was then at the helm, ſeized his arms behind, and ſtruggling with him, the reſt of the crew came to his aſſiſtance, bound him, and brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cabin, where they ſecured his hands with a pair of hand cuffs, which they found in his cheſt.</p>
            <p>Previous; to his impriſonment when he ordered the veſſel to be ſteered N. W. he informed the crew that they were near the Engliſh Channel: But on the 30th of May when the mate has got poſſeſſion of his Quadrant, and was enabled to take as obſervation, he found they were very near the attitude of this place, and in about half an hour after they ſaw land; but a thick fog coming on, they were not able to make a harbour <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

On ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Books or navigation, after confining the Capt. they found that he had cut out of every book the table of the Sur's declination.

The court being opened with the cuſtomary ſolemnities, the priſoner was arrangned, and pleading not guilty, was remanded for trial on Monday. On that day the trial commenced, and continued, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinment, till Tueſday, when the examination on the part of the crown being ended; the priſoner was called upon by the court to make his defence: But declining to offer any thing in his defence: he was given recommitted, and the court adjourned to also o'clock on Wedneſday.</p>

On Wedneſday, the court again aſſembled, and the priſoner learn nothing to ſay in his defence, the court was ordered to be cleared. After a ſhort period the court was again opened, and the priſoner brought to the bear, when his Excellency governer Westfourth, the preſident of the court, addreſſed the priſoner, and declared, that the court having deliberately conſidered all the evidence which had been ſubmittes to them, were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly of opinion that he was guilty of the murder of Joſeph Porter. His Excellency then demanded of the priſoner if he had any thing to args, why Juſtice of death ſhould not be pronounced upon him.
