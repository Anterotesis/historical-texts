            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>e salvation in so walking. This made <hi>Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David,</hi> and other faithful Shepherds so solemnly charge Israel to abide with God when they could no longer abide with Israel. Hence rose <hi>Peters</hi> resolution as long as he abode in his Tabernacle to put them always in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, though they were established in the present truth. The sacred Assemblies at our Elections presents <hi>New-Englands</hi> representatives, as sometimes Israels before <hi>Joshuah,</hi> yea, before the Lord: Hence stirs up from the same spirit in all the faithful messengers of Christ to whom on such days the door of opportunity and utterance is opened, an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to leave their solemn testimony for Gods Glory and this peoples good; Such is this Sermon now in thine hand: Therefore the more diligently to be attended by all that unfeignedly love our Lord Iesus, their souls, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies Churches, and this Colony. Though the Prophets dye, yet such words will live to take hold of those that will not hear, as they did of Israel. 'Tis an observation worth observing, Israels liberty from <hi>Egypt</hi> began with the meeting and kissing of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the mount of God, and the peoples obedience: Their bondage to <hi>Babylon</hi> entred by their attention to prophets of their own and their non subjection to the prophets of God. <hi>2 Chron. 36.12, 15, 16.</hi> Hence that pathetical exclamation, <hi>Oh that my people had hearkned!</hi> Isa. 48.18, 19. Its not the least of our wilderness mercies, That from the beginning we have seen this union. Our good God hath neither suffered our teachers to be driven into corners, nor left them to run altogether in vain by shutting the door of faith where he hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door of utterance. This short testimony given forth by this watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shepherd in so solemn an assembly from the Lord, there is another tryal whether the same faith &amp; faithfulness, which dwelt in our fathers in the first times of these plantations dwell in us, also their children. That God hath continued us yet in the mount of Gospel liberties, is through his grace out of Question. The spirit of Vnion, and the spirit of subjection to Gods order is most to be enquired after. Well! this is our present Test. This Sermon proceeded from the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> which our Lord Iesus <hi>hath</hi> put into the breast plate or heart of the speaker, that is faith and love:

               <p n="1">1. Remember that a main design of Gods people's adventuring in to this wilderness was for progress in the work of Reformation, and that in the way of brotherly communion with the Reformed Churches of Christ in other parts of the world. O forsake not, deny not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not that fundamental design! and otherwise indeed what needed they to have removed from <hi>England</hi>? (this cannot justly be denyed) they were then in the place from whence there came mixtures in the worship of God, and the blessed Sabbath of God struck at, &amp;c. which there were grieved with, <hi>and vexed their righteous souls from day to day</hi>; but here they hoped they might enjoy freedom from those pollutions, <hi>and freedom to follow the Lord fully in all his Ordinances and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; I say <hi>to follow the Lord</hi> (not by halves: not still in way of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Religion to have a medly of all sorts of Religion, but) <hi>fully</hi>; with what purity the Lord would give them light for, and power to enjoy without molestation: And therefore, as not in a way of Separation from the Churches of Christ in <hi>Old-England,</hi> which the printed Books of our <hi>New-England</hi> Divines do abundantly shew; (<hi>v. Cottons Answer to</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> pag. 138.140, <hi>&amp;c. Hookers Survey, pt. 1. pag. 48.</hi> Mr. <hi>Philips in his Answer to Lamb.</hi> pag. 144.

And so to hold communion with them in the Ordinances of Christ, and according to the order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ, yet withal to depart from defiling mixtures aforesaid; Surely then it follows by undenyable consequence, that if it was for Reformation, then not for Toleration of all Religions: and awful are the words that fell from the pen <hi>of our famous Cotton in his bloody tenet washed,</hi> (pag. 132. and 192) <hi>viz.</hi>

The hearty love and union of a truely Religious people, consists not in a boundless <hi>toleration of sin,</hi> but in the way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> Ezek. <hi>11.18, 19.</hi> And should this poor people be intoxicated with that <hi>heady wine</hi> of the Doctrine of such a <hi>toleration,</hi> as to open that door [for instance] unto <hi>superstitious and anti christian Ceremonies</hi> in the worship of God, as it would be contrary to our professed Fundamental end of the setling of this Plantation, so God would be extreamly provoked at such a toleration: and who sees not the event that would be? the like I might say as to any other such mixtures brought in by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration destructive to the established way of Worship here, for the substance thereof: and shall this be the commendation of New-England, <hi>i. e. [I have somthing for thee, that thou canst bear with them that are evil?</hi>] and this for thee [<hi>that thou sufferest the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Jezabel <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Yea why do not men plead for <hi>Toleration</hi> of all <hi>non-fundamentals</hi> in Civil matters? for there are the <hi>extra-fundamentalia</hi> there also.</p>
               <p>Let the Magistrates <hi>Coercive Power</hi> in matters of Religion [there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore] be still asserted, seing he is one who is bound to God, more then any other men, to cherish his true Religion; and as the good Kings of Judah, commended for it in Scripture, <hi>Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Iosiah &amp;c.</hi> therefore are they to be principal Instruments in furthering the Reformation aforesaid: and I would leave it with any godly, sober Christian to consider and answer; Whether the <hi>Interest of Religion</hi> hath not as good a title, and plea for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates Protection, as [not any irreligion which self conceit and humor hath wedded any unto; but] any worldly Interest whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? and how wofull would the state of things soon be among us, if men might have liberty without controll, to profess or preach or print, or publish what they list, tending to the Seduction of others! and though the <hi>Enemy soweth Tares,</hi> which cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times plucked up without danger to the wheat, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let alone, yet I would hope none of the Lords husbandmen

I have taken off the yoke from thy neck, and the Almighty hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed light as by Snow in <hi>Salmon,</hi> I have given you Manna to the full, the Rock hath followed you, and you have had the Pillar of guidance and protection in all your Journeyings; but have you followed me fully with the Spirit of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua?</hi> Yea thou hast <hi>called upon me in trouble</hi> (in the time of Drought, a year never to be forgotten by us, and our Children after us, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. and at other times) <hi>and I delivered thee, and answered thee,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I bid you make no league with <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. (in respect of corrupt mixtures, and base compliances in matters of Religion) but (as <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>why have you not obeyed my voice?</hi> why have you not come up fully to the practice of my Will held forth to you by my Servants? Why are there these and those <hi>Images of Jealousie</hi> among you? What is this noise that I hear in so many Churches? the noise of the Axes and Hammers of those that would cut and beat down the carved work? Why is there such neglect of your Church-work of the house

of God? and (as <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.23.) hath that been diligently done, which is commanded by the God of Heaven? for why should there be wrath against the Colony of the <hi>Massachusets?</hi> and see <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. <hi>beg.</hi> And why is Family-duties in many houses laid aside? that in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Families there is (it may be) no Prayer from the one end of the week to the other? no Family-catechising, no Repetition of the Word preached, nor calling Children and Servants to an account of what they do or should hear? no reading of the Scripture? may be no Bible, or onely a torn Bible to be found? I mean, but a part of the Bible to be found, so that the whole Scripture is never read throughout in some Families? I wish this be not the condition of many Families, that either there is no Bible, or but a piece of a Bible, and that they can content themselves therewith. O that as to these, and such like things, we might be this day before the Lord as those at <hi>Bochim,</hi> weeping for the same before the Lord! And O what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness is it, that after the Lord hath done so much for us, in being to us <hi>not a wilderness nor a land of darkness,</hi> we should now say, <hi>We are lords, and will come no more at him:</hi> But let us testifie our reall thankfulness to God, by cleaving to the Lord in that good old way, wherein he hath been leading his people hitherunto. <hi>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be</hi> we <hi>not entangled with any yoke of bondage,</hi> of one kinde or other. Stand (I say) for your Liberties; not liberty to sin, but to be holy; liberty to <hi>run the wayes of Gods Commandments.</hi> Change not away your glory for that which will not profit: <hi>My son, fear thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change:</hi> (Prov. 24.21, 22.) <hi>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> Gods people came hither for Liberty; <hi>i. e.</hi> Liberty in the way of Holiness: and our Holiness lyes in

I would hope that the Fundamental Interest of the Liberties and Priviledges of the Churches of Christ here, and of the Civil State, will never be transformed, alienated, and reduced to such an Interest which no sober, godly, wise-hearted Christians will judge worthy their contending for, or worth their standing up in the defence of, or hazarding their Estates and Lives for in the day of triall.</p>
