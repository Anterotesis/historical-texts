            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE conduct of man towards his fellow creatures in different circumſtances, not only affords a curious ſubject for ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations but, if carefully traced out, would be found fully to develope the principles of human action. The circumſtances, in which mankind are providentially placed, rather than the characters they ſuſtain, ſeem to be the crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, by which is determined the degree of reſpect, that ſhall be paid them. Hence, real worth, if cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rags, muſt live and die in obſcurity; while gaudy attire, and high ſounding titles procure for many a worthleſs perſon, a tribute of reſpect, which is due to the virtuous only. For this cauſe, among others, did Solomon inſcribe on all the purſuits of human life, "vanity of vanities." And to place the ſubject in a ſtriking light, he ſets before us a familiar example, expreſſed in the plain, unadorned language
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037427_0004_100D40E85619A378"/>
of inſpiration. "There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king againſt it, and beſieged it, and built great bulwarks againſt it. Now there was found in it a poor wiſe man, and he by his wiſdom delivered the city;" but mark the returns which he received: "<hi>Yet no man remembered that ſame poor man.</hi>" Incapable through poverty of flattering their pride by a ſplendid equipage, or grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifying their appetites by ſumptuous entertainments, his good deeds are forgotten, he muſt retire to his former obſcurity, and have the mortification of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing the ingratitude of a people, whom he had ſaved from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Were mankind univerſally diſpoſed to render to each other that tribute, which gratitude requires, the circumſtances, in which perſons might be placed, would make no alteration as to the reſpect, which would be paid them: A real benefactor, whether he were found among the rich or the poor, the high or the low, would ever receive the tribute of a grateful remembrance. This conciſe narrative, therefore, virtually contains this charge againſt mankind, that they are not naturally inclined to remember their benefactors, as they ought to remember them.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this general propoſition, we ſhall firſt ſay how a benefactor ſhould be remembered; and then offer ſome conſiderations to ſhow, that mankind are not naturally inclined thus to remember them.</p>
            <p>1. We are to ſay how a benefactor ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. Barely mentioning ſuch expreſſions as theſe; <hi>remember the poor; remember thy Creator,</hi> is ſufficient to convince any perſon, that the term <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> often includes more, than merely retaining in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037427_0005_100D40E9E33824D0"/>
the mind an idea of the thing remembered. He, that ſays to the hungry, <hi>be ye fed,</hi> or to the naked, <hi>be ye clothed,</hi> does more than merely retain in his mind an idea of their neceſſities, and yet, his conduct falls ſhort of what is implied in remembering the poor. In all caſes, it is neceſſary, that <hi>works</hi> bear teſtimony to the truth of our aſſertions, and therefore, by works, as well as by words or thoughts muſt we remember a benefactor.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould remember our benefactors by doing them good. That command, which bids us "pray for thoſe that hate us, and do good unto thoſe, that deſpitefully uſe us," doubtleſs requires, that we do good unto thoſe, that do good unto us. This is what the law of benevolence requires; it is what the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural unenlightened conſcience of all mankind teaches them, as their duty. Are our benefactors in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous circumſtances? we ſhould cheerfully afford them relief, if it be in our power. Are their characters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly aſperſed? we ſhould openly eſpouſe their cauſe, and defend their injured innocence. Do they merit a reſpectful attention? we ſhould grant it to them in cuſtomary forms. And, does their devotedneſs to our intereſts claim our confidence! we ſhould ſpare them the painful ſenſations, which reſult from ſeeing a ſtranger preferred before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Senſations, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude alone would ever wiſh to excite. And, though our chief and principal attention is to be paid them, while living, yet the "pale ſhades of death" have their demands, and the voice of a benefactor calls to us even from the grave. There is ſomething inhuman in the thought of vilifying the memory of the dead, or even, in forbearing to pay ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037427_0006_100D40EB72F55D48"/>
of reſpect to a departed friend. A reſpectful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the deceaſed, is what every benefactor has a right to expect; it is what humanity requires; it is what that providence, which reminds us of our own approaching diſſolution, demands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our benefactors are to be remembered by an imitation of their benevolent example. The ſimple idea of a benefactor implies ſomething, that is worthy of imitation. It implies, that an unpurchaſed good has been conferred: And, whatever may have been the conduct of a benefactor in other reſpects, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to our imitation, in one inſtance at leaſt, the example of a benevolent diſpoſition. An example, which gratitude requires, that we ever bear upon our hearts. Are we, therefore, in circumſtances, in which we can do good to others, and do it not? we are chargeable with having forgotten the example of our benefactors. Are we able to relieve the diſtreſſed, to ſupply what is lacking in the circumſtances of the needy, and to cheer with the ſoothings of friendſhip the diſconſolate ſufferer, and do it not? each bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which we have received, reproaches us with the forgetfulneſs of ingratitude. Are we capable of doing good to public bodies—to ſocieties—to our country, and do it not? thoſe, who have devoted themſelves to the ſervice of their country, thoſe, who have "jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field," and the blood, which has been ſhed, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rights of mankind, riſe up againſt us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the neglect, as a fruit of the baſeſt ingratitude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our benefactors are to be remembered by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered and received as a gift from God. It is not ſufficient, that we trace the ſtreams of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037427_0007_100D40EE06671D48"/>
which are flowing to us in many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> their ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſource, and learn to adore that divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which animates all nature, and demands, from the united tongues of created intelligences, a tribute of thankful praiſe. It is God, we are told, that forms the ſpirit of man within him, that gives a benevolent diſpoſition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d an ability to exert it: It is God, that prepares the heart, that moves the diſpoſition, and prompts to action: And, it is God, that directs the ſteps of man, and enables him to put his benevolent intentions into execution. The whole proceſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, originates ultimately in divine goodneſs; and, while we forget, that this is the caſe, or neglect to acknowledge it by an affectionate attachment to the ſervice of our Maker, we do not remember, in their true character, thoſe, who have been made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divine goodneſs to us, and are not in a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſituation to render them thoſe conſtant returns of gratitude, which they have deſerved. While we forget <hi>even in our hearts,</hi> that there is a God, on whom our benefactors are entirely dependent, we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to them, in a certain ſenſe, the rank of Gods, and when we find them incapable of ſupporting that ſtation in the ſcale of being, to which we in an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous manner have exalted them, we are generally ready, not only to pull them down, but even to tear from their brows the laurels, which they really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to wear.</p>
            <p>Upon this idea, I would wiſh to be indulged the liberty of dwelling for a moment, as it not only ſhows the importance of religion to thoſe, who have deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037427_0008_100D40F1233F9710"/>
well of their country, but alſo as it points out a conſiderable ſource of that complaint and calumny, which is often caſt upon the adminiſtration of civil government. While we, from a principle of religion, which governs our <hi>feelings</hi> as well as our <hi>belief,</hi> aſcribe the ſucceſs, which attends the plans of a General, or a Politician, to the goodneſs of an over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and revere the men, who have been our ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactors, as inſtruments in the hands of God, we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them the place, that belongs to them; we give them juſt the praiſe, that is their due, and, upon a reverſe of fortune, ſhould not find ourſelves greatly diſpoſed to load them in an ungrateful manner, with unmerited calumny. The thought, that they are but inſtruments in the hands of a holy and wiſe God, will forbid every complaint, and be a powerful check againſt aſcribing their want of ſucceſs to a want of benevolence. On the contrary, while we forget, that there is an over-ruling hand in all theſe events, and aſcribe the benefit received almoſt wholly to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of the immediate agent, we ſhall be ready, upon every unfavorable occurrence, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that he has not exerted himſelf as he might have done, or, that, under the influence of ſome ſiniſter motive, he is diſpoſed to neglect our good, or to make us the victims of his own ambition or revenge. And by ſuch a thought we at once blaſt his well-earned laurels, and rob him entirely of the tribute of a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, which his conduct has deſerved. By aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much to our benefactors, in the inſtances, in which they have done us good, we are naturally led to demand too much of them in future, and, if our expectations are not equalled, we are ſtrongly inclined
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037427_0009_100D40F2ADAEE2A0"/>
to load them with curſes, and to forget, that we ever owed them any returns of gratitude. So long, therefore, as the courſe of human affairs is variable, ſo long as pure religion does not warm the hearts of mankind in general, ſo long the wiſeſt, and moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful adminiſtrators of public affairs have no reaſon but to expect, that their adminiſtration will at times be cenſured in an ungrateful manner. However grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, of courſe, it may be to the vanity of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart to have its ſucceſſes attributed wholly to itſelf, to the excluſion of divine Providence, it is in fact putting it into a ſituation, that is incompatible with that ſteady, perſevering reſpect, which gratitude demands. It is, therefore, the ſpirit of religion only, that places our benefactors in their true light, and ſecures to them a continuance of that attention and confidence, which their benevolent conduct has mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited; and of courſe, where true religion is wanting, it is impoſſible, that there ſhould be that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a benefactor, which there ought to be.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhown how a benefactor ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, we proceed</p>
            <p>II. To offer ſome conſiderations to prove, that mankind are not naturally inclined thus to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them.</p>
            <p>It is a painful taſk to draw the dark ſide of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character, and point out thoſe deteſtable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by which the human heart is often actuated. It is neceſſary, however, that it ſhould at times be done. Our divine Redeemer, whoſe compaſſionate ſoul could weep at the follies and ſins of an apoſtate world, was much employed in unfolding the human heart, and in expoſing the hypocriſy and wickedneſs,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037427_0010_100D40F5F34C2FD8"/>
to which it is often abandoned. And, in following his example as a public teacher, it is frequently nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary, that we lay aſide the language of palliation, that we ſtrip off the diſguiſe of external appearance, and expoſe in all their deformity, the worſt principles by which the human heart is actuated.</p>
            <p>It may, perhaps, be thought, that forgetfulneſs of benefactors is no very prominent feature in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character; and, that in this, they err leſs, than in many other reſpects. A regard, however, for truth, and a belief in the juſtneſs of ſacred repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, bids me aſſert, that ſuch an opinion is not well founded; and, we preſume, that a careful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the conduct of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> will fully juſtify the aſſertion.</p>
            <p>In ſupport of this, let the following things be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the human character there is a great degree of ſelfiſhneſs. The numerous commands, which are found in the word of God, <hi>to love our neighbors, and to look on the things of others,</hi> as well as the more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive declarations, that <hi>all ſeek their own things,</hi> are a ſufficient proof, that ſelfiſhneſs is deeply rooted in the human heart. And, in ſupport of this painful truth, may we not appeal to that conduct, which generally characterizes the different claſſes of mankind? Is it not ſelfiſhneſs, that lies at the foundation of a deſire for property, and which ſuggeſts to buſy ſeekers that variety of methods, which are adopted for its attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Is it not ſelfiſhneſs, that ſtimulates to exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive indulgence, thoſe, who ſacrifice at the altar of ſenſual intemperance? Is it not ſelfiſhneſs, that nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes the diſſocial paſſions of anger, envy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037427_0011_100D40F787348738"/>
from which a conduct ſhocking to humanity often proceeds? Is it not ſelfiſhneſs, that excites am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſires, that ſupplies an heroic courage, and that often prompts to actions called great and noble? Is it not ſelfiſhneſs, that leads many in the paths of morality, while pride or ambition only curb the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure deſires which rankle in their hearts? Is it not ſelfiſhneſs, that leads us almoſt to adore a truly great and conſpicuous character, whoſe virtues may flatter the vanity of his admirers, while a poor benefactor, from whom no ſuch advantage is to be derived, is neglected and forgotten? And, is it not owing to the prevalence of the ſame diſpoſition, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, rebellions and revolutions are much more frequently attempted under a mild and peaceable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, from which little is to be dreaded, than under one, that is more ſevere? And when theſe things are conſidered, is it poſſible not to believe, that mankind are naturally ſelfiſh, and of courſe, that they are not naturally inclined to render to their benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that, which is their due? To ſome, it is true, we may be ready to make ſuitable returns, becauſe in ſome circumſtances, ſuch a conduct would accord with the ſelfiſh feelings of the heart; but, ſo long as there is one benefactor unnoticed or unrewarded by us, let his circumſtances be what they may, ſo long we claim in vain the poſſeſſion of a thankful diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. While, therefore, the evidence, that ſelfiſhneſs prevails to ſo great a degree in the human heart, is ſo complete, we cannot believe, that a real diſpoſition to remember benefactors, prevails there alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mankind are naturally attached to certain ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems, and divide themſelves into certain parties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037427_0012_100D40FA59AD1AD8"/>
the limits of which their benevolence is generally confined. There is ſcarcely any ſubject, in which mankind are generally intereſted, reſpecting which they are not divided. And the effects of ſuch diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions are almoſt invariably inconſiſtent with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial regard, which public benefactors have a right to expect. In religion, the friends of certain ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments claſs themſelves together, imbibe a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for each other, and will generally extol the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and endeavor to exalt as much as poſſible, the reputation of their own denomination; while thoſe, who have embraced a different ſyſtem of faith, are greatly diſregarded, and their virtues treated with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar coldneſs. In politics, the effects of party ſpirit are not leſs evident, nor are the different parties in any reſpect more juſt in their comparative repreſentations of each other. In ſocial life, the diſtinction of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable and vulgar is chargeable with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, though on a ſmaller ſcale. And, may I not add, that particular ſocieties, not excepting even thoſe, which are profeſſedly founded on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of benevolence, are not free from party attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from its unhappy conſequences. A public benefactor, therefore, can only expect, that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its will be duly appreciated, and rewarded by thoſe of his own party, and need not be ſurpriſed, ſhould he, from others receive the coldneſs of inattention, or the more painful effects of unjuſt ſuſpicion or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious calumny.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This painful truth is further evident from that general neglect of religion, which prevails among mankind. When we conſider, that all things here below are the workmanſhip of a God, and that all
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037427_0013_100D40FCA24963B8"/>
events are under a ſuperintending Providence, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but <hi>believe,</hi> whatever we may <hi>feel,</hi> that "every good and perfect gift cometh down from the Father of Lights." And, when this is conſidered, would it be poſſible, if we were poſſeſſed of a right diſpoſition, for us to forget our maker? Would it be poſſible for us not to notice in a moſt thankful manner the hand, that ſupports, defends, and nouriſhes us from day to day? The fact, however, is certain: We do forget our heavenly benefactor: We do conduct toward him in a moſt ungrateful manner. Inſtead of reverential expreſſions, his ears are often aſſailed with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of profaneneſs and blaſphemy. Inſtead of a juſt ſenſe of dependence, and a thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for favors, he hears a vainglorious boaſting in language like this, "by the ſtrength of my hands I have done it, and by my wiſdom, for I am prudent." Inſtead of confidence in God, and a cordial reliance upon his grace through a crucified Savior, he ſees little but a preſumptuous reſting on an arm of fleſh. And, inſtead of a cordial obedience to his commands, he beholds every where the moſt evident tokens of a moſt unnatural rebellion. Such are the natural feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the human heart, and at ſuch a diſtance is it from the exerciſe of that religion, the firſt precept, of which is, "thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart." Now, if this be the caſe, where is the evidence, that mankind are naturally juſt to their benefactors? Why is it, that their firſt and greateſt benefactor is totally diſregarded? Or, can they be ſuppoſed to poſſeſs a principle of juſtice even to their fellow creatures, while they are ſo evidently unjuſt to their Creator?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:037427_0014_100D40FE395B6538"/>
We may, therefore, aſſume it as an undoubted truth, that mankind have not naturally within them, that diſpoſition, which is implied in remembering a benefactor: A truth, which we ought to lament, and for which it becomes us to be deeply humbled before a holy, and a righteous God. It is a truth, which ought to be moſt ſenſibly impreſſed upon our minds this day, leſt, while we are attempting to do juſtice to the memory of one, who was raiſed up in divine Providence for our good, we are found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the moſt eſſential part of our duty.</p>
            <p>While we are endeavoring to realize and improve that afflictive Providence, which has this day called us together, we may doubtleſs be allowed to adopt the language of inſpiration, and ſay, "truly a great man is fallen in our Iſrael." Whether we conſider him in public or in private life; in the field, in the cabinet, or in the domeſtic circle, he appears equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great man—the conſpicuous character. His cool unſhaken courage, while encountering a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior foe; his addreſs in ſupplying a want of the means of defence, and in ſecuring the confidence of his country amidſt complicated diſaſters; his ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated zeal, which could transform a ſmall undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined band of men into a formidable army; the plans, which he concerted, and by which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to free our land from a powerful invaſion; his coolneſs and deliberation in council; his readineſs to liſten to advice, coming from whatever quarter it might; his ardent love of liberty, and his zealous attachment to the cauſe of his country, all declare, that he was raiſed up for the time and place, in which he lived, and that he was particularly fitted for the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037427_0015_100D4100950D53F8"/>
important part, which he acted upon the public thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of life. And when to this portrait of his public character, we add the virtues, that adorned the man; his amiable diſpoſition; his love of induſtry and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; his freedom from vice of every deſcription; his attachment to the arts of civilized life; his rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence for the name of God; and his uniform re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for religion, we behold one of the moſt finiſhed characters, which the higher ſphere of life has ever produced: We behold one who, as we truſt, was truly wiſe; one, who to us was highly uſeful; and one, who will ever demand our grateful remembrance.</p>
            <p>While he was living, there were not wanting num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who duly appreciated his merits, and who uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly paid him that tribute of reſpect and confidence, which was his due. Did ſuſpicion attack the purity of his intentions? Numbers were found, who readily ſtepped forward and eſpouſed his cauſe. Did partyiſm miſrepreſent the meaſures, which he adopted? Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were found, who readily juſtified them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the inſidious deſigns of his oppoſers. Did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy induſtriouſly ſtrive to blacken his character, and prejudice the minds of his countrymen againſt him? Numbers were found, who met ſuch attempts with a becoming reſentment, and ſupported with a grateful firmneſs, both his character and the meaſures of his adminiſtration. Though ſome few may be chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>hankful neglect, yet the unanimity, with which the higheſt and moſt dignified office in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of his country was ſucceſſively conferred upon him, and the unaffected teſtimonials of ſorrow, which his death has fixed upon every countenance, clearly evince, that the great body of the people are
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037427_0016_100D410301E375A0"/>
free from ſuch a charge. But, have we remembered him with that diſpoſition, which real gratitude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies? WASHINGTON was born in the higher ſphere of life; he was ever a conſpicuous and dignified char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and it has long been our glory, that we have duly noticed and rewarded his merits. But, while our minds are, as it were, dazzled by the ſplendors of this great man, may it not be, that there is ſome "poor, wiſe man," who as really claims our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though not to the ſame degree, but, who is now ſuffering the pain and mortification of unmerited ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect? If there is ſuch a character thus neglected by us, WASHINGTON himſelf feels the neglect; for, it proves, that the reſpect, which we have ſhown to him, ariſes rather from the luſtre, which his greatneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon ourſelves, than from a really grateful diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>The virtues of our WASHINGTON are alſo to be imitated, or we do but poorly requite the good, which he has done for us. And in this view there is much, that claims our attention. When called by the voice of his country to defend her inſulted rights; his ready obedience, entering the field with ſcarcely a diſtant proſpect of ſucceſs, devoting himſelf entirely to the good of his country, and uniformly refuſing any conpenſation for his numerous and painful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, evinced the benevolence of his diſpoſition, and ſays unto us, <hi>go ye and do likewiſe.</hi> Amidſt the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, irregularities and temptations of war, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of his temper, the propriety of his conduct, and the frowns with which he invariable and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly checked every ſpecies of profaneneſs, intemperance and diſſoluteneſs of manners, atteſt both the purity,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037427_0017_100D410601F7FB88"/>
and firmneſs of his heart, and ſay unto us, <hi>go ye and do likewiſe.</hi> In the dignified ſtation of Preſident, his attachment to the principles of union, to the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of jarring parties, which muſt ever exiſt in a land, where freedom of thought and ſpeech is the boaſt of each individual, and to a ſyſtem of neutrality amidſt the diſturbances of Europe, clearly indicate an ardent love of his country, and ſay unto us, though acting in a humbler ſphere, <hi>go ye and do likewiſe.</hi> In leaving the arduous taſk of government, in deſcending vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily to the rank of a private citizen, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, without any kind of indignant reſentment, to be choſen to ſome of the loweſt offices of civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, he evinced ſuch an uncommon greatneſs or magnanimity of mind, as is of itſelf ſuperior to grades or diſtinctions of honor, and thereby ſays unto us, <hi>go ye and do likewiſe.</hi> In private life, the delicate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, which he ſhowed to his companion; the tenderneſs, with which he treated his domeſtics; the gravity and moral purity of his deportment; the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which he paid to the arts of civilized life, and to uſeful induſtry; and the uniform regard, which he diſcovered for the religion of his forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, form a moſt beautiful character, and ſay unto us, in a manner peculiarly perſuaſive, <hi>go ye and do likewiſe.</hi> Though like us, he was but man, and though at certain times the imperfections of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity might be viſible in his conduct, yet there was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much in him, that we may well remember by a careful imitation. And if we do it not, whatever may be the teſtimonials of our grief and reſpect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, we do but, in fact, inſult the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of this truly great and virtuous man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:037427_0018_100D41085D3BA868"/>
But while we are endeavoring to remember in a grateful manner, the good deeds, which he has done for his country, we ſhould be careful not to forget, that all is to be conſidered as a gift from God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſubject like this, we are perhaps in danger of aſcribing too much to the inſtrument, and of paying to that a kind of idolatrous homage, while we almoſt forget the Great, the Wiſe Diſpoſer of all human e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. It ought ever to be deeply impreſſed upon our minds, that, whatever may be aſcribed to our benefactors, the glory ſhould ultimately redound to that God, who gave them to us. We ſhould never forget, that it was God, that raiſed up to us a WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, and qualified him for the important part, which he was called to act. We ſhould never forget, that it was God, that diſpoſed him to ſtep forth in defence of his country's rights; that endowed him with a cool and ſteady courage in the day of battle; that gave him perſevering firmneſs in the midſt of diſaſters and gloomy proſpects; that concerted his plans; that fought his battles; that bid him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; and made him, in a political ſenſe, the father of his country. We ſhould never forget, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is due to the illuſtrious man, the glory of his whole life muſt be aſcribed to that inviſible hand, that gave, that made him uſeful, and that has again taken him away.</p>
            <p>Permit me now, in applying the ſubject more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ourſelves, to aſk, whether, conſidering the things, which have been ſaid, we have not reaſon to look within ourſelves, and to bluſh for the degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eracy of our hearts? Can we ſay amidſt all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which we have ſhewn him; amidſt all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037427_0019_100D410AC5C35F50"/>
that we have repoſed in him; and amidſt all the teſtimonials of grief, which his death has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, that we have really poſſeſſed thoſe feelings, which are implied in remembering a benefactor? Can we ſay, that we have uniformly imitated his example, and aſcribed his merits and uſefulneſs to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an over-ruling Providence? Can we ſay, that our hearts like his, have been filled with a love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for virtue's ſake; and that the ſincerity of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teſtifies, that we are not unmindful of our divine benefactor? Have we not, on the contrary, reaſon to mourn, and ſhould not this day be to us a day of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a day of deep humiliation and repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God, whom we have almoſt uniformly ſlighted? And does not that ſolemn providence, which has this day called us together, and which teaches us, that no qualifications, no character, nor no ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a preſervative from the grave, urge upon us this duty, in a manner peculiarly forcible?</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of this day's meeting, and the objects which I behold, admoniſh me, that, before I cloſe, ſome particular addreſſes will be expected. My firſt attention is due to that ſociety, which, without any knowledge of the intentions of our Supreme Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, has made choice of this day, to manifeſt their participation in the general ſorrow, which now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades our land.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>I SHALL not take this opportunity either to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, or to condemn the principles of your inſtitution, not even ſo far as they are ſubmitted to public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. An object of more importance and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037427_0020_100D410D9AE51608"/>
demands our attention. A tribute of gratitude is due to the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and ſtill more, to that God, who in goodneſs has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored us with ſuch a gift. While that afflictive Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, which has taken from you an illuſtrious broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and from our country a faithful parent, bids our tears to flow, it is our duty, not only to ſubmit to the hand of God, but to endeavor to improve in the beſt poſſible manner, this diſtreſſing diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>It is not to be denied, that the inſtitution of Maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry receives a real luſtre from the name of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. It is your part, on the contrary, to ſee, that the inſtitution does not eventually prove a diſgrace to him. How much ſoever you may pride yourſelves in his virtues, it is ſtill a truth, which you ought to feel, that the nature and tendency of your inſtitution will be judged of, in part, by the characters, which you ſuſtain. If, therefore, while you boaſt of a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal connection, you ſhould be guilty of bringing a ſtigma upon the inſtitution, and, in that way, of inſulting his memory with a conduct, at which he himſelf would bluſh, how could you anſwer it to his injured virtues? If, from your mouths the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of profaneneſs ſhould often be heard; if your ſocial meetings ſhould be devoted to bacchanali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an revels; if they ſhould be proſtituted to the baſe purpoſes of political intrigue, if your names ſhould be enrolled among the diſſolute diſturbers of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic felicity; if you ſhould be found favoring each other at the expenſe of the rights of your fellow cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens; if, in fine, there ſhould be in you an apparent contempt of the croſs of our divine Redeemer, with what propriety could you be conſidered as the breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037427_0021_100D410F27EB40E8"/>
of one whoſe life was purity itſelf, and who ever diſcovered a ſerious regard to the inſtitutions of our holy religion? Or, if you muſt be thus conſidered, will not the character of your illuſtrious brother ſuffer from the connection? Should ſuch characters as theſe be indulged amongſt you, you may poſſibly think, that the reputation of Maſonry is ſafe, while ſhielded by the virtues of an illuſtrious brother. But, can you offer ſuch an affront to humanity, as to demand, that the <hi>virtues of the dead</hi> be made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the <hi>vices of the living?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not indulge a thought, that theſe things are ſpoken with a view to reproach your ſociety, or to depreciate the inſtitution in the view of your fellow citizens. Receive them rather as teſtimonials of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the memory of our common defender, and as proofs of a real deſire to have the reſpectability and uſefulneſs of your order ſupported. Flattering enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums are here uſeleſs: For, you cannot be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that while the veil of concealment is induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown over your peculiar concerns, ſuſpicion will be watching you in the moſt critical manner; that every action and word will be ſeverely ſcrutinized, and that the character and tendency of your inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be judged of, rather by the character of the individuals, who compoſe it, than by any thing, that may be ſaid reſpecting it. And, if in an unguarded hour you ſhould be left to reproach the character of that auguſt perſonage, on whoſe account you exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it thoſe badges of mourning, at your hands, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, will his country require it.</p>
            <p>The ſolemnities of this day, the precepts of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, the demands of gratitude, and the rights of

humanity, all require, that you take heed to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And, while preſſing theſe things upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can, moſt cordially, recommend to your imitation the example of that illuſtrious brother whoſe death you now lament: And, will aſſure you, that, if you make him your conſtant pattern, and ſtudy to walk in his footſteps, your inſtitution will not only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as uſeful, but will even command the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention of your country. Let, therefore, his venerable image be ever preſent to your minds; let a remembrance of his virtues be a check upon the firſt ſallies of every impure, every unſuitable deſire, and, under a ſenſe of your dependence, let your knees be bent in humble adoration at the throne of grace, while you ſupplicate that divine aſſiſtance, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can lead you in the paths of virtuous uſefulneſs, and of religious improvement.</p>
            <p>Beholding in this aſſembly a reſpectable number, who are not included in that ſociety, which we have juſt been addreſſing, but who are equally intereſted in the ſolemnities of this day, I ſhall not be excuſed, ſhould I paſs them by in ſilence.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt, my friends, that you really parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in the ſorrows of this mournful occaſion, and that you are animated with an ardent deſire to teſtify your reſpect for the memory of that great man, who has fallen. And, while you are mingling your tears with thoſe of your country, over the tomb of your beloved chief, let them not be the tears of bereaved affection merely, let them be the tears of deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance—the tears of returning gratitude.</p>
            <p>Before you I have endeavored to diſcuſs an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject, and to lead your minds, into what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

to me, to be the path of duty. May the ſpirit of divine grace make it effectual to your hearts; That you have been wanting in returns of gratitude to this truly uſeful man, I would, by no means, be thought to ſuggeſt. Whatever may have been the caſe with others, I ſhall be juſtified in aſſerting, that, notwithſtanding the calumnies raiſed againſt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and the arts, which have been uſed to prejudice him in your minds, your confidence has ever remained unſhaken; you have uniformly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a becoming reſentment the aſperſions caſt upon his character, and it has long been your glory, that you were the friends of your country's chief defender. But, can I ſay, that you have done all, that duty requires? Can I ſay, that ſuitable returns of gratitude have been rendered to that God, who gave you a WASHINGTON to ſight your battles, to guide your councils, to teach you how to live, and again, to teach you how to die? If I find that, which I can commend, do I not alſo find that, which I muſt in faithfulneſs cenſure? And, may I not be allowed to improve the ſolemn objects, which this occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, with a view to the intereſts of your immortal ſouls? Tranſport yourſelves for a moment to the tomb of your beloved chief, and imagine, that you hear his departed ſpirit addreſſing you in language like this: <q>I have paſt the gloomy portals of the grave: Do you prepare to paſs them alſo. I have paſſed them with compoſure and ſerenity of mind, becauſe my life was virtuous, and my conduct uſeful: Do you prepare to paſs them thus, by walking in the path, which my footſteps have marked. I have paſſed them with the glow of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037427_0024_100D4116B1F8D8C0"/>
hope, becauſe I confided in God, and truſted in a crucified Savior: Do you prepare to paſs them thus, by ſubjecting every thought, and every feeling to the revealed will of your holy Sovereign. I have met my God, my final Judge in the world of ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its: Do you prepare to meet him there alſo, for meet him you muſt, either in mercy or in anger.</q>
