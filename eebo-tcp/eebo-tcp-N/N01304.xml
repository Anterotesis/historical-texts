            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Publick <hi>Exhortation</hi> muſt be at this Time, confined unto a <hi>Few words:</hi> The Time of the <hi>Year</hi> will have it ſo! And ſince I am to Diſcourſe IN a <hi>few words,</hi> why ſhould it be Thought Improper or Indecent, if I do it alſo OF a <hi>few words,</hi> and make that the <hi>Subject</hi> of my Diſcourſe?</p>
            <p>Tho' I ſhall not uſe more than a <hi>Few words</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to my <hi>Doctrine;</hi> yet I will be guilty of ſo much Anticipation, as to tell you afore hand, it will be of this Importance; <hi>That a <hi>Few words</hi> may have more than Few or Small Things comprized in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ere I come to a more <hi>direct proof</hi> of that. I will firſt obſerve, an Intimation in the Text before us; That a Good <hi>Exhortation</hi> will ſometimes go down the better, becauſe there are but a <hi>Few words</hi> Employ'd upon it. <hi>Suffer the Exhortation,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. One would think, it might have been ſaid, <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in the <hi>Exhortation; Rejoyce</hi> that you Enjoy ſuch an <hi>Exhortation.</hi> It ſeems, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001552_0003_0FB3A311041C2F60"/>
are moſt unreaſonably indiſpoſed unto what would be for their <hi>Good. Exhortations</hi> that have a Tendency to make them <hi>Good,</hi> and bring them to Eternal <hi>Good,</hi> ſuch <hi>Exhortations</hi> are a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and a <hi>Grievance</hi> to them. Oh! the Folly, and Miſchief of <hi>Sin! Original Sin,</hi> What a Depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haſt thou brought upon us! Our Apoſtle finds out an <hi>Argument</hi> why his <hi>Exhortation</hi> ſhould be tolerable. But there ſeems to be a <hi>Satyr</hi> upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mankind in the <hi>Argument.</hi> Sayes he; <hi>Tis but in Few words;</hi> Men begrutch the <hi>Time</hi> for long Exerciſes and Entertainments of <hi>Religion.</hi> Brave Husbands of their <hi>Time!</hi> Of their <hi>Time,</hi> Two or Three Hours at a Time, can go well enough to meer Impertinencies; but <hi>One Hour</hi> in the <hi>Service</hi> of God; This is a <hi>Suffering.</hi> How many <hi>Hours</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs Converſation</hi> with a Friend are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough! But <hi>One Hour</hi> to converſe with GOD; This is to <hi>Suffer</hi> Egregiouſly. An Hour or Two at the <hi>Table</hi> is well enough; A <hi>Quarter of an Hour</hi> in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> This is an Hardſhip, and hardly to be <hi>Suffered.</hi> Rather <hi>a Thouſand Dayes Elſewhere,</hi> than One in the <hi>Courts of the Lord;</hi> Notable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers of <hi>Time</hi> indeed! Well, The affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are, it ſeems, to be Recommended unto the Children of Men, becauſe they may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a <hi>Few words</hi> in a very Little Time. I confeſs, I do not think, this is much for the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, I ſee Something that may be for the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of them that handle the affairs of it. It was alwayes thought an <hi>Honourable</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001552_0004_0FB3A3128266CEA0"/>
Thing. <hi>To ſay much in a Little,</hi> I need not quote <hi>Euripides</hi> or <hi>Menander</hi> for it. You ſhall find, They that write the <hi>Maxims of Prudence,</hi> will all tell you, <hi>There is no greater ſign of Wit, and Senſe, than to ſay much in a Little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So did our Apoſtle. His <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi> is but a <hi>Short</hi> Epiſtle; it has but a <hi>Few words.</hi> But there is a <hi>Great Deal</hi> in it. It is full of <hi>Myſteries.</hi> It is an admirable <hi>System of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> There never was a <hi>Richer Compoſure</hi> ſeen upon the Face of the Earth. When <hi>Four Excellent Volumns in Folio,</hi> coming after a Library of other Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, have ſearch'd out the Truths contained in it, there is work yet left for more than as many more. <hi>More Treaſures</hi> are ſtill behind; unſpeakably more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that I can obtain this <hi>Doctrine</hi> for you;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That much may be ſaid in a <hi>Few words.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Few words</hi> may have abundance of <hi>matter</hi> in them. A <hi>Few Drops</hi> of Expreſſion, may have an <hi>Ocean</hi> of matter in them.</p>
            <p>We will in a <hi>Few words</hi> proceed unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Great God has in a <hi>Few words</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized all the <hi>Duty,</hi> that He has required of us. The <hi>Duty</hi> that we Owe to our God, it is very ſure, as there is <hi>much</hi> depends on it; <hi>Eternity</hi> depends on it! So, there is very <hi>much</hi> belongs to it. Well, But as <hi>much</hi> as our <hi>Duty</hi> is, I can carry you, where you ſhall ſee a <hi>Few words</hi> containing of it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place; <hi>Ten Words</hi> are a <hi>Few Words.</hi> Now All our <hi>Duty</hi> is compriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in <hi>Ten Words;</hi> You know what I mean; The
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001552_0005_0FB3A31400B175B0"/>
Law of the <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi> The old <hi>Romans</hi> had a famous Inſtrument among them, called, <hi>The Law of the Twelve Tribes.</hi> They ſent Embaſſadors unto foreign Countrys, to bring home an Account, and a Copy of their <hi>Wiſeſt Laws.</hi> Then they Employ'd a Number of their <hi>Wiſest Men,</hi> to Digeſt and Compile a <hi>Body of Laws</hi> out of theſe. The Extract, which was a long while in making, was called, <hi>The Twelve Tables.</hi> When it was done, their Orators admired it for its Excellencies; but eſpecially for the, <hi>Mira Verborum concinnitas;</hi> its admirable Expreſſiveneſs; its Expreſſing in a <hi>Few Words,</hi> the Greateſt and Braveſt Things that ever were uttered. And yet, we have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered about an Hundred Laws that were in it; Many of them <hi>Fooliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> many <hi>Trifling,</hi> many <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Ones! Our <hi>Law of the Two Tables,</hi> does as much Exceed their <hi>Law of the Twelve Tables,</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> does Exceed a <hi>Gloworm.</hi> In theſe <hi>Few Words,</hi> Oh, how much is contained! Well might the Man of God ſay, Pſal. CXIX. 96 <hi>Thy Commandment is Exceeding Broad</hi> Mind the <hi>Rules of Explication</hi> for theſe <hi>Few Words,</hi> and you will preſently be ſenſible of it</p>
            <p>Remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt; That <hi>the Law is Spiritual;</hi> It reaches to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> it calls for the Obedience of the <hi>Inward Man,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Outward Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remember ſecondly; That when a <hi>Duty</hi> is Commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the contrary <hi>Sin</hi> is Forbidden; and when a <hi>Sin</hi> is Forbidden, the contrary <hi>Duty</hi> is commanded.</p>
            <p>Remember, thirdly, That when any <hi>One Duty</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001552_0006_0FB3A315726C3400"/>
is Commanded, and when any <hi>One Sin</hi> is Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, all others of the <hi>Same kind</hi> are alſo Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Forbidden.</p>
            <p>Remember, fourthly; That when any <hi>Duty</hi> is Commanded, all the <hi>Helps</hi> and all the <hi>Signs</hi> of ſuch a Duty are alſo Commanded: And when any <hi>Sin</hi> is Forbidden, all the <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and all the <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and all the <hi>Appearances</hi> of ſuch a Sin are alſo forbidden.</p>
            <p>Remember, laſtly; Tis Exacted &amp; Expected, that we are not only to keep the Law <hi>our ſelves,</hi> but alſo do all we can, and uſe all <hi>Good Means, that others</hi> may keep it.</p>
            <p>Now ſay, Is not this <hi>Commandment Exceeding Bread?</hi> And have not a <hi>Few Words</hi> Excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much Comprized in them? Truly, <hi>Brevius nihil eſt, nec Plenius iſtis.</hi> —</p>
            <p>Here we ought to make a Pauſe; and in a <hi>Few Words</hi> deſcribe a <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which we muſt all now be neceſſarily obliged unto.</p>

               <hi>whole</hi> of our <hi>Duty,</hi> comprized in <hi>Ten Words.</hi> Well, but I will ſhow it you in <hi>Three Words. <hi>Three</hi>
               </hi> are not <hi>Many. Tribus Verbis,</hi> was an ancient Proverb for the greateſt <hi>Brevity</hi> imaginable In ſo <hi>Few Words</hi> you have it; Mic. VI 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, the Good Thing. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Juſtice, and to Love Mercy, and to Walk Humbly with thy God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More Briefly yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will ſhow it you in <hi>Two Words. <hi>Two Words</hi>
               </hi> are but <hi>Few Words.</hi> But now, what think you of thoſe <hi>Two Words?</hi> Matt. XXII 37.— 40 <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind. This is the Firſt and Great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Second is like unto it; Thou ſhalt Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf. On theſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments hang all the Law, and the Prophets.</hi> How much, how much do theſe <hi>Two Words</hi> carry in them! The very ſame, and it is a very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Hint</hi> that I give you, when I tell you, tis the <hi>very ſame!</hi> — You have, 1 Joh III. 23 <hi>This is His Commandment, That we ſhould Believe on the Name of His Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and Love One another, as He gave us Commandment.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001552_0008_0FB3A31A9B3AF280"/>I can give another Inſtance of ſuch an <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Sentence.</hi> Tis that <hi>Golden Rule</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; Matth.

            <p>I will only add, You all know, our Lord gave his Diſciples a <hi>Platform of Prayer,</hi> which in a <hi>Few Words</hi> does contain the whole matter of all our <hi>Prayers.</hi> Our <hi>Prayers</hi> may ask nothing of <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is in the Heavens,</hi> (for ſo the firſt clauſe ought to be tranſlated,) but what this Exquiſite

            <p>I will in a <hi>Few Words,</hi> yea, in <hi>One Word,</hi> give you the <hi>Reaſon</hi> for this <hi>Abbreviation of our Duty.</hi> Our Gracious God, has had <hi>Compaſſion</hi> on our Frail and Weak Faculties in this <hi>Abbreviation:</hi> Particularly, on the <hi>Frailty</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of our <hi>Memories.</hi> We can't <hi>Remember</hi> more than a <hi>Few Words.</hi> Our <hi>Duty</hi> muſt be given us in a <hi>Few Words,</hi> that it may be the more Eaſily <hi>Remembred</hi> with us.

            <p>Having offered you this Intimation, I will offer you a very <hi>Short</hi> Inference and <hi>Inſtruction</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>Certainly, we may in Like manner <hi>Conſider the Capacities</hi> of thoſe that are under <hi>our Instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is poſſible, we have poor Stupid Abject <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's</hi> under our Charge. Oh! Remember the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> you muſt give to the Glorious Lord, about

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who Made you and all the World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Great</hi> GOD <hi>Made me to Serve Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who Saves the Children of Men from all their Miſeries?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who is both God and Man, Saves them that Look unto Him</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What will become of you when you Dye?</hi>

            <p>It muſt be an extraordinary <hi>Sottiſhneſs</hi> indeed, if the Learning of theſe <hi>Three Short Queſtions</hi> can't be infuſed into them.</p>
            <p>And thus, our <hi>Children.</hi> We may betimes get a whole <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> into their Little Souls. We are furniſhed with <hi>Abridgments</hi> of it.

bear a <hi>Beating out,</hi> into more Volumns, than there are in a <hi>Vatican,</hi> or a <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library. It is a wondrous Thing, that we find out by our <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopes.</hi> In a little Body, more than a thouſand times ſmaller than a Grain of Sand, there lye folded up, all the parts of a <hi>Plant,</hi> or of an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> which are afterwards Evolved and Extended, unto mighty Dimenſions.

But the Subject is not Exhauſted; we their Children are to this Day ſtill upon it: ſtill hanging on, ſtill drawing at, that <hi>Breaſt of Conſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is that <hi>Myſtery;</hi> 1 Joh V 7 <hi>There are Three who teſtify in Heaven, The Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and theſe Three are One.</hi> It is compriſed in a <hi>Few Words.</hi>

            <p>There are the <hi>Benefits</hi> of our Great Saviour Propoſed unto us in a <hi>Few Words;</hi> 1 Cor.

            <p>Tis only a <hi>Scriptural Demonstration,</hi> which I have hitherto given you, That <hi>much</hi> may be ſaid in a <hi>Few Words.</hi> And ſuch is the moſt <hi>Suitable Demonstration;</hi> for a <hi>Preacher</hi> who would <hi>Seek out Acceptable Words.</hi> But then, for a more <hi>General Demonſtration,</hi> I need only refer you to the <hi>Rules of Implication</hi> One Thing will <hi>Imply</hi> many Things. A <hi>Few Words</hi> will have many, many <hi>Things</hi> in them, if the <hi>Rules of Implication</hi> be duely attended unto; And <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> will uſe to attend unto them. The words of <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> have ſometimes been called.<hi>Golden Words.</hi> In <hi>Gold,</hi> much lies in a <hi>Little Room.

are drawn out by the <hi>Rules of Implications,</hi> they may reach further than could have been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. There was a ſort of <hi>Sentences,</hi> that of old were called <hi>Laconiſms.</hi> The Wiſe men of the Time and Place choſe to Speak <hi>Laconically.</hi> They were very <hi>Sententious.</hi> They gave a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, <hi>That much may be Spoken in a <hi>Few Words.</hi>
               </hi> I do not know, why this may not be Practiſed among other People, as well as the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> You Know, <hi>Vir Sapit;</hi> A <hi>Wiſe</hi> man will <hi>Speak Little;</hi> but ſtill much more <hi>Wiſe</hi> he that will <hi>Speak much in a Little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in a <hi>Few Words,</hi> Let a Two-fold <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> arrive unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> The <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> of Expreſſing our ſelves in a <hi>Few Words,</hi> eſpecially on Some Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Let this be more Studied; The <hi>Folly</hi> of uſing <hi>too many Words,</hi> Let this be Diſliked, be Avoided.</p>
            <p>It is firſt, in our <hi>Devotions,</hi> that ſuch a Study muſt be maintained. In our <hi>Prayers,</hi> there is eſpecially One ſort of Words, which we ſhould beware of having too many of them. <hi>Vowes</hi> are ſuch Words. Take heed, Sirs, of having too many ſuch. Thus we are adviſed, Eccl V. 2. <hi>Let not thy Heart be haſty to utter any Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; Let thy Words be Few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour has alſo left another Caution with us; That we ſhould not think, our <hi>Prayers</hi> will find the more Acceptance with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe of <hi>Many Words</hi> uſed in them.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001552_0015_0FB3A3260EBADFC0"/>
He has cautioned us; Matth. VI. 7. <hi>When ye Pray, uſe not Vain Repetitions, as the Heathen do; for they think, they ſhall be heard for their much Speaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will add; Tho' there may be Occaſion for us to be <hi>Long at Prayer;</hi> yet for a man to uſe <hi>Tautologies</hi> in his Prayer; to uſe <hi>many Words,</hi> and come with one thing over and over, on purpoſe to Spin out the Prayer; This is <hi>to take the Name of the Lord thy God in Vain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more; We ſhould not Slubber and Hurry over our <hi>Family-Prayers.</hi> They ſhould be made, as by Men, who do not know, but that <hi>this is the Laſt Prayer that over they ſhall make in this World!</hi> Think ſo, my Friend, when Kneeling down with thy <hi>Family.</hi> Yet it is for the moſt part an Inconvenient Thing, to make thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> very <hi>Long</hi> ones. It may be no Service to the Intereſts of Piety in the Family. In a word, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves it unto us, That CHRIST and <hi>Paul,</hi> commands us, to make our Prayers, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But then, We are to Watch againſt the <hi>Folly</hi> of <hi>Talking too much</hi> in all our <hi>Converſation.</hi> Eſpecially, when the <hi>Errors</hi> of other People, are to be taxed, or when we are to Expreſs our <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> and <hi>Reſentment</hi> of their Miſcarriages

The Rule for us is, <hi>Quiquid Praecipies eſto Brevis.</hi> They will call to mind what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid, <hi>Suffer me a Little, and I will ſhew what I have to ſpeak on God's behalf.</hi> They will not make the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Heaven <hi>Tedious</hi> and <hi>Irkſome.</hi> They will Stand but a <hi>Little while</hi> in delivering of them, when either Severe <hi>Cold,</hi> or Extreme <hi>Heat,</hi> ſhall render it uneaſy to attend upon them.

            <p>In conformity to this Maxim, I will now addreſs the Auditory with a moſt <hi>Various Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but in as <hi>Few Words</hi> as can be imagined.</p>

            <p>Firſt; O Unregenerates, The <hi>Miſery</hi> of your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate State</hi> is to be ſet before you. It ſhall be done in a <hi>Few Words.</hi> Ah, Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, Take thoſe <hi>Few Words</hi> into your Meditation; Eph. II. 1, 2 3. <hi>Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; Walking according to the Courſe of this World, and according to the Spirit which works in the Children of Diſobedience: fulfilling the Deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind; and by Nature Children of Wrath.</hi> Oh! What a <hi>Black Sea of Death,</hi> have theſe <hi>Few Words</hi> thrown you into! Think of them; or Think of theſe <hi>Few Words; <hi>What am I doing?</hi>
               </hi> And, <hi>Where am I going?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; We muſt now in a <hi>Few Words</hi> tell theſe Poor <hi>Slaves</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> What they ſhall do to be <hi>Saved.</hi> O Take into your Meditation thoſe <hi>Few Words,</hi> Mark XVI. 16 <hi>He that believeth ſhall be Saved.</hi> The meaning of thoſe <hi>Few Words</hi> is This. Feel your ſelves <hi>Wretched;</hi> See your ſelves <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nable</hi> to get out of your fearful Wretchedneſs. Own your ſelves <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> that God ſhould help you to get out. Behold a <hi>Saviour</hi> provided for you. Cry to God for <hi>Help</hi> to Embrace that <hi>Only Saviour.</hi> Plead the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of your Saviour, that your Sin may be Pardoned. Plead the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001552_0019_0FB3A32C376BED60"/>
of your Saviour, that you may have a Title to Life. Reſign your ſelves up to the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of your Saviour, that He may Enlighten you, and Purify you, and Rectify you, and fit you for, and bring you to, the Heavenly World. In theſe <hi>Few Words</hi> You have <hi>All!</hi> That <hi>One Word,</hi> REPENTANCE, has a great deal, Oh! a great deal intended in it. Sinners, Tis more than a meer Crying out, <hi>Lord, Have Mercy upon me.</hi> But this <hi>One Word,</hi> and all that is in it, muſt be complied withal, by all that would find Mercy with God.</p>
            <p>But then, Thirdly; In a <hi>Few Words</hi> we are to ſhow the Believer, What <hi>Life</hi> he is to Lead; How he is to <hi>Live,</hi> that he may <hi>Dye</hi> with Safety and Comfort. Oh! Let your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation be much on thoſe <hi>Few Words;</hi> Eccl. XII. 13.14 <hi>Let us hear the Concluſion</hi> [and ſo, the Contraction] <hi>of the whole Matter; Fear God, and Keep His Commandments; For God ſhall bring every work into Judgment.</hi> Or, Take it in <hi>Other Words;</hi> and thoſe not very <hi>many</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Spend your <hi>Time</hi> now, as thoſe that muſt give an <hi>Account</hi> unto God how you have Spent it. <hi>Now</hi> do nothing, that you may juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend will be Condemned in the <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now</hi> do every thing, that you may be juſtly apprehenſive will in the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> be Rewarded. <hi>Now</hi> employ all your <hi>Talents,</hi> as Knowing, that in the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> You
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001552_0020_0FB3A32DD45CAD50"/>
muſt be Accountable for them. Or, if you would have all the <hi>Rules of Holy Living</hi> in <hi>One Word.</hi> Even <hi>So</hi> you ſhall have them; and that <hi>One Word</hi> ſhall be this; <hi>Live always as in the Preſence of God;</hi> and, <hi>Act as having the Eye of God always upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. Many People are under <hi>Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> about the Guilt of their Sins; Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with Fears that the <hi>Day of Grace</hi> is over with them; Or, perhaps, that they have <hi>Sinn'd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npardonably.</hi> I will take away all their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, with a <hi>Few Words.</hi> They ſhall be thoſe; Joh. VI. 37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Ah, Diſcouraged Souls; Theſe <hi>Few Words</hi> from the Mouth of a Lovely JESUS; They are Enough to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all your Objections. A SAVIOUR: An Able and a Willing <hi>Saviour;</hi> O all <hi>Fleſh,</hi> be Silent before Him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. There are many <hi>Afflictions</hi> which our Neighbours Encounter withal. I will direct them in a <hi>Few Words,</hi> how to Behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They are thoſe, Heb. XII 5 <hi>My Son, Deſpiſe not thou the Chastning of the Lord; nor Faint when Rebuked of Him.</hi> Or, in <hi>Other Words</hi> of the like Importance; <hi>Think whom thy Afflictions come from; Think what thy Afflictions come for; And be more Studious to Get Good by thy Afflictions, than to get out of thy Afflictions.</hi> The famous Two Words of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> which were <hi>Suſtine
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001552_0021_0FB3A32F4899D7E0"/>
ot Abſtine;</hi> that is, <hi>Bear,</hi> and, <hi>Forbear;</hi> were not more important ones.</p>
            <p>Finally; My Hearers; If you Sleight the <hi>Few Words</hi> in which you have the Holy Counſils of God, Let a <hi>Few Words</hi> tell you the Iſſue of it. Thoſe words; Phil. III. 19. <hi>Their End is Deſtruction, who Mind Earthly Things.</hi> But if you Entertain theſe <hi>Few Words</hi> with a due Affection and Obedience, a <hi>Few Words</hi> will tell you the Iſſue of that alſo. Thoſe words; Jam. I 25. <hi>A Door of the work, this man ſhall be Bleſſed in his Deed.</hi> SALVATION, is but <hi>One Word;</hi> Yet, my Friend, it contains all that an Immortal Soul can wiſh for And it is all Thine, if thou hearken to the <hi>Few Words</hi> in the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know, You Expect I ſhould obſerve a <hi>Decorum,</hi> and not at this Time uſe <hi>Many words.</hi> Theſe <hi>Few Words</hi> may be ſufficient, for the preſent Exerciſe, May the Grace of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them!</p>
