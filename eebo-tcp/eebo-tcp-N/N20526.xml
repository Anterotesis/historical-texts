         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had no proof of theſe declarations having been made, Mr. Fielding very liberally conſented to allow the Challenges; the remainder of the Jury having been diſcharged, the trial went off for defect of Jurors to February Seſſion, and the Defendant was remanded to Newgate.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the jury,</p>
               <p>Your attention, as a Jury of the City of London, is called to another proſecution for the publication of a miſchievous and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Libel. I ſay another, for true it is there have been many
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026931_0010_0FD26666CDF1B3C0"/>
proſecutions for offences of this deſcription, and unleſs it be that your ſervants, the ſervants of the public in reſponſible ſituations in Government, and particularly that ſervant of the public, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-General, ſhould be remiſs where he ought to be active ſhould be ſluggiſh where he ought to be alert, or be aſleep when he ought to be awake, proſecutions of this nature muſt come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. When they do come before you, they come before the tribunal beſt calculated to determine upon every thing that ſuch a proſecution imputes, and before the tribunnal beſt calculated to determine upon the innocence or guilt of the accuſed.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. I take upon me to aſſure myſelf, that you are all well aware of the nature and extent of the duty you are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing. There have been agitations lately about the power of a Jury, and the interpoſition of a Court; the differences always ſeemed to me extremely trifling; but now there is no kind of heſitation as to the extent of the proper province of a Jury upon ſuch occaſions as the preſent:—it is this, and God forbid it ſhould be otherwiſe, that in the very frame work of the crime, the Jury ſhould have a full cognizance of it, and a full juriſdiction over it: that the Jury ſhould be alone the judges, as to the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the criminality charged; that neither the book itſelf nor a paragraph extracted from the book, nor any expreſſion ſhall be ſaid to be criminal, unleſs the Jury go with that idea, which forms a part of the Indictment, imputing to the publiſher the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal intention aſcribed upon that Indictment. God be praiſed, that power is fully acknowledged. All that the officer of the Crown has done in this inſtance is, and with a vigilance becoming him, to ſee that the matter imputed to the priſoner now, ſhould come before a Jury of the City of London for their determination. What the duty of the Attorney-General was, in the firſt inſtance, is as it were your duty now. You are to look at the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he has done; but you have a greater power than he has, for you are to determine upon the guilt or innoeence of the party accuſed.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I confeſs in the agitation of queſtions relative to libel, it has frequently ſtruck my mind, ſome things perhaps had been better without proſecution, and that proſecutions ought to be directed againſt others; but in the reſult of all theſe enquiries as far as my mind has enabled me to come to a reſult, I can only lament the imperfection of all poſſible human eſtabliſhments.</p>
               <p>If ſedition were ſuffered to be ſcattered abroad among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in any poſſible way, to be ſure any man of common ſenſe muſt eaſily and readily go along with me in ſaying, that infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief muſt follow. What then is to be done? It is the duty of that great law cfficer of the country, the Attorney-General, when
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026931_0011_0FD266612285F788"/>
he has information from the different perſons who are employed under him, and by his directions to inform him of thoſe things that are going on in ſociety; if they ſhould appear to have a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency, it highly becomes him to put them in a ſtate of inquiry, that puniſhment may follow where puniſhment is deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that puniſhment may follow under the adminiſtration of juſtice in this country according only to the law; that idea is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in a ſhort Latin ſentence, which I will beg leave to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: Puniſhment is only intended <hi>"ut paena in paucas metus in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes incidat;"</hi> that is, that the puniſhment which muſt follow the conviction of the crime, ſhould only fall upon a few, and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a few glaring offenders, that all ſhould apprehend the danger of tranſgreſſing.</p>
               <p>The Attorney-General, who cannot do himſelf the honor of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending before you to-day, and therefore it devolves upon me, in my humble ſtation, to repreſent this caſe to you, he would have ſaid this if he had been here, which I will ſay for him. I have now diſcharged my duty, I only ſubmit the queſtion to you, and it is for you to decide; he can do no more, and I am ſure you will do your duty, as he has done his.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the particular charge which has been ſtated by my friend, and had before been ſtated to you by the Officer of the Court, I ſhall beg the liberty of calling your attention to again. But before I do this, let me remark, that when a man is proſecuted for words ſpoken, it ſeldom happens, unleſs the behaviour of the perſon has furniſhed evidence againſt himſelf, either by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he has ſpoken the words, the place in which he has ſpoken the words, or other circumſtances, that the evidence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention can ſo fairly be got at, as to leave no doubt what ever. In a publication, likewiſe, it may ſome times be difficult to come at the intent of the author; but in order to do that, you muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily go into the context, and into the whole publication. Where it can ariſe as a defence for the man accuſed, that the words which are ſelected for proſecution convey a different mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when taken in detached ſentences, from what they bear in connection with the general context, it is fair that he ſhould have that defence; he ſhould have the advantage of the whole taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So on the contrary, if the whole being taken together manifeſts the intention of a part, it is equally proper, that as the evidence on one ſide may be in his ſavor, ſo on the other ſide it is to be conſidered whether it is not againſt him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the paragraphs ſelected here, and which are ſtated upon this Indictment by neceſſary innuendos, as they are called in law, that is when a part n ſaid to be offenſive, it is neceſſary, in point of law, that that very expreſſion ſhould be ſo pointed out,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026931_0012_0FD26667E3607CF0"/>
and ſhould be ſaid to be ſo far criminal, as that it means ſo and ſo; whether the meaning be fair or not, it is you province to determine. Now, Gentlemen, in the preſent inſtance the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph which has been ſelected is of this nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You muſt know then that I uſed, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds and poultry, and among other things of this kind I had a very fine majeſtie kind of animal, a Game Cock,</q>—meaning thereby, as we have taken upon us to ſtate upon this record, to allude to the perſon of his Majeſty.—Gentlemen, this is the meaning which is aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, whether it bears this meaning is your province as I ſaid before to determine. Then Gentlemen, you are to judge of it in this way; it makes it's appearance in a pamphlet, price two-pence, entitled— "Politics for the People."—Politics for the People—For whom is it meant? Is it not meant to be circulated among the people? according to the common acceptation of the term people. Politics—circumſtances of public agitation ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the conſideration of the loweſt claſs of ſociety.</p>
               <p>Then the firſt part of the title is—"Politics for the People," it goes on "or Hog's Waſh." I dare ſay, Gentlemen, hat many of you can account for the adoption of that term, <hi>Hog's Waſh.</hi> I confeſs it ſtrikes me that, it has been taken up by the author of this book, as a ſort of comment upon a term or terms which eſcaped in the heat of debate in parliament from ſome member there. I remember ſome expreſſion being made uſe of which has undergone a variety of comments, where the SWINISH MULTITUDE had been the term uſed. I confeſs I would not have been the perſon to have made uſe of ſuch an expreſſion; but, however, it does not ſeem to me to convey ſuch an idea as juſtifies the following it up with ſuch comments, for it has been followed up with a continuance of comment which has extended the meaning, I am perſuaded, infinitely beyond the mind of the Gentleman who made uſe of it; it might have been reprehenſible, I do not ſay but it was reprehenſible, but the intention aſcribed here is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe, uſing the words in this way is much more likely to produce the very effect which we ſay this libel is calculated to produce.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, yon ſee the title of this pamphlet is—<q>Politics for the people; or, Hog's Waſh;</q> indeed it is intituled <q>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 8,</q> ſo as to manifeſt that there have been many preceding this publication; its price is two pence. It begins indeed with poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which you will have an opportunity of ſeeing by and by if you pleaſe, but as I have much to ſay to you upon the preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, I will not waſte your time by adverting to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are immaterial. The poetry in the firſt part, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026931_0013_0FD26669639A4200"/>
you ſhall read at your leiſure: if there is any thing that can render it pleaſant to the imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or improving to the mind, or in any ſhape have a tendency to favour the defendant in the leaſt degree, I beſeech you to read it, and give him the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, then we come to the ſecond page, at the top of which there appears this— <q> King Chaunteclere, or the Fate of Tyranny;</q> and it is ſuppoſed to be <q>An anecdote related by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen Thelwall at the Capel Court Society, during the diſcuſſion of a queſtion relative to the comparative influence of the Love of Life and Liberty, and of the Fair Sex, on the actions of mankind.</q> I ſhall not waſte much of your time in commenting upon either the paſſage I have read, or what follows, ſaving this, that Mr. Thelwall is repreſented as diſcuſſing this queſtion, and as diſcuſſing thoſe matters which may be ſuppoſed to relate to the love of life and the love of liberty; and if you can put any other interpretation upon it than that which readily ſtarts into my mind, for God's ſake do it: but ſee if it be not this, if the very agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that queſtion is not to beget a ſort of indifference about the ſhedding of human blood, driving, as it were, the mind to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of danger, and ſetting up an ideal liberty, not a real one; but making von ſuppoſe, or attempting to make you ſuppoſe, that every other thing but liberty, as they are pleaſed to call it, is to be held in contempt; that every thing which ſtands in the way of it, that any thing which may under any poſſibility be deemed likely to beget tyranny, is to be got rid of, inaſmuch as it is in the way of that liberty; and that Kings are in the way of liberty, and are only to be got rid of by death, by cutting off the head.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it would be impertinent in me to ſuppoſe that you were not as converſant as myſelf with the evils that pervade a neighbouring country. It would be impertinent in me to ſuppoſe you are not equally apprized of the fatal and melancholy cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe attending the late King of France: but before I comment fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this paſſage, let me call your attention to another little paragraph appearing in this book, which I declare to God when I firſt read I could not get over without tears. The circumſtance is mentioned in ſuch a flippant way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo oppoſite to the feelings of a man of common humanity, that I think you will go with me in your feelings as ſoon as ever I ſtate this little paragraph to you.</p>
               <p>You have heard that there was a man on the other ſide of the water of the name of Monſieur Condorcet. This is a paragraph that the author of this book has inſerted under the title of "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of a True Briton:" but before I read the paragraph, I will confeſs that my mind is relieved a little in not being obliged to lock upon that man as the author. I proſecute him only as the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026931_0014_0FD2666B2A285008"/>
publiſher. If I were to look upon him as the author, my eye could I hardly turn towards him without a flaſh of indignation: but I am relieved from that by his being proſecuted as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher, and not as the author. Now, Gentlemen, obſerve the flip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, the unfeeling, the cruel manner in which a tranſaction like that to which I have alluded is mentioned—<q>Monſieur Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorcet, when he announced in his gazette that our <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> had been ſhut up on the news of Louis Capet's death, pleaſantly obſerved, <hi>That it was not the common players who acted in the farce of that day.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now what does this betoken? A min<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> looking at a tranſaction of that ſort with a degree of pleaſure and unconcern. There is a common idea, and I am ſure it is impreſſed upon every man's mind, from the higheſt to the loweſt in ſociety, and which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently manifeſts itſelf in an expreſſion of that ſort—<q>Had my dog met with ſuch a fate, I ſhould have regretted him:</q> but, heavenly God! can we diveſt ourſelves of thoſe feelings that grow up with us in ſociety, and under the indulgence of which we are indebted for every poſſible human felicity: for without feelings of tenderneſs and compaſſion, what would the human being be? Gentlemen, we have at this day but too many opportunities of ſeeing <hi>what a beaſt</hi> a human being is, when he breaks looſe from the bonds of ſociety, and betakes himſelf to thoſe courſes which follow from anarchy and confuſion.</p>
               <p>This paragraph, therefore, is found in this book; I ſay, that is lamentable indeed; but it is found in a chapter thus deſcribed, "The Reflections of a True Briton." God forbid that that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which ſtands almoſt above all others in the world, a Briton, a manly, a true Briton, God forbid that he ſhould ever be found to have a heart like that, a characteriſtic which impeaches the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and feeling of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that can never be the reflection of a true Briton: bur the author, whoever he be, that has aſſumed this character, has traduced the name and character of a true Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, when he aſſumes himſelf to be ſuch, and follows a courſe like that which I have repreſented to you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this chapter contains that which is the ſubject of another count in this indictment: "Kings are wolf ſhepherds." Will you permit me for a moment to digreſs a little into that which I hope will ever remain a ſubject unattacked? Shall it be allowed to a man to impoſe upon fair anderſtandings, having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in his mind, and having no poſſible earthly good purpoſe; ſhall it be allowed to ſuch a man to ſay, Here I am as a friend of mankind agitating a fair queſtion? God forbid that fair diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be ever the ſubject of an attack, or ſhould ever call upon you for your deliberation. Fair diſcuſſion upon points of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026931_0015_0FD2666C6F6C6D38"/>
government is as open to the ſubject and as allowable as the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other queſtions; and I will be bold to ſay, that never yet was it ſuppoſed, from the beginning of civil ſociety to the preſent hour, that the man who meant fairly, whoſe heart moved honeſtly, who was an uſeful member of ſociety, who could be ſaid to be a good father, a good huſband, a kind neighbour, and who was endowed with the common ſocial feelings, it never yet was ſaid that there could be a doubt whether ſuch a man meant fairly when diſcuſſing topics of this deſcription.</p>
               <p>Many attempts have been made to pervert the underſtanding of thoſe who have the ultimate juriſdiction: for, God knows, it has happened but too frequently in our profeſſion, that ingenuity has been carried to the utmoſt height, a thing allowable in the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, to give the moſt plauſible interpretation, or the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comment, where there has been any pretence for calling the work under proſecution, fair diſcuſſion. But I need not trouble you on this ſubject, inaſmuch as this varies as much from every ſpecies of libel of that kind, as any thing the moſt inſignificant can from the moſt important.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, now let me call your attention a little to that which is the ſpecific ſubject of the indictment, and ſee whether you can affix any other than that very meaning that is put upon the whole of this ſentence by the inuendoes. If you can, you will: but judge of it fairly, and ſee if it does not import this, for I think it cannot import any thing elſe. <q>You muſt know then that I uſed, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds and poultry; and, among other things of this kind, I had a very fine majeſtic kind of animal, a game cock, a haughty ſanguinary tyrant, nurſed in blood and ſlaughter from his infancy, fond of foreign wars and <hi>domeſtic rebellions,</hi> into which he would ſometimes drive his ſubjects by his oppreſſive obſtinacy, in hopes that he might increaſe his power and glory by their ſuppreſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, without going any further in ſtating that which is the particular and ſpecific ground of this indictment, can you have a doubt upon this? Then ſo far I am ſure I may take the liberty of ſaying, that I have not a doubt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> your minds will go with me as to the meaning which is affixed to theſe words.</p>
               <p>Then we come to that which is the main part of the enquiry, and of every jury's enquiry upon a ſubject of this ſort, <hi>the intention of the man.</hi> If the author were ſtanding before you, it would be impoſſible in the nature of things for any ingenuity upon earth to ſay that he had a fair, a kind, or a good intention. What is it calculated, what is it intended for? To go among the people, to be bought up by them at two-pence a-peece. So it is to be circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;

and whatever is to be inferred from this ſtory is to bt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon their minds.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I confeſs very lately when I was looking over a French publication, a pamphlet of Monſieur Briſſot's, there was a paſſage in it that ſtruck me with aſtoniſhment at the neatneſs of the deſcription and the juſtneſs of the remark, as to the conſequence which muſt take place wherever the circumſtances exiſt which gave riſe to the obſervation; it ſtruck me, I ſay, with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He is ſpeaking of the terrible want of order in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of the manner in which diſcontents are diſſeminated; and he carries his attention down to the poor cottager, who being poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned himſelf, carries the contagion not only to his own home, but ſpreads it around his little hut. So it is with every thing of this ſort, ſo it is indeed, to make uſe of a ſimile: if a ſtone be thrown into the water, at firſt we perceive a little circle upon the ſurface, another ſtill ſucceeds, and then another, till the whole circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is immenſe, is deſcribed in that circle. And, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when we look at the poſſibility of diſſeminating diſcontents, we muſt always ſee that the beginning muſt be of this nature.</p>
               <p>What then is this calculated for? Not to meet the eye, not to reach the ear, not to be an object of ſearch of any man of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of any gentlemen ſuch as you: but it is calculated to find its way among the loweſt of the people, to excite them to diſcontents and commotions. Such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch only, can be its purpoſe. The very nature of the publication, the price, the title of it, all manifeſt this If it were to come to the attention, if it were to fall before the eye of any men better informed than the rude and vulgar, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they would have looked upon it as contemptible. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is ſo contemptible, it does not follow that it is not the leſs miſchievous. The obſervation I make to you for your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is, that it is infinitely more miſchievous, the more the thing is calculated to harraſs and diſturb the lower order of the people.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, no man is hardy enough to expoſe himſelf at once to the immediate fang of the law. Bad minds have always their contrivances about them: but God be praiſed, for the benefit of ſociety, thoſe contrivances ſeldom are capable of avail: they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expoſe their authors to puniſhment. So it is here. Not that this man, or the author, whoever he may have been, would dare openly to have attacked the King of this country, or would dare openly to ſay to any part of the multitude, Do this or that; nor would he do ſo in his writing: but there is a contrivance made uſe of, it is written in a ſpecies of fable; a ſpecies of ſimile or allegory, as it is called, is uſed to convey thoſe ſentiments. But whatever the contrivance may be, we are to reſort to that which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026931_0017_0FD266735C192168"/>
is capable of unravelling the myſtery in both inſtances; namely, the fair and ſober enquiry of a jury. And whatever the nature of the concealment may be, if a man makes uſe of a ſimilitude, if he is charged with meaning the King by the character of a Cock, it is for you fairly to ſay whether he had not this meaning; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that there is no poſſible device or artifice of a man that ſhall ſcreen him from the inveſtigation of a jury: and if a jury conceive he has ſo wrought up this matter by putting upon it any ſort of flimſy concealment, they will ſtrip the veil from it, they will look at it, and ſee what the matter is that is ſo concealed. So in this caſe the author has endeavoured, by alluding to a game cock, to conceal his intention.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, I call your attention moſt earneſtly to that which Citizen Thelwall, as he is ſuppoſed to be, is diſcuſſing in this libel. You will ſee from the part which precedes, and the circumſtances that follow, there could have been no other object in the mind of the author than thoſe objects to which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, when you travel a little further on in this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (the book is not large, it would not take you up above ten minutes to read it all through) I will not indeed inſult you by ſuppoſing that any of you have read it with any attention, though it may have got by accident into your hands very fairly, and you may have looked at it, and may have laughed at part of it: but you will find another part which manifeſts what the intention of the man is. He is firſt of all commenting upon the nature of the right which every ſubject has in this country, to inſiſt upon a free and open diſcuſſion. God forbid that free and open diſcuſſion ſhould ever be abridged. And how can it be abridged? It can never be but by thoſe men who are the worſt enemies to ſociety, abuſing the liberty of diſcuſſion. So it is with the liberty of the preſs, the moſt invaluable bleſſing, at the mention of which every man is alive. There is no man can check another's publication of his thoughts, whatever his thoughts may be: but if thoſe thoughts turn out to be miſchievous to the public, and, inſtead of ſerving the purpoſes of mankind, threaten their ruin and deſtruction, God forbid that thoſe thoughts ſo promulgated ſhould not provoke an enquiry, for then they become the fair objects of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The liberty of the preſs, that boaſt, and higheſt boaſt almoſt of an Engliſhman, how is that to be endangered? It may be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for aught I know, in ſucceeding generations; and I am ſure, if ever it is put in danger, it will be by the abuſes of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe who are the greateſt enemies to it, at the very time they are putting on the audacious effrontery of pretendiug to be its friends. Thoſe men who are the authors and publiſhers of things like this, are at
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026931_0018_0FD26674EA886D80"/>
all times the men to ſtand forward with the moſt unbluſhing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery, and ſay, the liberty of the preſs is violated in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; conſcious as they are that they are the men whoſe conduct, originating in the worſt motives, is calculated to produce miſchiefs innumerable in ſociety; well knowing that they deſerve no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, being in the very abuſe of that which ought to be looked upon as the chiefeſt bleſſing of the country. So it is with publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this ſort. This circumſtance is aſſumed in another part of the book. Mr. Thelwall, the character ſuppoſed to be in being here, and upon the ſcene, is repreſented as attacked during the diſcuſſion of the queſtion; and there is a ſentiment which he brings forward in conſequence of that attack, which is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous nature indeed. After having mentioned what had paſſed in the ſociety, he ſays,— <q>Theſe circumſtances are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to be generally known; ſince they prove that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the falſe appearances which have been artfully aſſumed by intriguing and intereſted individuals, pretending to more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than they have, there is no power in this country that can openly and legally interfere to prevent the freedom of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſcuſſion, if individuals will have ſpirit enough to aſſert it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is this but ſaying, to any parcel of people that may be collected together in any place, "Gentlemen, if you have indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſpirit enough to aſſert, and inſiſt upon any ſort of freedom that you think proper, have but that ſpirit in the individual, the accumulated ſpirit of thoſe individuals muſt be capable of carrying into effect whatever your intention may be." Is it any thing elſe, is it ſhort of that? Then you ſee that theſe few pages contain nothing but political matters, and nothing on thoſe ſubjects but ſuch ſort of ideas as are calculated to diſturb and harraſs the public mind. What is this? It is called, "Politics for the people"—to be ſcattered among the people.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I think I need not further advert either to the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, to the charge, or to that which ariſes out of the pamphlet, or out of the charge. I will make a few obſervations upon the nature of theſe proſecutions, and upon the defences ſet up. Theſe proſecutions, I ſay, muſt be inſtituted, becauſe there is no other mode in this country, or upon earth, by which publications of this ſort can be checked. If you think fit, or if you think ſociety would be benefited by theſe things having their free courſe unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, your wiſhes, if they ſhould incline that way, may, for what I know, act upon your minds ſo as to prevail upon you to believe that there can be no harm in this pamphlet: but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that is impoſſible in minds like yours.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, and truly, that whenever a libel is proſecuted,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026931_0019_0FD266762E37C980"/>
it draws it into a ſecond courſe of agitation; and that the very obſervations made upon the lible in a court of juſtice, become, as it were a promulgation of the libel itſelf. That is extremely true, and it has happened over and over again; it has happened within my own time, and happened, I am ſure, in times before, that the matter being brought forth, and the obſervations made upon it, which are indeed neceſſary, and my learned friend, who is of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the defendant to-day, I am ſure will exerciſe his ingenuity; and in doing ſo, he will do no more than his duty to his client. H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ingenuity is equal to much. I venture to think his diſplay of talents upon this occaſion will be ſuch as to excite admiration; and the more admiration it is attended with, I hope I know my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when I ſay, the more pleaſure I ſhall feel. I ſhall be extremely happy to find that my friend, in the obſervations he can poſſibly offer to you upon the preſent occaſion, ſhall deſerve your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhall deſerve your admiration.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, whatever the talents may be when they are exerted in a caſe where exertion can hardly produce any effect, and where the influence of that exertion, however you may admire the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of the advocate, cannot poſſibly go the length of convincing your judgments, or in any meaſure of altering the determination you are to make; we admire the advocate who is on the wrong ſide of the queſtion, for the eloquence and learning which he ſhews: but, thank God, in this country there is a tribunal which is to decide, after all the exertions of the advocate. You will enquire into the naked fact. The preſent caſe is indeed more complicated: but in the examination you are to make, the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be ſtripped at laſt of all the obſervations that I can make, feeble as they are, and it will be equally ſtripped of all the obſervations my learned friend will make, ſtrong as they will be, putting all thoſe out of the caſe, at the ſame time judging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining whether I have called upon you to exerciſe either your feelings or your judgments, and underſtandings, in any way but in a fair and impartial manner, you will decide this. caſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have not read the whole of the paſſage to you that is ſelected from this pamphlet, and put upon the record, becauſe it goes down at laſt to thoſe alluſions which are ſo palpable, that it is impoſſible, in the nature of things, that they can be miſtaken. The trappings of rovalty are mentioned; there is every ſort of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, and every ſort of alluſion, from whence to infer that the trapping are meant to apply to royalty, and royalty as exiſting in this country; that the King himſelf is that ſpecies of tyrant that ought to be got rid of, and that is only to be got rid of by that inſtument which is alluded to in another part of the little book,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026931_0020_0FD26677A394E300"/>
which you, I am ſure, will ſee when you come to look at it, to be the unavoidable meaning to be affixed to it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I would not wiſh to aggravate any caſe to you; but does not this appear to he ferocious and ſavage? Suppoſing it to have that alluſion which I have attributed to it, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed among the people, what are the ends that the writer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes by it? The ends of it are to render the people ferocious, to render them bloody, to render them cruel, and to diſpoſe them to carry into effect ſuch an act of cruelty at would plunge this country into a ſtate of wretchedneſs indeed. This I would ſay it the end propoſed the inevitable conſequences that muſt take place from the circulation of a book of this ſort among the people. I have ſtated that it is moſt evidently calculated for the loweſt of the people, and not to reach any higher circles; and therefore it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more miſchievous than any libel, except one, that was ever proſecuted, which was calculated for another purpoſe, and that was defended under an idea of the freedom of diſcuſſion, tho' not juſtified. Juſtification will hardly ever follow; and I am ſure when minds like yours view the ſubject fairly, and ſee that when what is ſaid it not to be palliated, is not to be excuſed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified, ſomething may be ſaid upon a queſtion, however obvious it may be, however plain a propoſition may be to my mind, ſomething may be ſaid upon it; and I may heſitate a little; but with the fair diſcuſſion of a common underſtanding, looking at all points which are the fair objects of human contemplation, the human mind will be at laſt capable of coming to a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>Without reading any more of this book to you, which you will read after you have referred to thoſe parts to which I have more immediately alluded, the concluſion ſeems to preſent itſelf to the mind in only one ſhape; and it is not in the power of quibble, of ingenuity, or wit, or any ſpecies of faculty that belongs to the human mind, to put any other interpretation upon it than that given by the record.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there will be one more ſubject of your enquiry, and of your attention: but as I am perfectly aſſur<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that obſervations relative to that will come from the learned judge who tries this indictment, with infinitely more force than they can come from me, I may ſpare you the time of attending to ſuch obſervations as theſe that is upon the nature and the character of the firſt magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate in this country. It is highly indecorous, that I am ſure you will go with me in ſaying, for any one in the leaſt degree to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of another againſt whom he can have no cauſe of complaint: but to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of the firſt magiſtrate of this country, is deemed highly indecorous and indecent, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026931_0021_0FD26679E9400F00"/>
his character therefore is for the wiſeſt purpoſes particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</p>
               <p>Then tracing this from the loweſt degree of miſdemeanor that can be committed againſt the King, tracing it from the loweſt ſtate to the higheſt, paſſing over the intermediate degrees of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, many of them that are trifling, and ſtill ſtopping ſhort of that which comes within the verge of treaſon, can there be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence more aggravated in its kind than this? It is not only treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſreſpectfully, but it is treating with a degree of ſarcaſm in the firſt inſtance, which manifeſts a ſtrong malevolence to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and in the next place, it is giving to the mind of every man, that can be impreſſed by ſuch a publication as this, not only an indifference to the character of the King, but a perfect deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch character, and ſuggeſting that the means of getting rid of ſuch a character muſt be by a ſtroke ſimilar to that which has taken place in a neighbouring unhappy country.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall therefore abſtain from all obſervations upon the royal character, as to the manner in which it is protected here, as to the utility of the office, and as to the benefit and the advantage derived from it by the inhabitants of this country, becauſe ſure I am you are equally converſant with the intercourſes of commerce, and with the vaſt and important objects that reſult from commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial inrercourſe, under the bleſſings of a free conſtitution like ours, where reſpect to government inſures that tranquility under which alone thoſe commercial benefits can ariſe, and happineſs to man take place. I ſay, therefore, with the effects of the conſtitution, you are much better acquainted than I am; my walk is in a more confined way than yours; I ſee not ſo much of the manufactures and merchandize of the country, as day after day are to be found in the city of London, and which I will be bold to ſay are only to be found in this city; and I will be bold again to ſay, that it is alone owing to the form of government that we live under: and again, that unleſs the royal perſon, the ſovereign of this country, were at the head of that conſtitution, the effects would not be what they are.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, to what other circumſtances need I advert? I am ſure my friend, who is advocate for the defendant, will never ſuppoſe, that by calling your attention to theſe words he can frit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them away. I think it may be ſuggeſted, becauſe I have heard it before ſuggeſted, that here, where the cock is mentioned, and we ſay in our indictment that it means the King; good God! the advocate may ſay (becauſe an advocate can always affect aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment), why ſhould you ſuppoſe the King is meant by this cock? I can only ſay I will leave it to the determination of 12 gentlemen, to ſay whether it be ſo or not, I am ſure if cannot be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026931_0022_0FD2667BC0AD2C08"/>
otherwiſe. And though he may pleaſe to ſay, by your legal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an inuendo, you may charge that the cock means the King; why you are the libeller yourſelf, by putting it upon the record: I can only obſerve, it is extremely ingenious; but you, Gentlemen, will be to determine between us: therefore let inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity be exerciſed, let it have its fair courſe. I am ſure my friend will be ingenious. I am ſure in his addreſs to you there will be much to admire: but it happens, indeed, to be a ſubject where there cannot be any great benefit reſulting to his client from it. When my friend has done his duty, I do confeſs, feeling this proſecution as a matter of infinite importance, I ſhall look with extreme earneſtneſs for your verdict. I preſume I ſhall not have any occaſion to trouble you again, therefore it is fit I ſhould make all the obſervations I have to offer now; it is upon that account you will pardon me for the length of time I have taken up.</p>
               <p>I have already hinted to you, that we proſecute this man as the publiſher. Now, Gentlemen, when the book is ſold at his houſe, if he be not there he is as much guilty as if he were. This is a matter very well known to be law from the earlieſt time; it is one of the caſes in law, where a maſter may be criminated by the act of his ſervant, even though he himſelf he not preſent. If his wife ſells the libel, he is criminal; and unleſs it were ſo, the law would, you ſee, be fruſtrated in thouſands of inſtances. The law is, that the owner, of the ſhop, the man having the profit of the buſineſs, ſhall be anſwerable. But here the book appears to be printed for the very man at the bar, and I dare ſay he will hardly deny it; from the manner in which he bears himſelf, I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might not abſolutely triumph in it. But, however, with reſpect to the criminality, and the law attaching upon that crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, there can be no doubt.</p>
               <p>The evidence I ſhall have to lay before you will be the moſt ſimple imaginable, that is, that the book was bought at his ſhop. What relates to the manner in which his buſineſs is generally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, on, I forbear to ſtate. You perceive that with reſpect to theſe two charges, I have not even ſtated them at full length, becauſe the book, if you pleaſe to have it, may be delivered to you, and you may there ſatisfy your own curioſity.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid before, I felt myſelf relieved that I had not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that man as the author. He may not be the author: I hope in God he is not. Although he is criminal as the publiſher, and although the publisher does infinitely more miſchief ſometimes than the author, and often has it happened that the publiſher is a ſtimulator to the author; yet I hope he has not the heart to be the author of ſome of theſe paragraphs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:026931_0023_0FD2667E64C29D30"/>Gentlemen, you have the caſe before you. I have done my duty, the attorney general has done his, and thoſe gentlemen who have been engaged in order to bring the proſecution into a ſhape before you, diſcharge their duty when they ſubmit it to you; and it would be moſt impertinent in me to ſuggeſt a poſſibility of your doing otherwiſe than your duty.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen of the Jury,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It is extremely unfortunate for the defendant, Mr. Eaton, it is perhaps not leſs unfortunate for me, that the indiſpoſition of my learned leader Mr. Vaughan, in the firſt inſtance, and his delicacy in the ſecond, occaſion the taſk of addreſſing you this day to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve upon me. It is unfortunate for the defendant, becauſe he loſes the benefit; of thoſe ſplendid talents which have been exerted once and again in his behalf, not without ſucceſs: It is unfortunate for me, becauſe it ſets thoſe ſplendid talents, to a certain degree, in contraſt with talents of a very oppoſite deſcription. But I feel myſelf conſoled, I feel myſelf animated by this conſideration, that, notwithſtanding all you have hitherto heard to the defence of this indictment, the meaneſt talents are more than equal.</p>
            <p>If this proſecution could aſſume a ſhape other than the moſt diſguſting, it would undoubtedly receive it from the very liberal, able, and eloquent manner in which it has been opened by my learned friend. But to fix an agreeable maſk upon it, is not within the compaſs even of his tranſcendent abilities.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, it is ſo common a topic of complaint in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, that I ſhould have been ſurpriſed if it had been omitted to-day, that this is peculiarly and emphatically an age of ſedition, that the preſs teems with libels calculated to vilify every thing that is great and good, libels deſigned to ſubvert the foundation of all government, to diſſolve the bonds of ſociety, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce confuſion and anarchy. If I had not received the reſpectable aſſurance I have upon this ſubject, if I had been left to form my opinion upon what I ſee on the record yon have to try. I ſhould have formed an opinion that the fact was totally different. I ſhould have ſuppoſed that libels had become ſo ſcarce a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that with all the induſtry of that numerours herd of Spies, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and Inquiſitors, with which this metropolis now abounds,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026931_0026_0FD2668527722CD0"/>none could be found—not one; and therefore, in onder to keep buſineſs alive, theſe ingenious gentlemen had ſet themſelves to work to make one. For if they had not ſo done, Mr. Eaton would not now he ſtanding at that bar.</p>
            <p>My learned friend has made a liberal uſe of that talent which he ſo eminently poſſeſſes, of working upon your paſſions and upon that of the audience, and in ſo doing he has acted judiciouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without captivating your paſſions, he can have no hope of convincing your judgment. But, Gentlemen, ſuſtaining the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred character you do at this moment ſuſtain, I call upon you to ſet a guard upon thoſe paſſions which are ſo liable to ſeduction, and which, when ſeduced, lead the judgment captive at their will. I call upon you, to apply to the conſideration of this caſe, a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equally unimpaſſioned and unprejudiced. In order that you ſhould do ſo, it becomes me now to ſtate, that the defence of my client does not impoſe upon me, as you may have imagined, the neceſſity of endeavouring to cool the fervour of your affection for the perſon of the king, or to leſſen your attachment to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the defence of Mr. Eaton had made it requiſite to avow that a man has a right to call the king an haughty and ſanguinary tyrant, I ſhould have told him he muſt have recourſe to ſome other counſel, for that in the diſcharge of my duty as an advocate, I could not forget my duty as an Engliſhman. No, Gentlemen, I conjure yon with equal earneſtneſs to that of my learned friend, I wiſh I could do it with equal eloquence, to foſter and cheriſh every ſentiment and every feeling of affection for your king, and in the very fervour of your paſſion I will call upon you, and call upon you with conſidence of ſucceſs, to condemn this indictment, and to acquit this defendant.</p>
            <p>But this proſecution would have been incomplete, it would have been an anomaly in the proſecutions of the preſent day, if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of France had not been introduced. And why are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced? Becauſe it is ſuppoſed that you will ſo far forget your duty and your oaths, as to apply any opinion which you may have formed upon them to the injury of the defendant in this cauſe. If conſidered rightly, I think the reſult will not be unfavourable to the defendanr. Whatever diſorders may have tarniſhed the French Revolution, they afford an argument to Engliſhmen to prize and maintain every liberty they poſſeſs, and above all the liberty of the preſs.</p>
            <p>If the French, after having been kept in darkneſs for ages, were, when the light firſt beamed upon their aſtoniſhed fight, dazzled with its luſtre, and therefore miſtook one object for another, it is not they whom we ought ſo ſeverely to cenſure, as the deteſted monſters who had ſo long veiled their eyes. If after having been
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026931_0027_0FD26686DB3CB7A0"/>for ages inſtructed in leſſons of barbarity, from the open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authoriſed exerciſe of which they were reſtrained, is it ſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary that when that reſtraint was removed, ſome of them ſhould practiſe the leſſons their former maſters had taught them? It in their progreſs from ſlavery to freedom they have had to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a narrow and a ſlippery path, aſſailed by idea without and by traitors within, is it to be wondered at that many of them ſhould ſtumble and ſhould fall?</p>
            <p>But is liberty to be deſcried, becauſe at any time, or upon any occaſion, licentiouſneſs has aſſumed its name? No: it ought rather to ſtimulate every people who poſſeſs it, to preſerve it in its priſtine purity; above all, it ought to ſtimulate them to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that part, without which they would ſink into a ſtate of ſtupid ignorance, and conſequently of abject ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, in the fulfilment of the ſolemn and ſacred duties of jurymen, there are few caſe which have a ſtronger claim upon your attention than proſecution for political libel. A proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a political libel is a charge not of the of a common wrong, but of the abuſe of a common right. I do not mean to ſay, that the abuſe of a common right may not amount to the commiſſion of a commonordinary commiſſion wrong, but that it is a charge of a different deſcription, requiring ſtonger evidence to ſupport it, and to be decided by the application of different prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The ordinary commiſſion of a common wrong, is the doing an act which the law has expreſly forbidden, and for which therefore, when the party does it, he knows he is amenable to the law. The abuſe of a common and acknowledged right, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a mind deeply impreſſed with the importance of the right, and eagerly employed in its exerciſe, not being ſufficiently acquainted with its bounds and limits. If there is any common right, into the abuſe of which we ſhould not enquire with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary rigour, it is that right, the exerciſe of which is called in queſtion this day, not only on account of its infinite moment to the public, but becauſe its limits have never yet been aſcertained with preciſion. So far indeed are they from having heen aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with preciſion, that no two men, no two lawyers, are agreed upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, I have not in this caſe to implore mercy or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for exceſs. I have only to clain your juſtice. For of all the proſecutions for libels that ever came into a court of juſtice I will venture to ſay this is the moſt extraordinary, I will add it is the moſt alarming. For I have no heſitation to aſſert, that if it were to ſucceed, the freedom of the preſs could not ſurvive a ſingle hour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:026931_0028_0FD266882795C230"/>Having ſtated this propoſition broadly and boldly, I come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the proof of it.</p>
            <p>The charge contained in this indictment is, that the defendant, <q>being a malicious, ſeditious, and evil-diſpoſed perſon, and greatly diſaffected to our lord the king, and to his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the government of this kingdom, and unlawfully, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and ſeditiouſly contriving, deviſing, and Intending to ſcandalize, traduce, and vilify our ſaid lord the king, and the regal power and office eſtabliſhed by law within this realm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to repreſent our ſaid lord the king as ſanguinary, tyrannical, oppreſſive, cruel, and deſpotic, and thereby to ſtir up and excite diſcontents and ſeditions amongſt the ſubjects of our ſaid lord the king, and to alienate and withdraw the fidelity, affection, and allegiance of his ſaid majeſty's ſubjects from hit ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's perſon and government, unlawfully, maliciouſly, and ſeditiouſly, did publiſh a certain printed pamphlet, entitled, PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITICS FOR THE PEOPLE, or HOG'S WASH, containing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſcandalous, malicious, inflammatory, and ſeditious matters of and concerning our ſaid lord the king.</q>
            </p>
            <p>My learned friend has animadverted with ſome ſeverity upon the title of this pamphlet, "Politics for the People, or Hog's Waſh." The latter part is a play upon a phraſe which has been uſed to deſcribe the People, not as my learned friend has ſuppoſed, an incautious expreſſion in the heat of parliamentary debate, but an expreſſion deliberately and ſolemnly recorded in a book which has run through ten or twelve editions, and which retains its place in that book to the preſent hour. Now if the people are the "Swiniſh Multitude," I do not think Mr. Eaton is deſerving of puniſhment for ſupplying them with food adapted to their nature. "Politics for the People." Whom are politics for, but for the people? Are politics for placemen and penſioners only? Are they only bleſſed with underſtandings fitted to the inveſtigation of this ſublime and myſterious ſcience? Or is it not, or at leaſt ought it not to be, a ſubject within the comprehenſion of every man? But the price is two-pence, <hi>binc illae lachrymae.</hi> If it be a crime to ſell a political pamhlet cheap, Mr. Eaton muſt plead guilty to that charge; but ſo far from confeſſing it as a crime, I ſtate it as a merit, I challenge for him applauſe. Political pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, I think, ſhould be cheap. I am very ſure that public or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and tranquility will never be maintained ſo well as when every man reads and underſtands political pamphlets; becauſe there is no obedience to law ſo exemplary, there is no attachment to a good coſtitution ſo ſtrong, as that which reſults from a knowledge of the reaſon and obligation of law, and the true; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as well as beneficial effects of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:026931_0029_0FD2668A0E4B06F0"/>Gentlemen, you perceive that in the paper which this man has publiſhed is not a ſingle ſyllable "of and concerning our ſovereign lord the king;" but that every thing which is ſaid of this famous game cock is charged by the indictment to have been meant of him, and is in words applied to him in a number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſes that you will find in the indictment, which parentheſes we call <hi>inuendos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inuendos have in former times gone ſuch lengths as to draw down ſome degree of ridicule upon them, but never before I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve have they gone the length of the inuendos in this indictment. The ſole purpoſe of an inuendo, is to ſix the true meaning. An inuendo is not to be an arbitrary thing at the pleaſure of the drawer of an indictment: it muſt be warranted by the context; it muſt be conformable to the ſenſe of the paper: the ſenſe of the paper muſt not be forced or ſtrained; it muſt be the natural, the plain, the obvious, the neceſſary ſenſe.</p>
            <p>This art of drawing indictments, and contriving inuendos, and ſo manufacturing libels, is indeed a curious art. I do not know, and I really am at a loſs to conjecture, who could have been the drawer of this indictment. From its internal evidence, I am led to ſuppoſe it muſt have been the author of the Arabian Nights Entertainment, or ſome perſon equally converſant in the wild and extravagant fictions of the eaſt. He muſt have given unbridled and unbounded licence to an imagination the moſt wanton and the moſt heated, before he could have ſat down to aſcribe mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to this paper ſo foreign and indeed ſo ridiculous. All of the inuendos, in my opinion, are far from innocent, but one of them contains the moſt ſeditious aſſertion I have ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>The drawer of this indictment might muſt as well have employed himſelf, like Dean Swift's projector, in attempting to extract ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams from cucumbers, as in attempting to extract ſedition from this ſtory of the game cock.</p>
            <p>This ſtory of the game cock appears to have been related at a debating ſociety, in anſwer to a ſtory that had been told of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro ſlave enduring the tortures of a frying-pan. The ſtory was aptly introduced to anſwer the purpoſe of the moment, in reply to a preceding ſpeaker. But as the ſtory of the negro ſtave did naturally introduce the ſtory of the game cock, the alluſion to it is not included in this indictment, becauſe it was the buſineſs of this indictment to conceal from you the real intention with which the ſtory was introduced, in order to impoſe upon you a belief that it was then told, and afterwards publiſhed, with the criminal intentions imputed. With this view the ſtory of the game cock is not only introduced into the indictment abruptly, but it cloſes abruptly too; for it ſtops ſhort at that part which applies it to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026931_0030_0FD2668CA47826B0"/>preceding ſtory of the ſlave. Theſe obſervations will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more forcibly upon your minds, if when you retire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate on your verdict, you take with you the pamphlet itſelf, and compare it with a copy of the indictment.</p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, I do not mean to contend that the author of this ſtory intended merely to allude to the immediate ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the tyranny exerciſed on a negro ſlave. No—the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of my client calls not on me to attempt to circumſcribe, far leſs to explain away any meaning which theſe words, taken in their utmoſt latitude, can imply. I will concede that the mind of the ſpeaker, in adverting to one ſpecies of tyranny, was naturally, and I maintain laudably led to contemplate tyranny in general, &amp; that this ſtory which he relates was calculated to expoſe the evil conſequences of tyranny, and to point out the juſt puniſhment of tyrants. And ſurely Engliſhmen muſt have undergone a ſtrange transformation, if they can endure to hear the right of doing this called in queſtion. Why do we look back to our anceſtors with ſuch enthuſiaſm and veneration? but becauſe in oppoſing tyranny and tyrants they fought, they bled, they conquered. It was their ardent love of liberty, it was their undaunted courage, it was their unſhaken fortitude, it was their profound wiſdom, that combined to rear that grand political fabric, the conſtitution of our country, which we have been accuſtomed to view with equal reverence and delight, upon the poſſeſſion of which we have prided ourſelves, but which I am ſure we ſhall not tranſmit to our poſterity, if we ſuffer the liberty of the preſs, which is its corner-ſtone, to be rudely torn away; and torn away it will be, if ſuch proſecutions as theſe can ſucceed.</p>
            <p>What language do our anceſtors hold out to us by Magna Charta, by the Habeas Corpus Act, by the Bill of Rights, and above all by the Revolution, but this, "We have found monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, unlimited and unfettered, incompatible with rational freedom and ſocial order; we have therefore preſcribed limits to it, that you our poſterity may be free and happy." It is not neceſſary for me to go ſo far back as the Revolution for this language; it has been held in a feebler tone perhaps, certainly with leſs effect within the memory of moſt of us. In the year 1782 the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons voted "that the influence of the Crown had increaſed, was increaſing and ought to be diminiſhed." Whether they followed up that vote with ſuch reſtrictions as were requiſite to curtail and check that increaſing influence, is not now a ſubject of enquiry. But it affords all I want for my argument, that every complaint of unlimited power, or of limited power tranſgreſſing the limits aſſigned to it, every detection of the fact, and every expoſure of the conſequence, is conſiſtent with the ſpirit of the conſtitution, is
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026931_0031_0FD26690E827CCE8"/>warranted by precedents the moſt approved, and is allowed by law. It is not merely allowed, it is commanded by a law that is paramount to all human law, the law written by the finger of God on the heart of man.</p>
            <p>But why is it to be ſuppoſed that this game cock, who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as an haughty and ſanguinary tyrant, nurſed from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy in blood and ſlaughter, muſt neceſſarily mean the preſent mild and merciful king of Great Britain? If we ſurvey the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe continent of Aſia, nay if we confine our view to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of Europe, ſhall we find no tyrants whom this game cock may be intended to denote? None "fond of foreign wars," if not of "domeſtic rebellions?" None who devour "the greater part of the grain ſcattered" by Providence "for the morning and evening repaſt" of their fellow-creatures? None who are always "picking and cuffing" at thoſe about them, who have not ſtrength to defend themſelves? Shall we find none who have ſported with obligations the moſt ſolemn, who have trampled on rights the moſt ſacred, who in the purſuit of their fell and foul conſpiracies againſt the peace and happineſs of the human race, have diſregarded every principle of juſtice, have outraged every feeling of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, have defied every mandate of their God?</p>
            <p>But this ſpeaker ſays, he thinks the beſt thing one could do for men and women is to rid the world of tyrants. It that ſo crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Then I am criminal; for I think ſo too. Tyrants, in any form, I believe, are much too bad to be mended, and I think the beſt way of diſpoſing of them is to ſend them out of a world to which they are a curſe, and which they can benefit only by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. If this leſſon were learned and were practiſed by every people groaning under tyranny, ſoon would freedom, which is now confined to a narrow ſpot, diffuſe her bleſſings through the world.</p>
            <p>The firſt political truth that is engraven on the ſoul of man, is, that all power flows from the people, and is a truſt for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and that when that truſt is abuſed, reſiſtance is not only a right but a duty. The Revolution of 1688 was a practical eſſay upon that principle. Then was that right exerciſed, then was that duty fulfilled. The truſt repoſed in a king was abuſed, the king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a tyrant, the people expelled him; and if he had ever dared to return, he would have expiated, and juſtly expiated, his crimes upon the ſcaffold.</p>
            <p>But why, I aſk again, is it to be ſuppoſed that the king of Great Britain is meant by this tyrant of the farm-yard? Is there any thing in the animal ſelected for this ſtory being a cock? That will not ſerve the purpoſe of the proſecution. For never was the king of Great Britain repreſented by the emblem of a cock. The
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026931_0032_0FD26694363142B0"/>king of Great Britain has always been denoted by a lion, and the king of France by a cock: the reaſon of which, I ſuppoſe, was, that <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> as you well know, is latin for a cock. None of us, I am ſure, can have forgot that which we were taught in our youth, that the crowing of the Gallic cock ſhould be ſilenced by the tremendous roaring of the Britiſh lion.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, we have juſt paſſed the anniverſary of an event to which my learned friend has adverted, I mean the execution of the laſt monarch of France. The application of this ſtory to that tragical event, cannot fail to ſtrike every mind that pauſes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for reflection; and if the author had a view to any perſon in particular, unqueſtionably it muſt have been to him: and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you or I may think of that monarch or his fate, we cannot deny to any man the right of thinking or ſpeaking of him and of his fate as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>But if when any man publiſhes a paper on tyranny in general, or Louis the ſixteenth in particular, he is to be charged by an inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo of this ſort with meaning king George the third, what will become of the ſecurity and peaceful exerciſe of the freedom of the, preſs? If when any man becomes obnoxious to the miniſtry every thing he ſays or publiſhes is to be thus ſtrained and perverted for the purpoſe of miniſterial vengeance, who can be ſale? It is not bookſellers only who are liable to proſecution for publiſhing, any of you who may happen to give a book to one of your children may be proſecuted, and your children may be dragged into this court to lay you in gaol by their evidence; and this, perhaps, for giving them a book which no diſintereſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no impartial man would conjecture to have any tendency to ſedition, or even any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to politics.</p>
            <p>Upon the principle of this proſecution, if it has any principle, a book which, I dare ſay, once afforded us much pleaſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I mean Aeſop's Fables, is the moſt ſeditious book that ever was publiſhed. Woe to Mr. Eaton, if he has ever ſold that book; woe to any man that has ſold it, if he has given offence to the miniſters, or to any of thoſe ſpies and informers who now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt this country as locuſts or the plague do ſome other. There is ſcarcely a fable that will not furniſh an indictment. One of them occurs to me at this moment: it is the fable of the Ape who was made king. To puniſh him for his preſumption in aſpiring to that character, the fox led him into a trap; and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the ape for diſloyalty, he went off with a ſneer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "You a king, and not underſtand trap?" Put this fable into an indictment, and call it "a ſcandalous, malicious, inflammatory and ſeditious libel, of and concerning our ſovereign lord the king;" ſtate in the inuendoes that the ape is intended to denote our ſaid
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026931_0033_0FD26695A9812328"/>lord the king; and that not underſtanding trap, means ignorance of the regal functions; and garniſh all this with "againſt the peace of our ſaid lord the king, his crown and dignity;" and then you have patched up a moſt notable libel. With this receipt for drawing indictments, I could go through the book, and draw five hundred.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, in this way a man may be proſecuted for publiſhing the ſacred ſcriptures themſelves. For wherever mention is made of a wicked king, and mention is made of many wicked kings, an indictment may be drawn, charging it to be a libel upon the king of Great Britain, and by inuendos applying the expreſſions to him. But I aſk again, what man can be ſafe, if meanings like theſe are to be affixed to every thing he publishes, or every thing he ſays?</p>
            <p>Let us look at the language of the ſtory, and ſee the meanings which are affixed by the indictment.—<q>You muſt know then that I uſed, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds poultry; and, among other things of this kind, I had a very fine majeſtic kind of animal, a game cock (<hi>meaning thereby,</hi> ſays the indictment, <hi>to denote and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſaid lord the king</hi>) an haughty ſanguinary tyrant, nurſed in blood and ſlaughter from his infancy, fond of foreign wars and domeſtic rebellions, into which he would ſometimes drive his ſubjects by his oppreſſive obſtinacy, in hopes that he might increaſe his power and glory by their ſuppreſſion. Now this haughty old tyrant—(<hi>again,</hi> ſays the indictment, <hi>meaning our ſaid lord the king.</hi>)</q> Never, I believe, ſince proſecutions for libels had exiſtence, has ſuch an indictment, containing ſuch inuendos as theſe, made its appearance in an Engliſh court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The only ground on which theſe inuendos can be attempted to be ſupported, is a ground which the proſecution will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtate, a ground which they cannot ſtate; namely, that there is ſo palpable a reſemblance of character and conduct in this game cock so our ſovereign lord the king, that that man muſt be blind who does not ſee the real object, and the true appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>If the inuendos had ſtopped here, I ſhould have thought this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment by no means an innocent production. But what muſt I think, what muſt you think, when you find an inuendo in terms the moſt unequivocal, charging the king with being a tyrant. <q>Yet I had even at that time ſome lurking principles of averſion to bare-faced deſpotiſm ſtruggling at my heart, which would ſometimes whiſper to me that the beſt thing one could do either for cocks and hens, or men and women, was to rid the world of tyrants—<hi>meaning,</hi> the indictment ſays, <hi>our ſaid lord the king,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:026931_0034_0FD266974AF70990"/>
                  <hi>among others.</hi>
               </q>—Which is the libel now? Not that paper pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. Eaton: for if all that is charged could be ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, its guilt would ſink into nothing in compariſon with the guilt of this indictment, which contains a libel upon record, in a court of juſtice, that will be handed down to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I now come to the cloſe of this indictment, and it is a cloſe worthy of it. A little detached ſentence of three lines is logged in to bolſter up this miſerable proſecution. <q>Kings are wolf ſhepherds. Homer ſtyles them devourers of the people, and they do not appear to have loſt their original taſte.</q> To the four firſt words of this, "Kings are Wolf Shepherds," the indictment has applied an inuendo, <hi>"meaning, among othters, our ſovereign lord the king."</hi> Never was a propoſition ſtated more evidently falſe than that a general remark muſt have an univerſal application. If I ſpeak of kings in general, am I to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to ſpeak of <hi>all</hi> kings? Certainly not. My omitting to ſay <hi>al kings,</hi> demonſtrates that I mean to exclude <hi>ſome;</hi> if to exclude any, clearly to exclude thoſe to whom the remark is no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable.</p>
            <p>The Empreſs of Ruſſia is the ſhepherdeſs of a vaſt flock; but as it was not ſufficiently numerous for the exerciſe of her boundleſs philanthropy, ſhe has lately, by a little gentle compulſion, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it by a conſiderable number of the Poliſh breed. She, and our worthy ally the king of Pruſſia, have gone hand in hand in this bleſſed work of increaſing their flocks. Poſſibly neither you nor I ſhould chuſe to call theſe two monarchs "Wolf Shepherds;" but I fancy we ſhould none of us be diſpoſed to puniſh very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely the man who did.</p>
            <p>All mankind have found by fatal experience that kings are wolf ſhepherds, if they are ſuffered to poſſeſs unlimited power; and therefore our anceſtors employed themſelves very wiſely in faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limitations on their power. But it is of kings whoſe power is not limited that this ſentence ſpeaks. For it is illuſtrated by an expreſſion of Homer's, "devourers of the people," which applies to kings whoſe powers are not limited as the powers of the king of Great Britain are. The king of Great Britain ſuſtains a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter totally different from that of any other king, and therefore general obſervations upon kings never have been, and never can be underſtood to apply to him. On the contrary, they neceſſarily exclude him. It is not long ſince ſuch an application would have been conſidered as libellous, and I rely with confidence on the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and loyalty of Britons for repelling an application ſo unfounded and a compariſon ſo degrading—degrading not only to the king, but to the people. For if it were admitted that cur king reſembled kings in general, it would be admitted that he was a deſpot, from
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026931_0035_0FD26698D37BBB60"/>which it would follow, as a neceſſary conſequence, that the people were ſlaves.</p>
            <p>I have beſtowed ſome pains in ſearching for an indictment like the preſent, and I can find none even in that ſink of iniquity, the collection of indictments in the reign of Charles the ſecond. I believe neither the records of the Star chamber, nor the annals of Jefferies, will furniſh an indictment in which a general reflection upon the nature and tendency of tyranny, or the deſert of tyrants, has been deemed a libel upon the king of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, In every caſe where a charge is made, that an act has been done which the law forbids, after it has been aſcertained that the act has been done, and done by the party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, the next queſtion is, with what intention he did the act. It is the intention which clothes the act with innocence or guilt. If you try a man for murder, you do not content yourſelves with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining the fact of the deceaſed having been killed, and killed by the priſoner you are trying; but you examine into the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the caſe, to know the intention with which he killed him. If you find his intention was malicious, you pronounce him guilty of murder; if he was provoked by a certain degree of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you pronounce him guilty of manſlaughter; but if you find he did it accidentally, or in ſelf-defence, you pronounce him not guilty. If this be ſo in a matter of ſuch deep importance to he public as the loſs of a citizen, and where prima facie ſo black a crime as murder has been perpetrated, how much more in the caſe of a miſdemeanor, a miſbehaviour, which is an offence of the moſt trivial nature that the law takes cognizance of? If this be ſo in a matter where at firſt view the motives are the moſt diabolical that can predominate in the human breaſt, how much more in a caſe where the intention is on the firſt bluſh indifferent, and where it is always with heſitation and doubt that a jury will pronounce it to be criminal? In a caſe where though one may conſider it to be criminal, another will think it innocent, and a third will believe it to be meritorious, according to the different political principles they have embraced, according to the extent and range which in their reſpective opinions ought to be allowed to political diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, when you are travelling in this dark and intricate road, you will proceed with the utmoſt poſſible circumſpection, left you ſhould be entangled in an inextricable labyrinth. When you are called upon to penetrate into the inmoſt receſſes of a man's ſoul, and decide on what paſſes there, with what awe will you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs yourſelves to the taſk?</p>
            <p>Recollect what is required of you by the proſecutors. You are required to determine upon the inſpection of this paper, that the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026931_0036_0FD2669AE505B110"/>defendant <q>maliciouſly and ſeditiouſly contriving, deviſing, and intending to ſcandalize, traduce, and vilify our lord the king. and the regal power and office eſtabliſhed by law within this realm, and to repreſent our ſaid lord the king as ſanguinary. tyrannical, oppreſſive, cruel, and deſpotic; and thereby to ſtir up and excite diſcontents and ſeditions amongſt the ſubjects of our ſaid lord the king, and to alienate and withdraw the fidelity affection and allegiance of his ſaid majeſty's ſubjects from his ſaid majeſty's perſon and government, unlawfully, maliciouſly, and ſeditiouſly</q> did publiſh this pamphlet. Can you, as honeſt and conſcientious men, can you, as men who have duties to fulfil, as men who have rights to guard, bring your minds to propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo monſtrous and ſo extravagant?</p>
            <p>But if this conſtruction were not ſo evidently ridiculous and abſurd, if it were only doubtful, and doubtful in the mind of any one of you, then you are bound to acquit the defendant. By that admirable inſtitution, Trial by Jury, no man can be found guilty but by the unanimous, the decided, and undoubting opinion of twelve of his equals. Where there exiſts a particle of doubt, it is your duty, as you have been frequently told from the bench, to lean to the ſide of mercy.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, ſome caſes have lately occurred which make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me to ſay a word or two reſpecting the verdicts of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in caſes of libel.</p>
            <p>Whenever the exerciſe of a right has ſuffered interruption, its revival is attended with ſome inconveniences and ſome errors. That has been the caſe with reſpect to the functions of juries in caſes of libel. The ancient law of libel did not differ from other criminal law, but when the invention of printing had introduced political diſcuſſion, and when ſeditious publications (that is to ſay, publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions expoſing the corruptions and abuſes of government, and the profligacy of miniſters) made their appearance, the controul of the preſs was placed in admirable hands, a licenſer, the king's attorney general, and a court of inquiſition called the Star Chamber. The licenſer was to ſtifle in its birth every thing obnoxious to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. But if any thing happened to eſcape his hands, then the attorney-general, by his information <hi>ex officio,</hi> carried the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate author or publiſher before the board of inquiſitors, who never failed to adminiſter a ſentence adapted by its ſeverity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others from ſimilar efforts to enlighten the people.</p>
            <p>It was in that infernal inquiſition that the purity of the law of libel was debauched. It was there that that monſtrous maxim was firſtbroached, that <hi>Truth</hi> could be a falſe, ſcandalous, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and ſeditious libel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:026931_0037_0FD2669AE70AEF20"/>Thank God, iniquity always defeats itſelf. The intolerable oppreſſion of this inquiſition brought on its violent, I cannot ſay untimely death. But unfortunately ſome of its practices ſurvived it. The attorney-general was allowed ſtill to carry his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>ex officio</hi> into the court of King's Bench, and the doctrines of the Star Chamber were after a very long interval revived, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in exiſtence till within theſe two years, when they were, I truſt, completely deſtroyed by that act of parliament, for which we are indebted to the bright ornament of the Engliſh bar, and the model of its eloquence—an act which has aſſured and confirmed to every Engliſhman the right of being tried by a jury of his equals, when accuſed of having written or publiſhed a libel.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, That act of parliament enacts, that a jury may give a verdict "upon the whole matter put in iſſue by the indictment," Of what does that "whole matter" conſiſt? It propoſes four queſtions to the conſideration of the jury.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion you are aſked is, Did the defendant publiſh the pamphlet that has been produced in evidence? If he did not, you muſt acquit him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is the ſenſe aſcribed to the paſſage inſerted in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment by the inuendos, the true, the genuine, the neceſſary ſenſe? If it is not, you muſt acquit him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is the pamphlet, even if that ſenſe be the proper one, a "ſcandalous, malicious, inflammatory, and ſeditious" libel? If it is not, you muſt acquit him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Did the defendant publiſh the pamphlet with the criminal motives and intentions imputed by this indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If he did not, even then you muſt acquit him.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, In ſaying this, I am ſure I ſhall not he contradicted by the bench, that a verdict of <hi>guilty</hi> muſt be compounded of an anſwer to each of thoſe four queſtions in the affirmative, and that if you diſbelieve any one of the imputations, nay if you doubt any one, you are bound to acquit the defendant.</p>
            <p>It is the practice that had obtained before the paſſing of the libel bill, that has introduced any confuſion into this plain and ſimple matter. Juries were directed by the judges to find the defendant guilty, if the fact of publication was proved, and they believed the meaning aſſigned by the inuendos was correct, and thence juries have erroneouſly thought that if the fact of publication was proved they were bound to find the defendant <hi>guilty of publiſhing.</hi> Gentlemen, there is no guilt in publiſhing. Merely publishing a paper is in itſelf innocent. It is only the bad quality of the paper publiſhed, and the evil intention with which it is publiſhed, that can make a publication criminal. Therefore it is the duty of a
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026931_0038_0FD2669F1A4B0888"/>jury, unleſs they are clearly convinced, not only of the fact of publication, but of the truth of the inuendos, and of the paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a libel, and of the intention of the defendant being criminal, to pronounce him <hi>not guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen, theſe proſecutions are totally unlike all other proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that come before you. All thoſe indictments that you have hitherto tried, were preferred for purpoſes of public juſtice, to vindicate offended law, and puniſh the violation of public order and private property. Theſe proſecutions are always brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to anſwer the temporary and intereſted purpoſe of the party in poſſeſſion of power; and if it ſhould ſo happen that that party before it had attained its power had propagated principles to which their preſent practices are hoſtile, the publication of thoſe principles is then deemed ſeditious, and the publiſhers are proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. The proſecutions of the preſent day are indeed part of the ways and means of carrying on this diſaſtrous war. They were not opened by the miniſter with his budget, becauſe they are means which he has not yet the courage to avow.</p>
            <p>I underſtand that the reaſon why Mr. Eaton is ſingled out and proſecuted with ſuch unexampled ſeverity, is, that he has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſin which is not to be forgiven. Convinced by Mr. Pitt's ſpeeches and the Duke of Richmond's letters that the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſalvation of this country depends on a parliamentary reform, he has frankly declared that conviction. That has been caught up by one of theſe ſedition hunters, who are hired to prowl about the ſtreets, who dropped the information into the lion's mouth at the Crown and Anchor.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, we look back to the proſecutions for ſedition in the reigns of the Stuarts with deteſtation and horror. Are we abſolutely certain that our poſterity will look back upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the preſent day with very favourable ſentiments? There was then the ſame cry of ſedition, there was then the ſame pretence of conſpiracies and plots, when all the time the ſedition was the ſedition of the miniſters againſt the people, and the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and plots were theirs, to ſubvert the conſtitutional liberty of the country.</p>
            <p>Has this prodigious dread of ſedition ſlept from the time of Charles the ſecond until now, and is it to awake preciſely at the preſent moment? Were libels ſo abundant then? Have they been ſo ſcarce from that time to this? and do they now ſuddenly abound again? No ſuch thing. Publications reprobating ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and tyrants, and arraigning the conduct of miniſters, have never failed to iſſue from the preſs. But it is not all miniſters who have been troubled with the ſame irritability of temper, or been
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026931_0039_0FD266A16E2E1138"/>haunted with the ſame dread of a free diſcuſſion of their merits and demerits.</p>
            <p>It is a bad omen when miniſters wiſh to ſtop the current of free enquiry. It is a ſure ſign that their conduct is ſuch as will not ſtand the teſt of that enquiry. There have been miniſters of this country who have thought a free preſs their beſt ſafeguard, who have ſeared no libels, becauſe their conduct challenged inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would paſs the fiery ordeal with honour. If this is no longer the caſe, if the miniſters of the preſent day dread the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a rigid examination and compariſon of their profeſſions and their actions, if they wiſh to ſhut out the ſun becauſe they cannot bear the light, let them be open and honeſt, let them avow their meaning, let them ſpeak out; let them not, becauſe the great pillar that ſupports the Britiſh conſtitution is hateful to them, ſeek, upon falſe pretences, to level the glorious fabric with the duſt.</p>
            <p>But I am ſure the lofty and intrepid ſpirit of Britons is not to be ſubdued by any ſuch means. I am ſure the means are very ill adapted to the end. Never yet was the frequency of political pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications leſſened by proſecution, but on the contrary they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been increaſed ten-fold.</p>
            <p>If the miniſters wiſh to extract the ſting from theſe publications, they ſhould adopt a ſyſtem exactly the reverſe of that which has provoked them. Let them not cheriſh every canker that has crept into the conſtitution, which mars its beauty, and is eating out its vitals. Let them not cling to every corruption and every abuſe, as if corruption and abuſe were the end and perfection of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let them not purſue thoſe meaſures which induce the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of increaſing that heavy load of taxes which extorts from the poor the ſcanty ſubſiſtence that their labour can procure. Above all, let them not purſue thoſe meaſures which deprive the induſtrious poor of thoſe very means of ſubſiſtence, and throw them upon the benevolence of a generous public for their very bread. If they will avoid ſplitting upon theſe rocks, they will diſarm political publications of every thing offenſive, and we ſhall then hear no more of the prevalence of libels.</p>
            <p>But allow me to enquire why proſecutions are all on one ſide, why it is that thoſe pamphlets only are proſecuted as libels which reflect or are ſuppoſed to reflect upon the regal or ariſtocratical branches of the conſtitution? Does it not hence appear that to proſecute libels upon the <hi>conſtitution</hi> is no part of the ſyſtem of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration? For if a man will but exalt the regal and ariſtocratical parts of the conſtitution at the expence of the democratical part, he may libel the conſtitution with impunity. The democratical
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026931_0040_0FD266A271C88990"/>part of the conſtitution is not a favourite ſufficient, at preſent, with thoſe who have the management of affairs, to induce them to ſtand forward as it avengers.</p>
            <p>The "MAJESTY OF THE PUBLIC"-(Gentlemen, I am not uſing an expreſſon coined by the republicans and levellers of the day, if any ſuch there be; I am uſing the expreſſion of that great lawyer Mr. Juſtice Blackſtone, whoſe authority is conſtantly appealed to on theſe occaſions by the counſel for the crown)— "The Majeſty of the Public" may be libelled. "The Majeſty of the Public" has no attorney—general to file informations ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio againſt the libeller. The ſacred rights of the people may be inſulted, degraded, and vilified, and no proſecution is thought of. Yet let but a ſarcaſm be thought to fall on the power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of kings or nobles, and miniſterial vengeance is inſtantly hurled at the head of the unfortunate offender.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, are ſuch proſecutions as theſe for calling tyranny by its name, intended to ſpread that torpor over the mind which is requiſite to its introduction? Are they deſigned "to ſtop the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all the paſſioas but fear?" Let us then reſolve rather to ceaſe to live than live in chains.</p>
            <p>View in ancient hiſtory the glorious effects of freedom. See the heroic actions it inſpired. See the conſequences in the perfection of every art and ſcience that could confer dignity on man, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his comfort. Obſerve the dreadful contraſt that is now exhibited by thoſe countries which have loſt it. Where you ſaw blooming fields ſlately edifices, commercial cities, you now ſee a deſart. Where you ſaw a people, adorned by every manly and ſocial excellence, whoſe examples we to this day hold up to our youth as objects of admiration and imitation, you now ſee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate race of beings, poſſeſſing the form indeed, bat devoid of the principles and feelings of men.</p>
            <p>To what is it was owe the unexampled elevation which we have attained, but that tranſcendent freedom which has made us the envy and admiration of the world?</p>
            <p>What is it that enables North America to proceed with ſuch gigantic ſtrides to a ſtate of proſperity at which Europe will ſoon gaze with wonder and aſtoniſhment, but the invincible energies of freedom? What is it that renders South America ſuch a dreadful reverſe of that happy ſtate, but the ignorance and conſequent ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in which the people are held by their unfeeling tyrants?</p>
            <p>To attack the freedom of the preſs, and I conceive it is attacked moſt violently by this proſecution, is to aim a fatal ſtroke at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty itſelf.</p>
            <p>And is it now at the cloſe of the eighteenth century, in an age
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026931_0041_0FD266A3EAD4C090"/>which boaſts of being the moſt enlightened the world ever ſaw, that liberty is to be proſcribed in its moſt favoured reſidence? No, Gentlemen, ſo long as we preſerve thoſe bulwarks of our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>liberty of the preſs,</hi> and <hi>trial by jury,</hi> and juries preſerve their independence, I am ſure all the efforts of tyranny to obtain a footing in this iſland will prove abortive.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, this is not vain and empty declamation. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of every right we poſſeſs depends in the firſt inſtance upon the freedom of the preſs. While we poſſeſs that unimpaired, we can never be enſlaved. If we loſe it we cannot be free. While the preſs, which has been beautifully and emphatically ſtyled <q>the eye of the political body,</q> continues to inſpect and watch with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the adminiſtration of public affairs, ſome hope remains that thoſe affairs may be adminiſtered with ſome attention to the public intereſt. But if it is deſtroyed, or conſtantly harraſſed in the performance of its neceſſary functions, we may abandon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to deſpondency and deſpair.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, if you find the defendant guilty, conſider what you determine, under the awful ſanction of an atteſtation of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being. You ſwear to the truth of every word and ſyllable in this indictment. You ſwear that by this game cock, this haughty and ſanguinary tyrant, nurſed from his infancy in blood and ſlaughter, is meant the king of Great-Britain, and no other. You ſwear too that that king is a tyrant, for ſo the indictment charges him to be. You ſwear that an obſervation on kings in general muſt neceſſarily include him. Beſides that, you not only ſwear that you ſo underſtand all this, but that ſo did the defendant mean.</p>
            <p>Can you lay your hands upon your hearts, and ſwear all this? Can you lie down upon your pillows without feeling thorns in the reflection, that that man who has already been impriſoned near three months upon this indictment, is to be impriſoned two or three years longer, and his wife and children reduced to beggary and want, becauſe you have fancied that a ſenſe prima facie ſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, may poſſibly belong to this paper?</p>
            <p>Why is it that that inſtitution, Trial by Jury, has challenged ſuch univerſal admiration? Becauſe men are called upon to try others by the ſame law by which they may themſelves be tried, and therefore it is concluded that no man would be ſo mad or ſo wicked as to wreſt the law either for acquittal or conviction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the former caſe he would ſuffer as a member of that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſociety which cannot exiſt if its laws are not inforced; in the latter Caſe he would be expoſed to the hazard of ſuffering as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, and becoming the victim of his own guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:026931_0042_0FD266A5D8754E88"/>Where that man ſtands to-day, you yourſelves may ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. For there is not a word you utter which may not be tortured into ſedition, with as much reaſon as the paper now under your conſideration.</p>
            <p>In pronouncing your verdict upon this caſe, you will recollect that ever-applicable precept of the great Author of our religion— "Do unto others as you would wiſh them to do unto you." Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the judgment ſeat, you will mete out to the defendant the ſame meaſure of juſtice which you would think he ought to mete out to you, were you in his ſituation and he in yours. If you were ſtanding at that bar, accuſed of having uttered general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, prompted by the generous feelings of your hearts, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of tyranny and tyrants, to which the deſpotic ingenuity of a Special Pleader had affixed a ſeditious meaning by ſuch inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endos as appear upon this indictment, would you not claim as a firſt principle of juſtice that your words ſhould be taken in the moſt favourable ſenſe, and not be perverted from their primary meaning, for the purpoſe of incarcerating you in that ſtrong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? I am ſure you would, and therefore I claim the ſame juſtice for the defendant. I claim it of YOU, becauſe the verdict muſt be yours, and yours alone, as you will anſwer it to your country, to your conſciences, and your God.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I have endeavoured to diſcharge my duty. I fear I have done it feebly and imperfectly. You will nevertheleſs do yours; and I am confident you will add to the number of ſhining inſtances we have lately witneſſed, that an innocent individual is never more ſafe than when his conduct is ſubmitted to the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and impartial judgment of an Engliſh jury.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen of the Jury,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS is an indictment againſt Daniel Iſaac Eaton, who is charged with having publiſhed this libel. It cannot be neceſſary for me to ſtate the charge, you have heard it opened by the learned counſel for the proſecution, and you have afterwards heard thoſe parts which are offenſive, and which charge ſedition upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, particularly ſtated and read to you. The pamphlet has been produced, and it will be put into your hands, therefore it would be a mere waſte of time for me to run over the words of the charge, I ſhall take for granted that you are perfectly maſters of them; and being ſo, the firſt part of my duty I conceive to be to ſtate to you what is the evidence in ſupport of this proſecution; and when I have done that, I ſhall ſtate more particularly what I conceive to be the gift of the crime.</p>
            <p>To prove the publication they only call one witneſs. He ſays he bought it at the ſhop which is kept by the defendant in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopſgate-ſtreet, on the 18th of November; it is number 8. Upon the croſs-examination, he ſays, he is not an informer, but a man who lives by carrying about newſpapers. This is the whole evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the publication.</p>
            <p>Before I ſtate to you the queſtion of publication, for of that you muſt be ſatisfied upon the evidence, I will ſtate what I conceive to be particularly the nature of the crime, the nature of the ſedition imputed to the priſoner. It is, as charged in the indictment, that of vilifying and traducing the king and the regal office, as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law.</p>
            <p>Now as to the firſt, traducing the king, the laſt count in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment ſeems to apply particularly to that: the part I allude to is this—<q>Kings are wolf ſhepherds: Homer ſtiles them devourers of the people, and they do not appear to have loſt their original taſte.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, as to this part of the queſtion, by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this country, and by the ſettled law of this country, to write any thing poſitively and decidedly diſreſpectful, to vilify or traduce, to render ignoble, or diſgrace in the eyes of the people who are governed, the firſt branch of the legiſlature, the king, is by the law of the land an offence, and this is the offence imputed to the priſoner. The fort of ſedition imputed to him is, that he endeavoured thereby to weaken the hands of government.</p>
            <p>You know very well, Gentlemen, that this conſtitution is formed of King, Lords, and Commons; and it is very neceſſary, the law
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026931_0044_0FD266ACF91D9CD0"/>has conſidered it ſuch, and wiſdom and policy require that it ſhould be ſo, that every branch of the legiſlature ſhould be held in equal reſpect. I have no doubt to ſtate to you, that in a ſtate of civil ſociety, where there exiſts a government, there muſt be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioriry and inferiority; it is for the advantage and the good of the whole that it ſhould exiſt; and it is for that reaſon that the conſtitution and the law of this country have fortified and given a particular and ſtrong protection to the character which commands as the chief magiſtrate, and controuls thoſe who are governed in this country. I do not enlarge upon this ſubject, becauſe I am ſure the learned advocate for the defendant cannot controvert this; that being ſo, you will be to judge whether, upon the reading this pamphlet, which you ought to read, in my opinion, with your minds not all heated either with the addreſs of the counſel on the part of the proſecution, or with the addreſs of the counſel on the part of the defendant, but you ſhould read the book preciſely in the way as if you had it in your own private chamber, and wiſhed to make yourſelves completely matters of the whole ſubject: ſee what the impreſſion on your minds is then, and ſee whether a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon uſing the language which is uſed in this ſecond count, does or does not mean to vilify and traduce that branch of the conſtitution which the defendant is charged with doing in the indictment.</p>
            <p>You are not only to read the paſſages charged to be libellous, but to read the whole pamphlet; and if, upon reading the whole, you can apply this to any thing but the government of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that branch of it named—to be ſure it does not impute any thing to the defendant.</p>
            <p>An obſervation occurred to the counſel for the defendant which he urged with great ingenuity; he thought it his duty to ſtate to you that this has ſo general an application that it is not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the government of this country. Now you ſhould read a pamphlet of this fort, charged to be a libel, with exactly the ſame indifference as you would any other book; then ſee how you are to apply that language in the way it is here ſtated. "The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of a True Briton. Kings are wolf ſhepherds," and ſo on. Whether you would not apply them to all kings?</p>
            <p>The learned counſel has told you that the word ALL ſhould have been uſed for you to have put that conſtruction upon it. Now that is entirely a matter of fact upon which you are to decide; but the obſervation really ſtrikes me the other way; becauſe it ſtrikes me that if a perſon uſes the general term in that way, and makes no exception, that it is applicable to all perſons of that deſcription. It appears therefore to me, and you will judge of that, reading this with the whole of the pamphlet, whether you do not conſider
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026931_0045_0FD266B02C794CB8"/>this as a direct attack upon one branch of the legiſlature, and that the perſon who wrote this (I ſhall come to the publiſher by and by) did not thereby mean to ſay that kings, this deſcription of people, were devourers of the people, and ſo on;—whether being in that general way, it is not in the common conſtruction of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to be applied to the government of this country? If you think it is, then it is by the law of the land indiſputably a libel: and how far the priſoner may be anſwerable for it, it is for you to conſider.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make one more obſervation to you upon this part of the caſe, that it is your duty certainly to read the whole pamphlet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inuendos, the ſenſe that is imputed to the perſon who writes this book, is entirely to be decided by you. So much for that part of the caſe which imputes ſedition to the government of this country.</p>
            <p>It appears to me that ſedition is imputed in another way, and that is upon the perſonal executive power, upon the king himſelf. This indictment charges the author of this pamphlet with charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the king of England, among others, with being a tyrant; and after ſtating that ſuch a tyrant is guilty of oppreſſion by taxation, and ſo on, he ſeems to intimate pretty broadly as his opinion, that ſuch a perſon ſhould ſuffer death by the guillotine. And he ſays afterwards, deſcribing all this by the figure of a cock, that ſuch a perſon, when his trappings were ſtripped off, was found to be rank with the pollution of his luxurious vices, and ſo on. The ſecond count only makes a part of the ſame charge; it will be for you to conſider, reading the book in an indifferent manner; for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is no evidence given in explanation of the book one way or other; you have nothing but the ſpeeches of the learned counſel upon it. As to what paſſes in the world, you are competent and fair judges. Then reading this book, called Politics for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Reflections of a True Briton, and ſo on, conſidering the time when it is publiſhed, you will be to decide upon all the obſervations you have heard on both ſides, whether this is fairly or not imputable, as it is charged in this indictment, to the king of this country, and whether the author who wrote it meant to apply it to the king of this country.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to inuendos, it muſt be a fact always for a jury to decide what is the ſenſe and meaning of a libel; for a man in the higheſt extravagance of compliment, beyond a doubt may write ſuch a pamphlet as ſhall be a groſs libel. A man may uſe ſuch language as in the plain terms of it at firſt may appear to be no libel: but yet, perhaps, by looking into ſome other expreſſion, or taking the intention of the party in the whole of the book, it
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026931_0046_0FD266B1B00A9198"/>
will be impoſſibie not to ſee, that though he uſes language that is ironical, yet that you perfectly underſtand he means exactly the reverſe of what he ſays; and if from the whole of the work you can collect, and think yourſelves bound to collect, reading it fairly, that ſuch was the intention of the party, that will be a libel.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, it is in matters of ſedition as it is in other crimes. Few men are bold and hardy enough to uſe language of ſuch ſort as will ſubject them to very ſevere penalties, without ſome ſort of cover. God forbid that I ſhould (for it is not my province) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that to the defendant upon the preſent occaſion: but it is my duty to ſtate to you that if a pamphlet is written in that way, you have a right to take off the maſk, if you think it is a maſk; and it is your duty, reading it with indifference and with temper, to ſee what the intention is, whatever the veil may be, whatever the cover may be, whether it is under an ape, or whether it is by alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, or a figure; whatever colour or complexion the book may take, it is entirely for you to decide what is the fair meaning of that book, and what is the ſenſe in which the author wrote it.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you ſee here is a figurative deſcription of a cock, and ſo on; and this is imputed by the indictment to apply to the fovereign of this country, and to impute to him taxation, and other things, as oppreſſion; and that he ought to be taken off by the guillotine.</p>
            <p>Upon the obſervations made on both ſides of the queſtion, and conſidering that the book is entitled, "Politics for the People," and "The Reflections of a True Briton," you will be to judge whether that is fairly imputable to the ſovereign of this country; if it is not, certainly it is not a libel; if it is, on the other hand, it is indiſputably a libel, and you will find the defendant guilty of that count.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you have heard a great many obſervations in this caſe reſpecting the liberty of the preſs. I am ſure I think it my duty to ſtate, that the liberty of the preſs is the greateſt bleſſing this country can enjoy: but on the other hand I muſt ſtate to you that the licentiouſneſs of the preſs is the greateſt curſe. And I am ſure your good ſenſe will teach you this, that if men are permitted to <hi>ſay</hi> any thing, they will very ſoon go the length of <hi>doing</hi> any thing; and where that is the ſituation of affairs in any country, there is an end to all government. And therefore you muſt judge in a caſe of this ſort of the ſenſe of the libel, of the intention, of the party, and your deciſon on this indictment one way or other will not, in my opinion, affect that queſtion which has been ſtaced to you of the liberty of the preſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:026931_0047_0FD266B2E5082DC8"/>This, you ſee, is not charged to be a libel upon miniſters, but it is a direct charge, in one part of it, upon one branch of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and in another part of it in an oppreſſive exerciſe of the duties of that branch of the government; and therefore if it fairly applies to the king of this country, it ſeems to me very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for any jury to ſay, that a perſon who writes a book with an intention to make a direct attack upon the government, or to charge the executive government of this country with oppreſſion, it ſeems very difficult to ſay that that comes within the liberty or the preſs. I conceive the law to be completely otherwiſe, and that the executive government of the country is protected by the law, that every individual is protected from ſuch an attack, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive goverment of a country, the firſt magiſtrate, a character that ſtand ſo high, muſt neceſſarily be ſo protected; therefore it comes, and always muſt come to the queſion, whether a direct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive attack is made upon that government.</p>
            <p>If you ſhal1 be of opinion that this is not written in a mere ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative way, but that it is written with the intention charged in the indictment, to render contemptible that character, and to change that character with oppreſſion, it ſeems to me that this is no queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpeculation which involves the liberty of the preſs, but it ſeems to be that ſort of queſtion which gives the go by to it; and that you muſt be decided entirely in your opinion upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is before you.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, much has been ſaid about the cheapneſs of the libel; that is out of the queſtion; if you ſhould be ſatisfied upon the whole that it is a libel applied to the government of this country, it muſt be an aggravation of the offence, but that cannot decide the queſtion of libel one way or the other. But then there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion for your conſideration, and that is the intention of the party. Now you will obſerve the perſon before you is the publiſher, and not the author of the libel: but as to the qneſtion of the ſedition in the libel, that muſt firſt be diſpoſed of; and it is my duty to ſtate to you, that if you ſhould think this applicable to the government of this country, that then the publiſher of it, if it is a libel, is anſwerable for the conſequences of that publication; and it will he very difficult, in my opinion, for you to ſay, when once the fact is ſettled that the work is libelous, that the perſon who ſends into the world that ſort of publication to diſturb the peace of the country, could do it with any very good intention.</p>
            <p>The learned counſel for the defendant has told you, that ſcince the act of parliament has taken place, this is to be decided in the ſame way as any other crime, and he has thought fit to put the crime of murder as the example. Now taking that as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026931_0048_0FD266B4813F36C0"/>how would it be? Suppoſe a man commits a murder with a very offenſive weapon, I take it to be clear and ſettled law that his evil intent will thereby be preſumed; and if the law in the caſe where a murder is committed with a very offenſive weapon, would preſume that the party uſing it had an intention to do the miſchief, I ſhould think if a man ſends poiſon into the world that may do a great deal of miſchief, that a jury would not go any great length in preſuming upon the evidence, unleſs he could on nis part ſhew ſome evidence to get rid of the preſumption that he was influenced by that criminal intention which the law preſumes, in that caſe, as it does in the caſe of libel.</p>
            <p>It will be for you, therefore, firſt to make up your minds upon this pamphlet, whether it does apply to the king and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country; and if it does, then the next queſtion for you to conſider is, whether the priſoner is the publiſher of it. Now as to that, he certainly is anſwerable in law as the publiſher, if it is ſold in his ſhop. There has been nothing proved on the part of the priſoner to ſhew that he is not at all reſponſible for it; and unleſs he diſproves the fact of publication, it is a publication for which he is bound to anſwer; and as to his intention, I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly leave it to you to determine upon the caſe ſtated by the counſel, if you are ſatisfied that this is a libellous work, and if you are ſatisfied that theſe inuendos are proper inuendos, and fairly made out, whether you can think a man publiſhing ſuch a pamphlet as this, charged to have, and having in your opinion a ſeditious tendency, does it with ſuch an innocent intention as the law will ſupport.</p>
            <p>There is one more obſervation that has been made by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the deſendant. You have heard a good deal about the Star Chamber, and ſo on; now I think it is but fair to ſay that this has been brought before you by a grand jury. God forbid that you ſhould decide the queſtion againſt the priſoner becauſe a grand jury has found the bill; but ſo far as concerns the attorney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is on the part of the public certainly the mildeſt method of proceeding, becauſe it is giving the priſoner the moſt favourable opportunity of being tried by his equals. I cannot, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this proſecution can in any way be conſidered to look at all like any of thoſe proſecutions of which we have heard ſo much, becauſe I think all that is done away by the manner in which the preſent attorney-general has thought fit to proſecure this man.</p>
            <p>There was another obſervation made by the counſel for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, reſpecting the taxes and adminiſtration, and ſo on. I can only ſay that I think that obſervation was a little unfortunate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026931_0049_0FD266B69D57DB28"/>the whole of the defence ſeemed to me upon this occaſion in to turn upon this; and it is the ſtrongeſt part of the argument which has been put by the counſel for the defendant, that theſe inuendos, applying theſe paſſages to the king and government of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are not fairly applied. Now it ſeems to me, in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence are that, rather an awkward circumſtance; and it looks as if the mind, in reading this pamphlet, could not but feel that it is meant to convey ſentiments unfavourable to the government of this country; and what ſtrengthens that opinion is, that in the ſubſequent part ſomething further is ſtated reſpecting thoſe taxes mentioned in this very libel.</p>
            <p>You have had another obſervation made with reſpect to the ſtate of this man's family. Now as all that is to be conſidered as an attack upon your paſſions, either on one ſide or the other, you have too much good ſenſc to attend to it. You are to conſider the ſituation of the country at large, the good government of the Country on one hand, and the ſituation of the defendant on the other and I have no doubt that you will do juſtice between them both, and that you will not be hurried away by the idea of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or any thing of that ſort, which in a criminal caſe can make no conſideration at all. All that the proſecutor can aſk of you, and all that I can aſk of you, is this, to read this book as you would read it if you wanted to make yourſelves matters of it in your own private chambers, ſee what the impreſſion is on your minds, and if you think theſe inuendos are fairly made out, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this pamphlet, they certainly charge the defendant with publiſhing a ſeditious libel. You will judge of the whole. If you think him guilty, you will find him ſo; if you think this is not made out to be applicable to the king and government of this country, you will then acquit him.</p>
