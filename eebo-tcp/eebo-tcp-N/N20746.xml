            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reſpectable friends and Brethren,</salute>
INVITED by you to ſpeak on this occaſion, permit me to call your greateful contemplations to dwell a few moments on the majeſty and goodneſs of the ſupreme Lord and Architect of the univerſe. The pious admiration, expreſſed by that wiſe and ancient monarch Solomon, the builder of the Temple, at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condeſcention of Jehovah, will be the theme of my diſcourſe.</opener>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I KINGS, viii. 27.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>But will God indeed dwell on the earth! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee: how much leſs this houſe which I have builded?</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is a ſentence of that devout and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer, which Solomon addreſſed to the God of Iſrael, at the dedication of that magnificent edifice the Temple. It was the will of God, that a houſe of prayer ſhould be erected in Jeruſalem, and that Solomon, the wiſeſt and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027244_0005_0FD3CCED773F5750"/>
wealthieſt monarch of the eaſt, ſhould build it, and that it ſhould exceed in ſplendor, any thing that the world had ſeen.</p>
            <p>"Solomon built him a houſe. Howbeit the Moſt High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as ſaith the prophet, <hi>Heaven is my throne, and earth my footſtool."</hi> God is not confined to place or bounds. The houſe was intended for the worſhippers of Jehovah, in which to meet and preſent their religious homage. The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the building, which was one of the wonders of the world, was deſigned by the pious builders to bear a faint reſemblance of the glory of the Being worſhipped there.</p>
            <p>The model of the houſe was given from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Iſraelites and Tyrians were the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Hiram, king of Tyre, ſent his ſkilful arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itects from Tyere and Sidon, to work with the builders of Iſrael. The materials were prepared beforehand. The cedars were faſhioned on Leb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anon, and the ſtones and marble hewed and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed at the quarries. They were brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the building aroſe without the noiſe of axes or hammers. Lively emblem of the church of the redeemed, made up of Jews and Gentiles; a glorious building reſting on the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, Jeſus Chriſt, the chief corner ſtone. They are here prepared by the grace of the Redeemer, the ſanctification of ordinances and of afflictions, and the operation of the divine Spirit, faſhioning them in the ſtrength and beauty of holineſs, for that temple in the Lord, in the peaceful world above, where no jarring noiſe is heard. And lively
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027244_0006_0FD3EA59D408F7A0"/>
image alſo of the church on earth, when the peaceful and benevolent ſpirit of the religion of Jeſus, ſhall univerſally reign.</p>
            <p>At the completion of this noble edifice, king Solomon, at the head of the congregation of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, addreſſed God in a moſt ſolemn prayer, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring his favorable preſence, and beſeeching him to bleſs his worſhippers there. And God was pleaſed to give them a pledge of his gracious acceptance, by a glorious light ſhining in the temple, between the golden cherubims, and by a dazzling cloud inveloping the edifice. No pious ſouls ſincerely ſeek the favour of God in vain. How great was the joy and holy wonder of the king and the people, at this manifeſtation of the divine favor? Solomon could ſcarcely realize the condeſcention; that the high and holy Being who inhabits eternity, ſhould thus favorably regard the prayer of his people, and by this token of his gracious preſence, dwell with men. <hi>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee! how much leſs this houſe which I have builded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two thoughts eſpecially, ſtrike the mind, on reading this ſublime paſſage, this pious exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the royal preacher,—the <hi>majeſty of God,</hi> and <hi>his kindneſs to men.</hi> I will humbly attempt to raiſe my own and your devout contemplations to theſe great ſubjects—<hi>the majeſty and immenſity of Jehovah,</hi> the builder of the univerſe, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the ends of the earth, and <hi>his wonderful goodneſs and condeſcention</hi> to the wants and affairs of men; and to make ſuch application of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027244_0007_0FD3CCEFB2A70698"/>
ſubject, as may correſpond to the purpoſes of our preſent aſſembling.</p>
            <p>Every pious mind is ſtruck with admiration at the immenſity of God. For there can be no part of the univerſe or infinite ſpace, but God is preſent there.</p>
            <p>Our thoughts are capable of forming only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcanty conceptions of the immenſity or om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence of God. On entering on this great ſubject, I feel my inſufficiency and nothingneſs; but to purſue it as far as we are able, will exalt God in our thoughts and ſerve to give us ſuitable apprehenſions of ourſelves. For who by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can find out the majeſty of God, or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite immenſity to perfection? Our exiſtence and knowledge are limited, and beyond certain bounds we cannot extend. And all creatures with whom we are acquainted, are alſo finite and limited; and in our conceptions of the univerſe, we are ready to imagine that there muſt be ſome end to the creation, or to extended ſpace. And alſo in our thoughts on the exiſtence of God, we are inclined to limit his preſence, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is local and circumſcribed. We are unable to graſp immenſity and infinitude. Our capacity of thought is finite and bounded, and we are therefore loſt and drowned in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine immenſity. Such is the imperfection and ſcantineſs of our knowledge.</p>
            <p>So far as our eyes can ſee over the earth, and up to the ſtary heavens, we behold the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of the Creator's ſkill, his power and goodneſs. The ſtars appear ſmall by reaſon of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027244_0008_0FD3EA4F61606730"/>
their immenſe diſtance. It would be many ages before the ſwifteſt eagle could reach the neareſt of them. This earth on which we dwell is great, but how ſmall a ſpot is it compared to the whole creation? Numerous ſtars are ſeen by the eye, and by the help of glaſſes are ſeen, ſtars greatly beyond them; and each, probably a ſun to inhabited worlds of rational creatures, revolving around them.</p>
            <p>Should the ſoul diſengaged from the body, fly with ſwiftneſs to thoſe diſtant worlds of light, it would no doubt, there ſee other ſyſtems and worlds of light on all ſides, appearing as ſtars in the vaſt fields of the univerſe. Should it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend its journey for millions of ages, through interminable ſpace, it would ſee, with increaſing wonder, works on works of the creator. Or ſhould it reach the end of the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if any end there be, to created ſyſtems and worlds, would find itſelf within the univerſe of God, ſuſtained and upheld by his omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Beyond the utmoſt bounds of creation, there ſtill remains an unbounded infinite ſpace, the work of the Almighty. In attempting to reach the limit or the end, the thoughts are loſt, weary and confounded. Such is this immenſe univerſe, and infinite extended ſpace. And God is preſent in all parts and places therein. His eſſential preſence is here and there, and beyond the utmoſt extent to which our thoughts can reach. He is, ſays one, as a circle, whole cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is every where, and his circumference no where. Whither, O Lord, ſhall I go from thy preſence? If I aſcend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, lo, thou art
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027244_0009_0FD3EA6B1545FFC8"/>
there: if I take the wings of the morning, and fly with the ſwiftneſs of the rays of light to the utmoſt bounds of the creation, even there will thy hand ſuſtain me, and thy immenſity ſurround me.</p>
            <p>This amazing univerſe, the temple and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Deity, was brought into exiſtance by an act of his almighty will. "<hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</hi> He ſpake and it was done. Man can faſhion ſome curious work when he has materials and tools to work with. But who except a Deity, can call from nothing into being? Who but God could ſtretch out the heavens as an immenſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, adorned with countleſs worlds of light, and give them their admirable beauty and order!</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Fond atheiſt, could a giddy dance,</l>
               <l>Of atoms lawleſs hurl'd,</l>
               <l>Produce ſo regular, ſo fair,</l>
               <l>So harmoniz'd a world!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A God! a God! Creation ſhouts,</l>
               <l>A God! each inſect cries;</l>
               <l>He moulded in his palm the earth,</l>
               <l>And hung it in the ſkies.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>From the works of creation, we infer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity and omnipreſence of God. As unbounded ſpace and the created univerſe have God for their author, his eſſence muſt be neceſſarily infinite and unbounded. If there were any place, where God is not, it would imply imperfection, becauſe his exiſtance would then be limited and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitude abridged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:027244_0010_0FD3EA6C74A26550"/>
It is alſo inferred from the providence of God, and his conſervation of all things. Without his preſence in all parts of the univerſe, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upholding and governing all, all things would ruſh to ruin, and to their primitive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs. All things are full of God. O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous knowledge! The immenſity of Jehovah is high, we cannot attain unto it. "Thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O Lord is unſearchable. Great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy works, Lord God almighty, ſought out by all them, who have pleaſure in them."</p>
            <p>The majeſty and immenſity of God are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which fill our minds with awful reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ſolemn fear. It is his goodneſs, his kindneſs and condeſcention to men which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his perfections amiable, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to approach this high and holy being, our glorious Maker, with humble confidence and filial love.</p>
            <p>His condeſcention to the wants and the affairs of men, impreſſed the mind of the king and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael with holy wonder, admiration and joy. Let the goodneſs and condeſcention of our God to us, ſirs, his needy and offending creatures, now and all times deeply affect our minds, and irreſiſtably and ſweetly impel us, to love and ſerve him for ever. "Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and never forget his benefits, for his mercy endureth forever." An ocean of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence exiſts in God. The ſtreams flow over all creation. His infinite and amiable goodneſs appears in the creation of the univerſe. It is ſeen on earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all the favourable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027244_0011_0FD3EA4FBAE64710"/>
in which creatures are placed to obtain the happineſs of which they are capable. "The eyes of all, O Lord, wait upon thee, and thou ſatisfieſt the deſires of every living thing." What a vaſt family of living creatures, beſides man, wait on God, and are fed and clothed from the ſtore-houſe of his bounty?</p>
            <p>Thus God's infinite kindneſs appears in the creation of beings to poſſeſs happineſs, and alſo in their conſtant preſervation. "In God we live and move and have our being." His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence pervades our eſſence and by his conſtant care, the ſpirits are preſerved before him, and the ſouls which he has made.</p>
            <p>To every nation and individual, he leaves not himſelf without a witneſs of his goodneſs, in ſending rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, and all the bounties of his providence, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>And tho' men miſuſe and abuſe the bounties of heaven, and ſpurn at the hand that is liberally extended to give, yet the goodneſs and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God follow them, all the days of their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. Time would fail, ſhould we dwell on the delightful theme of the goodneſs and the love of God to men, and the one half would remain untold.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only remind you brethren, of that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital gift of God to men, the gift of his Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us. This is ſuch an expreſſion of love in the Deity, as fills holy angels with admiration
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027244_0012_0FD3EA6CF7352DC0"/>
and joy. In this was manifeſted the love of God, that he ſent his Son into the world to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that God loved us. Hear, O heavens, and be aſtoniſhed, O earth, with joyful ſurpriſe, at this wonderful and divine condeſcention; and let the glory be given to the higheſt, that thro' the bleſſed Mediator, there is peace on earth, and good will to men.</p>
            <p>The ſame divine philanthropy is ſeen in the Son of God, by whom the father made all worlds, and who as to his divine nature is one with him, and whom neither heaven, nor the heaven of heavens can contain. Yet, wondrous condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Behold him coming to dwell on earth,—veiling his glories in mortality,—converſing with us as a man converſes with his friend,—guiding us by his example, his precepts and his ſpirit, through the duties and dangers of life, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the manſions of eternal life, glory and felicity in heaven.</p>
            <p>Having now taken a ſummary though very imperfect view, of the immenſity of Jehovah, and his kindneſs and condeſcenſion to men, we will conclude with a few REFLECTIONS.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Great, ſirs, is the duty and unſpeakable the advantages of having our minds habitually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, with the conſciouſneſs of a preſent God. The eyes of the Lord are in every place, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil and the good. He is the conſtant witneſs and will be the righteous judge of all thoughts and actions, and before his ſupreme tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027244_0013_0FD3EA6471A5E660"/>
our ſpirits muſt appear, to receive an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal retribution.</p>
            <p>We are wholly dependant on God for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for all the favorable circumſtances of our ſtate of trial for eternity; and for all that good and happineſs which our immortal ſpirits hope for throughout the endleſs periods of our exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To whom then ſhould we ſeek principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to approve ourſelves, but to him, in whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor is our immortal life?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We hence infer the neceſſity of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God; and that we ſecure in this our ſtate of trial for eternity, an intereſt in his love and favor. His diſpleaſure is more dreadful than the terrors of death, and his ſmiles diffuſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal joy. Here we are ſurrounded with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſenſe, and ſee God only in his works; but when our diſembodied ſpirits ſhall be uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the world of ſpirits, our thoughts will then be filled with the immenſity of God. There we ſhall ſee him, face to face. All other objects will be in a manner loſt to us, and God be all in all. What will then be the condition of the ſoul that finds itſelf alone with God? How dreadful the terrors of his diſpleaſure whoſe frowns can make a hell of miſery.</p>
            <p>Let the ſolemn conſideration powerfully reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train from all ſin, and impel us to all duty. Let us cultivate an habitual ſenſe of the preſence of God with us every where. It will be the ſafeſt and happieſt means of guarding us from evil—of reſtraining the ſallies of intemperate paſſions—of mortifying our love of forbidden pleaſures,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027244_0014_0FD3EA64779A92C8"/>
and crucifying every luſt. It will ſweetly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to the cultivation of a meek, holy, and heavenly temper and converſation; to be holy as God is holy, and merciful as our Father in heaven is merciful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is moſt ſafe and happy who loves and pleaſes God. There can be no true love to God without an habitual deſire to pleaſe him in all things. And to what higher bleſſedneſs can the ſoul aſpire, than the friendſhip of the immenſe and eternal Jehovah, the greateſt and beſt of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Secure of this the ſoul is ſafe in every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible condition. It is the only cordial and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the moſt adverſe and trying ſcenes of life. When the wicked are driven away in judgment as chaff before the deſtroying tempeſt, God remembers the righteous and comforts them in the midſt of trouble. His favor makes ſweet amends for the loſs of all things. "Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labor of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flocks ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herein in the ſtalls, yet, I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation." And when they paſs through the valley of the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows of death they fear no evil, for God is with them.</p>
            <p>The friendſhip of God, is the only ſource of immortal life and joy, through all eternal ages. This conſtitutes the happineſs of angels and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous departed ſpirits. To them God is all in all. They are abſorbed in the immenſity of his love.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:027244_0015_0FD3EA7AE6723190"/>
4. Let pious ſouls look up to God, and truſt in his almighty goodneſs. For to them, he gives the tokens of his ſpecial favor. He meets them in the ways of his inſtitution. He anſwered the pious prayer of Solomon and the congregation, at the temple, in divine condeſcention and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He honors the houſe of prayer, and meets the faithful with celeſtial bleſſings. Happy are all his faithful ſervants who worſhip him in his earthly temple! In due time they will be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the heaven of heavens, the ſanctuary on high, where they will need not the light of the fun, to enlighten them, "for the glory of the Lord doth enlighten it and the Lamb is the light thereof."</p>
            <p n="5">5. From the divine example illuſtrated by the ſubject, we infer, that condeſcention, kindneſs and brotherly love, towards our fellow men, are duties which as men and chriſtians, we ought dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put in practice. Is Jehovah, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, good and kind to men? Let men be glad to imitate the great example. "If God hath thus loved us, then ought we to love one another." Cultivate and cheriſh, ſirs, the benevolent and friendly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let the love of God, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt reign in your heart, and ye cannot fail to love your neighbour as yourſelf. And actuated by this genuine principle of chriſtian benevolence, you will preſent an offering accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God and uſeful to men. For God is love, and this is his commandment that ye love one another, as brethren of one family and travellers to the immortal inheritence.</p>

               <hi>Gentlemen of this ancient and honourable Society,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the impreſſion of the ſublime and glorious truths, of which ſome faint ſketches have now been offered, permit me to addreſs to you a few thoughts.</p>
            <p>As the moſt excellent creature on earth, it has pleaſed our merciful Creator, to make man capable of the communications, the profits and pleaſures of ſociety. There is in man the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of juſtice, truth and benevolence; and a ſenſe of accountableneſs to God, as the powerful motive to every moral and ſocial virtue. In him are found the humane and friendly affections, the faculty of reaſon and ſpeech, and ſkill in numberleſs uſeful inventions and arts.</p>
            <p>Without ſociety theſe faculties and acquiſitions would be uſeleſs and man moſt unhappy. You have entered into a ſociety where the obligations are ſpecial. Every laudable ſociety is formed to promote the good of its members and the public happineſs. In the eſtimation of mankind a ſociety is honorable in proportion to this tendency. May you, gentlemen, ever act up to the charitable and beneficent deſign of your inſtitution. Ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that there can be no true greatneſs of character without goodneſs.</p>
            <p>The real antiquity of your ſociety, is great. It was honoured in the ages of Chivalry. Kings princes and prieſts have enroled their names among the fraternity. It is much to the credit of your inſtitution, that your laws exclude from your ſocial retreats all oppoſing debates on the politics of government, and on different ſyſtems
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027244_0017_0FD3EA7647E06738"/>
of religion; and that it opens its friendly boſom, to receive as brethren, the worthy of all nations, languages and denominations. Your ſociety is diſperſed over Europe and America and extends into Aſia. Multitudes of the fraternity, whom miſfortunes had reduced, have been comforted, fed and clothed by its charity. Funds are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In captivity and diſtreſs in foreign climes, your laws encourage you to expect relief from the charity of Maſons; and demand of you the ſame return; and to forget the enemy in the brother. Theſe things are good and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to men.</p>
            <p>Illuſtrious characters in civil and military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments in modern times, are alſo found in your fraternities. May you dignify your ſociety by a laudable and worthy example in all reſpects, and in all duty to God, to mankind and to one another. Permit me to call to your grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, that kind providence of God, which allows you, with undiſturbed quietneſs, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue your labours in theſe peaceful regions, while the nations of Europe are convulſed with dreadful wars. <hi>Deus hec otia fecit.</hi>
