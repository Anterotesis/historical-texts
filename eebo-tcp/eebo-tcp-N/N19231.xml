            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Occaſion of our LORD's giving this Caution was this: Perceiving that much People were gathered together, to hear him, out of every City, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd knowing, (for he is GOD and knoweth all Things) that many, if not moſt of them, would be Hearers only, and not Doers of the Word, he ſpake to them by a Parable, wherein, under the Similitude of a Sower, that went out to ſow his Seed, he plainly intimated how few there were amongſt them who would receive any ſaving Benefit from his Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, or bring forth Fruit unto Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Application, one would imagine, ſhould be plain and obvious: But the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as yet unenlightened in any great Degree by the Holy Spirit, and therefore unable to ſee into the hidden Myſteries of the Kingdom of GOD, dealt with our Saviour, as People ought to deal with their Miniſters—diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with them privately about the Meaning of what he had taught them in Publick, and with a ſincere Deſire of doing their Duty, aſked for an Interpretation of the Parable.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed LORD, as he always was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to inſtruct thoſe that were teachable (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſetting his Miniſters an Example to be courteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as their improving the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge already imparted, was the only Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which more was to be given them, it therefore highly concerned them to <hi>take heed how they heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Context then it appears, that the Words were primarily ſpoken to the Apoſtles themſelves. But becauſe they were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the whole Church, and 'tis to be feared out of thoſe many Thouſands that flock to hear Sermons, but few comparatively ſpeaking are effectually influenced by them; I cannot but think it very neceſſary to remind you of the Caution given by our LORD to his Diſciples, and to exhort you with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Earneſtneſs to <hi>take heed how you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. And, FIRST, I am to prove that every one ought to take all Opportunities of hearing Sermons.</p>
            <p>That there have always been particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſet apart by GOD to inſtruct and exhort his People to practice what he ſhould require of them, is evident from many Paſſages of Scripture.—St. Jude tells us, that Enoch the ſeventh from Adam propheſied, or preached, concerning the LORD's coming with ten Thouſand of his Saints to Judgment. And Noah, who lived not long after, is ſtiled by St. Peter, <hi>a Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And though in all the intermediate Space between the Flood and Giving of the Law, we hear but of few Preachers, yet we may reaſonably conclude, that GOD never left himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Witneſs, but at ſundry Times, and after divers Manners, ſpoke to our Fathers by the Patriarchs and Prophets.</p>
            <p>But however it was before, we are aſſured that after the Delivery of the Law, GOD has conſtantly ſeparated to himſelf a certain Order of Men to preach to, as well as pray for his People; and commanded them to enquire their Duty at the Prieſts Mouths. And tho' the Jews were frequently led into Captivity, and for their Sins ſcattered abroad through the Face of the Earth, yet he never utterly forſook his Church, but ſtill kept up a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Prophets and Preachers, as Ezekiel,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025033_0005_0FCD841535152838"/>
Jeremiah, Daniel, and others, to reprove, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, and call them to Repentance.</p>
            <p>Thus was it under the Law. Nor has the Church been worſe, but infinitely better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for under the Goſpel: For when JESUS CHRIST, that great High Prieſt, had through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf as a full, perfect, ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the Sins of the whole World, and after his Reſurrection had all Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him both in Heaven and Earth, he gave Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and in them to all ſucceeding Miniſters, to go and preach his Goſpel to every Creature; promiſing to be with them to guide, aſſiſt, ſtrengthen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them <hi>always, even to the End of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be the Duty of Miniſters to preach (and woe be to them if they do not preach the Goſpel, for a Neceſſity is laid upon them) no doubt, the People are obliged to attend to them; for otherwiſe, wherefore are Miniſters ſent?</p>
            <p>And how can we here avoid admiring the Love and the tender Care which our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer has expreſſed for his Spouſe the Church? Who, becauſe he could not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with us in Perſon, on account it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient he ſhould go away, and as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner take Poſſeſſion of that Glory he had purchaſed by his precious Blood, yet would not leave us comfortleſs, but firſt ſettled a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number of Paſtors and Teachers; and afterward according to his Promiſe, actually did and will continue to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to furniſh them and their Succeſſors with proper Gifts and Graces for the Work
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025033_0006_0FCD841A9B3A61F8"/>
of the Minſtry, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of his Body in Love, till we all come in the Unity of the Spirit, to the Fulneſs of the Meaſure of the Stature of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Oh! how inſenſible are thoſe of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Gift who do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, who crucify the Son of GOD afreſh, and put him to an open Shame, by wilfully refuſing to attend ſo great a Means of their Salvation? How dreadful will the End of ſuch Men be? How aggravating, that Light ſhould come into the World, that the glad Tidings of Salvation ſhould be ſo very frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in this City, and that ſo many ſhould loath this ſpiritual Manna, his Angels rood, and call it light bread?

And to enter his Houſe merely to have our Ears entertained, and not our Hearts reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt certainly be highly diſpleaſing to the Moſt High GOD, as well as unprofitable to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that ſo many remain Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, yea, unaffected with the moſt Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Preaching; ſo that like St. Paul's Companions, they only hear the Preacher's Voice with their outward Ears, but do not experience the Power of it inwardly in their Hearts. Or like the Ground near Gideon's Fleece, they remain untouched, whilſt others
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025033_0008_0FCD842009796E28"/>
that came to be fed with the ſincere Milk of the Word, like the Fleece itſelf, are watered by the Dew of GOD's Heavenly Bleſſing, and grow thereby.</p>
            <p>Flee therefore, my Brethren, flee Curioſity; and prepare your Hearts by a humble Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to receive with Meekneſs the engrafted Word, and then it will be a Means, under GOD, to quicken, build up, purify, and ſave your Souls.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Direction I ſhall lay down for the ſame Purpoſe, is, not only to prepare your Hearts, before you hear, but alſo to give diligent heed to the Things that are ſpoken, whilſt you are hearing the Word of GOD.</p>
            <p>If an earthly King was to iſſue out a Royal Proclamation, on performing or not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conditions wherein contained, the Life or Death of his Subjects entirely depended, how ſolicitous would they be to hear what thoſe Conditions were? And ſhall not we pay the ſame Reſpect to the KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, and lend an attentive Ear to his Ambaſſadors, when they are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his Name on what Terms our Pardon, Peace, and Happineſs may be ſecured?</p>
            <p>When GOD deſcended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Mount Sinai in terrible Majeſty, to give unto his People the Law, how attentive were they to his Servant Moſes? And if they were ſo earneſt to hear the Thundrings or Threatnings of the Law, ſhall not we be as ſolicitous to hear from the Miniſters of CHRIST, the glad Tidings of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>In particular, take heed therefore how you hear the Redeemer's calls. See Luke 11.9. <hi>Aſk
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025033_0009_0FCD8421ACCD19D8"/>
and it ſhall be given you.</hi> It is not do this or that, or the other duty, and it ſhall be given you, but aſk, and it ſhall be given you. Your duties are what you owe to GOD, and they are his right; if you ſhould take the goods of a neighbour, to purchaſe any thing of him, it would be no better than ſtealing. See what our Saviour ſays, John 10.1. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the ſheep-fold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a thief and a robber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to neglect doing duties, is the way to provoke the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>The next words are, <hi>ſeek and ye ſhall find.</hi> The word ſeek implies a great earneſtneſs to find ſome valuable thing that is loſt, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of great value or importance, and what can be of greater importance than the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a dead ſoul to life. Remember the importunate widow, how by her importunity ſhe obtained the reſtoration of her daughter. <hi>Knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> When any perſon ſees what is in his own heart, he ſees his nature is depraved; but let no one, even in his heart, charge GOD with a fault in that matter, whether his ſhallow reaſon can comprehend it or not. Therefore, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpirit of your minds, it is the gift of GOD."</p>
            <p>Whilſt CHRIST was himſelf on Earth, it is ſaid, that people hung upon him to hear the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth. And if we looked on Miniſters as we ought, as the repreſentatives of JESUS CHRIST, we ſhould hang upon them to hear their Words alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:025033_0010_0FCD8422D1175DC0"/>Beſides the ſacred Truths that Goſpel Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters deliver are not dry inſipid Lectures on Moral Philoſophy, intended only to amuſe us for a while; but the great Myſteries of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which therefore we are bound ſtudiouſly to liſten to, leſt through our Negligence we ſhould either not underſtand them, or by any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> let them ſlip.</p>
            <p>But how regardleſs are thoſe of this Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who inſtead of hanging on the Preacher to hear him, doze or ſleep whilſt he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them from God? Unhappy Men! Can they not watch with our bleſſed LORD one Hour? What; Have they never read how <hi>Eutichus</hi> fell down as he was ſleeping, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> continued his diſcourſe till Midnight, and was taken up dead?</p>
            <p>But to return. Though you may prepare your Hearts, as you may think, by a teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſpoſition, and be attentive whilſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are delivering, yet this will profit you little, unleſs you obſerve a</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Direction,—not to entertain any the leaſt Prejudice againſt the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>For could a Preacher ſpeak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, if his Audience was prejudiced againſt him, he would be but as a ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal.</p>
            <p>That was the Reaſon why JESUS CHRIST himſelf, the eternal Word, could not do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mighty Works, nor preach to any great Effect among thoſe of his own Country; for they were offended at him. And was this ſame JESUS, this GOD incarnate again to bow the Heavens, and to come down ſpeaking as never Man ſpoke; yet if we were prejudiced
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025033_0011_0FCD8425E1845668"/>
againſt him, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, we ſhould har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our hearts as the <hi>Jews</hi> did theirs.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as you ought not to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt, ſo you ſhould be careful not to depend too much on a Preacher, or think more highly of him than you ought to think. For though this be an Extreme that People ſeldom run into; yet preferring one godly Teacher, in Oppoſition to another, has often been of ill Conſequence to the church of GOD.</p>
            <p>That, we read, was a Fault which the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> condemned in the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthians:</hi> For whereas one ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul</hi>; another I am of <hi>Apollos:</hi> Are ye not Carnal, ſays he? For who is <hi>Paul</hi> and who is <hi>Apollos,</hi> but Inſtruments in GOD's Hand by whom you believed? And are not all godly Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent forth to be miniſtring Ambaſſadors to thoſe who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation? And are they not all therefore greatly to be eſteemed for their Work's Sake.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, it is true, commands us to pay double Honour to thoſe who labour in the Word and Doctrine. But then to perfer one truly pious Miniſter at the Expence of the Character of another, is earthly, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, deviliſh.</p>
            <p>Not to mention that Popularity and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe cannot but be exceeding dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a rightly informed Mind; and muſt neceſſarily fill any thinking Man with a holy Jealouſy, leſt he ſhould take that honour to himſelf, which is due only to GOD; who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone qualifies him for his Miniſterial Labours,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025033_0012_0FCD84276F051048"/>
and from whom alone every good and perfect Gift cometh.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> Direction I would recommend is, to make a particular Application of every Thing that is delivered, to your own Hearts.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour was diſcourſing at his laſt Supper with his beloved Diſciples, and foretold that one of them ſhould betray him, each of them immediately applied it to his own Heart and ſaid, <hi>LORD, Is it I</hi>? And would Perſons in like Manner, when Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are diſſuading from any Vice, or perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Virtue, inſtead of crying, this w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> deſigned againſt ſuch and ſuch a one, turn their Thoughts inwardly, and ſay—<hi>LORD, Is it I?</hi> How far more beneficial ſhould we find Diſcourſes to be, than they generally are now?</p>
            <p>But we are apt to wander too much abroad: Always looking at the Mote which is in our Neighbour's Eye, rather than the Beam which is in our own.</p>
            <p>Haſte we now to the <hi>Sixth</hi> and laſt Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: If you would receive a Bleſſing from the LORD, when you hear his Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pray to him, both before, in, and after every Sermon, to endue the Miniſter with Power to ſpeak, and to grant you a Will and Ability to put in Practice what he ſhall ſhew from the Book of GOD to be your Duty.</p>
            <p>This would be an excellent Means to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word preached effectual to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning and enflaming your Hearts, and without this all the other Means before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed will be in vain. No doubt it was this Conſideration that made St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025033_0013_0FCD842B38ACA6D8"/>
intreat his beloved <hi>Epheſians</hi> to intercede with GOD for him,—<hi>Praying always,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit; and for me alſo, that I may open my Mouth with Boldneſs, to make known the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the Goſpel.</hi> And if ſo great an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle as <hi>Paul,</hi> needed the Prayers of his People, much more do thoſe Miniſters who have only the ordinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this would be a good Proof that you ſincerely deſired to do as well as know the Will of GOD: And it muſt highly profit both Miniſters and people; becauſe GOD through your Prayers will give them a double Portion of his Holy Spirit, whereby they will be enabled to inſtruct you more fully in the Things which pertain to the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>And oh, that all that hear me this Day, would ſeriouſly apply their Hearts to practiſe what has now been told them!—How would Miniſters ſee Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven, and People find the Word preached ſharper than a two-edged Sword, and mighty through GOD to the pulling down of the Devil's ſtrong Holds!</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt would then fall on all them that heard the Word; as when St. <hi>Peter</hi> preached. The Goſpel of CHRIST would have free Courſe, run very ſwiftly, and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands again be converted by a Sermon.</p>
            <p>For JESUS CHRIST is the ſame Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to Day, and for ever. His all-powerful Hand is not ſhortened. He has promiſed to be with his Miniſters always, even unto the End of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:025033_0014_0FCD842C78228F48"/>It does indeed ſometimes happen that GOD to magnify his Free Grace in CHRIST JESUS, is found of them that ſought him not; a notorious Sinner is forcibly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by a publick Sermon, and plucked as a Fire-brand out of the Fire. But this is not GOD's ordinary Way of acting. No; for the Generality, he only viſits thoſe with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Word who humbly wait to know what he would have them to do. And ſends unqualified Hearers not only empty, but har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, away.</p>
            <p>Take heed, therefore, ye careleſs curious Profeſſors, if any ſuch be here preſent, how you hear. Remember that, whether we think of it or not, we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, where Miniſters muſt give a ſtrict Acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of the Doctrine they have delivered, and you as ſtrict a one, how you have impro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r it. And good GOD! how will you be able to ſtand at the Bar of an angry, Sin avenging Judge, and ſee ſo many Diſcourſes you have deſpiſed, ſo many Miniſters who once longed and laboured for the Salvation of your precious and mortal Souls, brought out as ſo many ſwift Witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt you? Will it be ſufficient then think you, to alledge that you went to hear them only out of curioſity, to paſs away an idle Hour, to admire the Oratory, or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the ſimplicity of the preacher? No, GOD will then let you know, that you ought to have come out of better Principles, that every Sermon has been put down to your account, and that you muſt then be juſtly puniſhed for not improving by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:025033_0015_0FCDAA330E1ECAB8"/>But fear not, you little Flock, who with Meekneſs receive the ingrafted Word, and bring forth the peaceable Fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; for it ſhall not be ſo with you. No; you will be your Miniſter's Joy, and their Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS. And they will preſent you in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Triumph faultleſs and unblameable to our common Redeemer, ſaying, Behold us, O LORD, and the Children which Thou haſt given us.</p>
            <p>But ſtill <hi>take you heed how you hear.</hi> For upon your improving the Grace you have, more ſhall be given, and you ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. For He is faithful that has promiſed. Who alſo will do it. Nay, GOD from out of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall ſo bleſs you, that every Sermon you hear ſhall communicate to you a freſh Supply of Spiritual Knowledge. The Word of GOD ſhall dwell in you richly; you ſhall go on from Strength to Strength, from one Degree of Grace unto another, till being grown up to be perfect Men in CHRIST JESUS, and filled with all Fulneſs of GOD, you ſhall be tranſlated by Death to ſee him as he is, and to ſing Praiſe before the Throne with Angels and Archangels, Cherubims and Seraphims, and the general Aſſembly of the Firſt-born, whoſe Names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever and ever.</p>
