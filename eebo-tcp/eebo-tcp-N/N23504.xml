            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>A CHARACTER formed upon the principles of religion is the moſt honorable and uſeful. It compriſes all the virtues that recommend man to the peculiar notice of his MAKER, render him an ornament to ſociety, make him happy in a ſtate of ſocial connection in the preſent world, and glorious in immortality.</p>
            <p>SUCH a character was David, <hi>The anointed of the God of Jacob:</hi> and he inſiſts upon the indiſpenſable neceſſity of it in thoſe who rule over men. Nor does he offer merely his own private opinion reſpecting this important ſubject, for the Spirit of the LORD
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031126_0005_0FEBE3D81D60DFC0"/>
was with him—<hi>The GOD of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me,</hi> HE THAT RULETH OVER MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD.</p>
            <p>THE royal Prophet here points out, in a very brief and comprehenſive manner, the duty, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualifications of a civil ruler. Theſe words ought to be engraven in the heart of every ruler, and in the heart of every perſon in the choice of rulers; for while they direct the latter to whom they ought to give their ſuffrages, they point out to the former the character which they ſhould poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>IT is both pertinent and laudable, and muſt be conſidered ſo, by all good men, to enter on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buſineſs of legiſlation, by the preſentment of the rulers and officers of Government before the LORD in his ſacred courts, to hear the words of his law, and to ſupplicate his preſence and aid. We are happy that our civil Fathers have conſecrated the preſent time to theſe ſolemn duties of religion. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on which we are aſſembled, and the theme which I have choſen, will naturally lead me to make ſome remarks on government; delineate the character of a good ruler; exhibit the neceſſity of religion in civil adminiſtrations, and its happy effects in ſociety.</p>
            <p>MUTUAL advantage, at firſt induced men to form into ſocial compact, and produced towns, ſtates and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031126_0006_0FEBE3E07371FF88"/>
empires. To exiſt in this ſocial capacity, and ſecure life, property and happineſs, it was found neceſſary that they ſhould have ſome form of civil government. It is the will of GOD, that government ſhould exiſt among men. What particular form is no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignated, but every nation has a right to chooſe for itſelf, and adapt it to the views, feelings and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the people. One form may be beſt for one nation, and a different, for another. That form is beſt, which moſt effectually ſecures their rights and rational liberties.</p>
            <p>To the due adminiſtration of juſtice it is neceſſary that ſome ſhould be clothed with authority; without this, they will not be able to regulate the affairs of ſtate, and ſecure the good and peaceable, from the wanton abuſe of the wicked and licentious. Their power, it is true, they derive from the people, but when they have inveſted them with authority they ſhould pay due ſubmiſſion to, and place confidence in them.</p>
            <p>A RACE of rational beings, not connected by the parental or filial tie, not depraved, but perfectly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, it is probable would fall into ſome kind of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or civil connection. By forming into ſociety the collected gifts and graces of all would become the property and emolument of all; but without ſocial connection, they would be the property and profit
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031126_0007_0FEBE3E31850E250"/>
only of the perſon poſſeſſing them, and could not benefit the whole. Society cannot be formed, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, without certain regulations, or conſtitutional eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhments. Such a race of beings, as we before mentioned, could find no difficulty in forming into union, and conſtituting the ſocial tie. If their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and capacities were different, reaſon would plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead the ſuperior to the head, and the inferior to their reſpective places of ſubordination in the body. Or, if in regard to powers and capacities, all were on a par, then all would equally govern, and be equally ſubject. The good Angels are repreſented as having a kind of connection and order among them. The ſacred books ſpeak of Principalities and Powers, Thrones and Dominions; and the ſuperiority ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this neceſſarily ſuppoſes connection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. But be it as it may among good and holy beings, yet obviouſly among beings ſo deeply depraved and ſelfiſh as man, government is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary. Without government, it would be impoſſible to live in ſuch a world as ours. A ſtate of anarchy, without law and government, would be a ſtate of complete wretchedneſs.—Such are the fierce and ſavage luſts of men, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and life would conſtantly hang on uncertainty.

and his accountableneſs to Him for all his actions: and this will have a happy influence on his conduct and excite him to fidelity. It unfolds a glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, through JESUS CHRIST, to thoſe who are faithful to GOD in the truſt committed to them, and improve their talents aright: by which glorious hope the pious ruler is animated in his laborious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>IT humbles the pride of the human heart, teaches that ſalvation is only through the grace that is in JESUS, and lays proſtrate the hope of man from any diſtinguiſhed merit in himſelf; which muſt tend to inſpire the chriſtian ruler with an amiable humility, while raiſed to a ſeat of honor; prevent his exalting himſelf above his Brethren, and lording it over GOD'S heritage. It teaches the motives, by which they are to be influenced in all their deliberations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Influenced by ſuch a religion, the Ruler will conſult the good of the community, and will always live in the affections of a grateful people. He will have a humble dependence on GOD for wiſdom to conduct him. He will ſee his need of divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and be modeſt and unaſſuming. He will not croud himſelf into public notice by artifice, but wait until he is called by the voluntary ſuffrages of the people. Thoſe, who are beſt qualified to rule, will be leaſt ſolicitous to obtain an office. A ſenſe of the importance of a public truſt, and of having the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031126_0010_0FEBE3EFA3514280"/>
weight of public affairs devolve on them, forbids their aſpiring to rule. Perſuaded that the moſt refined enjoyments are to be found in the walks of domeſtic retirement, they will quit them for an elevated ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only when called by the united voice of their brethren, and conſtrained by a ſenſe of duty. There is no greater evidence of a perſon's unfitneſs for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic truſt than his ſeeking it by promoting faction. True merit does not ſeek public notice, and it reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly enters the field of action. The good ruler will therefore engage in public life, not to gratify his own ambition, conſult his own eaſe, or obtain the applauſe of men; but from a ſenſe of duty.</p>
            <p>WHEN clothed with authority, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that his adminiſtrations be conſiſtent with the will of GOD, and promotive of the public good. He governs for the whole, and conſults the advantage of ſociety. No perſonal or partial conſiderations will influence him to turn aſide from duty. Awed by the fear of GOD, and a ſenſe of his accountable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he purſues a ſteady courſe, nor is influenced by the adulations of friends or the clamours of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriots. He will always make it his endeavour to enact wiſe and ſalutary laws, which are eſſential to preſerve the peace and order of ſociety. Much wiſdom and integrity are neceſſary to direct the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in framing ſuch laws, and to preſerve him from the baleful influence of ſelfiſh and party motives. While
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031126_0011_0FEBE3F259473CB8"/>
the unjuſt aims to eſtabliſh ſuch laws as will beſt promote his own ſelfiſh ends, the juſt will conſult the good of his conſtituents. The ruler of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter will look, not merely to the emolument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, but he will ſeek the beſt good of the whole circle: like the parent of a numerous offspring, he has a tender regard for every member, feels intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their united proſperity, and will not ſacrifice the peace of the family, to gratify the capricious humours of a few.</p>
            <p>A RULER of this deſcription will not only enact laws which are founded on the principles of juſtice; but will take care that they be faithfully executed. The wiſeſt and beſt code of laws will be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a community, only ſo far as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a faithful execution. He will not only obey the laws himſelf, and recommend ſuch obedience to others, by his own example; but will uſe the power, with which he is veſted, to enforce obedience from the unruly. He will be a terror to thoſe who do evil, and while he puniſhes the guilty, he will praiſe and encourage thoſe who do well. Firm in the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs, not over-awed by popular clamour, he will ſteadily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the dictates of conſcience, knowing he has a Maſter in Heaven, to whom he muſt give an account. He will not ſacrifice truth and juſtice, though it iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in popular odium, and diſmiſſion from public
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031126_0012_0FEBE3F4649DA070"/>
ſervice. He will not puſillanimouſly ſhrink from duty, becauſe it is attended with difficulty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but courageouſly ſtem the torrent, until, over-borne by its impetuoſity, he is compelled to recede from danger. Influenced in all his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by the fear of GOD, he will be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prompted to a courſe of rectitude, than by all the adulations or cenſures of men.</p>
            <p>How contemptible muſt be that ruler, who has no opinion of his own, but is blown about by every gale of temptation, and complies with the caprices of evil and deſigning men! Firmneſs and ſtability are very eſſential qualities in a good ruler. But, let his talents and abilities be ever ſo great, and his political acquirements ever ſo conſpicuous, he will be but poorly qualified for a ſtation of eminence, who has no reverence for GOD, and regard for his religion. His honeſty and integrity muſt be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is to be feared he would neglect the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of thoſe, whoſe proſperity he ſhould ſeek, and ſport with the liberties of the people.</p>
            <p>MEN devoid of every principle of religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by the fear of GOD, and unreſtrained by his commands, cannot reaſonably expect to be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the lives and liberties of the people; nor that they will countenance their vices. They cannot put confidence in them; for there is, there indeed can
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031126_0013_0FEBE3F69EB4F640"/>
be no reaſon to think, that they will regard men, who have no fear of GOD before their eyes. It is therefore neceſſary that the fear of GOD be fixed in the heart of him, who rules over men, and that he be influenced by it in all his conduct.</p>
            <p>RULERS ſhould not only be concerned that their adminiſtrations be good, but muſt themſelves obey thoſe laws, which they enjoin on others. If the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the laws be the firſt to break them, they have every reaſon to expect that many will follow their example.</p>
            <p>RULERS are ſet for an example to the people.—They are to reprove thoſe who violate the laws, and encourage thoſe who keep them, by exhibiting a pattern for their imitation, not only in civil, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts; and, in this way, be nurſing Fathers to the Church. The example of thoſe, who are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to office, will always, in a greater or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, influence ſociety. The people look to them, and form their manners, their dreſs and behaviour; alſo their ſentiments and practice, in a political and a religious view. The body of the people, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, receive their moral and political complection from thoſe, who are in eminent ſtations. The rulers of Iſrael formed the manners of the nation. When they were wicked and corrupt, general wickedneſs
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031126_0014_0FEBE3F90F4852B0"/>
and idolatry prevailed. Thus, in the time of our Saviour, when the prejudices of the people run high, they enquired, whether, <hi>Any of the Rulers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believed on him;</hi> intimating, that the conduct of their rulers, would influence their minds to receive, or reject the Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>So it has been, in ſome ſenſe, with other nations, and ſo it is with our own. It is natural to look to thoſe of ſuperior wiſdom and eminence, for example. And though ſome, from perverſeneſs of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt to all ſenſe of honor and ſhame, may totally diſregard their good example, and others, awed by the fear of GOD, may altogether avoid their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet the general body of the people are more or leſs influenced by them to good or evil.</p>
            <p>IT is of high importance, therefore, that rulers be men of virtue; and that they reverence religion and its inſtitutions. It is in their power to do much good, or evil: the preſent proſperity, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting welfare of multitudes may much depend on their conduct.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED to the laſt thing propoſed; which was to exhibit the neceſſity of religion in civil adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations, and its happy effects in ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:031126_0015_0FEBE3FB4643AEF8"/>
RELIGION is neceſſary to the happineſs of ſociety; and without it, civil government cannot ſubſiſt.—Man is endowed by his great author with ſocial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but ſo great is his depravity, that ſelfiſhneſs predominates in his heart, and he has luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which, if under no controul, would fill the world with vice, and its attendant miſery. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, by which he is raiſed in the ſcale of being, make him more ſubtle in planning, and aſſiſt him in effecting his wicked and deſtructive purpoſes. If the mind be impreſſed with no idea of a GOD, every object of purſuit may be contemplated with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme regard; and the ſelfiſh would gain a compleat aſcendency over the benevolent affections.</p>
            <p>THE aids of religious principles, in union with the powers and faculties natural to man, are inſufficient to reſtrain his irregular and miſchievous paſſions; and the latter without the former muſt be much more ſo.</p>
            <p>THE light of nature indeed teaches the exiſtence of a GOD, and an all-wiſe and glorious providence, when her dictates are ſuitably attended to; and when they are not, and men boaſt themſelves as men of reaſon, and through ſophiſtry and ridicule attempt to ſubvert religion in the hearts of men, the "Age of reaſon" becomes an age of more than Egyptian darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:031126_0016_0FEBE3FDEA657848"/>
To guard men againſt the luſts and furious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of each other, civil eſtabliſhments, always known to be inſufficient, have been connected with, or have had recourſe to the aids of religion.</p>
            <p>WHAT could be the origin of ſociety without this connecting bond? And in ſocieties formed, nothing can ſo powerfully induce the ruler to a wiſe admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration of government, and a faithful diſcharge of all the duties of his office, or ſo enſure the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſubjects.</p>
            <p>A RULER cannot be ſuppoſed to loſe the feelings of the man by an elevation to office; he has the ſame paſſions to govern, and luſts to conquer; and the government and victory of theſe, is rendered more difficult, by the temptations which are encreaſed, and the opportunities for gratifying them, which are multiplied, by the ſituation in which he is placed. There are many, perhaps, whoſe conduct is inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the ſtations of private life, who, if they ſwayed a ſceptre, would become Neroes. But, how much ſoever warmed with true patriotiſm the hearts of civil rulers may be, they cannot calculate upon the intereſt of their ſubjects, in the righteous adminiſtration of their legal power. With reſpect to ſecret crimes, and crimes where numbers and power are enliſted on the ſide of the tranſgreſſors, coercion will be weak, and government of no avail. Set aſide the influence of religious principle, and the members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031126_0017_0FEBE4001C479408"/>
could have no ground for rational truſt and confidence in each other. No oath could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in ſuch a ſociety; they would live each moment in a ſtate of alarm; government would loſe all its energy; ſociety would be full of diſorder, confuſion and every evil work; the voice of joy would not be heard; the name of happineſs would not be known; and being itſelf would be a curſe.</p>
            <p>IF the being and attributes of the Moſt High, an all-wiſe, powerful and holy providence, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of eternity are acknowledged, the ſtate of things is ſurpriſingly altered for the better. Rulers may exerciſe the powers with which they are inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the people, whom they govern, will obey their laws, and feel that their guardian care is a ſource of mutual happineſs to the ſociety of which they are members.</p>
            <p>THOSE who are cordially diſpoſed to lead quiet and holy lives, cannot fail to realize, that they, their intereſt and happineſs, are rendered as ſafe, as this ſtate, and the exiſting circumſtances with which they are ſurrounded, can poſſibly make them. And, on the other hand, men of bad hearts and evil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not be able to run into thoſe exceſſes, to which their unbridled luſts would lead them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counteracting the dictates of conſcience; burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſunder the ſtrongeſt bands of ſociety, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031126_0018_0FEBE3C221434628"/>
or giving up life, property, and all that is worth living for.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred books teach us the being and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of GOD. They exhibit his Majeſty, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Juſtice, his Goodneſs, his Mercy, and his Truth: His Omnipreſence, his Spirituality, his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, his Supreme and unlimited Dominion; his readineſs to pardon, and his determination to reward the righteous, and puniſh the wicked and impenitent.</p>
            <p>THEY alſo bring us acquainted with our nature, ſtate and circumſtances; with our miſery and the mode of our cure; they point out our duty in every ſituation, in every relation, and in all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of human life; they encourage our rational hopes, and animate us by the moſt ſublime motives.</p>
            <p>ALL other things, which are deemed neceſſary to our peace, in the connected and ſocial ſtate, will not avail without this. No natural principles, nor the beſt forms of government, will be ſufficient without the conducting guidance, and powerful energy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This clearly ſhews, that the civil ruler is to be conſidered as GOD'S miniſter, and, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ought to yield obedience to good and ſalutary laws, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>THE beauty of the Chriſtian ſyſtem is exhibited, and its advantages to connected minds, in many and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031126_0019_0FEBE407971AEEA8"/>
various reſpects. It purifies the heart and amends the life. It refines, ennobles and exalts the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When the civil order is broken in upon by the licentious and diſorderly part of ſociety, when men of weak heads and diſhoneſt hearts officiouſly attempt to guide the affairs of State, and to arraign, at their bar, the well tried and choſen patriots of the commonwealth, our religion commands them to ſtudy the things which make for peace, to ſubmit to good government as the ordinance of GOD, and to obey magiſtrates as his miniſters to them for good. It enjoins patriotiſm as a common duty; and whatſoever we would that others ſhould do unto us that we do the ſame to them—and extend a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous benevolence to the whole race of man.</p>
            <p>THe malevolent paſſions and corrupt feelings of depraved nature, if unreſtrained, would predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate over the better principles, the ſocial and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſpoſitions of man; and involve ſociety, in calamities, too many to enumerate, and too horrible to think upon.</p>
            <p>THE religion of JESUS rectifies the ſoil of the heart; eradicates thoſe evil diſpoſitions which have been cultured there; plucks up every plant which his good hand hath not planted; reſtrains the paſſions, by bringing them under its happy dominion; and fills ſociety with tranquility and order.</p>
            <p>

IT cultivates in the minds of men, the pureſt and the ſublimeſt principles of virtue. It reclaims them from all thoſe paths of iniquity, in which, through the ſolicitations of the wicked, and the allurements of falſe honor and worldly pleaſure, they may have wandered; and makes them good men, and uſeful members of the community. It ſecures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the intereſts of government and the proſperity of its ſubjects. It directs rulers and people to the duties, which are peculiar to their reſpective places; and by ſetting before them the moſt glorious motives, ſweetly conſtrains and allures to the diſcharge of them. It promotes peace; it breathes benevolence; it cheriſhes the kind and ſocial affections, and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the morals of mankind. It prohibits every thing that is injurious to our happineſs, or the intereſts of thoſe who are about us. When all the members of a community are under its influence, and conduct agreeably to its requirements, they form the moſt beautiful and happy ſociety: the voice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, fraud and licentiouſneſs will not be heard in the ſtreets; iniquity will ſtop its mouth and virtue triumph. Society is happy in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as religion flouriſhes. But religion has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nobler in its view and tendency than the civil governments of the world; it looks forward into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet it is as friendly to the happineſs of men, in the preſent ſtate, as if it embraced no other object. It is a diſhonorable idea of religion, and degrading

            <p>WE have no reaſon to think, from any thing we can find in the ſacred books, that our bleſſed LORD deſigned to intermeddle with, or, in any reſpects, change the civil eſtabliſhments of mankind. His kingdom, he expreſsly tells us, <hi>is not of this world.</hi> He ſuffered Princes and Potentates to remain where they were; and left men to decide all matters of controverſy with reſpect to them, by the principles of reaſon and their civil laws or forms of government. He inculcated leſſons of obedience to them; and wrought a miracle to pay tribute, when he knew that he ſhould have been excuſed.</p>
            <p>THE religion of JESUS is replete with the wiſeſt maxims of civil polity, and inculcates them by the moſt inviting rewards, and the moſt dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To ſecure the favor of the Moſt High is to render to ſociety the moſt eſſential advantage. They who rule for GOD, who protect his Church, who are animated by his religion, and exemplify in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic adminiſtrations, and in the private walks of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic retirement, all the virtues of the Chriſtian, and they only, can govern with ſafety to themſelves, and advantage to their conſtituents.

religion will flouriſh. This will make them honorable and reſpectable to themſelves: It will encircle them with a glory, which the breath of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals will not be able to take away; and raiſe them to ſeats of immortal honor.</p>
            <p>CIVIL rulers are the guardians of the people; they will not ſeparate the public weal from their own private happineſs, nor feel ſatisfied with their labors, unleſs they are directed to the advantage of the community. They will derive the higheſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the adminiſtrations, which ſecure to thoſe under their charge their rights and liberties, civil and ſacred.</p>

            <p>THE ſocial intereſt is a vain and wild fancy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out religion. Let religion, and the virtues which it inculcates be baniſhed, and the baſes of public order and private tranquility are at once ſubverted; the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character loſes its dignity; and has nothing to recommend it above the herd of the foreſt.</p>
            <p>NOTHING can leſſen the beauty, obſcure the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or tarniſh the glory of that morality, which the goſpel inculcates. To conform to this, he who is called to the arduous duty of ruling over MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD. Parents muſt be wiſely tender and indulgent towards their children, and children muſt be obedient to their parents. Maſters muſt be gentle, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants diligent. Miniſters muſt be watchful, and the people to whom they miniſter muſt take heed how they receive and hear, and hold faſt and repent. It teaches all, in whatſoever ſtate we are, to be content, to be grateful for every enjoyment, and ſubmiſſive under all the ſorrows of human life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give our hearts to him who hath made, ſuſtained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us; and keep ourſelves unſpotted from the world.</p>

IF the laws of religion be viewed in their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, extent, and tendency, reaſon and equity will be found their baſis. And, if he, who is raiſed to the ſeat of power, pays no regard to this morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he has acquired only a fancied elevation, a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pre-eminence above his brethren. But he, who is ſincere and diligent in his endeavours faithfully to diſcharge the duties of his ſtation, hath an honor, which enmity and malevolence, with all their poiſon, will not be able to blacken.</p>
            <p>IN the ſocial and public, as well as private life, there is an inſeparable connexion between holineſs and happineſs; between ſin and miſery. From the attributes of the Moſt High and merciful Ruler, the common dealings of his Providence, and the declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of his holy word, we may conclude, that he will bleſs, defend and encreaſe a virtuous nation, and will leave thoſe, who are wicked to ſuffer the fatal conſequences of their own wickedneſs. The hiſtory of the world is full of examples, that in proportion as public virtue, and an attention to the duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have encreaſed or diminiſhed; ſo the wealth, credit and powers of all ſtates and empires have flouriſhed or decayed. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is a reproach to any people.</hi> Rulers, therefore, who are the miniſters of GOD, are in duty bound to lend their aid to promote religion.</p>

IF ſuch as we have deſcribed be the character of the good Ruler, and ſuch the happy conſequences of his adminiſtrations; it is highly important that none but men of this deſcription be inveſted with authority.</p>
            <p>THE duty, the intereſt and happineſs of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple require, that they examine the characters of thoſe, who are propoſed as candidates for places of public truſt. It is important that they revere the laws of religion; that its ſublime principles influence their hearts, and its pure morals be exhibited in their lives. The wicked and profligate, who ridicule or diſbelieve the religion of the Bible, who ſpeak diſreſpectfully of its ſacred truths, cannot ſafely be entruſted with the liberties of the people: they may greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, wantonly ſport with the lives of their ſubjects, unjuſtly wreſt from them the property, which they have earned by their honeſt and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious labors, and riot upon the ſpoils of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>OUR ſubject teaches not only the importance of good rulers, but the duty and neceſſity of treating them with reſpect and ſubmiſſion. They ſteadily purſue the peace and proſperity of their country; encourage a regard for the precepts of religion, which have the beſt influence on its happineſs, and enforce them by a correſponding example.

ALL unauthorized ſocieties, formed to prevent the execution of the laws and ſubvert government, are not only injurious to the intereſts of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but contrary to the laws of religion.</p>
            <p>THERE ever have been unprincipled men, who were impatient under the reſtraints of government, who have ſought their own private emolument at the expence of the happineſs of their country. When ſuch men have the addreſs to procure an election to office, they never fail to excite a factious and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpirit. <hi>When the wicked bear rule the people mourn.</hi> The ſuſpicions and jealouſies of reſtleſs and uneaſy ſpirits always endanger the peace and welfare of a people. Rulers ſhould be allowed to exerciſe their own judgments, in the regulation of all affairs, which come under their cognizance. People are not to be unreaſonable in their expectations from them. They cannot in all matters pleaſe all. They muſt conſult the good of the whole, not their own private intereſts or the intereſts, of a few.</p>
            <p>THE happineſs of a people, under whatever form of government, depends on a wiſe adminiſtration.—Under a government in many reſpects defective, if it be well adminiſtered, they may be happy. And the beſt and moſt perfect ſyſtem, with weak or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rulers, cannot fail to make them miſerable: but a good government and adminiſtration will enſure the moſt important and laſting benefits.</p>

THOSE, who rule in the fear of GOD, will make it their ſtudy, to promote the happineſs of the people, and approve themſelves to GOD their Judge. They act under th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> notice of his all-ſeeing eye, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that to Him they muſt render a ſtrict and impartial account of all their conduct. Happy is the people, who have ſuch rulers, yea; <hi>Happy is that people whoſe</hi> GOD <hi>is the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>I AM happy in addreſſing thoſe who, I truſt, feel the importance of the obſervations which have been made. I feel a pleaſing confidence while, I hope, I am repreſenting thoſe truths which are agreeable to this honorable body, and that they will ſtrive to have them generally practiſed.</p>
            <p>OUR civil Fathers, aſſembled this day before the LORD, have deſerved much of their country, for their decided and firm conduct in the ſupport of order.</p>
            <p>HIS Excellency the Governor, the Honorable the Council, Senate, and Houſe of Repreſentatives have proved themſelves lovers of their country, its peace and proſperity: and, we doubt not, will continue their laudable exertions, and, with unremitting dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and fidelity, purſue the public good.</p>
            <p>RELIGION and learning are neceſſary to promote and enſure our beſt intereſts. They will, therefore, we truſt, do all they can to encourage religion, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031126_0028_0FEBE4244F0B8060"/>
be an example to the people, by attending on its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and exhibiting its virtues.</p>
            <p>LITERATURE and religion ever go hand in hand, and are the beſt friends to order, liberty and repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government. The civil Fathers of this State will, therefore, conſider it as their duty, to reach out the foſtering hand, and be nurſing fathers to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and flouriſhing Univerſity, and to our Acad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies and Schools of learning; that the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be trained in the moral and divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our religion, to be pillars and bleſſings in the Church, and fill the various ſeats of government, when this honorable legiſlature ſhall ſleep in the duſt.</p>
            <p>MY Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry can do much to ſtrengthen the hands of the civil rulers, by teaching and enforcing the holy religion of JESUS, which inculcates peace, order, and a due ſubmiſſion to the conſtituted authorities of government. Our profeſſion excludes us from an active part in the civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il and political concerns of ſtate. Nor do we wiſh to intermeddle with them, any farther than the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of religion require. But the religion we preach teaches men to <hi>Render to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute; cuſtom, to whom cuſtom; fear, to whom fear; and honor, to whom honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are united with the Rulers of this State in conducting this people, as Aaron was with Moſes,

Called to the arduous and important du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of publiſhing and enforcing a religion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt morality, and moſt glorious tendency; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on which our perſonal, ſocial, and political happineſs ſo eſſentially depends; let us look to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eat of mercy, and, with fervent importunity, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a double portion of GOD's Holy Spirit to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us to a ſuitable zeal for his divine honor; to enable us to follow the example of the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; to affect our hearts with the religion of which we are the meſſengers to others, that we may ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly announce the declarations of his ſacred word; to bleſs our miniſtrations with a glorious ſucceſs, that when we have preached to others we may not be caſt away; but, having turned many to righteouſneſs, ſhine as ſtars forever in the kingdom of our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>WE are happy, my fellow-citizens, that we have a conſtitution of our own choice, excellently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to ſecure to us our invaluable liberties. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its operation we have enjoyed much civil happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſperity. Our rulers are from ourſelves, and accountable for all their public meaſures. Let the beſt men for capacity, approved virtue, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the liberties of their country be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rule: Let us keep a reaſonable eye on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meaſures: But let a ſpirit of jealouſy, diſcontent and murmuring againſt government be baniſhed
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031126_0030_0FEBE42946801000"/>
from among us, as unchriſtian and unmanly, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to our peace, and provoking to Heaven.</p>
            <p>WHILE many of the European nations are involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the deſolating calamities of war; their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance waſted, or wreſted from them by the hand of violence; their houſes plundered, and their fields drenched in human blood; the peaceful olive ſpreads its branches over our favored land, and we ſit quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under our own vines.</p>
            <p>WE have lately ſeen the clouds gathering over our heads, threatening to ſubvert our EXCELEENT CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITUTION, and deluge our infant and highly favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Republic. And we dreaded the violence of the impending ſtorm. But theſe clouds are diſſipated; our atmoſphere has, at length, almoſt regained its ſerenity; and we have reaſon to rejoice, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of thoſe, who raiſed it, were not able to effect their deſigns.</p>
            <p>WHAT language is ſufficient to expreſs the regret, which the wiſe and good have felt at the virulent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, which has been poured forth from ambitious, but diſappointed demagogues, againſt our beloved Waſhington, the chriſtian hero and ſtateſman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A grateful people will remember his deeds of valour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his wiſe and prudent counſels; rehearſe them to their children, who will early learn to liſp his praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and impartial hiſtory will hand them down to

poſterity; while thoſe, who have attempted to wound his reputation, will be remembered to their reproach, or buried in everlaſting oblivion. Long will Waſhington live in our hearts. Long may he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to bleſs his country; and may GOD think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him <hi>for good, according to all that he hath done for this people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FINALLY: Let us all remember that this tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry world is ſubject to conſtant viciſſitude, and was never deſigned for our continuing abode. There is another and better country, where the bleſſed JESUS determines to bring his choſen and peculiar friends. There order and peace forever reign, in the city of our GOD.</p>
            <p>LET us all aſpire after this heavenly inheritance, by a conformity of temper and conduct to the great pattern of holineſs. Magiſtrates, Judges, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, fear the LORD, and ſerve him with fidelity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that you will ere long meet with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled univerſe before the judgment ſeat of CHRIST, to give an account how you have ruled, and obeyed.</p>
            <p>IN that ſolemn day, may we all hear from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler and Judge of the Univerſe, WELL DONE, GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANTS; ENTER INTO THE JOY OF YOUR LORD.</p>
