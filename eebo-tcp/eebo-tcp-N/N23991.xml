            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I KINGS, viii. CHAP. 27 VERSE.</bibl>
               <q>BUT WILL GOD INDEED DWELL ON THE EARTH? BEHOLD THE HEAVEN AND HEAVEN OF HEAVENS CANNOT CONTAIN THEE, HOW MUCH LESS THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILDED?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE is no one of the divine perfections, on which we can ſeriouſly reflect without being loſt in wonder.</p>
            <p>WHEN we caſt our thoughts back to the ages preceding the creation, and reflect that the ſpace which is now occupied by this earth, by theſe heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and by the univerſe itſelf, was then a mighty void;—that there was not a ſingle particle of matter, or a ray of created light, in all this boundleſs extent, we are amazed at beholding this material ſyſtem riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtantaneouſly into life. That creation, of which we can entertain any tolerable conception, is nothing more than the change of one thing into another.—When a tree, or a plant is produced, certain particles from the earth, and air are differently arranged, placed in a new relation to each other, and thus aſſume a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031740_0005_0FEE2BAAC6CBFD80"/>
new appearance. Yet ſtrictly ſpeaking, there is in all this no new creation; matter only aſſumes a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form:—all the materials were provided before. But there was a time, when there were no materials in the univerſe; and when all the matter, which is now in exiſtence, was created from nothing. This ſurpaſſes our comprehenſion, and the thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds us. Our aſtoniſhment ſtill increaſes when we are told that all this took place, without any thing like that which is called <hi>labour,</hi> or <hi>exertion.</hi> God <hi>ſpake</hi> and it was <hi>done.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> and <hi>there was light. By the word of the Lord, were the heavens made, and all the hoſts of them, by the breath of his mouth. He ſhaketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble: He commandeth the ſun, and it riſeth not, and ſealeth up the ſtars; he alone ſtretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE eternity of God is equally incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with his power.—To every object which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>there is a ſeaſon and a time.</hi> A time for its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, duration, and deſtruction. It can be ſaid of none of the objects, which fall within our view, that it has been even ſo forever, there was a time wh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they were not. But the ſupreme God is the <hi>King eternal and immortal;</hi> he is <hi>without beginning of days, or end of life.</hi> Look back to the time when he firſt exerted his creating power: fix this period as far diſtant as you pleaſe. Call in, to the aid of your imagination, all the leaves that are ſhaken in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031740_0006_0FEE2BAFD811AEA0"/>
wind, all the grains of duſt, that compoſe this globe; all the drops of water which the ocean contains: and all the drops of water which the ocean contains: and all the particles of light which conſtantly, and in every direction, emanate from the ſun; let each leaf, each grain, each drop of water, and each ray of light be put to ſignify an hundred years.—Then ſay that as many years have elapſed, ſince God began to create, as are ſignified by this inconceivable multitude of leaves, particles, &amp;c. Let this be conſidered as one Era, in the divine exiſtence. Imagine that the commencement of it is a point, from which you are to begin a new calculation: and enquire how long the Deity exiſted before he began to create.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE, again, that each one of theſe drops, grains, &amp;c. is diviſible into a thouſand parts, and that each of theſe parts, was placed for a thouſand years. Say, then, that God had exiſted before he began to create for a duration, conſiſting of as many years as all theſe parts expreſs.—This ſecond Era will be a million times longer than the firſt, but ſtill it bears no proportion to the divine exiſtence.—We loſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the calculation, and approach no nigher to the divine origin. There never was a time when God did not exiſt. <hi>He inhabiteth eternity. He is and was, and is to come.</hi> He alone can ſay, <hi>Before me there was no God, neither ſhall there be any after me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is inconceiveable by us, how any being ſhould be poſſeſſed of perfect independence. Every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031740_0007_0FEE2BB42BF1F060"/>
which we ſee, depends on ſome other for its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, its properties, and its duration. All the objects which we ſee are the effects of ſome cauſe. When we obſerve a well cultivated field, we know that it was not the effect of chance; we know that ſome intelligent agent has been employed. When we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a building, we know that it muſt have been the effect of human art. <hi>For every houſe is builded by ſome man.</hi> We know likewiſe, that there was a time, when this world did not exiſt; that it is the effect of ſome cauſe, and dependent on ſome ſuperior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We next contemplate this being, and can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reſtrained from proceeding in our uſual mode, and from enquiring into the origin of the Deity. But reflecting on the abſurdity of ſuch an enquiry, we are obliged to adopt this concluſion, that there is a being, who is uncreated and independent, although we are utterly unable to conceive how ſuch a thing is poſſible. He alone can adopt the following lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, "<hi>I am, and there is none elſe beſide. Before the day was, I was." "If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fulneſs thereof."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we proceed to conſider that attribute of God, which is ſpoken of in the text, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, or omnipreſence. "Will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven, even the heaven of heavens cannot contain him."</p>
            <p>THIS thought occurred to the mind of King Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omon in the midſt of the prayer, which he made at
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031740_0008_0FEE75B2F7D9E5B8"/>
the dedication of the temple:—It is a conſideration, which ought to impreſs our minds while engaged in the ſolemnities of this day.</p>
            <p>WE are ſo much converſant with material objects; we have ſo frequently heard it ſaid that no body can be in two places at the ſame time; we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeeing bodies move from one place to another, as that it is impoſſible for us to form any juſt ideas of a being who is incapable of moving from place to place, but is equally preſent in all places. All the juſt conceptions, which we can poſſibly have of the divine immenſity, is by comparing our ideas of God, with the ideas, which we entertain of finite objects. As it is much eaſier to tell what the Deity is not, than what he is; ſo it is much more practicable to ſhow what lines will not circumſcribe him, than to form any right notions of the real extent of his preſence. We meaſure ſpace by the diſtances at which different material objects are placed from each other. We ſay that all that ſpace over which our eyes can glance, does not confine the Deity: that he is preſent, not only in every place on this globe, but that he is equally ſo, at all the bodies which ſurround this globe: that the moſt diſtant ſtar, which can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned is as really in the divine preſence as we are. Solomon himſelf could form no other conception of the divine greatneſs, but what he obtained by ſuch compariſons. <hi>Heaven, and the heaven of heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain thee.</hi> This was acknowledging himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031740_0009_0FEE2BBAEC6DEE90"/>
to comprehend the omnipreſence of God. For he has here taken into view the greateſt expanſe which can be defined, and of which he had any idea, and yet he aſſerts that this cannot circumſcribe the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God.</p>
            <p>"THE Hebrews" we are told "acknowledged three heavens, the firſt, the aerial heavens, in which the birds fly, the winds blow, and the ſhowers are formed: the ſecond, the firmament, in which the ſtars are placed: the third, the heaven of heavens, the reſidence of the Almighty, and abode of ſaints and angels." Theſe, doubtleſs, were the ideas, which the ſacred writers entertained on the ſubject. They frequently ſpeak of theſe different heavens.</p>
            <p>WHEN it is ſaid, <hi>There is a multitude of water in the heavens: The rain cometh down, and the ſnow from heaven: Can the heavens give ſhowers,</hi> &amp;c. reſpect is evidently had to the <hi>firſt,</hi> or aerial heaven.</p>
            <p>WHEN it is ſaid, <hi>The ſtars ſhall fall from heaven. The heavens declare the glory of the Lord, and the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament ſhoweth his handy work: By his ſpirit, he has garniſhed the heavens,</hi> &amp;c. the inſpired writers plainly allude to the <hi>ſecond</hi> heaven, or the region of the ſtars.</p>
            <p>BUT God is ſaid by the Pſalmiſt to have <hi>ſet his glory above the heavens:</hi> i. e. above the firſt, and ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond heavens; which exactly comports with the ideas
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031740_0010_0FEE2BBC75EAD758"/>
which the Jews entertained of the place of the divine reſidence—St. Paul ſpeaks of <hi>the throne of majeſty in the heavens:</hi>—of being <hi>caught up to the third heaven.</hi> Stephen ſaw <hi>the heavens opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God. God is ſaid to ride upon the heaven of heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſee then what the author of our text meant by <hi>the heaven of heavens:</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ſpace which lies far beyond all material objects, ſuch as the moon, the ſun, and the fixed ſtars:—the ſpace, in which, he ſuppoſed the angels were convened; and where the Almighty dwelt in light inacceſſible and full of glory, which no mortal eye hath ſeen or can ſee. This, he confeſſes, cannot confine the Almighty.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE that the fartheſt ſtar, which we ever behold, is placed at a diſtance, expreſſed in miles, by millions multiplied by millions. Let an angel be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at this ſtar, and from thence, commence his flight unto boundleſs ſpace; let him proceed with the greateſt conceivable velocity, and let his flight be continued through the greateſt duration of which the mind can form any idea, he is yet ſurrounded by God; he has not found the place where God is not preſent. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God: cauſt thou know the Almighty to perfection? Whither ſhall I go from thy ſpirit: or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? Thy preſence filleth heaven and earth. But the heaven, and the heaven of heavens can not contain thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:031740_0011_0FEE2BC8B7E48090"/>
IN contemplation of the divine immenſity, it is natural to enquire, with the devout King of Iſrael, <hi>Will God indeed dwell on the earth?</hi> If God is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in all places, and fills the Univerſe, with what propriety can it be ſaid, that He is peculiarly preſent in any particular place? Yet the ſcriptures ſpeak of God's being in Heaven—of his appearing on mount Sinai—of his appearing to Moſes in the burning buſh;—of his being in the Jewiſh temple, and in all religious aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>IN anſwer to this, we obſerve firſt, that by ſuch repreſentations, cannot be meant that God is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, more preſent in one place than another; he cannot, if we may uſe the expreſſion, contract him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into one place, and withdraw himſelf from other places. Accordingly, the ſcriptures teach us, that he is as really preſent in the caves of a mountain, in the bowels of the earth, or in the bottom of the ſea, as in the heavens above. <hi>Do I not fill heaven and earth, ſaith the Lord? Though they dig into hell, thence ſhall mine hand take them: though they climb up into heaven, thence will I bring them down: though they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the top of Carmel, I will ſearch them out thence: and though they be hid in the bottom of the ſea, thence will I command the ſerpent, and he ſhall bite them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD is as really preſent in the humble cottage, or the open field; as in the ſplendid palace, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic temple.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:031740_0012_0FEE2BCE283AA908"/>
BUT in the ſtile of ſcripture, the Deity is ſaid to be preſent in all places, where he makes any peculiar manifeſtations of himſelf; where he places ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and produces ſuch appearances and effects, as give to beholders, the moſt lively conceptions of his energy and attributes.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred writers repreſent him, as ſitting on a throne in the heavens;—as being ſurrounded by ten thouſand times ten thouſand glorified ſpirits.</p>
            <p>THERE is, probably, ſomewhere, in the univerſe, a place where God makes a moſt clear, and glorious diſcovery of his nature and perfections; where he condeſcends to be viewed, not as by us, through the medium of <hi>clouds and darkneſs;</hi> but in a light too reſplendent for our preſent organs of viſion; a light, which no mortal can approach unto. And as the pureſt and moſt exalted beings would not only be moſt deſirous of acquainting themſelves with the divine nature; but would likewiſe be more than all others prepared for enjoying the cleareſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, it is extremely reaſonable to ſuppoſe that this glorious place is filled with an innumerable multitude of ſaints and angels.</p>
            <p>THIS repreſentation will anſwer to the very fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urative deſcription which Micaiah gave of the objects which he ſaw in viſion. <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting on a throne and all the hoſts of heaven ſtanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:031740_0013_0FEE2BD0E8D2CA58"/>
WE are not to ſuppoſe, however, that the Deity is really viſible, in any place. He is a ſpirit, and no one hath ſeen God, at any time.</p>
            <p>THE Almighty is ſaid to have appeared to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the buſh: yet we cannot imagine that God was any more in that burning buſh, than in any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place whatever. But as the buſh was on fire, without being conſumed, there was a very evident and ſtriking proof of the divine energy.</p>
            <p>GOD is ſaid to have appeared, when, in order to impreſs the minds of men, with a ſenſe of his power and preſence, he has cauſed ſome remarkable lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous appearance. This was the caſe, when <hi>Moſes and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and ſeventy of the elders ſaw the God of Iſrael: when there was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of ſapphire: and as it were the body of heaven in his clearneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the ancient tabernacle, and in the Jewiſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there was the Shekinah, or a viſible light in teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the divine preſence. Before Solomon made his dedication prayer, <hi>It came to paſs that when the prieſts had come out of the holy place, the cloud filled the houſe of the Lord: So that the prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter becauſe of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this God was in reality, no more preſent in Solomon's temple, than he now is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031740_0014_0FED382DA832E4C0"/>
in chriſtian churches. But ſuch an appearance as was then made, exactly correſponded with the genius of the Moſaic diſpenſation. Every thing, under this economy was calculated to ſtrike upon the ſenſes. They had a variety of rites, forms and ceremonies. A pure, ſimple, and ſpiritual worſhip, would have been ill received by a people, ignorant, groſs, and uncultivated. They needed ſomething of external pomp, to captivate their attention.</p>
            <p>BUT it is very evident from the prayer of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that he expected the Deity to make ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſtation of himſelf in that temple, ſeparate from that glorious light, which filled the holy place. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that religious worſhip there performed, would be more acceptable to God, than if it were performed in a different place; and that God would be more likely to meet his people and anſwer their prayers when they aſſembled at the temple for public worſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ip, than if they wholly neglected divine ſervice, or convened in a different temple. He believed that the <hi>eyes of God would be open towards that houſe, day and night.</hi> For when he intercedes with God, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his people, it is on condition that they ſhould pray, either in, or towards that houſe. <hi>When thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Iſrael be ſmitten down before the enemy, becauſe they have ſinned againſt thee, and ſhall turn again, and confeſs thy name, and pray, and make ſupplication unto the Lord,</hi> in this houſe; <hi>then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the ſin of thy people Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:031740_0015_0FEE2BFB764C48A8"/>
IN this ſenſe, God is now preſent in all chriſtian churches. Public worſhip, is an inſtitution which he has ordained; and we cannot doubt his readineſs to bleſs the means which are of his own appointment. The ſame encouragement is given to religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, under both diſpenſations. To the Iſraelites it was ſaid, <hi>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and bleſs thee.</hi> To the diſciples of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, it is ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are met together in my name, there will I be in the midſt of them and bleſs them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRISTIAN temples, and chriſtian worſhip are extremely different from the temple and worſhip of the Jews. Chriſtianity conſiders its votaries as ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual. Jewdaiſm addreſſed itſelf much more the ſenſes. It was <hi>the law of a carnal commandment.</hi> Their religious ſervice <hi>ſtood in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and carnal ordinances, impoſed on them until the time of reformation.</hi> This time of reformation came, when chriſtianity was firſt introduced, and the pomp and ceremony of the Moſaic eſtabliſhment were done away. <hi>The law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</hi> Accordingly, our Saviour declares, <hi>The hour cometh, when ye ſhall, neither in the mountain of Samaria, nor yet at Jeruſalem, worſhip the Father.</hi> He faith further, <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father, in ſpirit and in truth: for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi>

IN chriſtian churches, there is no Shekinah, or viſible token of the divine preſence; yet Chriſt has promiſed to be in the midſt of his worſhipping ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>IN chriſtian churches, there is no ſacred fire, no place anſwering to the Jewiſh holy of holies, no incenſe evening and morning ſacrifices or ſprinkling of blood. Our prayers are to aſcend up inſtead of incenſe, and the lifting up of our hands to be as the <hi>evening ſacrifice.</hi> The way into the holy of holies is how laid open; even that new and living way which Chriſt has conſecrated through the veil.</p>
            <p>IN the chriſtian church, there is no ſucceſſion of high prieſts who are to offer, firſt for their own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people: But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the high prieſt over the houſe of God: He has appeared to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf: and by one offering he has forever perfected them that are ſanctified. Let us, therefore, draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS God manifeſted himſelf in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Jewiſh worſhippers in the temple, ſo has he, in all ages of the goſpel, to chriſtian aſſemblies. The aſtoniſhing ſpread of chriſtianity ſoon after our Saviour's reſurrection, was brought about, under
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031740_0017_0FEE75B8D84057F0"/>
God, by public preaching. It was by the preaching of Peter, that three thouſand ſouls were, in one day, added to the church. It was by the preaching of Paul and Barnabas in the ſynagogue, that <hi>a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude both of the Jews and Greeks believed</hi> in Iconium. It was becauſe St. Paul reaſoned in the Corinthian ſynagogue, that he perſuaded the Jews and the Greeks. And although it is certain that <hi>all</hi> who were thus perſuaded, and the <hi>whole</hi> church which he (thus perſuaded) eſtabliſhed at Corinth, were not really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, yet the alteration which took place with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to many of them, was ſo great, as to afford a ſtriking proof of the divine power and preſence. For after ſpeaking to the Corinthian diſciples, of <hi>forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, idolaters, effeminate, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners,</hi> he ſubjoins, <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are juſtified, but ye are ſanctified.</hi> When ſo many men, infamous for every ſpecies of tranſgreſſion, were perſuaded to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel of Chriſt, and did afterwards adorn the doctrines which it contained; when they were turned not only from darkneſs unto light, but alſo, from the dominion of ſin, to the practice of holineſs, was not the divine energy as fully manifeſted in the chriſtian miniſtry, as was <hi>the glory of the Lord,</hi> in the Jewiſh temple?</p>
            <p>THE effects of chriſtian miniſtrations have not, in latter ages, been ſo obvious and ſurprizing; and from the difference between the circumſtances of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031740_0018_0FEE75BA5E869728"/>
thoſe to whom the goſpel was <hi>then</hi> preached, and thoſe to whom it is <hi>now</hi> addreſſed, it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould be.</p>
            <p>WE cannot doubt however, that the divine ſpirit yet attends on a preached word, and that by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of both theſe, the kingdom of Chriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually enlarged. <hi>For as the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater: So ſhall my word be, ſaith the Lord, that goeth forth out of my mouth: it ſhall not return unto me void: but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and proſper in the thing, where unto I ſend it. When Chriſt aſcended up on high, he gave gifts unto men, that God might dwell among them.</hi>

               <p>BY the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, he has given, in the different periods of the church, <hi>ſome apoſtles and ſome prophets, and ſome evengeliſts: and ſome paſtors and teachers, for perfecting the ſaints for the work of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry: and for edifying the body of Chriſt.</hi> He man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſts himſelf in religious aſſemblies: He hears the prayers which are offered, and bleſſes the word which is ſpoken.</p>

And that the conditions of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be thoroughly known, and the importance of it duly eſtimated, he has appointed that a ſeventh part of our time ſhould be devoted, to the purpoſes of religious inſtruction and religious worſhip.

pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe:</hi> and further;—when we reflect on the probability there is, that thoſe who do not, by the means which God has appointed, attain to virtue and holineſs, will forever remain enemies to God, by wicked works: it muſt appear infinitely important, <hi>how</hi> the goſpel is preached, and in what manner it is received; <hi>Take heed therefore, how ye hear.</hi>

IN proof of the piety of our anceſtors, it may be remarked, that a church was gathered, and a miniſter<note n="§" place="bottom">The Rev. STEPHEN BATCHELOR.</note> ſettled, when the firſt ſettlements were made, <abbr>viz.</abbr> in the year 1638.</p>
               <p>THERE were two towns<note n="†" place="bottom">Portſmouth, and Dover.</note> in this ſtate, incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before this; in neither of which were the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es under the care of any particular paſtor, until ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years after this church was eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>IN this town and <hi>Exeter,</hi> ſettlements were made, churches formed, and miniſters choſen, the ſame year.</p>
               <p>THE firſt paſtor of this church, the Rev. STE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHEN BATCHELOR, was removed three years after his firſt miniſterial connexion with them.</p>
               <p>OF his ſucceſſor, the Rev. TIMOTHY DALTON, it is recorded that he continued in the miniſtry twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two years, and died in an advanced age. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which he made for the uſe of the miniſtry, will be a perpetual monument of his liberality, and regard for religious worſhip.</p>
               <p>FOURTEEN years previous to <hi>his</hi> death, the Rev. JOHN WHEELWRIGHT<note n="‖" place="bottom">He was cotemporary at the Univerſity, with OLIVER CROMWELL, as appears from Dr. MATHER'S letter to GEORGE VAUGHAN, Eſq.—See BIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KNAP'S Hiſtory of New-Hampſhire, Vol. 3. p. 339.</note> was ſettled as colleague with him.</p>

THIS man makes a very conſiderable figure, in the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, not of this ſtate only, but of New England in general. He is ſaid to have been<note n="*" place="bottom">See HUTCHINSON'S Hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts, Vol. 1. p. 55.</note> "a zealous miniſter of character, both for learning and piety." He was brother in law to the famous <hi>Ann Hutchinſon,</hi> who about the middle of the laſt century, occaſioned much diſturbance among the churches in the vicinity of Boſton, by propagating antinomian tenets. Having unfortunately embibed the ſame ideas of religion, he rendered himſelf pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly obnoxious to the government and clergy of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, by preaching a ſermon, which in thoſe times of accrimonious zeal, was thought to ſavour of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and ſedition.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.—p. 57.</note> Being called to an account, and refuſing to make any acknowledgment, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed, and ordered to leave that vicinity after 14 days. He then came into this ſtate, and laid the foundation of the town<note n="§" place="bottom">See a copy of the original deed from the natives to WHEELWRIGHT and others, in BELKNAP'S Hiſtory of New-Hampſhire, Vol. 1.—Appendix.</note> and church at <hi>Exeter.</hi> He was then miniſter of this church, and afterwards preached at <hi>Saliſbury.</hi> In the year 1644 he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour again, by the government of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, upon his making ſome ſlight acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the time of the Commonwealth, he was in England, from whence he wrote a letter<note n="*" place="bottom">I have lately been at London about five weeks. My Lord Protector was pleaſed to ſend one of his guard for me, with whom I had diſcou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

church, in which he diſcovered his friendſhip for the intereſt of CROMWELL. "He lived to be the oldeſt miniſter in the colony," which ſays a reſpectable hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, "would have been taken notice of, if his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors had not remained in power."</p>
               <p>SOON after his removal, and before the death of Mr. DALTON, the care of this church was committed to the Rev. SEABORN COTTON. Of the records which he kept, but a few imperfect ſketches are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our hands. We of conſequence, know little of him, or the ſtate of the church, when under his care. The term of his miniſtry was ſixteen years.</p>
               <p>TEN years after his deceaſe, the church again enjoyed the ſtated adminiſtration of chriſtian ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by his ſon, the Rev. JOHN COTTON. During his life 487<note n="†" place="bottom">See Hampton church records.</note> were initiated into the chriſtian church by baptiſm; and 220 were admitted to the Lord's ſupper. He died in the 14th year of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>THE vacancy occaſioned by his departure was in a few months ſupplied by the Rev. NATHANIEL GOOKINS, who was ſeparated to the miniſterial office in the year 1710. He is ſpoken of by many who are now living, with peculiar eſteem and veneration. He continued in the miniſtry twenty-four years; in which time, 1013<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> were baptized, and 320 admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to full communion.</p>
               <p>HIS ſucceſſor was the Rev. WARD COTTON, whoſe miniſterial life was longer than that of any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er paſtor of this church. His official relation to

the church was diſſolved in the year 1765, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been their miniſter for the term of 31 years. At the time of his ſettlement, the church conſiſted of 253 members, male and female. He received the addition of 519.—417<note n="†" place="bottom">Hampton church records.</note> of whom partook at the Lord's Table. The number of baptiſms was 1200.</p>
               <p>ABOUT ten months entervened between Mr. COTTON's diſmiſſion and the ſettlement of the Rev. EBENEZER THAYER. The number of church members was then 246,—92 of whom were males. In the time of his miniſtry, he baptized 641 perſons; received 223 into the church;—102<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> of whom were communicants at the Lord's Table. The reſt were taken under the watch and diſcipline of the church, but thought themſelves unqualified for ſo holy an ordinance as that of the ſacrament.</p>
               <p>HIS relation to this church was diſſolved by death on the 6th of September 1792. There are few preſent, it may be, who were not perſonally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him. You of this congregation, for a time, rejoiced in his light. The affection with which his name is mentioned, and the tears which do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually drop over his grave, are the ſureſt teſtimony of <hi>your</hi> attachment, and of <hi>his</hi> virtues.<note n="*" place="bottom">

AN hundred and fifty four years have elapſed, from the time when this church was planted, to the death of its late paſtor. And although there have been eight miniſters, and conſequently ſeven vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, either by removal, or death, the church has never been deſtitute, but in one inſtance for the ſpace of an entire year, during that whole period. This is infallible proof, either of great unanimity, or of uncommon zeal for the enjoyment of Goſpel ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. And the enterprize and exertion which you have diſcovered in preparing a convenient houſe for public worſhip, will be conſidered as infallible evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the flame of your forefathers, is not wholly extinguiſhed. This building <hi>which we now conſecrate to God,</hi> was erected on the 24th of May laſt, through your unremitting labour and aſſiduity, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a kind providence, it is now brought to its preſent ſtate of convenience and decency.</p>
               <p>WE might juſtly be charged with ingratitude, ſhould we, on this occaſion forget to make mention of the ſucceſs which has attended the labour of your hands. The welfare of the artificers and aſſiſtants, has been precious in the ſight of God, and no conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable caſualties have taken place to damp the joy which we now experience. This is not to be attrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted to the ſtrength of our own arms or the prudence of our deſigns. For <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain who build it.</hi> It is he who hath girded us with ſtrength, and hath made our way
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031740_0031_0FEE75D275E76870"/>
perfect. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE laſt conſideration which we ſhall bring to view, is the purpoſe for which this houſe was erected. If ſo much zeal and activity were well employed in preparing a ſanctuary, in which to attend on the means of grace: how much more important is it to be poſſeſſed of that moral purity and love to God, to the attainment of which all theſe means are to be ſubſervient.</p>
               <p>LET not the means content us, while the end is not anſwered. Let it never be forgotten, that the deſign, for which we convene in this earthly temple, is that we may hereafter become <hi>pillars in the temple of our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now <hi>May the Lord who made heaven and earth, bleſs you out of Zion!</hi> May the influences of his Holy Spirit, accompany the exhortations that ſhall here be delivered: May our prayers come up with acceptance from this alter, and may <hi>God glorify the houſe of his glory.</hi> And finally,</p>
               <p>MAY you be <hi>built upon the foundation of the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt being the chief corner ſtone, in whom, all the building, fitly framed together, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom may ye alſo, be builden together for an habitation of God, through the Spirit.</hi>
