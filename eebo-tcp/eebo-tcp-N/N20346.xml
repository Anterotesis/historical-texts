            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE <hi>yellow fever,</hi> or tropical endemic cauſus, and the <hi>ſmall pox,</hi> are inflammatory in the attack; and are communicated by ſpecific contagion. The poiſon of the former, as it ſeems, is conveyed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the ſtomach with the ſaliva, or any thing ſwallowed, and acts upon it, and upon the pylorus and duodenum, by corroſion; which firſt raiſing an inflammation on the parts, theſe afterwards become gangrenous. This poiſon acts as other acrid poiſons taken into the ſtomach. The diſeaſe is a corroſion of the ſtomach, the pylorus, and the duodenum; all elſe of the complaints, are they more than ſymptoms conſequent of that corroſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See an account of diſſections, page 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The contagious poiſon of the <hi>ſmall pox</hi> acts more like that infuſed into the blood by the bite of poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous animals, which contaminates the maſs.</p>
            <p>The conſtituent parts of theſe poiſons, or by what proceſs of nature they are generated, few pretend to know; and though ſome may fancy they know them, yet it is beyond the conjecture of moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:026684_0002_0FD15A2C55F736F8"/>Whilſt we are ignorant of the cauſe of the <hi>yellow fever</hi> and <hi>ſmall pox,</hi> we may however admit that they are infectious, though not alike in all circumſtances.<note n="*" place="bottom">The tropical endemic yellow fever is not always conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. It exiſts in the Weſt India iſlands for years together without being notably ſo. Strangers from northern climates are very liable to take it on their arrival there; and it goes hard with them. Their being ſo very ſuſceptible, is owing more to their intemperance, and expoſure to night air, dews and rains, than to contagion. After ſome number of years, it is uſhered in with aggravated circumſtances. It thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very contagious, and is a diſtinct and moſt fatal diſeaſe. Such was the yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, and in the Weſt Indies in 1793 and 1794. The milder or common yellow fever of the iſlands can never be conveyed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, becauſe it is not contagious, and the contagious kind ſeldom exiſts in the iſlands:—thence the long intervals of its appearance on this continent. All plagues have their periods. When the peculiar circumſtances that occaſion or admit of the aggravation in the yellow fever give way, the diſeaſe becomes no longer contagious, but ſinks into the common and leſs virulent tropical yellow fever. It is ſaid, an <hi>exceſs</hi> of <hi>heat</hi> or of <hi>cold</hi> will deſtroy certain diſeaſes. The dreaded Natolian plague (commonly called "<hi>The</hi> Plague") has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, at times, in the higher but mild latitudes, hitherto, without having ever originated any where elſe than in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia.</hi> It is often in northern Egypt and on the coaſt of Barbary: but it is ſaid to be always carried thither from its <hi>Natolian</hi> ſource. M. <hi>Savery</hi> calls Conſtantinople and Smyrna the <hi>Foci</hi> of it. Was this kind of plague ever known to exiſt between the tropics? It has been carried to England, and other countries of heat and cold, where it raged. All the countries of its exiſtence are in the <hi>temperate climates.</hi> Did it ever exiſt in countries of continual heat? On the other hand, the yellow fever, in its virulent ſtate, <hi>originates</hi> only within the tropics, the lower latitudes of perpetual heat: but it is of a nature to act in the higher latitudes, under a combination of certain peculiar circumſtances, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced from its native ſource. There muſt be ſuch a combination to produce and ſupport theſe contagious and dreadful diſeaſes. Other circumſtances arreſt, and in the end annihilate them.</note> The ſmall pox may be communicated in all ſtates of the air, but the yellow fever can exiſt only in a <hi>hot air,</hi> as hiſtories of it ſhow: and there are alſo ſtrong reaſons for believing from thoſe hiſtories that <hi>froſt</hi> kills the infectious matter of it, as ſurely as it kills certain other exotics. Many people, in the time of the late epidemic in Philadelphia, looked for rain,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026684_0003_0FD15A2E78829550"/>
which they believed would be fatal to the infection.<note n="*" place="bottom">In Granada, "As the change to <hi>moiſture</hi> was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably great and ſudden, much expectation was formed that the virulence of the infection would be done away or abated: but <hi>neither</hi> happened." Chiſholm.</note> Others regarded not the coming of rain, otherwiſe than as it might be attended with or followed by <hi>cold</hi>; and they looked only for mere <hi>cold,</hi> whether attended with rain or not, becauſe hiſtories of this fever aſſured them that <hi>cold</hi> had always been fatal to the infection. It is admitted that floods of rain, by diluting and waſhing off the ſtagnant putrid water of a low country, relieve from the remitting, the bilious, and the putrid fevers common to ſuch countries.</p>
            <p>Although the yellow fever originates in countries of perpetual <hi>heat,</hi> yet it may be brought from thence into this country of both cold and heat, as it hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has been: there are, however, two particulars eſpecially neceſſary to that end; that it be in the <hi>peculiar air of a large town,</hi> and that the ſeaſon be <hi>hot.</hi> It may well be preſumed it cannot act, in this country at leaſt, but under this combination; becauſe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet has appeared on the continent, unattended
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026684_0004_0FD15A2F9B974B20"/>
with thoſe circumſtances. If the matter of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion ſuffers <hi>cold,</hi> it ſuffers death; as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from facts uniformly heretofore happening in this country. When it was in Charleſton, S. C. in 1748, it received its death ſtroke from cold air on the fourteenth of October; and about the ſame time of October it lately experienced the like, on the change of air from an uncommon heat, for that ſeaſon, to the proper degree of autumnal cold. The cool air, eſpecially at night, in the laſt week of September, 1793, produced ſuch a change in the degree of infection and complaints of the ſick in Philadelphia, that the phyſicians expreſſed an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſurprize, on the great abatement of both: but the return of warm cloſe weather, with a ſhift of wind from the <hi>northern</hi> quarters to the <hi>ſouthern,</hi> in the beginning of October, gave ſo fatal a malignancy to the diſeaſe, as occaſioned more frequent deaths, for ſome days, even after the return of cooler wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but, it ſeems it had generally effected too much to admit of recovery, of the <hi>then</hi> ſick, in any ſtate of the air afterwards.</p>
            <p>For ſupporting the aforegoing principles, we need only be aſſured that the yellow fever has never been communicated in country places or ſmall towns on this continent; and that as often as it has been amongſt us, it always appeared to be imported, always vaniſhed in the cool ſeaſon of autumn, and never recurred with the enſuing ſummer, nor until again uſhered in from the Weſt Indies. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſay indeed, that it has been taken in country places, in ſome few inſtances. But on inquiry, it appears there has been a want of knowledge to diſtinguiſh the yellow fever from diſeaſes of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026684_0005_0FD15A30D5D50510"/>
country, the ſymptoms being partly alike. In other inſtances, people have received the infection in Philadelphia, but have pretended they had not been in the city: others alarmed, have imagined they had it, when they have only had a little cold or common complaint, or mere apprehenſion may have induced the ſuppoſition.<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems there ſtill is a ſuſpicion in ſome phyſicians, founded on the narrations of other people, that there were a few inſtances of the infection taken in country places. But to aſcertain facts of this nature, and diſtinguiſh them with accuracy, for a phyſician to judge of them with certainty, is not very eaſy in common. Diſeaſes originating in or greatly affecting the ſtomach, are attended with ſymptoms much alike, from the common intermittent to the yellow fever. Any thing corroſive or acrimonious, acting forcibly on the coats of that bowel, muſt immediately affect the nerves, which there abound, and readily communicate ſenſations to the very extremities. The beginning of the worſt of the yellow fever has been taken, in Philadelphia, for only a cold or obſtructed perſpiration. Perſpiration, by the bye, being refuſed a paſſage through its natural outlet, becomes depraved and even acrimonious. It then ſoon affects the fibres and the nerves, and induces ſpaſm (whether it be perceptible or not) attended with tremours, head-ach, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, reſtleſſneſs, anxiety, pains, nauſea or vomiting. If haply the perſpirable matter is into driven into the canal, it is thence diſcharged in the character of diarrhoea. But, if its ſtimulous produces fixed ſpaſm on the inteſtines, whilſt the pores of the ſkin ſtill remain cloſed, coſtiveneſs then occurs, and the perſpirable matter is every way ſhut up. It ſeems, that from the ſpaſm of the ſtomach, extended, ariſes the coſtiveneſs uſual in the yellow fever; which remains, till recovery or putrefaction releaſes the fibres from the ſpaſm. When putrefaction happens to effect this—then it is that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders become aſtoniſhed on ſeeing the ſpontaneous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, which are immenſe, in fluids that had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating, and were impriſoned by the ſpaſm now ſuddenly let looſe on an entire loſs of tone in the fibres.</note>
            </p>
            <p>People and merchandiſe have been continually arriving from the Weſt India iſlands, the ſource of the yellow fever for ages paſt; yet the diſeaſe was never communicated to the people of this city, but in the heat of ſummer, and that only thrice in above ſixty years; probably the ſeldomer, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious matter having generally ſpent itſelf, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in the time of performing the voyages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026684_0006_0FD15A32F5356238"/>To ſatiſfy the mind that the late epidemic, in Philadelphia, was introduced from a tropical climate, ſober reaſon requires but to know, that it is a diſeaſe natural to the Weſt India iſlands; that it never was known to originate in this country; but has been admitted, without a doubt of any one till now, to have been always brought from thence; that it has been, this year, raging in thoſe iſlands more than uſual; that there never was before ſuch a plenty of means for bringing it from thence, and that it firſt broke out in a part of the city near which ſhips from thoſe iſlands, that had unuſual numbers of ſick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on board, diſcharged their cargoes. From all which circumſtances there ariſes an irreſiſtible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that the late contagious fever, called the yellow fever, was imported from the Weſt India iſlands.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The introduction of the yellow fever from Boullam, in Africa, into St. George's, in Granada, was by the ſhip Hankey, in February, in the year 1793, and it was called the "<hi>Boullam fever,</hi>" or "Boullam malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant peſtilential fever." Doctor Chiſholm thinks it is the ſame with that which raged in Philadelphia in that year. He illuſtrates this idea by the inſtance of a veſſel, belonging to Philadelphia, introducing the diſeaſe into St. Pierre, Martinique, in October, 1793, and by a veſſel from New London touching at St. Pierre, and carrying the infection to Granada in February, 1794. He adds, that on the ſick being put under his charge, he found the diſeaſe was his old enemy, the malignant peſtilential fever, (meaning no doubt the ſame with that introduced from Boullam into Granada in the preceding February) which he ſucceſsfully treated with mercury. It raged in Granada in 1793, and generally among the Weſt India iſlands, more or leſs, through that and the next following year.</p>
                  <p>The Boullam fever, in 1793, <hi>February,</hi> was imported into Granada from Boullam. In <hi>July</hi> following, into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia from the Weſt India iſlands. In <hi>October</hi> following, into Martinique from Philadelphia. Being identically the ſame in qualities, it was as readily returned from hence to the iſlands, as it was at firſt brought from thence to the great towns of the continent. A veſſel of Philadelphia loſt her ſupercargo at Granada, who died there of the Boullam fever ſo early as April, 1793.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:026684_0007_0FD15A349F378BF0"/>It has been inconſiderately imputed to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, that it is more liable to receive the yellow fever than other large towns of America. It is made by people who had collected from recent haſty pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, that it had been three or four times in this city, without their being informed how often it had been in other towns. This fever, it ſeems, has been at leaſt as often in Charleſton, S. C. and New York. The accurate doctor <hi>Lining</hi> ſpeaks of four times that it was in Charleſton; in the years 1732, ′39, ′45, and ′48. Charleſton being nearer the ocean, the tropic, the Havanna, and the Weſt India iſlands, ſeems more liable to receive the infection than a town further from them, and near a hundred miles inland, that in general is remarkably healthful, and which would

probably ſcarcely ever receive it, were it not that it is more populous, and therefore has more of the air peculiar to large towns, which is ſo neceſſary, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the heat of a ſummer, to give action to the contagious matter, on its ſpeedy arrival <hi>freſh</hi> from its tropical ſource.</p>
            <p>It is alſo ſaid that the yellow fever has been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into this country in ſhips from Rotterdam and Ireland, crouded with paſſengers: but this a great miſtake. The <hi>hoſpital fever</hi> has often been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them into America, but never once the yellow fever, which is not a diſeaſe of northern climates. The <hi>hoſpital</hi> or <hi>gaol fever</hi> is thought to ariſe from <hi>animal effluvia.</hi> Priſons, hoſpitals and ſhips are crouded with men, and abound with excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious <hi>animal effluvia pent up</hi> from freſh air. The gaol fever is peculiar to ſuch places, and is very infectious.</p>
            <p>It is wiſhed thoſe perſons who are apprehenſive that contagious matter of the yellow fever is wrapped up in furniture, and they know not what, and that it will break out next ſummer, would be at the pains to inform themſelves from the hiſtories of the diſeaſe heretofore publiſhed, of the manner and the time when it uſually arrived or broke out, and when it died away on this continent. It will pacify them. They will eſpecially be aſſured that ſome number of years paſſed away between the times of its recurring in our country.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026684_0009_0FD12B2EF8528C70"/>THE public is obliged to doctors <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Cathrall</hi> for an account, early given, of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of perſons who died of the yellow fever which raged in Philadelphia in the year 1793; the purport whereof follows, together with remarks thereon by the editor.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>brain</hi> in all its parts, has been found in a natural condition.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The diſeaſe is local to the ſtomach and parts near it. The brain is diſtant from the ſeat of it. The firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third and ninth of the following inſtances of diſſection were of ſuch perſons as died early in the diſeaſe. Note well the</hi> ninth <hi>obſervation of the doctors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The viſcera of the <hi>thorax</hi> are perfectly ſound. The <hi>blood</hi> however, in the heart and veins, is fluid; ſimilar in its conſiſtence to the blood of perſons who have been hanged or deſtroyed by electricity.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The</hi> early <hi>death from ſpaſm of the ſtomach— a ſtroke local that effects not general diſeaſe, may account for this: and moreover, in hot weather coagulation occurs not very ſoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſtomach</hi> and beginning of the <hi>duodenum</hi> are the parts that appear the moſt diſeaſed. In two perſons who died of the diſeaſe on the <hi>fifth day,</hi> the villous membrane of the ſtomach, eſpecially about its ſmaller end, was found highly <hi>inflamed,</hi> and this inflammation extended through the pylorus into the duodenum, ſome way. The inflammation here was exactly ſimilar to that induced in the ſtomach by acrid poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as by arſenic, which we have once had an opportunity of ſeeing in a perſon deſtroyed by it.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>This illuſtrates the reality of the matter of a ſpecific contagion acting immediately on the ſtomach. A part whereof may tend downward, and here and there attach to the inteſtines. If ſome of it is, in certain caſes, enveloped in the paſſing excrement, ſo as to be carried off at the common outlet,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026684_0010_0FD15A3974F23300"/>
yet enough of it may adhere, and act on the bowels to the worſt purpoſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>bile</hi> in the gall bladder was quite of its natural colour, though very viſcid.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The fluids are not the immediate ſubjects of this diſeaſe.—☞ The preceding are in inſtances of</hi> early <hi>deaths, in the ſtate of a contraction or inflammation of the ſtomach. The following are of later deaths, where gangrene has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, after the inflammatory ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In a perſon who died on the <hi>eighth day</hi> of the diſeaſe, ſeveral ſpots of <hi>extravaſations</hi> were diſcovered between the membranes, particularly about the ſmaller end of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the inflammation of which had <hi>conſiderably abated. Pus</hi> was ſeen in the beginning of the duodenum, and the villous membrane of this part was <hi>thickened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The inflammation abates as gangrene approaches. Was not the production of pus owing to an effort of health? The thickening was an indication of putrefaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In two other perſons who died at a more <hi>advanced period</hi> of the diſeaſe, the ſtomach appeared <hi>ſpotted</hi> in many places with <hi>extravaſations,</hi> and the <hi>inflammation diſappeared.</hi> It contained, as did alſo the inteſtines, a black liquor, ſuch as had been vomited and purged before death.—This black liquor appears clearly to be an altered ſecretion from the liver: for, a fluid in all reſpects of the ſame qualities was found in the gall bladder. This liquor was ſo acrid that it induced conſiderable inflammation and ſwelling on the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator's hands, which remained ſome days. The villous membrane of the <hi>inteſtines,</hi> in theſe laſt two bodies, was found <hi>inflamed</hi> in <hi>ſeveral</hi> places.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The effects of the poiſon, though moſtly local to the ſtomach and duodenum, ſometimes appear in other parts of the bowels; and they act deſtructively where there is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt ſuſceptibility. The poiſon firſt is in contact with the ſtomach: and after having effected a corroſion and inflammation there, which is followed by a gangrene of that bowel, it or ſome part of it may deſcend, as it ſeems, and raiſe an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation on the inferior bowels, where it chances to adhere, even
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026684_0011_0FD15A3A9465D128"/>
after the ſtomach is deſtroyed. The general maſs is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately contaminated by the attack on the ſtomach, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gangrenous or putrid: otherwiſe, could a ſubſequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation be produced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the other bowels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>liver</hi> was of its natural appearance, excepting in one of the laſt perſons, on the ſurface of which a very few diſtended veins were ſeen, although other abdominal viſcera were of healthy appearance.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The ſpaſms and corroſions of the ſtomach are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Such as muſt ſoon induce general diſorder of the body, and extenſive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> effects both in the ſolids and the fluids, though not always alike or in the ſame parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>external ſurface</hi> of the ſtomach, as well as of the inteſtines, was quite free from the inflammation; the veins being diſtended with blood, which appeared through the tranſparent peritoneum, gave them a dark colour.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>This is further in favour of the locality of this diſeaſe. How confined!—All is effected firſt by contact with the fibres and nerves of the ſtomach. The ſymptoms were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; and in the end the fluids with the ſolids become exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively morbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>ſtomach</hi> of thoſe who died <hi>early</hi> in the diſeaſe, was always <hi>contracted:</hi> but in thoſe who died in a more advanced period of it, where extravaſations appeared, it was <hi>diſtended</hi> with air.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>The corroſive poiſon early injures the fibres of the ſtomach, and occaſions ſpaſm; firſt of the minuter parts with which it comes into contact; and this preſently extends ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably and ſo forcibly as to contract the whole or a great part of that bowel, during the inflammatory ſtate, and until gangrene diſſolves the contraction of the fibres. The conſequent putrefaction is then attended with a diſtenſion of the parts. Such ſudden, ſtrong, and extenſive contraction muſt arreſt the natural and neceſſary functions; and death comes with ſpeed, before time is given for gangrene to effect it.</hi>
