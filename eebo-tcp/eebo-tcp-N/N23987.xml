            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRAYER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ALMIGHTY GOD,</hi> who haſt created all things, and by whoſe providence they are upheld and directed; we, thy rational creatures, eſteem it our duty to take all ſuitable occaſions of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our dependence upon thee, of venerating thy infinite greatneſs, of adoring thy wiſdom and power, and of thanking thee for thy ineſtimable benefits.</p>
            <p>We are ſenſible, that we are continually in thy preſence, and accountable to thee for all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and, therefore, we feel ourſelves intereſted, in praying "that thou wouldeſt direct us, in all our doings, with thy moſt gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help; that, in all our works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally by thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy obtain everlaſting life."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031736_0003_0FED3832E4AE78F0"/>Nor do we ſolicit thy gracious favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for ourſelves only; but, conſidering ourſelves as members of thy great family of mankind, we entreat thee to have mercy on all men. Provide for their neceſſities; and grant, that, in all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, they may remember thee who art the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their enjoyments,—and who, at the ſame time that thou "giveſt liberally to all men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideſt them not." Diſpoſe them to conſider vice as the greateſt, and the moſt degrading, of all evils; and the conſcientious diſcharge of all moral duties, as eſſential to their dignity and happineſs. And to this end, haſten, we beſeech thee, the time, when the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be univerſally diffuſed, and produce its full effect.</p>
            <p>But, more eſpecially, we pray for the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe United States. Continue to them the bleſſings of peace, and good government. And, O gracious God, who "makeſt men to be of one mind in a houſe," a city, or even in a whole nation, heal their diviſions; and diſpoſe them to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as becometh thoſe who are brethren, both by nature and grace,—and who have all one common intereſt, by being members of the ſame community.</p>
            <p>At this hour of danger to our country, give wiſdom, give fortitude, and at the ſame time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:031736_0004_0FEE25F26B675BD0"/>
to all thoſe whom we entruſt with the exerciſe of our ſovereignty. More particularly, we beſeech thee to behold with thy favour the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the United States. May his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be happy and glorious:—grant him in health and proſperity long to live; and finally, after this life, to obtain everlaſting felicity.</p>
            <p>Bleſs all ſchools and ſeminaries of learning; that, by them, our youth may be trained up in the fear and love of thy holy name, and be qualified to do much good in their day and generation.</p>
            <p>And, finally, we beſeech thee to bleſs the young men whom we are this day about to admit to the honours of this ſeminary. Grant, that the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have here been beſtowed on them, may not be beſtowed in vain; but that they may be the inſtruments, in thy hands, of reſtoring health to the ſick, and of bidding the heart, which pain or ſympathetic ſorrow had dejected, ſing for joy.</p>
            <p>Accept, moſt merciful God, of theſe our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we offer in the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; who has taught us, when we pray, to ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:031736_0005_0FEE25F3F2BA1968"/>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven: Give us, this day, our daily bread; and forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive thoſe who treſpaſs againſt us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, forever and ever.</p>

            <head>THE ADDRESS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is natural to expect, that they who are entruſted with the direction of ſeminaries of learning, muſt be ſolicitous for the reputable conduct of thoſe upon whom the honours of ſuch ſeminaries are beſtowed. Hence the cuſtom, which has always prevailed in this place, of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave of our graduates, whether in medicine or in the arts, with a parting addreſs, or charge, reſpecting their conduct in future life; the words of thoſe whom we eſteem being apt to make a deeper and more laſting impreſſion when ſpoken at that time, than at any other.</p>
            <p>On the preſent occaſion, this duty, owing to the indiſpoſition of our venerable provoſt, has devolved on me:—a circumſtance which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret;—becauſe I have neither had ſufficient lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031736_0008_0FEE2605E410B250"/>
nor (had that been afforded me) ſufficient experience, to diſcharge it properly. It is ſome conſolation, however, to reflect, that ſuch is your own good ſenſe, (which I have heard very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of;) and ſuch the opportunities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which you have ſo long enjoyed in this place, under the moſt able inſtructors; as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the beſt things that could have been ſaid at this time, in a great meaſure unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>That no man is born for himſelf only, is a maxim which can never be diſputed. Every one, who is capable of the leaſt reflection, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by daily experience, that, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which he derives from the labours of others, his life muſt be deſtitute of comfort, if not of ſupport. And if ſo, can he reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he alone is privileged to receive good, but without any obligation on his part to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it; to partake in the general welfare, but to do nothing to promote it.</p>
            <p>It follows, that it is every man's duty to avoid idleneſs, and to purſue ſome profeſſion that is of uſe to ſociety.</p>
            <p>This, Gentlemen, is what you appear to have propoſed to yourſelves. And the profeſſion you
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031736_0009_0FEE26076D397038"/>
have choſen, is both honourable and uſeful. For if health be the firſt of earthly bleſſings, and it is generally allowed to be ſo, then they who inſtruct us how to preſerve it, or reſtore it to us when loſt, deſerve to be held in very high eſtimation.</p>
            <p>But, at the ſame time that we beſtow on the profeſſion of medicine this tribute of juſt praiſe, we do not heſitate to ſay, that as, on the one hand, we have much to hope from it, ſo, on the other, we have ſomething to fear. In the hands of the ignorant and illiterate, of men of weak judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of all, who, either from nature or habit, are averſe to ſtudy and reflection, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the moſt fatal evils. To ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners it is owing, that, to this day, it continues to be a matter of debate, whether the profeſſion have, on the whole, done more good or harm to ſociety; and that, in almoſt all times, even great and highly eſtimable perſons have made it a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ridicule. Of this number, I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, was Pliny, the naturaliſt; who repeats an ancient inſcription upon a tomb, in which the deceaſed ſaid, that he died of a multitude of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, <hi>turba ſe medicorum periiſſe.</hi> And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of phyſic, and of thoſe who practiſed it in his day, "They learn it, ſays he, at our hazard, and acquire experience at the price of our lives.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031736_0010_0FEE2608F30AC1D8"/>
No law puniſhes their ignorance, nor is there any example of their being chaſtiſed. Only a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian can murder with abſolute impunity." And, to come nearer to our own times, in this number was alſo Mr. Addiſon. "We may lay it down as a maxim, ſays this celebrated writer, that when a nation abounds in phyſicians, it grows thin of people. Sir William Temple," continues he, "is very much puzzled to find out a reaſon why the northern hive, as he calls it, does not ſend out ſuch prodigious ſwarms, and overrun the world with Goths and Vandals, as it did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but had this excellent author obſerved, that there were no ſtudents in phyſick among the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Thor and Woden, and that this ſcience very much flouriſhes in the North at preſent, he might have found a better ſolution for this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than any of thoſe he has made uſe of."</p>
            <p>Theſe paſſages, which probably may have occurred to yourſelves in the courſe of your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are not here cited from the ſame motives with which they appear to have been written, but to impreſs you more ſtrongly with a ſenſe of the arduouſneſs of the undertaking in which you are about to engage; as well as with a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, without exerting your beſt endeavours to qualify yourſelves to be uſeful, you may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031736_0011_0FEE260D529216E0"/>
be in danger of producing the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, therefore, to recommend to you, in the firſt place, a diligent improvement of your leiſure hours, in extending your reading, and acquiring farther and ſtill farther information.</p>
            <p>They, who write on grandeur and ſublimity, are wont to tell us, that, though real greatneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways raiſes admiration, yet littleneſs does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the contrary paſſion of contempt; except when we are diſappointed by it, and meet with it in a place where we had reaſon to expect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better. The ſame remark, with but little variation, may be applied to the ſubject before us. Want of learning, in a peaſant, or mechanick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in us no ſentiments of contempt. To their occupations learning is not eſſential; and the poverty in which they are frequently educated, and the neceſſity, at a more advanced period, of a conſtant application to manual labour, allow them no opportunity of acquiring it. But an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate phyſician can never fail to be contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; becauſe his profeſſion being a learned profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we expect to find in him a literary character, and are diſappointed when it is otherwiſe.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:031736_0012_0FEE26132B3AC9A8"/>As medicine, however the invention of it may be aſcribed to the Egyptians, was firſt culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated as a ſcience in Greece, and, in conſequence of this, moſt of the terms that belong to it are of Greek derivation; as there are many valuable writings on the ſubject of medicine in that, and alſo in the Latin, language; and as a knowledge of theſe languages gives us a free acceſs to all the learning of antiquity, and to the moſt finiſhed models of eloquence in every ſpecies of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it will be expected of a phyſician, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other men of learning, to be in ſome meaſure acquainted with them. And as every phyſician ſhould be a writer,—ſo far at leaſt as to be capable, when an occaſion requires it, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his ſentiments, by writing, with perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity and correctneſs,—he ſhould be well acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er is comprehended under the terms, grammar, rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, and the belles lettres. He ſhould be no ſtranger to philoſophy; eſpecially to that branch of it which is called phyſicks, or natural philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. All the moſt approved authors who have written on the ſubject of his profeſſion, he ſhould read, and continue to read, till every ſentiment contained in them be not only comprehended, but rendered familiar to him, and indelibly impreſſed on his memory. And, laſtly, he ſhould cultivate
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031736_0013_0FEE2616BB67DED8"/>
habits of ſtrict attention, in whatever it may be in which he happens to be engaged; but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in every occurrence which relates to his practice; that he may be qualified to profit by his own experience.</p>
            <p>In all theſe branches, you have, we doubt not, made already a conſiderable proficiency; but it will require no ſmall degree of application to keep up this proficiency, and to ſupply what is wanting.</p>
            <p>Secondly. We truſt, that you will be no leſs diligent in the cultivation of every moral virtue.</p>
            <p>And, under this head, we would particularly recommend to you to cheriſh Sympathy. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more odious in any man than that inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility which wraps him up in himſelf, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents his being moved with either the joys or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of another. In a phyſician, it is not to be borne with. His abilities may indeed command our reſpect; but it is this participation in our joys and ſorrows, by which only he can render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beloved. And the phyſician, who is beloved by his patients, will always have it in his power to do them the more good. His very preſence will ſoothe their anguiſh, and his looks and accents impart conſolation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:031736_0014_0FEE261B45240E28"/>Diſintereſtedneſs is another of thoſe virtues, which may be here ſpecified; as being peculiarly becoming in the character of a phyſician. By diſintereſtedneſs, we do not mean, that, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, you ſhould have no expectation of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for your ſervices, or that your reward ſhould not be liberal; but that, on all proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, you ſhould be willing to aſſiſt and relieve your poorer brethren, in the way of your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as well as otherwiſe, hoping for no return; except that, which is indeed the greateſt of all others, the approbation of that Being who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders every act of beneficence done to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his creatures, as done to himſelf.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid by Hippocrates on this ſubject, is perhaps worthy of your attention: but, how far it is agreeable to the uſage of phyſicians, or might be attended with inconveniencies in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I am unable to determine. He is for having the phyſician to act, in reſpect to his fees, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and humanity, and "regulate them by the patient's power to reward them more or leſs libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally." In the following ſentiment, however, I am confident that you will agree with him. "There are even occaſions," ſays he, "on which a phyſician ought neither to aſk nor to expect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; as in the caſes of ſtrangers, and the poor, whom all the world are obliged to aſſiſt."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:031736_0015_0FEE261F2F290368"/>I will mention but one more of theſe virtues; and it is Candour: which I mention the rather, as the want of it in a phyſician may, on certain occaſions, produce incalculable evil.</p>
            <p>Of this virtue, the author whom I have juſt cited, who was as excellent a man as he was an illuſtrious phyſician, may ſerve as an example. In his writings, he is not aſhamed to own, at the expenſe in ſome meaſure of his glory, an error he had committed in dreſſing a wound on the head; "leſt," as he obſerves, "others after him, and by his example, ſhould fall into the ſame error." Does not this do him more honour, than even all his great learning and capacity? "Little minds," ſays Celſus, "and men of vulgar abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do not act in this manner; but are much more careful of the ſmall reputation they have; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can loſe nothing without impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves. Only great geniuſes, conſcious to themſelves of the abundance which they otherwiſe poſſeſs are capable of ſuch an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and of neglecting the little loſſes that diminiſh nothing of their riches and opulence."</p>
            <p>But, thirdly and laſtly, I ſhould think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inexcuſable, were I not to recommend to you
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031736_0016_0FEE2620B51D8CA8"/>
a daily attention to the cultivation of pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>HE DOES NOT DESERVE THE NAME OF A RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONAL CREATURE, AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT GIVES TO HIS NATURE ITS HIGHEST DIGNITY, WHO NEGLECTS TO KEEP UP A CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE GREAT AUTHOR OF HIS BEING. And, indeed, what exerciſe can be, in itſelf, more delightful, than to contemplate the perfections of that Being, who exiſted from eternity, who created all things, and ſupplieth all things living with plenteouſneſs; to expreſs our gratitude to him for the benefits which we every moment receive from him; to lift up our hearts unto him who careth for the meaneſt of his creatures, and pitieth them as a father pitieth his children, to converſe with him by prayer, to lay all our wants before him, and to unburthen, as it were, the fulneſs of our ſouls in his preſence.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, that this communication will add nothing to your profeſſional ſkill; nor can I venture to aſſure you, that it will give any effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the medicines which you preſcribe. But believing, as I do, that religious principle is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the happineſs of individuals, and to the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031736_0017_0FEE2628E4DAD850"/>
very exiſtence of ſociety, I look upon perſons, who are any way diſtinguiſhed by the ſtations which they hold in ſociety, to be more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to cheriſh it in themſelves, and (as far, at leaſt, as their <hi>example</hi> can go) to propagate it in others.</p>
            <p>Finally, my brethren, the connection, which for ſome time paſt has ſubſiſted between us, muſt henceforth ceaſe. But the time, I truſt, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come, when you will ceaſe, to reflect on that connection with pleaſure. On the other hand, I may venture to aſſure you, that the good wiſhes of your former inſtructors will never fail to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you. And in their name, as well as in my own, I bid you—FAREWELL.</p>
