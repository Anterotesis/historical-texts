            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION DELIVERED ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, 1794.</head>
            <p>THE little time allowed the speaker for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, together with the inexperience of youth, will lay claim to the indulgence of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and benevolence, while a few observations are made with a desire to entertain this polite and respectable assembly.</p>
            <p>It is of particular importance that a nation make choice of a pure and efficient government which shall preserve pure and inviolate, the rights and liberties of every individual, in which no evils can arise from the encroachments of arbitrary power, or from languor or want of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy in the administration. That government
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028499_0003_0FD929052CCA3790"/>
may be called the best, as best promoting the happiness of society, which will admit in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution the greatest share of wisdom, virtue, fidelity, unity, secrecy and dispatch. Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canism alone will admit the union of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers.</p>
            <p>In such a government the sovereign power rests in the people, who will most certainly be faithful to themselves, as they are bound from every principle in the wisest and best manner to promote the general welfare.</p>
            <p>Wisdom and virtue no less than fidelity, are essential to a republican government. As a meeting of every individual in a nation, if not wholly impracticable, would be attended with numerous inconveniences, it is therefore wisely concerted, that in a republic, the people chuse persons delegated, to devise plans of general utility. As it is always the interest, so it is the practice of a free and an enlightened people, to chuse men as their representatives, who are celebrated for their wisdom and virtues; and in this way, the wisdom and virtue of a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government becomes fixed upon a firm and permanent foundation. Unity, secrecy and dispatch, although generally allowed to prevail
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028499_0004_0FD9290A52D22550"/>
most in a monarchical form of government, may be equally enjoyed in a republic, where the people are cautious in chusing representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in whom they are willing to repose confidence in difficult emergencies, and where a supreme magistrate is chosen, vested with suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prerogatives.</p>
            <p>Of such a nature is the government of the United States of America—such, my fellow cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, is the government which we have the happiness to enjoy—we experience none of the evils of proud tyranny and arbitrary power on the one hand, or of mad democracy and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant anarchy on the other—no one here fears the tyrants haughty frown—no one here is subject to the wild phrenzy and confusion of those who are without any form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all; but true liberty founded on wise and equitable laws, pervades every part of the community. Wisdom, virtue, and integrity prevail in our legislative; unity, secrecy and dispatch in our executive departments. Our wise legislators, sensible of the danger of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, have enacted, that no magistrate or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in government shall have any power, except what he receives from the laws—justice
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028499_0005_0FD9290ECC817E08"/>
is administered to all with an impartial scale—every one must be subject to the laws of the state—neither birth, fortune nor the most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable station, can exempt any from a strict obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>That the blessing of a government, founded on such principles, may be secured to us, is our highest interest and should be the object of all our endeavors. But, my fellow citizens, while we are enjoying so many of the rich bounties of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us not forget that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a blessing, more easily obtained than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. It is natural for a people, who have been inured to habits of freedom and activity, when threatened with immediate oppression, to rise up as one man, and assert their liberties; but having a long time enjoyed the blessings of peace, and of a mild administration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are too apt to grow languid, and by a negligence and inattention to those inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests and concerns which appear more distant, to be lulled into a state of dangerous insensibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and unfitness so war. When in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a sudden attack may be made upon the country, and if slavery be not the consequence, irreparable injuries may be committed. The
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028499_0006_0FD9291056FE3EE8"/>
security or perpetual safety of a nation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becomes justly an object of general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. To shew in what consists the safety of a nation, and of ours in particular, is my present object.</p>
            <p>That a nation be secure, it is necessary that it be not deficient in respect to arms, the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the country, military skill and courage among the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>It is unnecessary to take up your time on the subject of military weapons—we have nothing to fear in this country from the want of arms, ammunition and military stores, if we have but prudence and courage to direct us, at what time, and in what manner to use them—from the watchful and provident care of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is reason to believe, that our arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and magazines will soon be amply sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>The situation of a country is also a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing to be attended to, when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the means of defence. Hills, vallies and rivers render a nation strong and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; they not only afford places of refuge in time of danger, but by the assistance of these,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028499_0007_0FD92917EA0D3E58"/>
an enemy may often be led into some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inconvenient situation, become sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and easily overcome—Let us on this subject call to mind, the brave Leonidas, the Spartan General, who at the head of only eight hundred men in the streights of Thermopylae, not only defended himself, but gained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory over the numerous armies of Xerxes. To come nearer the present time, some of us, my fellow citizens, have heard and others may have known from more evident tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, that such was the fate of the fierce and too confident Burgoyne, in the late American war. Our country is peculiarly favorable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its situation, to the preservation of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. As a friend to liberty <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Governor Livingston.</hi>
               </note> has justly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, in order to conquer America, it would require, that an enemy have forces so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to cover every foot of land in our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory—the reason is obvious, because in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as we fall in one part, we rise and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more powerful in another—and although it may be called a disadvantage, that we have such an extensive sea coast, by which we lie open in so many places to foreign irruptions
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028499_0008_0FD9291BD14259A8"/>
from the sea, yet it is to be considered, that our ports and harbors may be fortified, and that when invaded, we have time to rally our fortes and to act with united strength.<note n="*" place="bottom">"Admit that your fleets could destroy our towns and ravage our sea coasts; these are inconsiderable objects, things of no moment to men, whose bosoms glow with the ardor of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. We can retire beyond the reach of your navy, and, without any sensible diminution of the necessaries of life, enjoy a luxury, which from that period you will want; the luxury of being free."—Address of the Congress of 1775 to the inhabitants of Great Britain.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Military skill is in like manner very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the security of a nation—discipline in war is as necessary to ensure success in the field, as understanding and virtue to ensure the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the common interests in the cabinet. Regularity in every thing is attended with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but in nothing more than in troops destined to battle. From history it appears, that those nations have generally excelled in war, who have paid the greatest attention to military discipline. Among the ancient Romans,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028499_0009_0FD9291D2E0A8B78"/>
great attention was paid to the military art, and Rome never shone with so much lustre, as while this art was in the highest perfection; but when luxury and pride prevailed to such a degree, that the profession of arms became dishonorable, Rome sunk into a state of the most abject stupidity and ruin—she was in a desperate condition indeed, when the young men made a practice of cutting off their hands and fingers, that in their mutilated condition, they might be exempt from military service, and when she was obliged to have recourse to foreign mercenaries for aid against her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the second volume of Gibbon's decline and fall of the Roman empire.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Valour or courage among the inhabitants, is in like manner necessary to the security of a nation—courage is the great support and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of discipline. They are both alike neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, the best disciplined troops, without courage, would be little more than a lifeless mass, and the most fierce and intrepid without order, would only heighten the danger and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028499_0010_0FD92922C102FCC8"/>
hasten the ruin. The discipline of the Romans, would have availed but little, had active cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage been wanting—it was their virtue which in their language meant valor or public spirit, that gained them such astonishing success in all their wars and preserved their liberty and independence; it was the want of this, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the nation to a state of impotency and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bordering upon misery and ruin. The example of ancient Rome suggests in lively colours, this useful principle to every Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, that a nation possessed of virtue, valour and public spirit, will be possessed of liberty and independence, and will never be at a loss for forces to repel incursions. In colours equally strong and lively, does the example of the same nation suggest an equally interesting and estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished truth, that luxury and effeminacy, pride and selfishness, and a want of that glow of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, of that patriotic spirit, which seeks the happiness of the country at large, will be attended with the loss of liberty and the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial rights of man.</p>
            <p>Allow me here to consider, whether a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army be necessary for the defence and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the United States. By reason of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028499_0011_0FD92923EF71A528"/>
advantage in point of military discipline, it has been asserted, that a standing army is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a militia, and if it be meant of a militia without regulations, the assertion will most undoubtedly be just. Standing troops bred up to habits of war, will act with more vigour and afford more resistance than an untrained militia; but a militia may be under such good regulations, as to have all the advantages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the disadvantages of a standing army. In despotic governments, where the principle of governing is fear, a standing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my must be kept up, to awe the people into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience—but in free governments, where the principle is virtue, there is no necessity for such an order of men; so far is it from being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that on the other hand, it is wholly unable to answer the ends of such a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In a land of liberty, like ours, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous, to make a distinct order of the profession of arms—great opportunity is in this way afforded for the overturning of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the introduction of all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and calamities which attend a revolution; it was the standing army of Julius Caesar, which overturned the Roman commonwealth; it was the standing army of Oliver Cromwell, which turned the long parliament out of doors;

but besides the danger of a revolution, it is not to be supposed that courage or public spirit will prevail as much among a standing army, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a militia. An army which consists of the people, and is actuated by the same interests, which consists of men who have certain rights to protect, will act with more spirit than an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my composed of men, who neither know, nor think any thing of the cause in which they are engaged—with the same discipline, therefore, they may be supposed to excel standing troops.</p>
            <p>The militia of the United States is under good regulations, and daily improving in disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline—our wise and honest legislators have shewn their regard for our national security; as well as for the pure principles upon which all free governments depend, by the wisdom and impartiality manifested in our military establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Convinced of the danger of standing armies, they have not made a distinct order of the profession of arms, but wisely uniting the profession of the citizen and the soldier, have ordained, that every man (excepting only those who perform the sacred functions of the desk) shall prepare to meet the enemy in battle. No man in this government takes up arms, but with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028499_0013_0FD929314FB31E88"/>
a view to defend his country and its laws. The soldier puts not off the citizen when he enters the camp, but it is because he is a citizen, and would wish to continue such, that he makes himself, for a while, a soldier.</p>
            <p>While we oppose standing armies as tending to overturn the government, to support arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, and to introduce the greatest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of morals, and would contend that in a free government, an army should always be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the people, and actuated by the same interest; it is not denied that it may be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under certain circumstances of a country, to appoint a number of the inhabitants, who shall be particularly disciplined, that th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> may be a constitutional security for the public peace, and for protection against foreign or domestic vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. No one, viewing the present commotions of Europe, and the ignominious conduct of Great Britain towards us, can doubt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of our having a certain number of men in readiness, upon whom reliance may be plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our safety and honor.<note n="*" place="bottom">

The late military arrangements of Congress, must strike every one as important; and it is presumed that there are not wanting brave. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans in sufficient numbers, who, if called upon, by urgent necessity, will not only be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but will rejoice to have the honor of being defenders of their country.</p>
            <p>A harmony or union in the measures of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among the citizens of the United States, is also highly essential to the national se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.—It is the interest of every citizen to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in the wisdom of our federal government, the <hi>grand palladium</hi> of our liberties—this only can make us secure as individuals; strong and powerful as a nation.—Let the jarring interests of individuals, subside and give way to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral good. That which will best promote the happiness of the nation at large, will best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happiness of every individual. Unless we act upon the principles of the confederation, we are in great danger, both from home and abroad; unless we act upon the principles of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028499_0015_0FD8BFEA9D00B2A8"/>
and harmony, the most dreadful consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may ensue; but if we adhere to these exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principles, liberty and glory will attend us. It was for want of a confederation, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure similar to ours, that Europe remained so long in a state of tyranny, usurpation and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But when a freedom of communication began to prevail, and the principles of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy received among the different powers of Europe; when, in a word, civil government became fixed upon principles solid and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, then the security and happiness of Europe became established.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>It is for want of adherence to this noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that she is now covered with blood, and experiencing all the horrors of war. From the misery of other nations let America take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! It becomes us, my fellow citizens, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate a spirit of peace and harmony with our friends, that we may be the more formidable to our enemies.</p>
            <p>Moderation and calmness among the people,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028499_0016_0FD9293611B07528"/>
and particularly among those delegated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the people, are also in a high degree ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the preservation of our liberties and the security of the nation. The misfortune, however, always is, that when there is the greatest necessity for an unbiassed judgment and a calm investigation, these qualities are most wanting, by which means the nation becomes hurried into an expensive and unprofitable war, or undergoes some weighty calamities. The want of these qualities in an individual, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great disadvantage, but of much geater disadvantage is the want of them in a nation. When an individual is insulted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and moderation are esteemed as supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to revenge and the impulse of passion, and as far more likely to obtain redress. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are frequently attended with a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the latter with fatal and alarming conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. In like manner, are the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of passion and revenge, in a nation fatal and alarming, with this difference, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the fate of one, the fate of millions is concerned. It becomes Americans, the <hi>favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> of Heaven, to cultivate that spirit of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent moderation, for which they have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028499_0017_0FD9293F88465110"/>
been so remarkably distinguished, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though never afraid of war, always to prefer the arts of peace. When therefore, we feel a desire for war rankling in our breasts, we would do well to examine, whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a cool and impartial regard to jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or whether revenge be not the instigator. Passion should never be allowed to predominate ever reason. When we last fought, we had reason, religion, and GOD on our side—we were not in haste to sound the alarm of war—we took up arms, not to revenge ourselves, but free our country—we fought and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Heaven was on our side—We consulted and fought under the God of battles, whom we ought to consult again, before we involve ourselves in all the horrors and calamities of war.</p>
            <p>What wisdom and calmness has our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment manifested in all its measures! Had it not been for the prudence and moderation of our government, and particularly for the well timed proclamation of our President, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might now be experiencing the ravages and desolations of an unprincipled soldiery. But, my fellow citizens, we have cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028499_0018_0FD928AE106B8978"/>
that amidst all the storms and tempests with which our political vessel has been assailed; the careful management of some of our most experienced pilots has prevented its dashing upon the rocks. Instead of blindly rushing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to war upon the abusive and mysterious conduct of Great-Britain towards us, an Envoy extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to the British court was appointed. Mr. Jay was made choice of, who whether we consider the proof he has given of his talents as a negociator, his local situation, or his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial character, is in every respect well qualified for the important trust. Let good citizens unite in their prayers that the divine blessing may attend his mission, and that war with all its concomitant evils may be banished from our coasts.</p>
            <p>But, my fellow citizens, should the British government persist in her refusal to fulfil her treaty, should she in defiance of justice, deny us indemnification for the injuries we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, should she continue in her ignominious conduct towards us, and, allow injuries and insults to go unpunished, should it be necessary to appeal to her fears and a war, notwitstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our exertions, should again be rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028499_0019_0FD92947ABF8E988"/>
have we courage and resolution suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to support us on such an occasion?</p>
            <p>In our late glorious struggle for liberty, every patriotic American felt himself interested in the cause and was willing to sacrifice life or property for the attainment of so desirable an object. It is presumed that those patriotic principles have not yet been obliterated, and that they glow with as much ardor in your breasts, and in the breasts of all free Americans, throughout the United States, on the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this day, as they did the Fourth of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six.</p>
            <p>Many of those who fought have the satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to see their children, whom perhaps they were once obliged to leave helpless and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, now growing up in the love and spirit of the same noble principles, and as if divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the sacred planet of liberty under which they were born, partaking of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and genius of the parent and shewing marks of their parents bravery in every action.</p>
            <p>Courage may be called a distinguishing trait in the American character. There is neither
