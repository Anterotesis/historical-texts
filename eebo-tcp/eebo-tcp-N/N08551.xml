         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In this addreſs to your lordſhip, where virtues are ſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, extraordinary encomiums may be well expected; and I fear I ſhall require your lordſhip's pardon for my defects; I ſhall however preſume to obſerve to you, if generoſity and greatneſs of mind, ſuperior ſenſe, learning and judgment, the nobleſt oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and fineſt behaviour, with the moſt entenſive publick ſpirit, are excellencies which deſervedly raiſe a perſon to titles and honours, they ever belong to your lordſhip as their poſſeſſor.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN an age of enquiry into things, it is not to be admired that our great legiſlators ſhould make many new laws well intended for redreſſing publick evils, however ſhort they may fall of it, in the general execution of them: for there is hardly any fence ſo ſtrong, but the fertile genius of the preſent times, by its inventions and ſtratagems, will eaſily break through it.</p>
            <p>But I do not here pretend to be a particular advocate, either for or againſt the alteration of our laws, any further than as it makes new books neceſſary; what I ſhall now attempt, is to introduce an inſtructive treatiſe, writ in the eaſieſt method, and adapted to every capacity, whereby the unſkilful, and thoſe who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in practice of the law, may in ſome meaſure be their own adviſers, and readily avoid the common errors too often happening in the proſecution of ſuits.</p>
            <p>And in this treatiſe is contained the moſt uſeful and requiſite learning in the law, for all degrees of perſons to acquire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, there being likewiſe many curious things therein not to be found in any other one law book; ſo that I may venture to ſay, the publick will here reap benefit and ſecurity to themſelves, at the ſame time attornies and ſolicitors confeſs it affords a very juſt inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Nor will theſe gentlemen, I hope, make any objection to the popularity of my title, ſince this work is not deſigned to defame or abate the profeſſion of the law, tho' it gives ſome light into it to the ordinary reader.</p>
            <p>This edition has been reviſed and corrected, and many valuable additions inſerted from the reports of the late lord chief baron <hi>Comyn;</hi> lord chief juſtice <hi>Raymond; Strange,</hi> maſter of the rolls; Mr. juſtice <hi>Foſter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> And alſo from the ſtatute law to the fourth year of the reign of his preſent Majeſty incluſive.</p>

               <p>Action of <hi>Debt</hi> is a ſuit given by law where a man oweth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certain ſum of money, by obligation, or bargain for a thing ſold, or by contract, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the debtor will not pay the debt at the day agreed; then the creditor ſhall have this action againſt him for the ſame.</p>
               <p>If money be due upon any ſpecialty, action of debt only lieth; for no other action may be brought for it: and where a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to pay money for things which he hath bought, and the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler takes bond for the money, the contract is diſcharged; ſo that he ſhall not have action of debt upon the contract, but on the bond. <hi>Nat.

               <p n="1">1. In a bond where ſeveral are bound ſeverally, the obligee may have action of debt againſt all the obligors together, or all of them apart, and have ſeveral judgments and executions; though he ſhall have ſatisfaction but once: but when the bond is joint, and not ſeveral, all the obligers muſt be ſued that are bound; and one is not obliged to anſwer without the reſt. Alſo if a bond is made to three to pay money to one of them, they muſt all join in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for they are but as one obligee. <hi>Dy.</hi> 19, 310. <hi>Yelv.</hi> 177.</p>
               <p>If there be ſeveral days mentioned for payment of money on a bond, the obligation is no forfeited, nor can be ſued until all the days are paſt: yet in ſome caſes, the obligee may bring action of debt for the money due by the bond preſently, though it be not forfeited; and by ſpecial wording the condition, an obligee may be able to ſue the penalty on the firſt default.

               <p>In action of debt brought upon a bond againſt an heir for the debt of his anceſtor, it is not good for the heir to ſay, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors have aſſets in their hands; for the obligee may ſue either heir or executor: if an heir hath aſſets, and the executor alſo, it is at the obligee's election to have action of debt againſt the one or the other; but he ſhall not charge them doubly. Debt lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the heir of an obligor, who has lands by deſcent, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors have not ſufficient: and if an heir has made over lands fallen to him by deſcent, execution ſhall be had againſt him to the value of the land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be not ſold <hi>bona fide</hi> before the action brought. <hi>Dy.</hi> 204. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 433. <hi>Ander.</hi> 7. <hi>Stat.</hi> 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>W. &amp; M. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>An executor brought error on a judgment againſt the teſtator upon bond: and after affirmance moved on ſtat. 4 <hi>Ann. c.</hi> 16. <hi>ſect.</hi> 13. to pay principal, intereſt and coſts, it was inſiſted, that as he came for a favour to ſave the penalty, it was but equitable he ſhould pay the coſts in error which he had put the plaintiff to; for if plaintiff had taken execution, equity would never puniſh him for taking thoſe expences out of the penalty.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide were cited <hi>Baynham</hi> v. <hi>Matthews,</hi> 2 <hi>Str.</hi> 871. where an executor diſcontinued without coſts. 2 <hi>Kel.</hi> 70. <hi>pl.</hi> 28.

               <p>The caſe of <hi>Sidney</hi> v. <hi>Newinſon</hi> was, That plaintiff had brought an action of debt upon bond againſt defendant as adminiſtrator, and filed a bill in equity to diſcover aſſets; and had inſtituted a ſuit in the ſpiritual court, to oblige her to give in an inventory. After judgment for the plaintiff in the action, a writ of error was brought in <hi>K. B.</hi> and the judgment reverſed. Then plaintiff brought a new action in <hi>K. B.</hi> and defendant moved to ſtay proceedings upon ſtat. 4 <hi>Ann. c.</hi> 16. <hi>ſect.</hi> 13. on paying principal, intereſt, and coſts; and now upon motion for the court's direction to the maſter in tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coſts, it was inſiſted for plaintiff, that defendant ought to pay the whole coſts of the firſt ſuit, proceedings in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and ſpiritual court.</p>
               <p>The court ſaid, that they had nothing to do to order coſts for
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010935_0005_0F852D4093D1F1B0"/>
proceedings in another court, which has no power to award coſts, if the party is intitled to them; and as to the judgment that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, there is no reaſon for defendant to pay for plaintiff's error and miſtake. The court was of opinion, the proceedings in this court muſt be ſtayed on payment of the coſts of this ſuit. <hi>Str.</hi> 699.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An action of debt lies for rent in arrear, upon a leaſe for life or years; at common law it lay not on leaſes for life, but now by ſtatute it may be had. 8 <hi>Ann. c.</hi> 14.

               <p>The remedy by the common law for rent on a leaſe for life was aſſiſe, if the plaintiff had ſeiſin, or by diſtreſs; and if tenant for life died, his executors might bring action of debt for the rent in arrear: but a new remedy is given by the above ſtatute, and that is to diſtrain. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 65. 3 <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If a rent or leaſe for years of land is reſerved and made payable at four quarter-days, the leſſor may have action of debt after the firſt day of failure; for every quarter's rent is a ſeveral debt, and diſtinct actions may be brought for each quarter. 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 81. 2 <hi>Vent.</hi> 129. An aſſignee of rent upon a leaſe for years, ſhall have debt for it: and action of debt will lie againſt a leſſee, for rent due after the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of the leaſe; for the perſonal privity of contract continues, though the privity of eſtate is gone: but it is otherwiſe, if a landlord once accepts the rent of the aſſignee, knowing of the aſſignment. <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 22, 23.</p>
               <p>When the leaſe is ended, the duty in reſpect of the rent remains, and debt lieth by reaſon of privity of contract between leſſor and leſſee. <hi>Cro. Jac.</hi> 227.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Action of debt lieth upon a parol contract by word only, and ſo doth action on the caſe: and in ſome caſes, debt will lie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no contract betwixt the party that brings the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and him againſt whom brought; for there may be a duty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by law.

               <p>If goods or money are delivered to a third perſon for my uſe, I may have action of debt or account for them. And where money is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to a perſon, to be re-delivered again, the property is altered, and debt lies: but where a horſe, or any goods are thus delivered, there action of detinue lieth.

               <p>A man agrees with a taylor to make him a ſuit of clothes, for a certain price; the taylor may bring a general action of debt againſt him for the money; but if the price is not agreed on, action of the caſe only lies, or ſpecial action of debt on the ſpecial contract. <hi>Wood's Inſt.</hi> 9th edit. 563.</p>

                  <p>As there are different kinds of bail; ſo there are divers ſorts of bail-pieces, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A common bail-piece, where the defendant is ſerved with a copy of the proceſs; this is merely to bring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant into court, and is in nature of an appearance in the court of Common Pleas. 2. A ſpecial bail-piece on a <hi>cepi corpus,</hi> or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt returned, when the defendant is actually arreſted, and the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff hath taken a bail-bond. 3. A bail-piece on an <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> in caſe a defendant lives at a great diſtance from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and a cauſe is removed out of an inferior court. 4. Bail-pieces taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commiſſioners in the country, by virtue of the ſtat. 4 <hi>W. &amp; M. c.</hi> 4.</p>

Theſe bail-pieces, if common, are to be filed in the office within ſix days after the end of the term the attorney appears: and ſpecial bail, which is taken before a judge, or by commiſſioners, when accepted, is to be filed; after 20 days notice given of putting in ſpecial bail before a judge on a <hi>cepi corpus,</hi> if there is no exception, the bail ſhall be filed in four days. Upon a <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> 28 days allowed to except againſt the bail, and after that, if it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, it ſhall be filed in four days. <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 174. <hi>Salk.</hi> 89.</p>
                  <p>Bail is not properly ſuch till it is filed; but it ſhall be accounted good, till the ſame is queſtioned and diſallowed. And when cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſors of bail are queſtioned, they muſt juſtify themſelves in open court by oath of their abilies; or before one of the judges of the court; or by affidavit before the commiſſioners as took the bail: and the court may adjudge bail ſufficient; when the plaintiff will not accept it. Alſo a defendant, with leave of the court, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit money in court inſtead of bail: and the court on motion, or a judge at his chamber, will order a common appearance to be taken, when ſpecial bail is not required. <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the defendant doth not find common or ſpecial bail, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney for the plaintiff is to call upon the ſheriff for the return of the writ; on default whereof, a rule being made for it, the ſheriff ſhall be amerced, or ſummoned before a judge to ſhew cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if on a <hi>cepi corpus</hi> no bail is returned, a rule will be made out to bring in the defendant's body. When a ſheriff hath taken good bail of the defendant, he will on a rule return a <hi>cepi,</hi> and aſſign the bail-bond to the plaintiff; which may be done by indorſement, without ſtamp, ſo as it be ſtamped before action brought thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then if the bail-bond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be forfeited, the plaintiff may bring his action on the bond in his own name. <hi>Stat.</hi> 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 <hi>An.</hi> But upon ſuch aſſignment of a bail-bond and action brought thereon, neither defendant nor bail can be arreſted on the bond, but ſerved only with a copy of the proceſs; for otherwiſe bail might be taken <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

                  <p>If a plaintiff does not declare againſt the defendant in two terms after bail is put in, the defendant may <hi>non-proſs</hi> the plaintiff, and then the bail are diſcharged; for in ſuch caſe the defendant is to go only upon common bail, by the rules of the court. If the defendant render himſelf to cuſtody in diſcharge of his bail, upon the day of the return of the ſecond writ of <hi>ſcire facias,</hi> againſt the bail, the court ſitting, the bail ſhall be diſcharged: And the bail may bring in the body of the defendant, at any time before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the <hi>alias ſcire facias,</hi> and render him up, which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the bail; but care muſt be taken that the bail-piece be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the office. <hi>Rol.

                     </gap> a general plea is drawn on a little piece of 3<hi>d.</hi> ſtamp'd paper, having only the defendant's attorney's name to it, thus: In debt, <hi>He owes nothing;</hi> or if by bond, <hi>'Tis not his deed, &amp;c.</hi> In caſe, <hi>He hath not promiſed:</hi> In treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, <hi>Not guilty,</hi> &amp;c. And ſpecial pleas are drawn up in form, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the matter pleaded at large, with a proper concluſion to the declaration or action; and muſt be ſigned by counſel; they are of two ſorts, pleas in abatement, and in bar. A plea in abatement begins, <hi>That the defendant ought not to anſwer the bill,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>it</hi> concludes in this form: <hi>Whereupon he prays judgment of the bill, or declaration aforeſaid,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>When a defendant hath pleaded, the plaintiff anſwers the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's plea, which is called a <hi>replication:</hi> This muſt contain certainty, and not vary from the declaration, but muſt purſue and maintain the cauſe of the plaintiff's action; otherwiſe it will be a departure in pleading. The defendant anſwers the plaintiff's repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by <hi>rejoinder;</hi> and it ought to be a ſufficient anſwer thereto, and enfore the matter of the bar pleaded; if he departs from the plea, the rejoinder is not good. The plaintiff may anſwer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinder by a <hi>ſurrejoinder;</hi> alſo ſometimes, though ſeldom, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings come to <hi>rebutter</hi> in anſwer to the ſurrejoinder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A faulty plea in bar, in ſome caſes is made good by a replication; and the replication may be allowed good by a rejoinder; but not where they want ſubſtance. <hi>Co.

                  <p>After all the above pleadings, there may be a <hi>demurrer</hi> in law: And where the defendant has pleaded in abatement, before he pleads directly in bar, he may demur to the plaintiff's declaration; and refer the points of law that ariſe thereupon to the judgment of the court, which determines all queſtions ariſing on ſuch demurrers. A demurrer is to be ſigned, and argued on both ſides by counſel; and when it is joined the plaintiff enters it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and paper books are delivered to the judges: And on a general demurrer, the party confeſſeth all matters of fact, that are well pleaded. Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrers alledge inſufficiency in law in the other party's declaration, plea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if ſpecial, ſay, <hi>That it ought not to be anſwered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore prays judgment:</hi> And if the matter be found inſufficient, judgment is againſt him that joined in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer;

but if it appear ſufficient, judgment is given againſt the demurrant. Where the points on a demurrer are apparent and eaſy to determine, the court will proceed to give judgment upon it preſently; but if it be doubtful or difficult, they will take time to conſider thereof, and give a day to the parties: And ſometimes all the judges of <hi>England</hi> are conſulted.</p>
                  <p>By ſtatute, no dilatory plea ſhall be received in any court of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, unleſs the truth of it be proved by affidavit, or probable matter is ſhewn: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

An action of account may be brought againſt a factor, who ſells goods and merchandizes; and if a man have a ſervant, whom he orders to receive money, the maſter ſhall have account againſt him, if he were his receiver: but an apprentice is not chargeable in action of account. <hi>Co.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A covenant between perſons muſt be to do what is lawful and poſſible, or it will not be binding: and in ſuch caſe where there is any agreement under hand and ſeal, action of covenant may be brought on it; and if one is party to a deed, his agreement to pay amounts to a covenant. 2 <hi>Mod.</hi> 91.</p>
                  <p>Upon a bond action of covenant lies, it proving an agreement; and if a perſon covenants to pay another a certain ſum of money at a day, tho' he may bring action of debt for it, yet may writ of covenant be had at his election: but when only a hand is to a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not a ſeal, covenant lieth not, but action of the caſe upon breach of the agreement.

Not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to deeds, but their executors and adminiſtrators, may take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of covenants: but there may be an agreement and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, only to be performed by the parties themſelves. <hi>Dy.</hi> 12. 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 16. <hi>Cro.

                  <p>In deeds and articles of covenant, ſometimes a clauſe for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, with a penalty, is inſerted; and other times, and more frequently bonds are given for the performance, with a ſufficient pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, ſeparate from the deed; which laſt being ſued, the jury muſt find the penalty, but on covenant the damages only. And commonly the party damnified in this action ſhall recover nothing but damages for the breach; except in real actions. <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 145.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is agreed, that one man ſhall pay 100<hi>l.</hi> to another for lands in ſuch a place, this is a mutual real covenant; and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of covenant lies, if the other party refuſes to convey, &amp;c. And when covenants are diſtinct and mutual, ſeveral actions may be brought againſt parties; but if there be mutual covenants, and the one not to be performed before a covenant precedent, there the

covenant is not ſueable till the other is performed. <hi>Sid.</hi> 423. 2 <hi>Mod.</hi> 74.</p>
                  <p>A perſon covenants expreſly to repair a houſe, and it is burnt down by lightning, or any other accident, yet he ought to repair it, or action of covenant lies againſt him; for it was in his power to have guarded againſt it by his contract, by exception, &amp;c. tho' a tenant is not ſo bound, by covenant in law. But where the uſe of a thing is demiſed, and it runs to decay, ſo that the leſſee or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant cannot have the benefit of it; for this no action of covenant lieth for the leſſee: and if the leaſe, &amp;c. is not good, there can be no covenant, or any breach. <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 349. <hi>Yelv.</hi> 19. 2 <hi>Danv. Abr.</hi> 233.</p>
                  <p>If a man makes a leaſe of lands for years, and then turns out the leſſee, he ſhall have covenant againſt the leſſor, tho' there be no expreſs covenant in the deed: but in caſe a ſtranger enters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch leſſee, the leſſee ſhall not have an action of covenant upon the ouſter, becauſe he was never a leſſee in privity to have the action; yet a ſtranger to the deed may not take advantage of a covenant. <hi>Yelv.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>A covenant for the leſſee to enjoy againſt all men, extends not to tortious acts and entries, &amp;c. for which the leſſee hath his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedy againſt the aggreſſors. If a perſon covenants in a deed, that he hath good right to grant, &amp;c. and he hath no right, it is breach of covenant, for which action of covenant lieth: and where a man by his own act diſables himſelf to perform a covenant, it is a breach thereof; and no duty or cauſe of action ariſes upon any covenant, till it be broken. <hi>Vaugh.</hi> 123. 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 21. 2 <hi>Bulſt.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>On covenants in general, if the plaintiff have judgment in an action for one breach, and afterwards the covenantor breaks his covenant again, a new action may be brought, and ſo for every breach: or in covenants perpetual, upon a new breach, a <hi>ſcire facias</hi> may be had on the former judgment, and the plaintiff need not bring any new writ of covenant. <hi>Co.

                  <p n="1">1. This action lies for any thing certain and valuable, wherein one may have a right or property; as for cattle, cloth, houſhold-goods, plate, jewels, bags of money ſealed, or cheſt of money lock'd, ſacks of corn, loads of wood, &amp;c. but for money out of a bag, or corn out of a ſack, &amp;c. detinue lies not, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

not be diſtinguiſhed from another man's corn or money; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the party muſt have an action on the caſe, &amp;c. <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 138. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 286.</p>
                  <p>The thing detained muſt be once in the poſſeſſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; which is not to be altered by act of law, as ſeizure in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, &amp;c. and the nature of the thing muſt continue without alteration, to intitle this action; ſo that if leather be made into ſhoes, or timber be uſed in building, &amp;c. the writ of detinue will not lie.

Grantees of goods, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they are to be delivered over, &amp;c. ſhall have action of detinue: and if a man bargain and ſell goods, upon condition to be void, on payment of money at a day; if he pays it, he may have detinue for the goods. <hi>Cro.

                  <p>A general action of detinue lies againſt one that finds a man's goods; though if I deliver any thing to a perſon, to re-deliver to me, and he loſes it, if another finds the thing, and delivers it to one who has right to the ſame, he is not chargeable to me in deti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: but where any goods are delivered to a man, and he delivers them to another, action of detinue may be had againſt the ſecond perſon; and if he deliver the goods to a party having right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet 'tis ſaid he is anſwerable. 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 58. 2 <hi>Danv.

                  <p>If a perſon receives goods of me for my uſe, I may take my goods again without requeſt; or if they are left or delivered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to another man, before they are delivered I may countermand the authority, and require the goods again; and may bring an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or take the goods where I find them. <hi>Co.

                     <hi>Action of trover</hi> and converſion is a ſpecial action of the caſe, lying where a man having found goods refuſeth to deliver them to the owner upon demand. Or if one hath in his poſſeſſion my goods, by delivery to him, and he ſells or uſes them without my conſent, this is a converſion for which trover lies; and ſo if he doth not actually convert them, but doth not deliver them to me on demand.</p>

finder of the goods, or any other who gets them afterwards; and an executor may bring trover for the goods of the teſtator; and either by finding or delivery of goods, as the defendant hath a lawful poſſeſſion, there muſt be a demand and refuſal to make the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but if the poſſeſſion was tortious, as if the defendant take away my hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very taking is a ſufficient proof of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, without any thing farther. <hi>Sid.</hi> 264. 3 <hi>Salk.</hi> 365.</p>
                  <p>The action of trover and converſion lieth for goods, altho' they come into the poſſeſſion of the plaintiff before the action brought, which doth not ſatisfy for the detainer, or purge the wrong: in caſe a perſon takes the horſe of another, and rides him, and then delivers the ſame to the party, he may notwithſtanding have tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it being a converſion, and re-delivery is no bar: but where a defendant generally tenders the goods, if the plaintiff refuſe to receive them, that will go in mitigation of damages; though the plaintiff may bring trover ſtill. <hi>Danv.

                  <p>One puts out cattle to paſture, and then ſells them, the buyer, may have trover againſt the farmer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he refuſes to let them go till paid for; and his remedy muſt be by action for what is due to him for depaſturing the cattle: for he may not detain them for the debt; as in caſe of an inn-keeper, or taylor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for things in their cuſtody. <hi>Cro.

                  <p>If a man finds goods, he ought not to abuſe or uſe them, for therein lies the offence, to found this action, the point of which is the converſion; in this caſe, the party finding is to deliver them on demand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he may anſwer, that he knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the plaintiff is the true owner.

Where any words are maliciouſly ſpoken of another, for which, if true, they would touch his life, or he might be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, action of ſlander lies; as to call a man traitor, robber, felon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or charge him with the committing any of theſe crimes; or to ſay of one, if he might have his will, he would do ſuch a thing, which thing is actionable. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 130. <hi>Dy.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>To reproach a perſon with a henious crime, as that he lay in wait to rob or murder any one; to charge a man with a rape, that he did raviſh or was guilty of raviſhing a certain woman; or ſay he ſhould have been hanged for a rape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and charging one with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy or buggery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being very penal by the law, for theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lieth.

Given under our hands and ſeals this 5th day of <hi>January</hi> 1756. This order was affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſeſſions upon appeal. Both the orders were removed by <hi>certiorari</hi> into the King's Bench. It was moved to quaſh the ſame. Objections taken: 1. The complaint is ſaid to be taken in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but not upon oath. 2. It is only ſaid, that he demiſed to <hi>W. Thatcher;</hi> but not ſaid for what eſtate or term. 3. It is ſtated, ſo much due for rent, but not ſaid for what term: it might be due twenty years ago. It is not ſtated to be due when <hi>Thatcher</hi> moved the goods. 4. The words of the order are, goods and <hi>cattle;</hi> of the ſtatute goods and <hi>chattels.</hi> 5. No certain time is alledged when the defendant aided and aſſiſted; only ſaid on or about the 26th, 27th, or 28th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 6, Not ſtated that <hi>Thatcher</hi> did carry off his goods: only that <hi>Biſſex</hi> did aid and aſſiſt him in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off. 7. They adjudge the complaint true, but do not ſtate the evidence, and this is a conviction, not an order: and for any thing that appears, it might be upon <hi>Clavey'</hi>s evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. 8. It is not ſtated that the goods were under the value of 50 <hi>l.</hi> which is the ground of the juſtices juriſdiction. 9. The words of the ſtatute are, if any perſon ſhall be a tenant of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments: the word uſed in the order is eſtate, which may be a thing incorporeal, or may mean the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the land, and ſo not within the ſtatute. 10. It ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whether the landlord has a right to diſtrain: by 8 <hi>An. c.</hi> 14. the landlord may diſtrain at any time within ſix months after the expiration of the term: it doth not appear theſe ſix months were not expired, and if they were, this is no offence. After conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Deniſon</hi> delivered the reſolution of the court: I think the moſt material objection is, whether this is an order or a conviction. If a conviction, the evidence ought to have been ſet out. And there has been no doubt (notwithſtanding the caſe of

So it was held by Lord <hi>Hardwicke</hi> in the caſe of <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Lloyd.</hi> 2 <hi>Stra.</hi> 996. 2 <hi>Barnard K. B.</hi> 302, 310, 338, 466. <hi>Seſſ.

M.</hi> 4 <hi>Geo.</hi> which the court ſaid was a ſtrong caſe, and muſt be conſidered as an order. I underſtood from my Lord <hi>Hardwicke,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Lloyd,</hi> that his ground of the difference was founded upon the expreſſions of the ſtatute, and not upon the penalty; as where the words of the ſtatute are, "of which he ſhall be convicted," it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued as a conviction. Here it is extremely ſtrong; the ſtatute calls it an order: and in the nature of it, it is an examination upon a complaint. If the party was never ſummoned, this court upon affidavit will grant information againſt the juſtices: but the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons need not be ſet out; and the court will intend the juſtices have done right, in caſe the contrary does not appear upon the face of the order. As to the firſt objection: this is not an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but a complaint: when the party is ſummoned, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are to be examined upon oath, but the complaint need not be upon oath. In anſwer to the ſecond objection: as the order has followed the words of the ſtatute, we will not intend it a caſe wherein the juſtices had not a juriſdiction. The court will not, in caſe of an order, intend that the juſtices have done wrong. As to the third objection: it is ſufficiently alledged in an order; his aſſiſting the tenant to carry away the goods, as it is here alledged, is ſufficient, the rent continued then to be in arrear; and the rather as the defendant might have availed himſelf of the rent paid, by proving it before the juſtices. I much doubt, whether in a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it would not be ſufficient to ſay, the rent was in arrear at ſuch a day; and I think it would lie upon the defendant to prove that the rent does not remain in arrear. As to its not being ſaid, for what time the rent was due; this is mere matter of form. As to the fifth objection: <hi>about,</hi> in common parlance, means in this caſe three days or near it. They might be three days in carrying the goods away. The days are not material, even in legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Ld. <hi>Raym.</hi> 581. and in the caſe of <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Simpſon, H.</hi> 3 <hi>Geo. Stra.</hi> 46. the day and hour in a conviction are not material.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010935_0036_0F852D60769ADDD8"/>
By this ſtatute no time is limited, when the complaint ſhall be made: it may be made at any time. Suppoſe the defendant had paid the penalty on a different complaint made, he might eaſily have ſhewn it. As to the ſixth, the anſwer is obvious; if <hi>Thatcher</hi> had not carried his goods away, the defendant could not have aided in carrying them. The ſtatute makes two offences, one carrying the goods away; the other, aiding in carrying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is only neceſſary here to ſtate the offence which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had been guilty of, which this order does in the words of the ſtatute. In the caſe of <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Monk, M.</hi> 13 <hi>Geo.</hi> 2. there was a conviction for aiding and aſſiſting in killing a buck. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that it was not charged the buck was killed. But the court held, that as the conviction was in the words of the ſtatute, it was ſufficient; and the court held they were all principals, as well thoſe that killed the buck, as thoſe that aſſiſted. And this was the caſe of a conviction. All the other objections may have this general anſwer; that in the caſe of orders, where the juſtices have juriſdiction, we will intend they have acted right; and if they have done wrong, they may be puniſhed by an information.

But in proſecuting cauſes, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deſcend to iſſue, this court cannot try it by jury; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is to be ſent into the King's Bench, and try'd there, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards remanded into the Chancery: though if there be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer in law, it ſhall be argued and adjudged here.

In ancient times this court was ordinarily exerciſed only in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal matters, and pleas of the crown: and it awards execution againſt perſons attainted or condemned by parliament, or any other court, when the record is removed, and their perſons brought thither by <hi>habeas corpus;</hi> and there pardons of offenders are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on removing the records and priſoners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This court may bail any perſon whatſoever; grants <hi>habeas corpus's</hi> to relieve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wrongfully impriſoned; reſtores freemen unjuſtly disfranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and grants prohibitions to keep other courts within their proper juriſdictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 70. 2 <hi>Danv.

               <p>The court of <hi>B.

The <hi>court of Common Pleas</hi> is one of the king's courts held in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> or other certain place: it is not to follow the king and his court, but to be held at ſome place certain; nor ſhall be removed without warning by adjournment. <hi>Stat.</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>All actions belonging to this court come here either by original, as on arreſts and outlawries; or by privilege or attachment, for or againſt privileged perſons; or out of inferior courts not of record: and all civil cauſes, real, perſonal, or mixed, are here brought and determined; tho' regularly this court cannot hold plea in any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion real or perſonal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by writ out of Chancery, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here; unleſs it be by bill for or againſt an officer, or other privileged perſon of the court. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 99, 100.</p>
               <p>The Common Pleas is ſaid to have been the only court for real cauſes concerning lands; and in perſonal and mixed actions, it hath a concurrent juriſdiction with the King's Bench: but it hath no cognizance of pleas of the crown; and common pleas are all pleas that are not ſuch. It's juriſdiction, like that of the other courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> is general, and extends throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and hither ſuits are removed out of other courts by divers writs; as by <hi>pone, recordare,</hi> writ of falſe judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 118. <hi>Forteſcue</hi> 50, 51.</p>

up to order and determine the rights and revenues, debts and dutie due to the crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Exchequer there are diver courts, conſiſting of many branches; but according to the uſual diviſion, it is divided into two parts only, for diſpatch of buſineſs. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 112, 115.</p>
               <p>This is the laſt of the four courts at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and the lord chief baron and barons are the ſovereign auditors of <hi>England,</hi> and hear and determine all cauſes in law or equity: for the judicial part of the Exchequer is a court both of law and equity; the court of law being in the office of Pleas, after the courſe of the common law, <hi>coram baronibus;</hi> and the court of equity held in the Exchequer-chamber, before the lord treaſurer, chancellor or under-treaſurer, and barons: but generally before the barons only, the lord chief baron being the chief judge. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 118.</p>
               <p>Here the proceedings are according to the practice of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, by bill and anſwer; but the plaintiff muſt ſet forth in his bill, that he is debtor or accountant to the king, though whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or not, is not material: in this court the clergy uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibit their bills for recovery of tithes; and here the attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney general brings bills againſt perſons for any matters concerning the king; alſo any perſon grieved with any proſecution on behalf of the king, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may bring his bill againſt the attorney general, and be relieved therein. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

               <p>In the court of law, all the officers, and clerks, the king's te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and farmers, all debtors and accountants of the Exchequer, are privileged to ſue and implead one another, or any ſtranger, in like manner as in the King's Bench and Common Pleas; and the writs of <hi>ſubpoena,</hi> and <hi>quo minus</hi> go into <hi>Wales,</hi> where no proceſs of the courts of <hi>B.

The <hi>Court-Baron</hi> is that court which every lord of a manor, (who in antient times were called barons,) hath within his own precinct: and a court-baron is an inſeparable incident to a manor; it muſt be held by preſcription, for it cannot be created at this day, and is to be kept on ſome part of the manor. <hi>Co.

               <p>This court is of two natures, 1. By the Common law, which is the barons or freeholders court, of which the freeholders being ſuitors are the judges. 2. By cuſtom, which is called the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary court, and concerns the cuſtomary tenants and copyholders, whereof the lord or his ſteward is judge: the court-baron may be of this double nature, or one may be without the other. The freeholders court hath juriſdiction for trying actions of debt, treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under 40 <hi>s.</hi> and may be held every three weeks; being ſomething like the county-court: but on recovery in debt, they have not power to make execution, only to diſtrain the defendant's goods, and retain them till ſatisfaction is made. The other court-baron, is for taking and paſſing of eſtates; ſurrenders, admittances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is kept but once or twice in a year, (uſually with the court-leet) unleſs it be on purpoſe to grant an eſtate, and then it may be holden as often as required. 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 26. 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 12. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 119.</p>
               <p>In this court the homage jury are to inquire that the lords do not loſe their ſervices, duties, or cuſtoms; but that the tenants make their ſuits of court; pay their rents, heriots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and keep lands and tenements in repair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every public treſpaſs may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed here by amercement on preſenting the ſame. <hi>Stat.</hi> 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>No ſteward of a leet, or court-baron, ſhall receive profits to his own uſe, that belong to the lord, on pain of 40 <hi>l.</hi> and diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</p>

the ſeveral courts, there are attornies at large; and attornies ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, belonging to this or that court only. <hi>Rol. Abr.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>By order of all the judges, attornies are to be admitted into ſome of the inns of court of chancery, and take chambers there or near, (except houſe-keepers in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter, &amp;c.</hi>) and none ſhall be ſworn an attorney until he is thus admitted: no attorney ſhall put himſelf out of the ſociety that he is of, till he is admitted of ſome other ſociety, and deliver a certificate thereof; all attornies are to be in commons the times ordered by the ſociety to which they belong, and offending therein ſhall be put out of the roll of attornies. Attachments have been granted againſt thoſe that have diſobeyed this order, in not being admitted of ſome inn of court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and attornies may be committed for any ill practices. <hi>Ord.

               <p>Action lies for a client againſt his attorney, if he appear for him without warrant; and if he pleads a plea, for which he hath not his warrant: but in caſe the attorney appears without warrant, and judgment is had againſt his client, the judgment ſhall ſtand, if the attorney be reſponſible; otherwiſe if the attorney be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible. Action lies againſt an attorney for ſuffering judgment againſt his client by <hi>nil dicit,</hi> when he had given him a warrant to plead the general iſſue; though this is underſtood where it is done by covin. Action lies not for what any attorney does generally, although he knows the plaintiff has no cauſe of action; he only acting as a ſervant in way of his profeſſion. <hi>Danv.

               <p>He, that is attorney at one time, is attorney at all times pending the plea: and the plaintiff or defendant may not change his attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, while the ſuit is depending, without leave of the court, which would reflect on the credit of attornies; not until the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney's fees are paid; and attornies and ſolicitors may detain writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which come to their hands by way of buſineſs, till their juſt fees are ſatisfied: if there be no fees due, the court will compel the delivery of them on motion, without forcing the party to an action.

               <p>Jurors are not to meddle with any matters which are not in iſſue; they are finable if unlawfully dealt with to give their verdict; tho' they are not fineable for giving a verdict contrary to the evidence, or againſt the direction of the court; for the law ſuppoſes the jury may have ſome other evidence than what was given in court; and they may not only find things of their own knowledge, but they go according to their conſciences: but in a civil cauſe, an attaint will lie againſt them, if they give a falſe or corrupt verdict. 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 147. <hi>Vaugh.</hi> 144, 149, 153.</p>
               <p>If the jury take upon them the knowledge of the law, and give a general verdict, it is good; but in caſes of difficulty they may find the ſpecial matter, and leave it to the judges to determine what law is upon the fact.

When a juror is ſworn, he may not go from the bar until the evidence is given, for any cauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without leave of the court, and having a keeper with him: and when the jury are gone from the bar, a witneſs may not be called by them to repeat the ſame evidence he gave in court. <hi>Co.

1. Trial, in its common definition, is the examination of a cauſe civil or criminal, before a judge, who has juriſdiction to try it according to the laws of the land. And the moſt general rule has been, that every trial ſhall be out of that town, precinct, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which the matter of fact triable is alledged, or the neareſt thereunto, for the better cognizance of the fact committed. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 125.</p>
                  <p>All trials for murder muſt be had in the county where the fact was done: but if the ſtroke is in one county, and the death in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the indictment may be found by the jury of the county where the party died; and there the matter be tried as well as if the ſtroke had been in the ſame county: and when an indictment is found againſt a perſon in the proper county, it may be heard and determined in any other county by ſpecial commiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a civil caſe, if a foreign iſſue which is local ſhould happen, it may be tried where the action is laid; and for that purpoſe the plaintiff may enter a ſuggeſtion on the roll, that ſuch a place in ſuch a county is next adjacent; and it ſhall be tried in the court of <hi>B. R.</hi> by a jury from that place, according to the laws of that country, which may be given in evidence. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 27. <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 247. 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Salk.</hi> 651.</p>
                  <p>Where civil cauſes are grown to iſſue, if they are to be tried in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the defendant lives not forty miles from <hi>London,</hi> in that caſe eight days notice of trial muſt be given the defendant; and if he live that diſtance from <hi>London,</hi> or further off, he muſt have fourteen days notice from the plaintiff, before he try his cauſe. But at the <hi>aſſizes</hi> eight days notice of trial is good, let the defendant live where he will; and if the defendant go to trial without ſufficient notice given him, the trial is not binding. A defendant, on due notice given, muſt go to trial, or judgment will paſs againſt him by default: and where the plaintiff will not try his cauſe in ſuch time as he ought to do, by the rules of the court; the defendant may give a rule and notice for trying the cauſe by <hi>proviſo,</hi> and ſo diſcharge himſelf of the action. 2 <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 613. <hi>Stat.</hi> 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the court ſees that one of the parties is ſurpriſed, through ſome caſualty, without any fault of his own, they may at their diſcretion put off the trial to another time, until ſuch party is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared: alſo if a defendant is not ready to try his cauſe, on pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and affidavit of the reaſons, the judge will order it to be ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till another day the ſame aſſizes; and in <hi>London</hi> until the next term, on payment of coſts. A cauſe is to be entered in the judge's book two days before the time of trial, or it ſhall not be ſet down to be try'd that term; and if the iſſue is not joined between the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:010935_0051_0F852C80941E5C30"/>
and defendant, which conſiſts of an affirmative on the one part and a denial of the charge on the other part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will not be a good trial. 2 <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 609.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To proceed to trial in the courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> after the till or writ iſſued and executed againſt the defendant, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereupon made by him, the declaration is to be drawn and delivered with an imparlance to the defendant's attorney; and it muſt be entered that term on the prothonotary's roll, and docquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the term following the plaintiff's attorney gives a rule with the ſecondary for the defendant to plead by ſuch a day, or the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff to have judgment; and the defendant having pleaded to the plaintiff's action and declaration, according to the caſe, ſo that the parties are at iſſue, the attorney for the plaintiff makes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the iſſue, and gives it to the defendant's attorney, with notice of trial; in order to which, the <hi>venire facias</hi> muſt be made out and returned by the ſheriff, and after is ſued forth the <hi>habeas corpora</hi> to bring in the jury, and the record is made up; whereupon a trial is had, and a verdict being brought in by the jury, judgment is given accordingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the defendant do not plead, but lets it go by default, then upon entering judgment, a writ of inquiry of damages is to be award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, returnable the next term, of the execution, whereof notice is to be given the defendant's attorney; which being executed, with the damages inſerted in a ſchedule annexed to the writ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the ſheriff to the prothonotary's office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and on a rule being given upon it, he taxes coſts: then it is carried to the clerk of the judgments, and on giving him the number, roll, and term that the judgment was entered, he will make out a writ of execution, either a <hi>capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> or <hi>fieri facias,</hi> for the damages and coſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the proceedings to trial at the <hi>aſſiſes,</hi> when any cauſe comes on, a <hi>diſtringas</hi> of the jury is to be firſt returned by the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, and then the record muſt be delivered to the judge's marſhal; upon which, the counſel being inſtructed with their briefs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all parties ready, the marſhal gives the record to the judge, and the cryer calls over the names of the jury, and when they are ſworn, being firſt elected by ballot, they are bid to ſtand together, and hear their charge; which done, the counſel on both ſides open the caſe, firſt of the ſide of the plaintiff, as the proof lies on him, and looking over their <hi>Breviates</hi> argue the matter in conteſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the witneſſes to prove what they aledge; and then the judge ſums up the evidence, and gives it in charge to the jury, to do impartially therein: at which time the clerk of aſſiſe, or his aſſociate, files the writ, panel and record together, and makes a
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:010935_0052_0F852C86D4F99160"/>
copy of the jury's names, and of the iſſue they are to try, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> delivers to the jury; and a bailiff being ſworn to keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meat, drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are then kept together till they all agree on the verdict.</p>
                  <p>The jury, when they are agreed, return to give in their verdict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the plaintiff is then called; and if he do not appear, a nonſuit ſhall be recorded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if he appears, the clerk aſks the jury who they find for, and what coſts, and damages, and ſo enters it on the back of the panel, and repeats it to the jury, which finiſhed the trial: and after that is over, the aſſociate delivers to the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's attorney the record with the <hi>diſtringas,</hi> and the names of the jury annexed, on the back of which he writes the ſubſtance of the verdict; then upon the back of the record is ingroſſed the <hi>poſtea,</hi> (that afterwards the plaintiff and defendant came before ſuch a judge, and the jury was elected and ſworn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and found ſuch verdict and coſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and after it is to be carried to the clerk of the <hi>poſtea's</hi> to be marked, and then 'tis delivered to the clerk of the rules, and he makes a four-days rule for judgment; which rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, if judgment be not arreſted, the record is to be carried to the maſter of the office, who will tax further coſts, when the judgment is fit to be entered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in trials at the aſſiſes, the record and <hi>diſtringas</hi> are generally kept by the aſſociate till the next term, and he indorſes the <hi>poſtea,</hi> receiving his fee for it at the trial; and then he is to be called upon for the ſame, and you proceed to have it marked, take out a rule, and ſign judgment, as before is directed, and the judgment muſt be entered on a roll: alſo if a trial is had the laſt day of term, or at the ſittings after, or the aſſiſes, judgment cannot be given thereupon until the firſt day of the next term; and judgment being entered, execution is awarded, and writs of <hi>capias ad ſatisfaciendum, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There may be new trials granted, in ſeveral caſes; as where ſufficient notice was not given the defendant of the former trial; if exceſſive damages are aſſeſſed by the jury; or a verdict is given againſt evidence; and when there was any fraud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a new trial ſhall not be had for two ſmall damages, except action of covenant is brought for a ſum certain, and the jury give damages under that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it ſhould not be granted for want of any evidence at a former trial, that the party might then have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Salk.</hi> 647.</p>

               <head>Of Eſtates in Lands and Goods, and how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; Anceſtors, heirs, Executors, and Adminiſtrators.</head>
               <p>ESTATE is that title or intereſt which a man hath in lands tenements, or other things. And eſtates are real, of lands and tenements; or perſonal, of goods and chattels; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſtinguiſhed into freeholds, that deſcend to the heir, and chattels which go to the executors: alſo ſome eſtates are made by words, and others implied by law; and the word <hi>eſtate</hi> in deeds and grants generally comprehends the whole in which the party hath an intereſt or property, and will paſs the ſame.</p>
               <p>The eſtates and lands we have in this kingdom, are obtained and held in divers manners:
<list>
                     <item>1. By diſcent and right of blood.</item>
                     <item>2. Conveyance, or grant from one man to another.</item>
                     <item>3. Antient tenures and holdings of lands.</item>

                  <hi>Diſcent</hi> is where a man hath land or other eſtate of inheritance in fee-ſimple, and dieth without making any diſpoſition thereof, but leaveth it to go (as the law calleth it) to the heir; it is a means whereby lands or tenements are derived to a man, as heir and by right of blood, from an anceſtor; and this is the worthieſt means whereby lands can be acquired. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 13, 237.</p>
               <p>In diſcents, the next and moſt worthy of blood ſhall inherit; as the male and all deſcendants from him, before the females; and the elder brother and his poſterity, before any younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A ſiſter of the whole blood ſhall be preferred before the younger brother of the half blood: but ſuch younger brother may be heir to his father or uncle; though not to a brother, for want of the whole blood. And a perſon to have land in fee-ſimple, by diſcent, muſt be Heir of the whole blood: by which rule, where lands deſcend to the ſon from the father, and he enters and dies ſeiſed, without iſſue, this land ſhall go to the heirs of the part of the father; and if there be none ſuch, it ſhall eſcheat. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 14. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And diſcent is lineal, or collateral; lineal is downwards in a right line, from grandfather to father, father to ſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the lineal heirs ſhall firſt inherit: collateral is a diſcent which ſpringeth out of the ſide of the whole blood; as the grandfather's brother, father's brother, and ſo downwards: ſo that if a man purchaſe lands in fee-ſimple,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:010935_0057_0F852C8B1CE1C898"/>
and dies without iſſue, for default of the right line, he who is next of kin in the collateral line of the whole blood, ſhall have the land, by diſcent as heir to him. In caſe of diſcents, when land deſcends on the part of the father, the heirs of the mother ſhall not inherit; and where lands deſcend on the part of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the heirs of the father ſhall not inherit: 'tis otherwiſe in caſe of purchaſe, where a ſon purchaſes lands, and dies without leaving iſſue; if there be no heirs on the part of the father, thoſe on the mother's ſide ſhall inherit the lands. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 10, 11, 13. 1 <hi>Vent.</hi> 415.</p>
               <p>Inheritances may lineally deſcend, but not aſcend; and in the right line, children ſhall inherit their anceſtors without limitation; but the anceſtors may not take from the children, for the father can never come to the lands which his ſon hath purchaſed by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal aſcent; though he may by collateral aſcent, where the land of the ſon comes to his uncle, and then to his father: in the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral line, the uncle inherits the nephew, and the nephew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The elder brother of the whole blood ſhall have land by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that is purchaſed by a middle or younger brother, if they die without iſſue: and when there is no brother or ſiſter, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhall have it as heir; but it may afterwards deſcend to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as heir to the uncle; and if after the diſcent to the uncle, the father hath iſſue another ſon or daughter, that iſſue ſhall enter upon the uncle, and hold the eſtate. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 11. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 40. <hi>Vaugh.</hi> 244.</p>
               <p>There is a difference between diſcents from father and mother to their ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ldren, and between brothers and ſiſters; a ſon or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter need be only of the blood either of father or mother, which hath the inheritance: but the brothers and ſiſters muſt be of the ſame father and mother, to inherit one another. From this it is, that if a man hath iſſue two ſons by divers venters, the younger brother of the half blood ſhall not have the land purchaſed by the elder brother, on his dying without iſſue; but the elder brother's uncle or next couſin. If a man hath two wives, and by one wife he has a ſon and a daughter, and a ſon by the other, and then dies ſeiſed of land in fee-ſimple; here, if the elder ſon die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iſſue, before actual ſeiſin, the land ſhall deſcend to the younger brother; but if the elder brother had entered, then the ſiſter ſhall have the land as heir to him. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 14, 15. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 41. <hi>Noy</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>As in diſcents one muſt be heir to him that was laſt actually ſeiſed; ſo none can inherit lands as heir, but the blood of the firſt purchaſer. Though the law takes no notice of the diſability of the father in caſe of diſcent, relating to brothers and ſiſters, as to
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010935_0058_0F852C8BDE424EB0"/>
their eſtates: a man, who had iſſue a ſon and a daughter, was attainted of treaſon, the ſon having purchaſed lands, and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue; and it was held, that notwithſtanding the attainder of the father, the daughter ſhall take by deſcent from her brother, becauſe the eſtate between them was immediate, and therefore the father's inability ſhall not hinder it. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 12. <hi>Lit.</hi> 8. 4 <hi>Leon.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>By diſcent, lands in fee-ſimple ſhall go, 1. To the eldeſt ſon as heir, and to his iſſue; the ſons firſt, in order of birth, and for want of ſons, to all the daughters equally, who are called parce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and all of them inherit as one heir. 2. If the eldeſt ſon hath no iſſue, then to his next eldeſt brother, of the whole blood, and his iſſue: and for want of a brother, to a ſiſter or ſiſters of the whole blood, and her and their iſſue. 3. If there be no brother or ſiſter, then to the uncle, and his iſſue; and for want of an uncle, to an aunt or aunts, and their iſſue. 4. And if there be no uncles or aunts, then to couſins, in the neareſt degree of conſanguinity. And where lands are purchaſed by <hi>brethren;</hi> after uncles and aunts, the land ſhall go to the father, and the half blood, and their iſſue; and for want of uncle, aunt, father and half blood, to the next of kin in the collateral line: here the half blood come in after the father, as being of the whole blood to him; tho' not to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 163, 12, <hi>&amp;c. Wood's Inſt.</hi> 221. In diſcent of <hi>eſtates tail</hi> half blood is no hindrance; for the iſſue are in <hi>per for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam doni,</hi> and always of the whole blood to the donee. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>Sometimes diſcent is by cuſtom of fee-ſimple lands to all the ſons, or to all the brothers, where one dies without iſſue, as in <hi>Gavelkind</hi> in the county of <hi>Kent:</hi> all the ſons ſhall inherit, like unto ſiſters at common law; and the heir at the age of fifteen years may give and ſell his lands, and tho' his father be attainted of treaſon or felony he ſhall inherit. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 140.</p>
               <p>And there is a cuſtomary diſcent of lands in ſome antient bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs and manors, to the youngeſt ſon, and ſometimes to the eldeſt daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>Borough Engliſh;</hi> and by other cuſtoms: but where the youngeſt ſon dies, having no iſſue, the eldeſt ſon is heir to him. <hi>Kitch.</hi> 102.</p>
               <p>As to diſcents of <hi>Borough Engliſh</hi> lands, the cuſtom goes with the land, and guides the diſcent to the youngeſt ſon; altho' there be deviſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the contrary. 2 <hi>Lev.</hi> 138.</p>
               <p>In the learning of diſcents in general, there are ſome things further to be taken notice of:
<list>
                     <item>1. Where parties are in by diſcent, or purchaſe.</item>
                     <item>2. Where diſcents toll an entry.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Diſcent being created by law, and the moſt ancient title, an heir is in by that, before a grant, or deviſe. If a man gives fee-ſimple
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010935_0058_0F852C8BDE424EB0"/>
lands by will to one who is heir at law, the deviſe is void, and he ſhall take by diſcent: and where a father deviſes his land to his wife for life, and after her deceaſe to his eldeſt ſon; tho' the ſon doth not take the eſtate preſently on the death of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhall be in by diſcent, and not by purchaſe, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſhall be void as to him. <hi>Dy.</hi> 126. <hi>Style</hi> 148.</p>
               <p>When the heir takes that which his anceſtor would have taken if living, he ſhall take it by diſcent; and not by purchaſe: but generally where an eſtate is deviſed to the heir at law, attended with a charge, as to pay money, debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch caſe he takes by purchaſe, and not by diſcent. And a man can have lands no other way than by diſcent or purchaſe. 2 <hi>Danv. Abr.</hi> 557. <hi>Lutw.</hi> 593.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A diſcent which takes away an entry is where one dies ſeiſed of lands, in which another hath right to enter, and it deſcends to his heir; ſuch diſcent ſhall take away the other's right of entry, and put him to his action for recovery thereof: but a diſcent ſhall not take away the entry of leſſee for years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who hath no freehold; and if it be of ſuch things as lie in grant; as advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, rents, commons in groſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it puts not him that hath right to his action. And tho' where a deſſeiſor dieth ſeiſed, and the law caſteth the lands upon his heir, this is a diſcent which tolls an entry at common law; by ſtatute, it is only where the diſſeiſor had peaceable poſſeſſion five years. <hi>Co.

               <p n="1">1. Feoffment is a grant or conveyance of any manors, meſſuages, lands or tenements to another in fee, to him and his heirs for ever, by the delivery of ſeiſin and poſſeſſion of the thing granted: and in every feoffment the grantor is called the feoffor, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by virtue thereof is the feoffee. And the livery and ſeiſin is made in the preſence of witneſſes, all perſons being removed from the

               <p>The deed of feoffment is our moſt ancient conveyance of lands; and is ſaid to excel the conveyance by fine and recovery: for it clears all diſſeiſins, abatements, intruſions, and other wrongful eſtates, which no other conveyance doth; and for that it is ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and publickly made, it has been of all others the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. It bars the feoffor of all preſent and future right, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral benefit, as conditions, power of revocation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys contingent uſes: but feoffment may not be of ſuch things whereof livery of ſeiſin cannot be made; the livery being a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony uſed by which the common people may ſee the paſſing or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the eſtate; and if either of the parties die before livery and ſeiſin, the feoffment will be void. <hi>Weſt.

               <p>As a feoffment is a common law conveyance, and executed by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, it makes a tranſmutation of eſtate; but a conveyance on the ſtatute of uſes, ſuch as a covenant to ſtand ſeiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes only a tranſmutation of poſſeſſion, and not of eſtate. If a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee be inrolled, but no livery made; it is no good feoffment, but the inrolment ſhall conclude the perſon to ſay that it was not his deed: but where a bargain and ſale of lands is not inrolled, and the bargainor delivers livery and ſeiſin of the land, according to the form of the deed, it has been held a good feoffment. 2 <hi>Lev.</hi> 77. <hi>Poph.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Ander.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>Where a man makes a feoffment, without any conſideration; by that the eſtate paſſes, but not the uſe, which ſhall deſcend to the heir. A feoffment in fee, made by tenant in tail, doth not give the inheritance of the tail, to the feoffee, nor is he thereby te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail; for none ſhall be ſuch but he who is comprehended in the gift made by the donor: but it gives away all the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate eſtate the feoffor had: though if leſſee for life, and the <hi>reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A deed of feoffment is always applied to a corporeal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable thing; as a houſe, or land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a feoffment of lands, to hold to the feoffee and his heirs, after the death of the feoff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

2. Leaſe and releaſe is the moſt common deed of conveyance now in uſe; to convey any right or intereſt in lands or tenements, to another who hath the poſſeſſion thereof. And this conveyance by leaſe and releaſe amounts to feoffment, the uſe drawing after it the poſſeſſion, and ſupplying the place of livery and ſeiſin, required in that deed.</p>
                  <p>In the making of it, a leaſe or bargain and ſale for a year, or ſuch like term, is firſt prepared and executed; to the intent that by virtue thereof the leſſee may be in poſſeſſion of the lands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be conveyed by the releaſe, and thereby, and by force of the ſtatute 27 <hi>H.</hi>8. <hi>c.</hi> 10. for tranſferring of uſes into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be enabled to take a grant of the reverſion and inheritance of the ſaid lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the uſe of himſelf and his heirs for ever: upon which, the releaſe is made, reciting the leaſe for a year, and declaring the uſes. And in theſe caſes, a pepper-corn rent in the leaſe for a year is a good reſervation, and ſufficient to raiſe an uſe, to make the leſſee capable of a releaſe. 2 <hi>Vent.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p>The leaſe for a year muſt have the words <hi>bargain and ſell</hi> for money; and 5<hi>s.</hi> or any other ſum, although never paid, will be a good conſideration; whereupon the bargainee for a year is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in poſſeſſion, on the executing the deed, without actual entry: but if only the words <hi>demiſe, grant, and to farm let,</hi> are uſed, in that caſe the leſſee cannot accept of a releaſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance until he hath actually entered, and is in poſſeſſion. 2 <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 435.</p>
                  <p>A leaſe and releaſe make but one conveyance, being in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of one deed: and to the perfection of this deed, it is required that he who makes the releaſe have an eſtate in himſelf, out of which the eſtate may be derived to the releſſee; the releſſee is to have an eſtate in poſſeſſion, in deed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in law, in the land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the releaſe is made, as a foundation for the releaſe; and there muſt be ſufficient words in law, not only to make the releaſe, but to create and raiſe a new eſtate, or the releaſe will not be good. It is neceſſary in all caſes where a releaſe of lands is made, that the eſtate be turned to a right, and there are two rights to the eſtate and alſo to the poſſeſſion: or elſe there muſt be privity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate between the tenant in poſſeſſion and releſſor, without which a releaſe will not operate. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 22. <hi>Mod.</hi> 252. 2 <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 435.</p>
                  <p>In caſe a releaſe be made by one, that at the time of the making thereof had no right; or to a man that at that time had nothing in the lands, ſuch releaſe is void, becauſe he ought to have a freehold, or a poſſeſſion, or privity. But if a man make a leaſe for life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder for life, and the firſt leſſee dieth; and then the leſſor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes to him in remainder, before entry, this is a good releaſe to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010935_0061_0F852C8E2263C5A0"/>
enlarge his eſtate; he having an eſtate in law capable of enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by releaſe before entry had. <hi>Noy Max.</hi> 74. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 270.</p>
                  <p>A releaſe to a man and his heirs, will paſs a fee-ſimple; and if made to a perſon and the heirs of his body, by this the releſſee hath an eſtate-tail. And where a man releaſes to another all his right which he hath in the land, without uſing any more words, as to hold to him and his heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the releſſſe hath only an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for life. <hi>Dy.</hi> 263.</p>
                  <p>Theſe releaſes, that enure by way of paſſing away an eſtate, may be made upon condition, or with a defeazance; ſo as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be contained in the releaſe, or delivered at the ſame time with it: and there may be in this deed a recital, covenant, warranty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A confirmation is in nature of a releaſe, where one having right unto lands makes a deed to him who has poſſeſſion of them, to enlarge his eſtate, or make his poſſeſſion perfect. And it is likewiſe a means whereby a voidable eſtate is made ſure and unavoidable. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 295.</p>
                  <p>And this confirmation which is often joined to leaſe and releaſe, may be for perfecting an eſtate, by making a conditional eſtate abſolute; or for increaſing it; as where an eſtate for years is made leaſe for life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or it may be for diminiſhing, by confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſtate of a tenant at a leſs rent: but the prior eſtate muſt not be void; for a confirmation will have no effect upon an eſtate that is void in law, or determined. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 301.</p>
                  <p>If tenant for life grant a rent-charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to one and his heirs, he in reverſion is to confirm it; otherwiſe it is good only for the life of tenant for life. <hi>Lit.</hi> 529.</p>

A fine is a final agreement or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon record, for the ſettling and aſſuring of lands and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, acknowledged in the king's court by the cogniſor to be the right of the cogniſee. Or it is a covenant made before juſtices and entered of record, for conveying lands, tenements, or any thing inheritable, to cut off all controverſies.</p>
                  <p>Anciently a fine was a determination of a real controverſy; but now it is generally a feigned action upon a writ of covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuppoſes a controverſy where in reality there is none, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the title that a man hath in his eſtate againſt all men; or to cut off intails, and with more certainty convey the title of lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and paſs the inheritance thereof, though it be not controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to whom we think fit. And a fine may be levied on a writ

of right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any real action: and being levied in the king's court, therefore it binds women covert, being parties, and others whom ordinarily the law diſables to act. <hi>Weſt Symb. par.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>There are four ſorts of fines: a <hi>fine ſur cognizance de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> ſingle, which is the principal, and ſureſt kind of fine, it giving preſent poſſeſſion to the cogniſee, without writ of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a <hi>fine ſur done, grant and render,</hi> called a double fine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the cogniſee after a releaſe and warranty to him by the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, grants and renders back the lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this render is ſometimes of the whole eſtate, and ſometimes of a particular eſtate with remainders over; alſo ſometimes with reſervation of rent, and clauſe of diſtreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>fine ſur cognizance de droit tantum,</hi> which is a fine executory, generally uſed to paſs a reverſion; and ſometimes made uſe of by tenant for life, to releaſe to him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: when a reverſion is paſſed by it, then it is expreſſed in the fine that the particular eſtate is in another, and the cogniſor willeth that the cognſee ſhall have the reverſion, or that the land ſhall remain to him after the other eſtate is ſpent. A <hi>fine ſur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſit</hi> is where the cogniſor is ſeiſed of the lands, and the cogniſee hath no freehold therein, but it paſſeth by the fine; it is uſed to grant away eſtates for life, or years, and is alſo executory, ſo that the cogniſee muſt enter, or have a writ of <hi>habere facias ſeiſmam</hi> to obtain poſſeſſion, if the party to whom the eſtate is limited, be not in poſſeſſion at the time of levying the fine. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 513. 2 <hi>Rep.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>recovery</hi> is <hi>fictio juris,</hi> or a formal act by conſent, uſed where a man is deſirous to cut off an eſtate-tail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the better aſſurance of lands and tenements, upon which uſes may be limited and raiſed.

                  <p>This common recovery ſuppoſes a recompence in value, to all perſons that loſt the eſtate: and it is either with ſingle, double or treble voucher.

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery with double voucher is to bar the firſt voucher, and his heirs, of every eſtate at any time in him, or any of his anceſtors, whoſe heir he is of ſuch eſtate; and all others of right to remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and reverſions dependant and expectant upon the ſame, and all leaſes and incumbrances derived out of them; alſo it will be a bar of the eſtate whereof the tenant was then ſeiſed in reverſion or remainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The recovery with treble voucher is to make a perpetual bar of the eſtate of the tenant, and of every ſuch eſtate of inheritance that at any time had been in the firſt or ſecond vouchee, or their anceſtors, whoſe heirs they are; and as well of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion thereupon depending, as of all leaſes, eſtates, charges and incumbrances, derived out of any reverſion or remainder. <hi>Co.

                  <p>In proſecuting recoveries there is a colourable ſuit; wherein there is a demandant, and a tenant, and one called to warrant upon a ſuppoſed warranty, who is the common vouchee; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant is ſuppoſed to come into court, and the common vouchee to make default; and withdraw in contempt of the court; whereupon judgment is had, that the demandant, againſt whom there is no defence, ſhall recover the land. And in a recovery with ſingle voucher, the writ of entry muſt be brought againſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail in poſſeſſion, and he is to vouch the common vouchee: but if the recovery be with double or treble voucher, then by fine, feoffment or leaſe and releaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you are to diſcontinue the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and make a tenant of the freehold of the land; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon bring the writ againſt that tenant, and he is to vouch the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail, and he the common vouchee; and then judgment is

                  <p>To every recovery there muſt be a good tenant to the <hi>praecipe,</hi> or it will be void: a recovery has been held good where a ſtranger that had nothing in the land was made tenant to the <hi>praecipe</hi> with the tenant in tail; for the ſuppoſed recompence in value ſhall go to him who loſt the eſtate. If tenant for life, and he in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in tail ſuffer a common recovery, and both vouch the common vouchee; it is no good recovery to bar the iſſue in tail, becauſe he in remainder was not tenant to the <hi>praecipe,</hi> being not in poſſeſſion. But where there is tenant for life, the remainder in tail, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or remainder in fee; if the tenant for life is impleaded by agreement, and he vouch the tenant in tail, and he vouch over the common vouchee; this will bar the remainder and reverſion in fee, though he in remainder or reverſion did never aſſent to the recovery. 2 <hi>Lil.

                  <p>The uſual ſurrender at common law is of two ſorts, a ſurrender in deed or by expreſs words in writing, when the words of the leſſee to the leſſor prove a ſufficient aſſent to give him his eſtate back again; and a ſurrender in law, being that which is wrought by operation of law, and not actual; as if leſſee for life or years take a new leaſe of the ſame land during their term, it will be a ſurrender in law of the firſt leaſe: and in ſome caſes this ſurrender is of greater force than the ſurrender in deed; for if a man make a leaſe for years to begin at a day to come, the future intereſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſurrendered by deed, becauſe there is no reverſion wherein it may drown: but if the leſſee before the day takes a new leaſe of the ſame thing, 'tis a good ſurrender in law of the former leaſe.

                  <p>This clauſe alſo proceedeth upon a ſuppoſition, which perhaps may not be true, namely, that the tenant is a man of ſubſtance; it is more likely, that if he were able to live elſewhere, he would not chuſe to hold over under ſuch circumſtances, nor perhaps would the landlord want to be rid of him: the putting him out of poſſeſſion by ſome expeditious and eaſy method, ſeemeth the more adequate remedy in this caſe alſo, in like manner as is provided in the caſe where the tenant deſerteth the premiſſes. <hi>ibid.</hi> 312.</p>

On an aſſignment of the leſſee, before acceptance of rent from the aſſignee, the leſſor may charge either the leſſee or aſſignee with the rent, at his election; tho' if he once accepts the rent from the aſſignee, knowing of the aſſignment, he cannot afterwards bring debt againſt the leſſee for rent. As the rent iſſues out of the land, the aſſignee generally who has the land, and is privy in eſtate, is debtor in reſpect thereof: yet if an aſſignment be made by an aſſignee, to any one whatever, the firſt aſſignee is not ſuable for any rent; here, if he be accepted by the leſſor, the admiſſion of one aſſignee is the admiſſion of twenty. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>An aſſignee is he who hath the whole eſtate of the aſſignor: and there is aſſignee in deed, being ſuch perſon to whom a leaſe or eſtate is aſſigned by deed; and aſſignee in law, whom the law makes ſo without deed; as an executor appointed by will is in law aſſignee to the teſtator: but if there be aſſign in deed, the aſſign in law is not allowed.

                  <p>In a will made of goods there muſt be an executor named; but not of lands only, without goods, for executors have nothing to do with the freehold. If lands are given by will, 'tis called a deviſe, and goods and chattels a legacy; and there is this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity between lands and goods given by a will, that when lands are deviſed in fee, or for life, the deviſee ſhall enter without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of others: but in caſe of goods, there muſt be the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the executor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where lands or tenements only are

                  <p>The conſtruction of wills is more favoured in law than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deed or conveyance, to fulfil the intent of the teſtator: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the teſtator is ſuppoſed to be <hi>inops conſilii,</hi> and in a hurry, and a deviſe is not a conveyance by common Law, but by the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: the deviſes before the ſtatute were by cuſtom, and as cuſtom enabled men to diſpoſe of their eſtates contrary to the common law; ſo it exempted this kind of conveyance from the regularity and propriety required in other conveyances; and thus it came to paſs that wills upon the ſtatute, in imitation of thoſe by cuſtom, gained ſuch favourable conſtruction. Words in wills are always conſtrued according to the intention of the parties that make them, as near as can be collected: but the words and intent muſt agree with the law; and if the words are inſenſible and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they are void. 3 <hi>Salk.</hi> 127, 128. <hi>Co.

A perſon, when he makes his will, ought not only to have his memory to anſwer queſtions, but to have perfect mind and memory: and one muſt have as good diſpoſing memory when he revokes his will, as when he makes it: but if there be any diſagreement of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes therein, their teſtimony is to be preferred, which depoſe that the teſtator was of ſound memory, for the ſupport of the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. <hi>Co.

                  <p>A teſtator deviſed by will all his lands, tenements and eſtate whatſoever, whereof he ſhould be poſſeſſed at the time of his death; and after this he purchaſed lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was held, that a deviſe of perſonal things was good, tho' the teſtator had them not at the time of the will; but a chattel real, as a leaſe for years, doth not paſs: and a deviſe of lands is not good, if the teſtator at that time had nothing in them. By deviſe of all a man's lands and tenements, all the lands he hath in poſſeſſion, and alſo in reverſion, do paſs: but where a perſon, having lands in fee, and other lands for years, deviſes all his lands and tenements, the fee-ſimple lands only paſs; tho' if he hath only leaſes for years, by ſuch deviſe, thoſe leaſes ſhall paſs to the deviſee. <hi>Goulſb.</hi> 93. <hi>Salk.</hi> 237. 2 <hi>Danv.

                  <p>The deviſe of all a man's inheritance carries a fee-ſimple: alſo lands given to a perſon to diſpoſe of at pleaſure, makes a fee. If there are no words of inheritance in a will, the deviſee hath no more than an eſtate during life: deviſe of all a man's eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> paſſeth an eſtate for life only, not a fee by implication. So if one wills, that another ſhall have his lands in <hi>D.</hi> and ſays not how long, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if a man deviſes land by will, paying 20 <hi>l.</hi> the deviſee hath a fee-ſimple, altho' the money be not a hundredth part of
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:010935_0081_0F852CA3DFF56580"/>
the value of the land: and yet if the deviſe be to a perſon, to the intent that he out of the profits pay ſo much to one, and ſo much to another, this is ſaid to be but an eſtate for life. <hi>Hob.</hi> 75. 2 <hi>Nelſ.

                  <p>A deviſe to a man and his heirs male makes an eſtate tail; tho' ſuch a gift in any common conveyance would be a fee-ſimple, it not being ſaid of what body. Deviſe to one who his heir for life, remainder in contingency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is good; and in theſe caſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutory deviſes, the eſtate deſcends till. the contingency happens: by way of future executory deviſe, a deviſe to an infant <hi>in ventre ſo mere</hi> ſhall take place. If a term is deviſed to <hi>A.</hi> for life, with remainder to <hi>B.</hi> this remainder is good by way of executory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, for the reſidue of the term. And a term may be deviſed to one for life, with remainders to ſeveral others for life, when all the perſons are <hi>in eſſe:</hi> though if the deviſe in remainder be to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for life, who is not then in being, no limitation of a term may be beyond ſuch eſtate; as to another and his iſſue, &amp;<hi>c.

                  <p>In wills a deviſe may be to one, to the uſe of another; and the uſe ſhall be executed: and deviſes muſt be of a thing, and to a perſon certain. Land given to a man who ſhall marry my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to a man and his children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is certain enough: but a condition in a will, that one ſhall not marry ſuch a perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is unlawful and void: if a legacy or portion is given to a woman, provided ſhe marries not without conſent of another, it is only <hi>in terrorem;</hi> unleſs the portion on ſuch marriage be limited over to ſome other perſon. A man deviſes 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to his daughter, if ſhe attain 21 years, or at that age; if ſhe dies before, the legacy is gone: here in caſe the legacy had been, to be paid her at her age of 21, then it is <hi>debitum in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But where a deviſe of lands was to one in fee, and in the ſame will the ſame lands were deviſed to another, this 'twas ſaid made them jointenants; and if a deviſe is to one perſon in fee, and to

                  <p>But a general gift of all a man's goods without any exception, though this be by deed, it is liable to ſuſpicion as fraudulent, to deceive creditors: and therefore whenever any gift ſhall be made, in ſatisfaction of debt, it is good to make it in a publick manner before neighbours; that the goods and chattels be appraiſed to the value, and the gift expreſly made in ſatisfaction of the debt; and that on the gift of the goods the donee take poſſeſſion of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 80. <hi>Hob.</hi> 230.</p>

                  <p>The gift in law is when a man is married to a woman, the law gives all the goods of the wife to the huſband by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and if a perſon be made executor of a will, on his taking upon him the executorſhip, the law gives and transfers the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the teſtator's goods to ſuch executor: though in theſe caſes, it is as it were conditional; for the huſband is liable to the debts of the wife, and the executor to the debts of the teſtator. <hi>Co.

                        </gap> quo;</hi> and if there be not one thing for another, or ſome conſideration, it is a nude contract and void in law. A covenant is an agreement made by deed in writing, between two or more, to do or not to do ſome act agreed upon betwixt them. <hi>Terms de Ley</hi> 32, 459.</p>
                  <p>Agreements are either executed already at the beginning, or executory, to be performed <hi>in futuro;</hi> and are governed by the intention of the parties: they ought to be perfect, full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, ſo as to be executed with a recompence; or give an action or other remedy for it. An agreement without ſatisfaction is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and a forced agreement of the party is accounted no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore he that did agree to the thing ſhall not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to perform it. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 290. 2 <hi>Mod.</hi> 8. <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 193. <hi>Lil. Abr.</hi> 48.</p>
                  <p>Any thing under hand and ſeal, which imports an agreement, will amount to covenant; and a <hi>proviſo</hi> by way of agreement amounts
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:010935_0085_0F852CA6D923C2B0"/>
to covenant. And a covenant is either in fact, or in law: in fact is that which is expreſly agreed between the parties, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the deed; and in law is that covenant which the law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and implies, though it be not expreſſed in words. A ſervant covenants and agrees to ſerve me a year, and I covenant to pay him a ſum of money for it; here he may have an action againſt me, although he do not ſerve me; but then I may oblige him to ſerve out the time. <hi>Lev.</hi> 155. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 204.</p>
                  <p>A covenant is no duty 'till broken: in covenants the laſt words, that are general, ſhall be expounded by the firſt words which are ſpecial and particular: and if ſome covenants in a deed are good and lawful, and others not; thoſe againſt law are void, and the other ſhall ſtand good. 2 <hi>Ventr.</hi> 218. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 287. 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>There can be articles of agreement made, to be performed only by the parties; or by them and their executors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein both of them are obliged to do ſomething, according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agreed upon.</p>

Bond or obligation is a deed in writing obligatory, whereby one doth bind himſelf to another, under his hand and ſeal, to pay a ſum of money, or do ſome other act: a bond contains an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with a penalty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a condition, which expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions what money is to be paid, or other thing to be performed, and the limited time for performance thereof; for which the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is peremptorily binding.

                  <p>A bond or obligation may be made from one to one, or two,

three or more; or be from two perſons or more, to one, two, three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a bond hath not a date, or hath a falſe or impoſſible date, if it be ſealed and delivered, it is a good obligation from the delivery: and if one binds himſelf to pay twenty pounds, but doth not ſay when it ſhall be paid, the bond is good, and money due preſently. Alſo in caſe <hi>A.</hi> binds himſelf to <hi>B.</hi> in thirty pounds to be paid to <hi>A.</hi> whereas it ſhould be to <hi>B.</hi> the obligation will be good, and the <hi>Solvendum</hi> void. 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 5. <hi>Co.

                  <p>All conditions of bonds muſt be to do things lawful and poſſible: and when the matter or thing to be done, or not to be done by a condition, is unlawful or impoſſible; or the condition is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, inſenſible or incertain, the condition is void, and in ſome caſes the obligation likewiſe. And if a thing be poſſible at the time of making the obligation, and afterward becomes impoſſible by the act of God, or of the law, or of the obligee, the obligation is diſcharged: but ſometimes an obligation may remain ſingle, where a condition is impoſſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if money be not paid according to the condition, the obligation becomes ſingle. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 120. <hi>Dy.</hi> 51. <hi>Cro.

If a duty be uncertain at firſt, to be made certain after, being in the mean time but a mere poſſibility, it can't be releaſed: but a duty

                  <p>All debts and duties may be releaſed, before or after due, by apt words. A releaſe of all manner of actions bars and diſcharges all real, perſonal and mixt actions, ſubſiſting at the time of the releaſe, and bonds, ſtatutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But not executions or writs of error; tho' a releaſe of all ſuits, will be a bar to an execution: the releaſe of all actions may not diſcharge a covenant before broken; but by releaſe of covenants, a covenant not broken may be releaſed.

A releaſe of all actions may be a good bar in account. By releaſe of all demands, all rights and titles to lands, conditions before broken or after, covenants broken, rents, annuities, debts, duties, contracts, obligations, recognizances, ſtatutes, judgments, executions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all manner of actions real and perſonal, are barred and diſcharged; for this is the beſt releaſe of all, and includes in it moſt of the others. 2 <hi>Rol.

A future act may may not be releaſed by releaſe of all demands; and a releaſe before any rent due, of all demands that the releſſor had or ſhould have againſt the releſſee, hath been adjudged not to releaſe the accruing rent. An obligation ſubſequent is not diſcharged or avoided by this releaſe: though where a man is bound in a bond to pay money at a time to come, a releaſe before will be a good bar; as it is a debt preſently, though payable afterwards. 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 152. <hi>Co.

Tenant in fee-ſimple is where one hath lands and tenements of inheritance, to hold to him and his heirs for ever: to have fee is to have an inheritance; and to have fee-ſimple implies, that it is without limitation to what heirs; but to heirs generally. And a man cannot have a greater eſtate. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Heirs</hi> makes the inheritance: and an eſtate granted, to hold a man for ever, or to him and his aſſigns for ever, is only for life, the words <hi>his heirs</hi> being wanting. A gift to one and his children, and their heirs, in a fee-ſimple to all jointly that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: though if lands be given to a man and his heir, in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, it is but for life; and the heir cannot take by diſcent, he being but one, and therefore ſhall take nothing. Where lands are given or granted to a man and his ſucceſſors, this creates no fee-ſimple; except it be to a corporation, when it doth. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>A fee-ſimple determinable upon a contingency is a fee to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents;

tho' not ſo durable as an abſolute fee: and there are ſaid to be three ſorts of fee-ſimple: fee abſolute to a man and his heirs for ever; fee-ſimple conditional, when the eſtate is defeaſible by not performing a condition; and a qualified fee, which may be defeated by a limitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a fee conditional or qualified are not properly fee-ſimple. A rent or annuity is granted to one and his heirs, this is a fee-ſimple perſonal. <hi>Vaugh.</hi> 273. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 2, 18. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 87.</p>
                  <p>At the common Law, all eſtates were fee-ſimple; and all other eſtates are derived out of it, ſo that there muſt be a fee at laſt in ſome body: but a fee-ſimple cannot be limited upon a fee-ſimple; nor may any remainder, as it is an abſolute eſtate, and nothing can be after it.

A manor is loſt where there are no cuſtomary tenants or copyholders: and if a copyhold comes into the hands of the lord, and he leaſes it for one year, or half a year or for any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, it can never be granted by copy after; and if a copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder bargains and ſells his copyhold to a leſſee for years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his copyhold is extinguiſhed. <hi>Co.

                  <p>Theſe copyhold eſtates are moſt commonly for three lives: and when any copyholder for life refuſeth to pay his rent, or upon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons refuſes to come to court and be ſworn of the homage, or to make preſentment; if he commits voluntary waſte, or cuts down timber on his copyhold lands, except it be for reparations, they are forfeitures of his copyhold: but a copyholder for life committing

                  <p>The grant of copyhold eſtates regularly paſſeth by ſurrender and admittance: a copyholder cannot transfer his intereſt to a ſtranger, otherwiſe than by ſurrender to the lord, to the uſe of him that is to have the eſtate.

                  <p>In theſe laſt kind of divorces, the wife, 'tis ſaid, ſhall receive all again that ſhe brought with her, becauſe the nullity of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ariſes through ſome impediment, and the goods of the wife were given for her advancement in marriage, which now c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To ſteal or take away any woman, having an eſtate in lands or goods, or that is heir apparent, againſt her will, and marry or defile her, is felony by ſtatute: and it is the ſame, if the taking be againſt her will, though the marriage was with her conſent.

                  <p n="1">1. Baſtardy ſignifies a defect of birth, objected to one born out of wedlock: for a baſtard is he that is born of any woman not married, ſo that his father is not known by the order of law; and therefore he ſhall not be heir, or of kin to any perſon; he being

the firſt of his family; nor ſhall he have heirs, but of his own body.</p>
                  <p>A woman is with child by a man, who afterwards marries her, and then the child is born; the child is not a baſtard: but if a man hath iſſue by a woman before marriage, and after they marry, the iſſue is a baſtard by our law; but legitimate by the civil law. In caſe one marries a wowan groſly big with child by another, and within three days after ſhe is delivered, in our law the iſſue is no baſtard; 'tis otherwiſe by the ſpiritual law: and where a child is born within a day after marriage between parties of full age, if there be no apparent impoſſibility that the huſband ſhould be the father of it, the child is not a baſtard, but ſuppoſed to be the huſband's child. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 96. <hi>Danv.

                  <p>But if the huſband be but eight or nine years of age, or if he be within the age of fourteen, the iſſue is a baſtard: ſo where a huſband is gelt, or hath loſt his genitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhews an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to get a child; but it muſt be by ſpecial matter. By the common law, if the huſband be within the four ſeas, ſo that by intendment he may converſe with his wife, and the wife hath iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, the child will not be a baſtard: but he is a baſtard who is born of a woman when her huſband is over ſea, at and from the time of the begetting to the birth of ſuch child. Where a woman lives in adultery with another, her children by ſuch other are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards; for they are born out of the limits of matrimony; though if huſband and wife conſent to live ſeparate, the children born after ſuch ſeparation ſhall be taken to be legitimate, and not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, becauſe the acceſs of the huſband ſhall be preſumed. Iſſue of a ſecond wife or huſband, the firſt being living, is a baſtard. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 244. <hi>Danv. Abr.</hi> 729. <hi>Salk.</hi> 122. 2 <hi>Salk.</hi> 483.

                  <p>It hath been held, that if a woman hath a child forty weeks and eight days after the death of her huſband, it ſhall be legitimate; the law having appointed no exact certain time for the birth of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate iſſues. And here, if a woman great with child by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer huſband, ſhall marry another man after his death, the child ſhall be the lawful child of the firſt huſband; but if the woman be privily with child, it ſhall belong to the ſecond huſband.

No conſtable, caſtellain or bailiff ſhall hold pleas of foreſts for green-hue or hunting, but the foreſter ſhall attach ſuch pleas, and preſent them to the verderors of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; who ſhall inrol them, and preſent them incloſed under their ſeals unto the chief juſtice of the foreſt, when he comes into thoſe parts to hold pleas of the foreſt, to be determined before him.</p>

And perſons committed or detained for any crime (unleſs for treaſon or felony expreſſed in the warrant as aforeſaid) in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation-time, may complain to the lord chancellor or keeper, or any judge, who upon view of the copy of commitment, or oath of its being denied, ſhall upon requeſt by ſuch perſons, or any in their behalf, atteſted and ſubſcribed by two witneſſes, grant a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> under the ſeal of their reſpective courts, returnable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and on ſervice thereof, the officer within the times before limited is to bring up ſuch priſoner before the ſaid lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor or judges, before whom the writ is made returnable, with the cauſes of his commitment; and thereupon, within two days after he ſhall be brought up, the priſoner ſhall be diſcharged from his impriſonment, on entering into recognizance with one or more ſureties, to appear in the court of king's bench the term following, or at the next aſſiſes, ſeſſions or general gaol delivery, or ſuch other court for the county where the offence is cogniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; into which court the writ, return and recognizance afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſhall be certified; unleſs it ſhall appear that the party is detained upon a legal proceſs or warrant, for ſuch matters or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which are not bailable by law.</p>

                  <p>THE nobility and peerage of this kingdom is created by the king, either by writ or letters patent. The calling up a lord by writ is the moſt antient way, and gives a fee-ſimple in a barony, to him and his heirs, without words of inheritance; but the king may limit it to heirs male, or the heirs of the body; and if he dies hefore he ſits in parliament, his blood is not ennobled: but the creation by letters patent is good, and makes the peerage ſure, tho' he never ſits in parliament; and his heirs ſhall inherit the honour, purſuant to the words of the patent. <hi>C <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>All peers of the realm are looked upon as the king's hereditary counſellors; the king and whole kingdom have an intereſt in the peerage of every lord: and the privileges belonging to our nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beyond other men are very great. The perſon of a peer, as well out as in parliament time is privileged from all arreſts, unleſs for treaſon, felony or breach of the peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this privilege is ſo extenſive in reſpect of his perſon, that the king may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain any peer of his liberty, without order of the houſe of lords, except it be in caſes of treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 52. 4 <hi>Bac.

                  <p>Peers are not to be arreſted upon mean proceſs, or on executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for debt or treſpaſs, becauſe they are preſumed not only to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the king and the publick affairs; but the law doth preſume they have ſufficient lands, in which they may be diſtrained: but they may be apprehended in criminal caſes. And tho' a peer may not be arreſted in his body, his eſtate may be ſequeſtred for debt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a proſecution after a diſſolution and prorogation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or adjornment for above fourteen days: when he refuſes to appear and anſwer, on a bill of complaint exhibited in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, Exchequer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 53. <hi>Stat.</hi> 12 &amp; 13 <hi>W.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>

There are generally four coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a county; in ſome counties fewer, and in ſome but one, according to uſage: and they are elected at the county court, in full county, by the freeholders, upon the king's writ.</p>
                  <p>Coroners are to be men of good ability, and have lands in ſee in the county where choſen, to anſwer all people; and if inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the county ſhall anſwer for them: there are alſo ſpecial coroners, within divers liberties, as well as the ordinary officers in every county; as the coroner of <hi>the Verge,</hi> which is a certain compaſs about the king's court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome corporations and colleges are licenſed by charter to appoint their coroners within their own precincts. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 174. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 271.</p>

If a coroner doth not come to inquire, having notice of the death of any perſon, he may be fined and impriſoned by the juſtices; and he ſhall be fined and impriſoned for not certifying his recognizance, and the evidence and inquiſition taken before him, to the court where they ought. 2 <hi>Rol.

And a juſtice of the peace is a judge of record, for he may take a recognizance of the peace, which none but a judge of record can do; and hence they are called juſtices, being before the 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. called conſervators of the peace.

                  <p>It is ſaid, conſtables were conſervators of the peace before juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the peace were made; but ſome of our law books mention that conſtables were only ſubordinate officers to the conſervators of the peace, as they are now to the juſtices.

of the county; and a conſtable by his original authority, for breach of the peace, and ſome miſdemeanors that are not felony, may impriſon a man. But 'tis ſafeſt and beſt, to bring offenders to a juſtice, who, as the cauſe ſhall require, will either bail or commit them to priſon. Conſtables may not lawfully take up night-walkers, on bare ſuſpicion only of their being of ill fame; if they are not found breaking the peace, or doing ſome unlawful act, &amp;c. And in <hi>London</hi> they ought to be cautious, what perſons they ſend to the compter, taken up at night, for fear of actions for falſe impriſonment. 2 <hi>Hale's Hiſt. Pl. C.</hi> 88, 89, 90.</p>
                  <p>One part of the office of conſtables is attendance upon judges of aſſize, juſtices of peace at their general and ſpecial ſeſſions, and other meetings, to execute warrants, and preſent offences upon oath; and they muſt attend at courts-leet, and on coroners, for executing warrants, &amp;c. Petty conſtables are to execute the warrants of juſtices, and not diſpute it where the juſtices hath juriſdiction, and the warrant is lawful: and being ſworn officers, they need not ſhew their warrants when they come to arreſt any one. But if the juſtice's warrant doth not ſet forth the ſpecial matter therein, it is unlawful; and if a juſtice of peace ſends a warrant to a conſtable to take up one for ſlander, &amp;c. the juſtice having no juriſdiction in ſuch caſes, the conſtable ought not to execute it; if he does, he is liable to action of falſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 76. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 291. 2 <hi>Danv. Abr.</hi> 148.</p>
                  <p>As the conſtable is the proper officer to a juſtice of peace, and bound to execute his lawful warrant; if a warrant be directed to any conſtable by name, commanding him to execute the ſame, though he is not compellable to go out of his own pariſh, yet he may if he will, and execute it in any place in the county, and ſhall be juſtified by the warrant for his ſo doing; but if the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is directed to all conſtables, &amp;c. generally, no conſtable can make execution of it out of his precinct. <hi>Salk.</hi> 175.</p>
                  <p>By warrant from a juſtice, a conſtable ſhall ſell the goods of an offender apprehended to diſcharge the expence of carrying him to gaol: if he hath no goods, then the town, where he was taken, muſt be at the expence, and the conſtable, with three or four of the principal inhabitants, may impoſe a tax on every inhabitant, &amp;c. which being allowed by a juſtice of peace, the conſtable by his warrant may levy it: and if the inhabitants refuſe to make a <hi>Rate,</hi> two juſtices may by their warrant compel them to it. <hi>Stat.</hi> 3 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Conſtables, headboroughs, &amp;c. having laid out money in their offices, they and the inhabitants may tax all perſons chargeable by the 43 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. concerning the poor, as every occupier of

                  <p>And the duty of conſtables under particular heads, extends to affrays, alehouſes, arms, arreſts, artificers, bakers, baſtardy, bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, bridges, butter, buttons, carriages, cattle, clothiers, coals, conventicles, cuſtoms, deer-ſtealing, deſerters, diſtillers, diſtreſs, drunkenneſs, dyers, eſcapes, exciſe, felons, fiſh, forcible entry, foreſtallers, game, gaming, gaol and gaolers, gunpowder, haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, hay-market, hedge-breakers, highways, horſes, hue and cry, inns, juries, labourers, land-tax, malſters, meaſures, militia, night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkers, orchards robbed, phyſicians, plague popiſh, recuſants, poſt-letters, preſentments, priſons, priſoners, riots, rogues, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, ſabbath, ſervants, ſhoemakers, ſoldiers, ſwearing, taylors, tithes, tobacco, vagrants, watch, warrants, weights, wreck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under all which heads above, the conſtable's buſineſs is chiefly in ſerving warrants, making commitments, and levying penalties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by order of juſtices.</p>

To compaſs or imagine the death of the king, queen or their eldeſt ſon and heir, is high treaſon: though it muſt be manifeſted by ſome overt act; as by providing arms to do it, conſulting to levy war againſt him, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letters to excite others to join therein, aſſembling perſons in order to impriſon or depoſe the king, or to get him into their power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe acts are ſufficient to prove that one compaſſed or imagined the death of the king, and to a man guilty of high treaſon. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 6, 12.</p>
               <p>It was formerly held that compaſſing by bare words, is not an overt-act to make this crime treaſon; but it hath been adjudged, that words are an overt-act: ſuch deliberate words as ſhew a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect purpoſe againſt the king's life, will amount to an overt-act of compaſſing or imagining the king's death; for as the compaſſing or imagining the death of the king is the treaſon, words are the moſt natural way of expreſſing the imagination of the heart, and may be good evidence of it: and any external act, which may be a manifeſtation of ſuch imagination, is an overt-act. But if words are ſet down in writing, and kept privately in a man's cloſet, they are no overt-act of treaſon, except the words are publiſhed. <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 242. <hi>Hawk. P.

               <p>Words of perſuaſion to kill the king, are overt-acts of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his death; and it is held, that he who intendeth by force to preſcribe laws to the king, and to reſtrain him of his power, doth intend to deprive him of his crown and life: that if a man be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the intention of thoſe who take up arms againſt the king, if he joins in any action with them, he is guilty of treaſon: and that the law judges every rebellion to be a plot againſt the king's life, and a depoſing him; becauſe a rebel would not ſuffer that king to reign and live, who will puniſh him for rebellion. <hi>Moor</hi> 620.</p>
               <p>Under the head of compaſſing and imagining the king's death, intention of treaſon proved by circumſtances is puniſhed as high treaſon: and men's actions are governed by their intentions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5 <hi>Mod.</hi> 206.</p>

               <p>It has been adjudged, that adhering to the king's enemies is an adhering againſt him; and this adhering to the enemies of the king out of the realm will be treaſon: one who was beyond ſea, having ſolicited a foreign prince to invade the kingdom, was held guilty of high treaſon, and triable by the Stat. 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 2.

               <p>Not only violating the queen conſort is high treaſon, but alſo her yielding and conſenting to it is treaſon in her; but this doth not extend to a queen dowager: ſo likewiſe violating the wife of the prince, is treaſon only during the marriage. And the eldeſt daughter of the king is ſuch a daughter as is eldeſt not married at the time of the violation, which will be treaſon, altho' there was an elder daughter than her, who died without iſſue; for now the elder alive has a right to the inheritance of the crown, upon a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of iſſue male. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The treaſon againſt the queen's life, mentioned in the ſtatute, muſt be alſo during the coverture; and it extendeth not to a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager queen. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

               <p>As to counterfeiting the king's ſeal, it was treaſon by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law; and the ſtatute 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. mentions only the great ſeal and privy ſeal; for the counterfeiting of the ſign manuel, or privy ſignet, is not treaſon within that act; but by 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>P. &amp; M. c.</hi> 11. Thoſe who aid and conſent to the counterfeiting of the great ſeal, are equally guilty with the actors; but an intent or going about to counterfeit the great ſeal, if it be not actually done, is not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; there muſt be an actual counterfeiting, and it is to be like the king's great ſeal. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 15. <hi>H.

raſing any thing out of a patent, and adding new matter therein; or taking off the wax impreſſed by the great ſeal from one patent, and fixing it to another, are not within this law: but here, tho' this be not a counterfeiting, it has been adjudged a miſpriſion of treaſon of the higheſt degree. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 16. <hi>Kel.</hi> 89.</p>
               <p>At common law, <hi>Forging of the king's money</hi> was treaſon; as counterfeiting it is by the Stat. 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.

                  <hi>Murder</hi> is a wilful and felonious killing of a man upon malice forethought; ſo as the party wounded or hurt die within a year and a day: and if one dies in that time, through diſorderly living, it ſhall be no excuſe, the wounds will be judged the principal cauſe of his death. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 53. <hi>H.

               <p n="1">1. In murder 'tis malice makes the crime; which is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, where it may be evidently proved there was former ill-will, and the killing is with a ſedate mind, and formed deſign of doing it; or it is implied by law, when one kills another ſuddenly, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to defend himſelf, as going over a ſtile and the like. He who doth a cruel and voluntary act, whereby death enſues, doth it of malice prepenſed and forethought, in the eſteem of the law: and if a perſon in cool blood maliciouſly and deliberately beats another in ſuch a manner, beyond any apparent intent of

chaſtiſement, that he dieth; it is murder by expreſs malice. So where a man executes his revenge, on a ſudden provocation, in ſuch a cruel manner, with a dangerous weapon, as ſhews a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious intention to do miſchief, and death follows, 'tis malice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs from the nature of the fact. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 51. <hi>H.

               <p>If one lays poiſon to kill a certain perſon, and another takes it, and dies; or if having malice to a man, ſtrikes or ſhoots at him; but miſſeth him and kills another perſon; theſe are murder: and by poiſoning, and where one killeth another without provocation, malice is implied. If one reſolves to kill the next man he meets, and does kill him, it is murder, though he knew him not; here malice is implied againſt mankind. Where two perſons meet and fight on a precedent quarrel, and one is killed; or if a perſon upon a ſudden quarrel appears to be maſter of his temper, and kills another, it will be murder: for when perſons fight after a former quarrel, it ſhall be preſumed to be out of malice; and if two men fall out in the morning and meet and fight in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, if one of them be killed, this is murder; their after-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of malice. If two perſons fight a <hi>Duel,</hi> upon ſome quarrel precedent; and one of them be killed, both principal and ſeconds are guilty of murder. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 51, 52. <hi>Kel.</hi> 27. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 578. <hi>H.

               <p>A man being provoked by words or geſtures, makes a puſh at a perſon before his ſword is drawn, and thereupon a fight enſues, wherein he who made the aſſault kills the other, this will be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but if he had made no puſh, 'till the other's ſword was drawn, it would have been only manſlaughter in the perſon killing. And if one upon a quarrel with another tell him that he will not ſtrike firſt, but will give ſuch other a pot of ale to ſtrike him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the other ſtrikes him, and he kills the other, he is guilty of murder; this being only a covert to his malicious intention. <hi>Kel.</hi> 55, 61. <hi>H P.

               <p>Where a perſon aſſaults another with malice, altho' he be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards driven by the other to the wall, and kill him there in his own defence, it is murder in reſpect of his firſt intent: but if the party aſſaulted fly to the wall, and being ſtill purſued kills the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is only manſlaughter in his own defence. If two having malice fight, and the ſervant of one of them, not knowing of the malice, killeth the other, this is murder in the maſter, and but manſlaugter in the ſervant; though when there is a conſpiracy to kill a man, but no malice againſt his ſervant, if the ſervant be ſlain, the malice againſt the maſter ſhall be conſtrued to extend to

               <p>It muſt be on a ſudden quarrel, where the party guilty doth not appear to be maſter of his temper; by talking calmly upon the quarrel, or afterwards in other diſcourſe, whereby the heat of blood may be preſumed to be cooled: therefore if two perſons meet together, and in ſtriving for the wall one of them kills the other, this is manſlaughter; ſo it is, if upon a ſudden occaſion they had gone into the fields, and fought, and one had killed the other; for all is one continued act of paſſion, on the firſt ſudden occaſion. <hi>Kel.</hi> 56. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 51, 54. <hi>H.

out, or on juſt provocation; and as to provocations, no treſpaſs, breach of a man's word, or affront by words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be thought a juſt provocation to excuſe the killing of another; though if upon ill words, as calling another ſon of a whore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both the parties ſuddenly fight, and one of them kill the other, it will be but manſlaughter; being done in a preſent heat. And if one upon angry words aſſault another, by pulling him by the noſe, and he that is aſſaulted draws his ſword, and immediately kills the other party, this is only manſlaughter; for the peace was firſt broken by the party killed, and here an indignity was offered to the ſlayer, from whence he might apprehend that there might be ſome farther deſign againſt him. If a man is taken in adultery with another perſon's wife, and the huſband preſently kills the adulterer; it is a juſt provocation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and makes it manſlaughter. <hi>Kel.</hi> 55, 131, 135. <hi>Hawk.

               <p>The difference between grand and petit larceny is only the value of the goods: and if two perſons ſteal goods to the value of 13<hi>d.</hi> it is grand larceny in both; and in caſe one at different times ſteals divers parcels of goods from the ſame perſon, which together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the value of 12<hi>d.</hi> they may be put together in one indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the offender found guilty of grand larceny; tho' this is very ſeldom done: but on the contrary, the jury ſometimes, where it is an offender's firſt offence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> find it ſpecially, as they may, that the goods are but 10<hi>d.</hi> value; ſo as to be only petit larceny, though the offender be indicted for ſtealing things of the value of 30 or 40<hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 109. <hi>H.

               <p>To make the crime of larceny, there muſt be a felonious tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or an intent of ſtealing the thing, when it comes firſt to the hands of the offender, at the very time of the receiving. If a man hath poſſeſſion of goods once lawfully, though he afterwards carry them away with an ill attention, it is no larceny: where a taylor imbezils cloth delivered to him, to make a ſuit of clothes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is no felony; nor is it where a ſervant goes away with his maſter's goods delivered to him, which is only a breach of truſt, by reaſon of the delivery; (but by ſtatute they are to be under 40<hi>s.</hi> value:) and if I lend a man a horſe to go to a certain place, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>As in theſe caſes, there is a lawful poſſeſſion by the delivery of the goods, that extenuates the offence; but if one intending to ſteal goods, get poſſeſſion of them by ejectment, replevin, or other proceſs at law unduly obtained, by falſe oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a felonious taking. And a man may commit larceny, by taking away his own goods, in the hands of another; where the owner delivers goods to a carrier, and afterwards ſecretly ſteals them from him, with an intent to charge him for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the carrier had a ſpecial property for a time. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 108, 64, 110. <hi>Kel.</hi> 43, 44. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 373.</p>

And ſo when a thief takes the purſe of a perſon, which in a fright he caſt into a buſh; and where a man endeavouring to eſcape from a robber drops his hat, &amp;c. which the highwayman takes up, it is a taking from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and in caſe a thief cuts a man's pocket, whereby his purſe falls to the ground, if he takes up the ſame, though he lets it fall again, it is robbery. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 60. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 363. <hi>H.

There muſt be penetration and emiſſion, to make this crime; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe an attempt to raviſh a woman, though it be never ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, will be an aſſault only. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 124.</p>
               <p>In rapes, it is no excuſe or mitigation of the crime, that the woman at laſt yielded to the violence, and conſented either after the fact or before, if ſuch her conſent was forced by fear of death, or of impriſonment; or that ſhe was a common ſtrumpet, for ſhe is ſtill under the protection of the law, and may be forced: but it is ſaid by ſome to be evidence of a woman's conſent, that ſhe was a common whore. And it is a ſtrong preſumption againſt a woman, that ſhe made no complaint in a reaſonable time after the fact; if ſhe conceals it for any long time, it may argue a conſent. <hi>Co.

               <p>It was formerly adjudged not to be rape to force a woman, who conceived at the time; becauſe if ſhe had not conſented, ſhe could not conceive: though this opinion hath been ſince queſtioned, by reaſon the previous violence is no way extenuated by ſuch a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſent. And it was a queſtion before 18 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a rape could be committed on a child of the age of ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years? by that ſtatute whoſoever ſhall carnally know and abuſe any woman child under the age of ten years, he ſhall ſuffer as a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, without benefit of clergy, and here it is not material whether ſuch child conſented, or were forced, but it muſt be proved that the offender entered her body, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi>190. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 393.</p>
               <p>Tho' a woman raviſhed may proſecute, and be a witneſs in her own cauſe; yet a woman's poſitive oath of a rape, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring circumſtances, is ſeldom credited: if a man can prove himſelf to be in another place, or in other company, at the time ſhe charges him with committing the fact, this will invalidate her oath: ſo if ſhe is wrong in the deſcription of the place where done, or ſwears the fact to be committed in ſuch place, to which it was impoſſible the man could have acceſs at that time; as if the room was then locked up, and the key in the keeping of another perſon, &amp;c. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 37. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 107.</p>
               <p>The aiders and abettors in committing a rape may be indicted as principal felons, whether men or women: and there is an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> of rape, which a feme covert may bring without her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. If a woman raviſhed afterwards conſents to it, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if ſhe have any, or a father, or next of kin, there being no huſband, may proſecute this appeal; alſo the criminal in ſuch caſe, may be attainted at the ſuit of the king: and if a woman conſent after, ſhe is diſabled to challenge any inheritance, dower, &amp;c. 6 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 30, 131.</p>

               <p>This ſin againſt God, nature and law, it is ſaid, was in ancient time puniſhed with burning; though others ſay with burying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: but at this day it is felony excluded clergy: and puniſhed as other felonies. It is felony both in the agent, and patient conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs the perſon on whom committed be within the age of diſcretion; and then 'tis felony in the agent only, not him: and he that doth the act is not only a principal, but thoſe that are preſent aiding and abetting him are principals. 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 36 <hi>H.

                  <hi>Perjury</hi> is a crime committed by wilful and falſe ſwearing, in any judicial proceedings, in what is material to the iſſue or cauſe in queſtion by a man's own act, or the ſubornation of others. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 194.</p>
               <p>To make an offence purjury, it muſt be wilful and deliberate, and not committed through ſurprize, inadvertency or miſtake of the queſtion; and the depoſition is to be direct and abſolute, for nothing which the party offers upon his belief is aſſignable for perjury: it muſt be falſe in expreſs words or intention; and if one knows not what he ſwears, it is a falſe oath in him, ſo that a
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:010935_0145_0F852C27603F4B78"/>

               <p>Where an oath is taken before a perſon that hath no authority to give it; or when a court hath not power to hold plea of the cauſe; there perjury cannot be committed; and if an oath be given by him who hath lawful authority, if it be not in a judicial proceeding, but in a private affair, it is not puniſhable as perjury. The forſwearing muſt be in ſomething material to the iſſue; and therefore if what a witneſs ſwears be not of any conſequence in deciding the cauſe, it may not be puniſhed as perjury: but if a falſe oath be given by a man, attended with ſuch circumſtances, that the jury are thereby induced in the giving of a verdict, he may be guilty of perjury. 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 164. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 278. <hi>Rol.

               <p>A perſon may be indicted at common law for a falſe affidavit taken before a maſter in chancery; but not on the ſtatute, becauſe this is not perjury in a matter relating to the proof of what is in iſſue: perjury by the common law may be in an immaterial thing, in an anſwer in chancery; but if one ſwear falſe to an interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in a thing not materially charged therein, it is not perjury.

but not in a conviction on the ſtatute, for there he muſt reverſe the judgment before he can be reſtored, and diſability is part of the judgment.
