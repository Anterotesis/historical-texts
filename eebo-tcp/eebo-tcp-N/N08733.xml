            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</p>

            <p>ONE peculiar excellency of the goſpel revelation is, that it opens a glorious proſpect beyond the grave, where nature can ſee nothing but darkneſs. In thoſe gloomy regions where the light of nature (that is cried up by many) can ſee nothing but perpetual night, the goſpel opens a morning which ſhall never have an evening.</p>
            <p>Many of the heathen had ſome confuſed notions of the future exiſtence of the ſoul, but they never dreampt of the reſurrection of the body: Hence when the Apoſtle Paul was at Athens, that noted ſeat of learning in the heathen world, though the Epicurean and Stoic philoſophers could hear him upon other points, yet when he came to the doctrine of the reſurrection, they <hi>mocked</hi> at it, as a matter too abſurd to deſerve a hearing. Such a miſerable guide is fleſhly wiſdom! And ſince many
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011166_0003_0F857EA178741660"/>
of the Theſſalonians had been lately turned from thoſe dark ways, the Apoſtle takes care, among other important articles, to inſtruct them in this great point, that they might not <hi>ſorrow</hi> for their Chriſtian friends, <hi>as others which have no hope.</hi> No hope of ever ſeeing or enjoying them again, as if they were loſt in the grave. He does not forbid all ſorrow; no, it is given as a mark of an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned people, when the righteous were taken away, and <hi>no man laid it to heart.</hi> Iſa. lvii. 1. Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wept over his friend Lazarus, yet an immoderate ſorrow is to be guarded againſt; <hi>for if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particular occaſion of my reading theſe words to you at this time, is the tidings I have juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the death of my dear godly mother <note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. Elizabeth Backus, of Norwich, who died January 26, 1769, in the 71ſt year of her age.</note>, though they afford many important inſtructions which deſerve the conſtant notice of every ſoul. They may naturally lead us to conſider what it is to be in Jeſus; that death is but a ſleep to ſuch, and that God will wake them up, and bring them with him in the great day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is it to be in Jeſus? For if we are not firſt in him, we cannot ſleep in him. Anſwer, 1. It is by faith to take him as our <hi>refuge</hi> from all evil. In our fallen ſtate we like the <hi>ſlayer</hi> are expoſed to the <hi>avenger</hi>'s ſtroke continually, from which no natural nor Chriſtian friends can ſecure us; our houſes are no defence, neither are the ſtrongeſt holds that nature or art can afford: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011166_0004_0F857EA229199370"/>
but the refuge which God has provided can ſecure us. The city of refuge was an eminent type of our glorious Saviour, who by his obedience and ſatisfaction has brought in an everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is unto all, and upon all them that believe; which ſecures them from the dreadful ſentence of the law: For there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus; yea his own mouth has declared, that they ſhall not come into condemnation, but are paſſed from death unto life. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 22. and viii. 1. <hi>John</hi> v. 24. Souls will not fly to this refuge till they ſee their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; hence appears the neceſſity of the law, as a ſchool-maſter to bring us to Chriſt. When Iſrael heard its thunderings from Mount Sinai, they ſaw that they ſhould <hi>die</hi> if they had not one to ſtand between God and them; and when any ſoul effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually hears the law, it is alarmed to <hi>fly for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> Heb. vi. 18. A view of which hope will make the ſoul gladly quit all its own ſtuff, that it may win Chriſt, and be found <hi>in him.</hi> Phil. iii. 8, 9. Who is alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge from every enemy.</p>
            <p>The ſtrong man armed would fain drag us to ruin, but Jeſus has conquered him, and taken away all his armour, ſo that he can't hurt any ſaint. Indeed the ſerpent will ſhew his venom at their heel; but the God of peace ſhall bruiſe him under their feet ſhortly. <hi>Rom.</hi> xvi. 20. Perſecutors often take crafty counſel againſt them, but 'tis in vain, for they are <hi>hidden ones:</hi> Their life is <hi>hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Pſa. lxxxiii. 3. Col. iii. 3. Believers are in the midſt of a world of troubles, yet God is their refuge and ſtrength, and ſuch a preſent help therein,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011166_0005_0F857EA35A2BDC10"/>
that he makes all to work together for their good. He is a wall of ſire round about them, and the glory in the midſt of them: Which leads me to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to be in Jeſus is to have a <hi>living union</hi> with him, as the branch hath with the vine. As natural life is loſt when the union between ſoul and body is diſſolved; ſo our ſpiritual life was loſt by revolting from God, and is recovered only by reconciliation and union with him. By the divine ſpirit the ſoul is cut off from nature's ſtock, and grafted into Chriſt, the true vine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have ſuch a vital union with him as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtrength and nouriſhment from him, to bring forth fruit to the Father's glory; without which union and communion, they <hi>wither,</hi> and can <hi>do nothing.</hi> Rom. xi. 24. John xv.—The great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the Gentiles ſays, <q>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</q> And again, <q>I alſo labour, ſtriving according to his working, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me mightily.</q> Thoſe who thus walk in Chriſt as they have received him, are truly happy in life, as no others are, and death is far from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a period to their felicity; ſo far from it, that it puts an end to all their toils and troubles, and brings them to their reſt. Hence obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That death is but a <hi>ſleep</hi> to thoſe who are in Jeſus. This metaphor is often uſed to deſcribe the ſaints departure. Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <q>our friend Lazarus ſleepeth.</q> The aptneſs of the ſimilitude may be ſeen in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sleep is peculiarly for the body. While that is aſleep, the thoughts often rove far and wide, and ſometimes God has appeared to and converſed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011166_0006_0F857EA39E8C1568"/>
with the ſoul while the body ſlept; ſo in this caſe, when the body returns to the earth, the ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns unto God who gave it. <hi>Eccl.</hi> xii. 7. Some have advanced a conceit of the ſoul's ſleeping with the body till the reſurrection, but that is a moſt ſtupid notion, contrary to the whole book of God. Our Saviour ſhewed to the Sadduces, that God's ſaying I <hi>am</hi> the God of Abraham, of Iſaac and of Jacob, clearly proved that they then had a <hi>living</hi> exiſtence, as well as ſhould hereafter have their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies raiſed. <hi>Luke</hi> xx. 38. And he ſaid to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent thief, <q>to-day ſhalt thou be with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</q> Alſo in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, he is ſo far from countenancing this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſhews how hell-flames will wake up the ſoul which was ſtupid before, and give it a keen ſenſe of its own torments, and apprehenſion of the ſaints happineſs, even while his brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in this world, and needed to take warning of their danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sleep is for the night, after the ſeaſon for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is cloſed. This life is often compared to a day, in which important labour and buſineſs is to be done, and it diſcovers great ſtupidity not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereto in its ſeaſon. Hence that ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, "why ſtand ye here all the day idle?" <hi>Matt.</hi> xx. 6. Jeſus ſpake and acted as a pattern for his people, when he ſaid, <q>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me while it is day; the night cometh, wherein no man can work.</q> Tho' we have not the ſame works in many reſpects to do that he had, yet each one has a work aſſigned him, by him who ſent us into the world, and whatſoever our hand findeth to do, we ought to do with our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011166_0007_0F857EA49BA20538"/>
might, ſince there is no device, work or know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge in the grave, whither we are going.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſleep of a labouring man is ſweet. It is emphatically ſo with thoſe who have laboured for God, and have ſpent their time and ſtrength in his ſervice. It is ſaid of David, that, <hi>after he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, he fell aſleep.</hi> And he ſays or himſelf, <q>thou art my hope, O Lord God; thou art my truſt from my youth; I will hope continually, and will praiſe thee more and more. I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine only. O God, thou haſt taught me from my youth; and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have declared thy wondrous works: Now alſo when I am old and grey-headed, O God, forſake me not, until I have ſhewed thy ſtrength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</q> 
               <hi>Pſa.</hi> lxxi. 5, 14, 16—18. Thus he aſcribes all the honour to God in the fulleſt manner, while he enjoys great comfort in his own ſoul, on a review of the part he had been enabled to act in life, and with a proſpect of the glorious morning when he ſhall be "brought up again from the depths of the earth." Verſe 20. A like view made Paul ſay, <q>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is at hand.</q> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 6—8.</p>
            <p>I am far from thinking that rich grace may not now as well as formerly be diſplayed, if God will, at the laſt hour, to ſuch as have ſpent their life in ſin, ſo as to give a joyful proſpect of glory; yet for ſouls to <hi>neglect the great ſalvation,</hi> with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obtaining ſuch mercy hereafter, is an evil
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011166_0008_0F857EA560785508"/>
which we have as great warnings againſt, as any one that is mentioned in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> How full to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 22 to the end, and v. 11—14? O what diſtreſs can be like <hi>mourning at the laſt,</hi> with this keen reflection, <q>how have I hated inſtruction and my heart deſpiſed reproof!</q> Hence we have that call often inculcated, <q>to-day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</q> On the other hand, Peter enforceth his exhortation to the ſaints, to give <hi>all diligence to add to their faith virtue,</hi> &amp;c. by this motive, <hi>that ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly into the everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And he thought it meet, as long as he was in this taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to <hi>ſtir them up,</hi> by putting them <hi>always in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of theſe things. 2 <hi>Peter,</hi> i. 5—13.

Indeed here the antetype goes far beyond the type, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon labourers have only a ſhort reſpite, and then return to their taſk again; but thoſe who ſleep in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, from henceforth reſt for ever from their labours, yea, and from every thing diſagreeable; for they go where the wicked <hi>ceaſe from troubling,</hi> and where the <hi>weary are at reſt.</hi> Yet 'tis far from the ſluggard's paradiſe, for while the Prophet ſhews, that, in oppoſition to all unhappineſs, the righteous are taken away <hi>from the evil to come,</hi> and <hi>enter into peace and reſt in their beds,</hi> he ſhews at the ſame time, that in diſtinction from all ſtupidity, each one is <hi>walking in his uprightneſs.</hi> Iſa. lvii. 2. The ſoul is joining with angels, and the ſpirits of juſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011166_0009_0F857EA5F66D9FD0"/>
men made perfect, while the body ſleeps in the duſt. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sleep is but for a night, to wake in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with freſh vigour: So ſhall it truly be with the ſaints. Though in this world they are often neglected or abuſed by ſuch as truſt in their wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their riches; yet Death ſhall feed upon them, and the upright ſhall have dominion over them, <hi>in the morning.</hi> Pſa. xlix. 14. O glorious morning! Then will the righteous be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> when they awake in the divine <hi>likeneſs.</hi> Pſa. xvii. 15. Which leads us to conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That God will wake up thoſe who ſleep in Jeſus, and bring them with him in the great day. This is the certain conſequence of Chriſt's death and reſurrection, which is the foundation of all our hopes. The reſurrection is not a doctrine of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but of revealed religion, and is built upon God's promiſe through his Son, who therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the error of thoſe who formerly denied this doctrine into two points; their not knowing the <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> nor the power of God. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxii. 29. Not knowing the ſcriptures, which reveal it, nor the power of God, which will perform it. And thoſe who deny the reſurrection of the body in our day, err in the ſame points; but let infidels ſet up reaſon againſt revelation ever ſo much, and ſay, <q>how can this fleſh, which moulders in the duſt, or is ſcattered in the air or water, ever be raiſed again?</q> Yet if we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again, <hi>even ſo</hi> them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him. He that gives up this doctrine forfeits the name of a Chriſtian, for if the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011166_0010_0F857EA6A81F7048"/>
dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed; and if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your ſins. <q>But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept.</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 16, 17, 20. And as ſurely as he aroſe and aſcended to heaven, ſo ſurely will he come again with power and great glory, and will ſpeak with ſuch authority, that all who are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and come forth. <hi>John</hi> v. 28, 29. That morning will be as joyful to the righteous, as it will terrible to the wicked.</p>
            <p>But how will the ſaints then appear? Our ideas thereof are very imperfect. The beloved diſciple ſays, <hi>it doth not appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him.</hi> Well that is enough for the heaven-born ſoul, whoſe language is, <q>then ſhall I be ſatisfied, when I awake in thy likeneſs!</q> Yet the Apoſtle Paul has given ſome lively deſcriptions of this affair, in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 42—44. Alluding to the quickning of ſeed that is ſown, he ſays, <q>it is ſown in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power; it is ſown a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</q> 'Tis the ſame body, though gloriouſly changed; therefore he adds, that <q>this corruptible muſt put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> And elſewhere he tells us, that the Saviour ſhall <hi>change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi> Phil. iii. 21. Then ſhall the ſaints be ſatisfied with likeneſs to him, both in body and ſoul, and he will <hi>bring them with him:</hi> None will be left behind, but all ſhall be <hi>caught up
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011166_0011_0F857EA75E9CD290"/>
together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air;</hi> and ſhall be openly acquitted and bleſſed by the great Judge; and to crown the whole, ſhall be EVER WITH THE LORD.</p>
            <p>Theſe things may teach us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The importance of looking each one to his own caſe: Are we in Jeſus or not? No queſtion can be of greater weight to us, therefore my friends paſs it not over ſlightly. Have you been made to know the dreadfulneſs of being without Chriſt, without God in the world? And have you been driven out of every other refuge, ſo as to take ſanctuary in Chriſt alone? One peculiar excellency of the knowledge of him is, that it transforms the ſoul into his likeneſs: Hence John gives this as the reaſon why the ſaints <hi>know</hi> that when he ſhall appear they ſhall be <hi>like him,</hi> namely becauſe they ſhall <hi>ſee him as he is.</hi> i. <hi>John,</hi> 3.2. The views they have of him now, through a glaſs darkly, cauſe a ſelf-loathing for their former actings againſt him, and a longing after conformity to him in heart and life: Hence they juſtly conclude, that when their views of him come to be perfect, their likeneſs will be ſo alſo; and this is the mark they ſteer for, and the prize they preſs after: Therefore the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aſſerts in the next words, that, <hi>every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as</hi> HE <hi>is pure.</hi> Have we truly this hope or not?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This doctrine may afford much ſupport and encouragement to the faithful, in all their labours and ſorrows here. Theſe are but for a day, which is ſwiftly paſſing, and though ye may bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and heat of it, yet the ſhadows of the evening draw on apace, when you ſhall reſt from your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011166_0012_0F857EA897052870"/>
and reap the happy fruits of them for ever. James's exhortation is full to this purpoſe: Having ſpoken of the ſuffering which the juſt are expoſed to in this world, he turns to them and ſays, <hi>be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: Behold the huſbandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and the latter rain. Be ye alſo patient; ſtabliſh your hearts; for the coming of the Lord draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh.</hi> Jam. v. 7, 8. Doth the huſbandman purſue his labours, and patiently go through the toils of ſummer with the hope of a future harveſt, and ſhall not the believer ſhew equal diligence and conſtancy in his father's vineyard? Did I ſay equal? Yea much greater; for the one labours for the meat that periſheth, while the other's labours are for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto them. <hi>John</hi> 6.27. The huſbandman has no certain ſecurity but that all his labours may prove fruitleſs; but the exhortation to the ſaints to be ſtedfaſt and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, always abounding in the work of the Lord, is enforced with this motive, that <hi>ye know your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 58.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What reproof may theſe things adminiſter, to thoſe who are waſting the hours of life in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſchief, inſtead of regarding the great things which concern their peace? Many behave as if they had nothing to do but to live at eaſe, and gratify the fleſh upon the fruits of others labours: But this is as contrary to the end of our being, as death is to life; for thoſe who <hi>live in pleaſure, are dead while they live.</hi> They invert the true order of things, and <hi>ſleep</hi> away the <hi>day,</hi> till ere they are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011166_0013_0F857EA903B1F7F8"/>
aware the <hi>night</hi> cometh, when no man can work. And alas! how doleful will that night be to them! An eternal night, without the leaſt reſt! They had been <hi>dreaming</hi> of many years of eaſe and merriment, till they <hi>ſlipt into deſtruction as in a moment, and are utterly conſumed with terrors.</hi> Pſa. lxxiii. 18, 19. Once they had no ears to hear the cries of the poor or of the oppreſſed, but now they will find that thoſe cries have entered into the ears of the Lord of hoſts, who will avenge their cauſe. Then thoſe who have laid up treaſure for themſelves, and have not been rich towards God, will find that the good creatures which they have abuſed ſhall be <hi>witneſs againſt them, and ſhall eat their fleſh as it were fire.</hi> Luke xii. 21. <hi>Jam.</hi> v. Ah woful caſe! Now therefore awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may think they are not waſting the day in idleneſs, becauſe they are buſily engaged; but what is it about? Why they are careful and troubled about many things, and yet neglect the one thing needful. Jeſus ſays, <hi>ſeek</hi> FIRST <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> And what a wretched plea would it be before his bar, for the ſoul to ſay, <q>I had ſo many concerns of my own, that I had no time to attend to the one thing needful!</q> A man of great note in the world, once cried out on the views of eternity, <q>alas! I have ſpent all my life in laboriouſly doing nothing!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe great truths may afford much ſupport under the loſs of Chriſtian friends. Did I ſay <hi>loſs?</hi> Muſt I not retract the expreſſion? For we are not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011166_0014_0F857EA9D3230470"/>
wont to call our weary friends loſt, when they are got to reſt in a quiet ſleep; and none ſleep ſo quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as thoſe who ſleep in Jeſus. They are beyond all danger of having their repoſe diſturbed for ever. They have done their work, and are receiving their reward; have fought the good fight, and are ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glorious victory; and ſhall we begrudge them their happineſs! Rather let us congratulate their ſafe arrival to the realms of peace. Yet what will become of us who are left behind? The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are taken away from the evil to come. The ſame day that righteous Lot went out of Sodom, fire and brimſtone deſtroyed them all; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſays, <hi>except the Lord of hoſts had left unto us a very ſmall remnant, we ſhould have been as Sodom.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then 'tis a loud call to us when any of this rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are taken away; and he is a ſtupid creature who does not <hi>lay it to heart.</hi> But what ſhall we lay to heart?</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould lay to heart the <hi>evil of ſin.</hi> Had we never known ſin, we ſhould not have known death. Sin is the cruel murderer that deſtroys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and nations, and lays our deareſt friends in the duſt; and can we mourn their departure, and yet harbour the murderer! Can we take this viper into our boſoms! All our ſorrows in life, and all the terrors of death, are but ſo many diſcoveries of what this monſter has done; and ſtill we ſee but a little part of his miſchiefs. Look to Calvery, and behold the Prince of life in the agonies of death; a ſcene which made the ſun hide its face, the earth to quake, and the rocks to rend aſunder; and ſhall not this rend our rocky hearts! For he endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this becauſe he was <hi>made ſin for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011166_0015_0F857EAA5B7EB628"/>2. Let us lay to heart that <hi>time is ſhort.</hi> Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for ever? How many are already gone? We find they are daily going, and every one muſt draw after them, as there are innumerable before them. We are all but tranſient perſons here, and are haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another world, as faſt as time can carry us; O therefore let us uſe the world as not abuſing of it, for the faſhion thereof paſſeth away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us lay to heart the vaſt importance of being <hi>always ready.</hi> The ſhortneſs of time, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of life, the terrors of death, with many other conſiderations, loudly inculcate this leſſon; but nothing can enforce it more than the glorious bleſſings which are to be enjoyed therein. What bleſſings does our Lord pronounce on thoſe who are <hi>found watching?</hi> And James ſays, <hi>behold we count them happy which endure.</hi> Them who have endured the rage of earth and hell, and have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their race with peace or with triumph, we count them happy: Well, ſays he, <hi>my brethren, take them for an example of ſuffering affliction and of patience.</hi> Jam. v. 10, 11. Balaam wiſhed to die the death of the righteous, but his deſires were vain, while he ſtill loved the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. True deſires to die their death, will engage us to live their life.</p>
            <p>Theſe things deſerve the conſtant regard of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, and they call for our ſpecial and particular notice, who have been lately bereaved of a godly relative. Paul ſpeaks of ſome who were <hi>in Chriſt before him:</hi> And I have abundant reaſon to think that my dear Mother was in Chriſt before I was born; and when he granted a glorious viſitation of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011166_0016_0F857EAC7801B520"/>
his ſpiritual preſence to this land, in the year 1741, is was as welcome and joyful a ſeaſon to her as his perſonal coming was to Elizabeth of old. O how freely did ſhe ſpeak of the wonders of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming grace, to her children and others round! And I believe very few have lived with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant devotedneſs to God than ſhe has done ever ſince. Many may doubtleſs be apt to attribute this to the power of natural affection; and I am not inſenſible that the dead are often extalled extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly; but ſhall others lies make us afraid to ſpeak the truth, and cauſe us to cover with obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thoſe whom God ſays ſhall be in <hi>everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance?</hi> Pſa. cxii. 6. Yet I am not going to advance any encomiums of my own, only ſhall beg leave preſently to annex a few of her own teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to vital religion, which I truſt will juſtify what I have now ſaid. In the mean time, my brethren, may all your prayers be unto God for us who are bereaved, that we may rightly improve this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that we may neither deſpiſe his chaſtnings, nor faint under his rebukes.</p>
            <p>The ſtroke is aggravated by our diſtance, which prevented our knowing any thing of Death's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach till ſhe is gone. O affecting thought! Gone ſo that we ſhall ſee her face no more; no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her delightful and inſtructive converſation. But ſtay; is ſhe gone from our world of ſin and ſnares? gone from our grovelling converſe, to join the general aſſembly above, and can we wiſh her back again!</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Ye then that mourn, ſuppreſs the pious tear;</l>
               <l>"You wiſh her out of Heaven to wiſh her here."</l>
            </q>
            <p>Yet ſurely we have cauſe to be humbled under
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011166_0017_0F857EAD237F5760"/>
God's mighty hand, which has given this ſtroke; and oh that the bitterneſs of this ſtroke might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter ſin to our ſouls! May it bring eternal things in nearer view, and rouze us all from our ſtupidity, ſo that we may no more be ſlothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX, CONTAINING SOME Memories of Mrs. BACKUS's Life.</head>
            <p>MRS. ELIZABETH BACKUS was deſcended from one of the firſt planters of <hi>Norwich;</hi> and was born there on <hi>April</hi> 6, 1698. Her father, Mr. JOHN TRACY, was a man eminent for vital and practical religion, who died on <hi>March</hi> 27, 1726, with ſuch comfortable views of another world, that he charged his friends to give him up, and not hold him any longer with their prayers. He was very ſtrict in the religious education of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which this daughter of his was ever thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for as long as ſhe lived; yet ſhe was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that none of theſe things would ſtand her in ſtead in the trying day, without a new heart; and ſhe has often mentioned to her children a work of conviction and converſion which ſhe experienced about the year 1721. And though I have not met with any record thereof, yet in an old paper I find ſhe has ſet down ſome hints of her ſoul-exerciſes afterwards, which diſcover an early concern to have her heart as well as life conformed to God. In <hi>April</hi> 1725 ſhe writes thus; <q>by afflictions of late I have been awakened to ſee I have been aſleep, and I deſire to be humbled for my ſin, and do deſire the Lord would go on ſtill to awaken me,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011166_0019_0F857EAE3A9E68A0"/>
and give me a humble, meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</q> And ſhe ſets down this paſſage from Mr. <hi>Wilcox:</hi> 
               <q>It is well for us that it is ill with us; if it were not bad, it would be worſe. We ought to be thankful to God for croſſing us; for woe be to us if he let us alone; it is ten to one but hearts deſires and lean ſouls would go together.</q> To which ſhe ſubjoins theſe words: <q>Some time ago I met with ſome croſſes, which overcame me with melancholy, and almoſt diſabled me for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any duty: I happened to ſee a paſſage in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s treatiſe about overmuch ſorrow, which convicted me of my ſin in this matter: It was this; the cauſe, ſays he, is ſinful impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: Diſcontents and cares proceed from a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love of ſome bodily intereſt, and not taking Heaven for a ſatisfying portion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She was married to Mr. SAMUEL BACKUS <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 18, 1716, with whom ſhe lived in great ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as conſiderable proſperity, till he was taken away on <hi>November</hi> 24, 1740, when ſhe was left with eleven children, the youngeſt being not ſix weeks old, and ſhe in ſo weakly a ſtate as not to be able to go to meeting till the next ſummer. However ſhe then found the truth of that word, <hi>though weeping endureth for a night, joy cometh in the morning.</hi> The morning of that glorious day of grace, in 1741, ſhed its kind beams on her family, (as well as through the land) and hopefully brought a great part of her children to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of HIM, who is a father of the fatherleſs, as well as a judge of the widows, in his holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Some brief account of theſe things I find
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011166_0020_0F857EAEFB789FE8"/>
written with her own hand thus; <q>In the fall of the year 1740 we were all taken ſick with the meaſles, and it pleaſed God to afflict me in taking away my huſband. And now in this time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs I ſaw ſo much of the evil and wickedneſs of my own heart, that I thought God was juſtly afflicting of me: I ſaw I had been aſleep.—As I was walking in my houſe in great heavineſs, theſe words were caſt into my mind: <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation:</hi> They turned in my mind an hundred times, and were of great ſupport to me. Again, as I was muſing on my own and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily's circumſtances at preſent (being now left a widow, with many ſmall children) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with what it had been in times paſt, I found diſcontent to ariſe in my heart; but all on a ſudden it darted in my mind, what is required in the tenth commandment? Why ſurely it requireth full contentment with our own condition. Theſe words turned in my mind many times, until I felt a calm within, and I ſaid, ſurely I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to bleſs God's name for his goodneſs to me.— And now ſome months after this having examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my caſe often, and comparing the caſe of my ſoul now with what it had been in months paſt, I could freely ſay from my heart, I could not be willing to be again in that ſleepy ſtate of ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the things that concern my everlaſting peace, no not to be in the moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous condition in temporal things that ever I was in all my life. Now I can ſay, I hunger and thirſt after the word, it is the delight of my ſoul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011166_0021_0F857EAFB7E088F0"/>Thus our dear mother was taught and upheld by the divine hand, in the midſt of an evil world; and has lived a little beyond threeſcore years and ten. Her poſterity have increaſed to threeſcore, 52 of which are now living. I lived with her, till I was called away to preach the goſpel among the people to whom, after my poor manner, I ſtill miniſter; upon which our correſpondence by letter began, whereof I will give the reader ſome copies and extracts, whereby he may be enabled to form ſome judgment of her manner of living.</p>

               <p>'TIS with a great deal of ſatisfaction I ſit down to write a line to you, though I am full of pain and weakneſs. Your aunt <hi>Anne</hi> is gone before; Oh that I may be ready to follow after! I have not been abroad ſince laſt fall but three times. I went to ſee my ſiſter before her death: It was trying to nature, and yet comfortable, to ſee her courage in death <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>This was Capt. <hi>Richard Hide</hi>'s wife. My brother's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame date ſays, <q>Aunt <hi>Anne Hyde</hi> died the 20th inſt. after a long and lingering illneſs, in which ſhe manifeſted great calmneſs of mind, and aſſurance of her well-being in another world; and ſeemed to leave her family as freely as if it were only for a ſhort journey, and then expected to meet them again.</q>

                     <p>Theſe are the words of my brother <hi>Simon Backus,</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary behaviour had rendered him very dear to many; but death, which ſpares none, took him away in the midſt of his days, by a conſumption. He died in a comfortable frame, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 16, 1764, aged 35.</p>

               <p>—I HAVE been tried without and within. In <hi>October</hi> 4 I had a clear view of the all-ſeeing preſence of God, that it fills heaven and earth, and the room where I was, and I ſaw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a loathſome creature; and I could ſay with <hi>Job, now mine eye ſeeth thee, I abhor myſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Now I ſee I had been living to myſelf, and working for myſelf, when God's glory ſhould have been all my aim.

               <p>Mother's growing infirmities prevented her writing much more, ſo that I had but two or three ſhort letters from her after this; in one of which ſhe ſays, <q>O! God is good to me! He cometh over the mount of my ſins, and ſpeaks peace; once by this word, <hi>I have choſen you in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of affliction.</hi>
                  </q> And in the laſt I ever had from her ſhe ſays, <q>I am here yet dragging along the poor remains of life, and oh how many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies! I have cauſe to ſing of mercy as well as judgment.</q> About a month before ſhe left the world ſhe had ſuch an ill turn, that it was thought ſhe could not continue long, after which ſhe had ſome revival, whereupon, as a letter informs me, <q>ſhe ſaid to one of the brethren of the church who came to ſee her, ſhe deſired his prayers for her, ſince it ſeemed ſhe muſt come back into this world again, for a little ſeaſon, that God would enable her to ſpend all to his glory. She ſaid, if it had been God's will, ſhe ſhould rather have gone and left the world.</q> Mother had an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſhe ſhould drop away ſuddenly, and my brother, who lived with her, ſays, ſhe often told him, when going to bed, where he might find her grave cloaths on any ſudden occaſion; and ſuch an occaſion he had on <hi>January</hi> 26, 1769; when after ſleeping a good part of the night, ſhe awaked about five in the morning with a coughing turn, and dropped way ſo ſoon, that her children in the other part of the houſe had but juſt time to get in to ſee her breath her laſt. I ſhall beg leave to cloſe the whole with an addreſs to my relations.</p>

                  <salute>My beloved Friends,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE ventured ſo far to diſcloſe intimate friendſhip, as to give a few extracts, and ſome whole copies of letters, which in the courſe of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years I have received from my dear mother; the originals of which, in her own hand-writing, you are welcome to ſee when you pleaſe. The tedious diſtance of fourſcore miles deprived me of the privilege of daily converſe with her, and of that enjoyment of her edifying example which others of you were favoured with; yet that diſadvantage is now in ſome meaſure balanced with above fifty kind epiſtles, wherein ſhe being dead yet ſpeaketh. Thus a kind Providence makes all things to work for our good. Had it not been for our former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſhould doubtleſs have been now more deprived of her company than I am; for I ſuppoſe ſhe rarely if ever wrote to any that were near; and I am fully perſuaded, that no others can draw her true picture ſo well as her own pen hath done it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her little practice in writing. Others might no doubt have ſet her off with more polite language, and in more gaudy colours; but that, like <hi>paint,</hi> mars true beauty. I ſhall deſire you to paſs by her expreſſions of ſtrong affection for a poor child, and fix your attention upon the lively features which ſhe has exhibited of a SINCERE CHRISTIAN.</p>
               <p>What an union and due proportion appears in her of thoſe two great points, a truſt alone in Chriſt's righteouſneſs, with a ſtrict regard to holineſs? Who can more fully renounce all kind of dependence on their own doings, than ſhe often does? Yet let the legaleſt produce an inſtance, if he can, of a more ſtrict and conſtant regard to a holy life, than ſhe
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:011166_0033_0F857EB8E31863E8"/>
has ſhewn. Again, here is a ſtrong aſſurance unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great diligence. How unſhaken was her confidence in her great Redeemer, which made her often ſay, "death is no terror to me;" while ſhe ſtill ſaw the <q>awfulneſs of trifling away time, and that a Chriſtian cannot enjoy God, and live in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the world?</q> She had higher motives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her to improve time well than the fear of periſhing. Here alſo appears true humility, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing of divine bounty. A feigned hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility often moves perſons to deny or undervalue what God has wrought for them, or by them; while pride will influence the creature to take the creator's gifts to ſet off ſelf with. Few I believe have ſteered clearer of thoſe extreams than our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend; and the nearer ſhe got to heaven, the lower ſhe lay before God and man; ſeeing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf "a lothſome creature:" Not becauſe ſhe had fallen into any outward ſcandal; no, but becauſe ſhe had been <q>working for ſelf, when God's glory ſhould have been <hi>all</hi> her aim:</q> Therefore ſhe could ſay, I abhor myſelf; while her hope was ſtill firm in Chriſt. Hence what a harmony do we here ſee between godly ſorrow and ſpiritual joy! Thoſe ſcriptures were eminently verified in her life, <hi>we glory in tribulation;</hi> and, <hi>as ſorrowful, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rejoicing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miſtake me not, my friends, as though I was aiming to garniſh the ſepulchre of a deceaſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. My aim is as much above any ſuch thing, as the poet's plan was above the <hi>painter</hi>'s work, with regard to Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi>

<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:011166_0034_0F857EB9B4379978"/>
your attention to the <hi>beauties of holineſs,</hi> which ſhined in her, that you may <hi>imitate</hi> her lively and lovely example. One of the moſt artful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that the enemies to the power of godlineſs have taken in our day, to promote their ſoul-deſtroying ſchemes, has been by repreſenting, that the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Holy Ghoſt, and his quickning and comforting influences, which thoſe ſaints enjoyed that we read of in the bible, were favours peculiar to the days of inſpiration, or to the ſcenes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, and not to be expected in theſe times of reaſon and liberty; but as ſuch notions are directly contrary to the current of ſcripture, and exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the language of thoſe hypocrites who ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath forſaken the earth, and the Lord ſeeth us not,</hi> Ezek. ix. 9; ſo the Lord hath not left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without a number of witneſſes, even in theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious times, to the divine reality of his ſpiritual, life-giving and ſoul-comforting preſence with and in his ſaints; among which I believe this mother in our Iſrael ought to be reckoned as one: Whoſe teſtimony therefore, I think, ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten nor concealed; eſpecially among her numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poſterity, who are doubtleſs willing to enjoy the temporal legacies which ſhe has left them: And can one of them be willing to miſs of this <hi>good part which ſhall not be taken away!</hi> We are all in an evil world, where we are conſtantly expoſed to
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:011166_0035_0F857EBA19C3DEF8"/>
changes, troubles and death: And who would not think it a great favour, if ſeized with extremity of pain, to have, <q>ſweet views and foretaſtes of God's love, and of the glorious manſions above, ſo that death ſhould be <hi>no terror</hi> to them?</q> or upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fall or ſurprize, to have their <q>ſenſes all the while, and a ſweet calm and peace of mind, ſo as to feel as well pleaſed and contented with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, as if viſiting near friends?</q> What are all the kingdoms and glories of this world in compariſon with ſuch enjoyments! Well, my friends, this happineſs, and more than tongue can expreſs, is freely held forth in the goſpel, and the call is, <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good!</hi> And ever remember that you are to come and eat <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money and without price.</hi> In Chriſt there is the <hi>gift of righteouſneſs</hi> to deliver from our greateſt guilt, and <hi>abundance of grace</hi> to cleanſe our ſouls, and ſupply all our needs, ſo as to make us holy and happy for ever.</p>
               <p>Man's foundation error is, an imagination that there is ſomething better than the will of God; ſome <hi>way</hi> better at preſent to walk in than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and ſome <hi>intereſt</hi> better than to be at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. This evil imagination moves us to go aſtray, and to turn every one to his own way, inſtead of ſubmitting to divine government; but the <hi>natural</hi> as well as <hi>moral</hi> conſequence of ſuch conduct can't poſſibly be any other than miſery; for when we purſue a ſeparate intereſt of our own, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defend it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt all dangers and enemies. And oh! how dreadful the taſk! How inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the burthen!</p>

But oh, how good is my Lord to me, who does many a time ſpeak a word to my ſoul, that gives it a lift, with a view of the ſtability of the covenant, of his faithfulneſs and loving kindneſs, and the ſweetneſs of his <hi>kingly power in ſubduing us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!</hi> Praiſed be his name.</q> Take notice that his <hi>kingly power in ſubduing us to himſelf</hi> is <hi>ſweet</hi> to the gracious ſoul. So in a letter already recited ſhe ſays, <q>I ſaw there was no ſafety at home nor abroad, but only in ſubjection and ſubmiſſion to the mind and will of God: And this is what I want every day that I live.</q> And ſurely we all need it as much as ſhe did. And oh! my brethren and friends, let us all remember the doleful caſe of the Jews, who boaſted of being Abraham's children and Moſes' diſciples, while they neither believed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes' writings, nor performed Abraham's works. <hi>John</hi> v. 46. and viii. 39. It is undoubtedly a great privilege to be born of pious parents; and the greateſt thing in it is, the enjoyment of their prayers, inſtruction and influence concerning the way wherein we ſhould go: Conſequently thoſe children who diſregard the ſame, will have the greater condemnation. How inexcuſable then ſhall we be found, if any of us neglect the great ſalvation exhibited in the goſpel, which has been clearly ſet before us, not only by public preaching, but alſo by lively examples of near friends! On the other hand, thoſe who are not ſlothful, but followers of them
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:011166_0037_0F857EBD41DC8830"/>
who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes, they will find, that though their preſent parting is grievous, yet their meeting hereafter will be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when they ſhall be <hi>caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: And ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.
