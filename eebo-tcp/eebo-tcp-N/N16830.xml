            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Remarks on the unfriendly aſperſions caſt upon the Baptiſts, for refuſing communion with other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—The goſpel doctrine of a church, and qualification of the members—With ſtrictures on Baptiſm.</head>
            <p>THE Baptiſt churches in general, have long been blamed for holding and practiſing what is commonly called <hi>cloſe communion,</hi> as if wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with <hi>chriſtian charity,</hi> or that <hi>mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance</hi> which the goſpel requires: and by ſome it is conſidered as incompatible with the exiſtence of grace; and for which we have been loaded with many reproachful names.</p>
            <p>WE are charged of making the want of a <hi>little water only,</hi> a <hi>bar to communion;</hi> and that we are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly fond of the <hi>watery</hi> element, that we place the whole of our religion in what they call a mere <hi>circumſtance</hi> of the <hi>ordinance of baptiſm:</hi> and ſome even aſſert, that we hold that none can be <hi>ſaved</hi> without being <hi>immerſed.</hi> And that thereby we put <hi>baptiſm</hi> in the place of <hi>redeeming blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT why ſuch unfriendly charges? Surely they greatly impeach our doctrinal <hi>principles,</hi> and are perfectly inconſiſtent with our avowed <hi>ſentiments</hi> and conſtant <hi>practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR it is too notorious to admit a plea of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in any of our opponents, that we conſider no
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021665_0006_0FB4FD9D04ECB630"/>one as a proper ſubject of baptiſm, who does not profeſs <hi>repentance</hi> towards God, and <hi>faith</hi> in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who does not, in other words, appear to be in a ſtate of <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NAY, ſo far from making baptiſm a <hi>ſaving</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we do not, we cannot, conſider any one as a proper ſubject of it, who looks upon it in that light.</p>
            <p>BUT however, we deſire to pay a proper defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that, as well as any other of Chriſt's inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; and not to treat it as though it was left to our choice, either to practiſe or omit it: although we do not conſider it as <hi>eſſential to ſalvation,</hi> yet it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the viſibility of a goſpel church; and to conſequently to communion at the Lord's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>Mahomet's impoſture,</hi> and become a true <hi>convert</hi> to chriſtianity, immediately after ſhould attend at a Paedo-Baptiſt church, it being one of their ſtated ſeaſons to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the ſacred ſupper; the ſolemnity attracts his mind, he ſees the beauty of the ordinance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to partake in it. Will they permit him? I am perſuaded they will not. But what are their reaſons? Is it becauſe they do not look upon him as a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> No, for they really do. But do they not believe God has <hi>received</hi> him? Yes, they do. But do they not believe Chriſt <hi>communes</hi> with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021665_0007_0FB4FD9E794C22F8"/>him <hi>ſpiritually?</hi> They do. How can they then <hi>ſhut him off?</hi> Doubtleſs, becauſe they view him to be no baptized, and not a member of any church. Their conduct in refuſing him, would be conſiſtent with the tendereſt feelings of chriſtianity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do not commune merely as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but as ſuch in a <hi>regular, viſible, ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to illuſtrate the point further, ſuppoſe a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt was providentially in one of our new towns where were a number of inhabitants, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table on other accounts, but had never been <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their infancy,</hi> nor had any church been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the place—he is invited to preach—his labours are ſo far ſucceeded, that in a few days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable numbers are hopefully brought to the <hi>knowledge of the truth</hi>—the next Lord's day they deſire him to <hi>break bread</hi> to them. What will he do? Why, it <hi>free communion</hi> is to be eſtabliſhed, here is a good opportunity for it to operate in its full latitude; for if it be lawful and right to break bread to one that is unbaptized, it may be to a whole ſociety. But however, if he be a <hi>Paedobaptiſt miniſter,</hi> I preſume he will not be guilty of ſuch an <hi>irregularity:</hi> nor would a <hi>conſiſtent Baptiſt.</hi> And I feel ſafe to conclude, that our <hi>Paedobaptiſt brethren</hi> would not blame us for refuſing communion with ſuch a ſociety, who did not ſubmit to baptiſm in ſome <hi>mode or other,</hi> however amiable their chriſtian characters might appear in other reſpects.</p>
            <p>IF they would acquit us from <hi>blame</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going inſtance, why ſhould they <hi>fault us</hi> for refuſing communion with thoſe that we verily belive have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021665_0008_0FB4FDA8C76E7F10"/>never been <hi>baptized</hi> according to Chriſt's inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, agreeable to an ancient writer, "They who are not rightly baptized, are, doubtleſs, not baptized at all<note n="*" place="bottom">Baptiſmum quumt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>A GOSPEL church muſt be built upon a goſpel plan.

            <p>THE church does not appear to be national, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, or parochial; but truly congregational. It is not built of dead materials, but of <hi>lively ſtones</hi>

            <p>AGAIN, The apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls the members of the Chriſtian church, "an holy prieſt-hood, to offer up <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt;"<note n="§" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 5—9.</note> which no <hi>carnal profeſſor</hi> can do; neither can men in their <hi>natural ſtate,</hi> for "<hi>ſpiritual things</hi> are fooliſhneſs to then;". but the children of God are "an <hi>holy</hi> nation, a <hi>peculiar people.</hi> to ſhow forth the praiſes of him who hath <hi>called</hi> them out of <hi>darkneſs</hi> into his marvellous <hi>light.</hi>" Can we by this deſcription find the features or an <hi>infant</hi> in his <hi>natural ſtate?</hi> or do they not rather reſemble true <hi>believers</hi> in Chriſt.

            <p>BUT how will this agree with the notion of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being born</hi> with an <hi>hereditary right</hi> to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ordinances of the goſpel?

That grace is not <hi>eſſential</hi> to church memberſhip.

            <p>AT a certain time our Lord enquired of his diſciples, whom men ſaid that he was.

CHURCHES in general, of all denominations, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this <hi>declaration</hi> as a promiſe in their favor.

            <p>BY all which I truſt it is made evident, that this <hi>rock</hi> on which the church of Chriſt is built, is Chriſt himſelf, who is the <hi>"root and offspring of David, the bright and the morning ſtar."</hi>

THIS is the <hi>rock</hi> implied in <hi>Peter</hi>'s confeſſion. But let us obſerve in the next place the manner of the building to be erected on this rock. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, in <hi>adults,</hi> in order to their admiſſion to ſpecial communion, is a point generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: but if this be the only idea that is to be taken, that they ſtand in the alley and give their tacit conſent to the <hi>articles</hi> and <hi>covenant</hi> read; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſubject themſelves to the rules of any particular church: if this be all that is plead for as neceſſary to the building of the church of Chriſt, I ſhall take leave to demur. For moſt perſons that have been educated in the theory of the Chriſtian religion, could ſubſcribe to this <hi>implicit faith:</hi> but thoſe members that are fit materials for this ſpiritual building, make a confeſſion in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as Peter did; and this ſprings fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a Chriſt revealed in them; <hi>"fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee."</hi> Without ſuch a revelation as this, no perſon can be a fit member for a goſpel church; neither can they get upon this <hi>rock</hi> without it: for until this is made to their ſouls, they do not know God nor Chriſt; for it is expreſſly declared by Chriſt, Mat. xi. 27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> And if they do not know Chriſt, they are not his <hi>ſheep:</hi> for he ſays. John x. xiv. <hi>I am the good, ſhepherd and know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi> Now if they are not Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſt <hi>ſheep,</hi> what right have they in his <hi>fold.</hi> Chriſt fixes a ſaving iſſue upon coming to him, hearing his ſayings, and doing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021665_0017_0FB4FDC597F69CF0"/>them: <hi>Mat</hi> vi. 47. And it is ſaid, John vi. 44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father which ſent me draw him:</hi> This is the man that <hi>digs deep and lays his foundation (by faith and repentance)</hi> upon this bleſſed ROCK</p>
            <p>FOR the preſent let us view the matter in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent light: if the <hi>divine rule</hi> will admit of <hi>one</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons' being received as a <hi>proper mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of a goſpel church, it will of <hi>two;</hi> and it of two, it will of <hi>ten;</hi> and ſo conſequently there may be a whole church and not a true believer in it: but would any one dare to call ſuch a ſociety of people, a church of Chriſt? Would it not rather reſemble a <hi>ſynagogue of ſatan?</hi> But perhaps it will be objected, that it is not likely ſuch an inſtance ever will take place; ſurely there is nothing but <hi>divine interpoſition</hi> to <hi>hinder</hi> it, if this method is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be <hi>ruleable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it may be further objected, that a <hi>perfect</hi> church is not to be expected in this imperfect ſtate. To which I anſwer, the <hi>divine rule</hi> requires that <hi>they</hi> be <hi>perfect:</hi> Mat. v. 48. 2 Cor. xiii. 11. Heb. xiii. 21. The queſtion is not, whether, after all, we ſhall not have ſome <hi>hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>unregenerate</hi> perſons in the church; but whether we may know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly receive ſuch, or otherways receive them that give no <hi>evidence</hi> to the contrary.</p>
            <p>NOW it will be readily granted that the divine rule requires every Chriſtian to be <hi>perfect.</hi> But what if ſome ſhould ſay. We don't expect Chriſtians to be perfect, and ſo ſhould take liberty to <hi>indulge</hi> themſelves in <hi>ſin,</hi> could the divine <hi>rule</hi> be plead in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021665_0018_0FB4FDC72F8F4B00"/>their favor? Would it not rather ſtare them in the face? Equally ſo does the <hi>goſpel rule</hi> every <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>hypocritical profeſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it may be further objected, that it is the duty of every perſon to attend to all the external duties of religion, as means God has appointed for their converſion. To which I anſwer, it is the duty of every rational creature, <hi>immediately to love God,</hi> and that <hi>perfectly</hi> as Gabriel does; for without a <hi>principle of real love</hi> to God, the ſinner cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any chriſtian duty; for ſhort of this, his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are like a dead corpſe without a ſpirit: <hi>For the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart:</hi> 1 Tim. i. 5.</p>
            <p>IF the goſpel directs the ſinner to a progreſſive uſe of <hi>means</hi> or <hi>ordinances,</hi> in order to his <hi>converſion,</hi> then it does not require him immediately to <hi>believe,</hi> or to exerciſe evangelical <hi>repentance:</hi> means always precede the <hi>end</hi> for which they were deſigned. But to ſpeak plain, every <hi>duty</hi> that the <hi>law</hi> or <hi>goſpel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of any creature, it requires it to be done from a <hi>principle</hi> of ſupreme <hi>love</hi> to GOD; and without that, all his pretenſions to duty are but hypocriſy. Prayer, reading of God's word, attending to the word preached, and ſpecial ordinances (in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way) are duties held up before every perſon: but they are required to attend them with penitent hearts. If the ſinner attempts to pray with a heart of impenitency and unbelief, he does but deceive himſelf and mock God: for his motives can't ſpring from a higher <hi>ſource</hi> than that which <hi>rules his heart,</hi> which is <hi>ſelflove.</hi> If he attends divine ſervice, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021665_0019_0FB4FDC8A05C9390"/>imagines he has been worſhipping God, he does but <hi>deceive himſelf:</hi> for they that <hi>worſhip God, worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> whilſt this inſcription might be juſtly written upon his moſt refined acts of <hi>devotion,</hi> To the UNKNOWN GOD. Should he be ſprinkled from the baptiſmal layer, or <hi>immerſed</hi> in Jurdon's ſwelling flood, it would avail him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without a new <hi>heart.</hi> Sould he come to the ſacred table of our Lord, and receive the outward elements, yet ſtill he does not commune with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> is <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and they have no communion together.</p>
            <p>THAT the proclamation of the goſpel is to be made in the ears of ſinners, will be readily granted: and where ever it comes, it makes a demand for the ſinner immediately to ſurrender his <hi>heart.</hi> His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal is criminal, and lays him under <hi>condemnation:</hi> John iii. 18. But that the goſpel invites impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, while ſuch, to partake of its ſpecial ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I chooſe rather to deny; for <hi>unto the wicked God ſaith, What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my covenant in thy mouth:</hi> Pſal. l. 16. But it may be poſſible that ſome may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that I hereby excuſe the ſinner from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any duty, becauſe he has not love to God: I am far from making excuſes for impenitents, but would rather ſhow them their inexcuſableneſs. Should the queſtion be aſked me, Whether it is the duty of a ſinner to pray, I ſhould readily anſwer, yes; and add, that he muſt pray <hi>in faith; for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin:</hi> Rom. xiv. 23. <hi>And without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> Heb. xi. 6.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021665_0020_0FB4FDCF4989B238"/>
               <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed:</hi> Rom. x 14. I can ſee no valuable end anſwered to the Redeemer's <hi>cauſe,</hi> or to the ſouls of men, either by <hi>urging</hi> or <hi>receiving</hi> unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into the church. If they can be perſuaded that they are <hi>doing</hi> ſomething that is acceptable to God as the <hi>matter</hi> of their <hi>duty,</hi> this may afford their conſciences a temporary relief, and may be the means of their delay of imbracing that which alone can prove the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>SHOULD one of the ſervants of Chriſt be called to viſit a dying perſon, on entering the room ſhould diſcover that <hi>death</hi> had ſtretched out his<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icy arms to receive him—that he is paſt hope of recovery—the <hi>criſis is important</hi>—a few minutes will decide his <hi>safe for eternity!</hi> The dying man fixes his ghaſtly eyes upon him, as a <hi>maſter</hi> in Iſrael, and expects ſome directions from him, while with a faultering tongue he thus relates his ſad <hi>caſe; I am a poor undone ſinner, juſt going into eternity, and have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an intereſt in Chriſt! What ſhall I DO!</hi> Will the faithful miniſter now tell him, he muſt attend the uſe of <hi>means,</hi> as God's appointment for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? Will he direct him to receive <hi>baptiſm,</hi> or to <hi>join</hi> to the <hi>church,</hi> or receive the ſacred ſupper? all which he may <hi>do</hi> and yet be damned: or will he not rather adopt St. Paul's direction to the Jailor, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Acts xvi. 31.—And tell him, if he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not he ſhall die in his ſins:</hi> John viii. 24. It will undoubtedly be granted, that the laſt mentioned is ſafeſt for the dying man; if ſo, it is alſo ſafeſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021665_0021_0FB4FDD52A1AD2E8"/>for living men; for living men are all dying men! and we know not which will die firſt, either the <hi>ſick</hi> or the <hi>well!</hi> Therefore, we ought ever to give ſuch directions to ſinners at all times, as would be late to give them when on a <hi>dying bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE, having taken a ſurvey of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>doctrine</hi> relative to the character of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people, and the churches of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we find this to be the account: That thoſe who had been ſo taught as to underſtand the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>croſs,</hi> and ſo <hi>learned</hi> of the Father as to come to the SON, immediately manifeſted their <hi>faith</hi> by their works of obedience, in ſubmiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ordinance of baptiſm.—After thus publicly giving themſelves up to the Lord, "they gave themſelves to one another by the <hi>will</hi> of God," or according to his will. Then they broke bread and continued in fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>BUT we have no account of any one's <hi>believing</hi> before <hi>taught,</hi> "for how ſhall they hear without a preacher." Nor of any one's being <hi>baptized</hi> before they <hi>believed.</hi> (or profeſſed ſo to do.) Nor of any one that came to the <hi>ſacred ſupper</hi> before they were <hi>baptized.</hi> We then believe it to be the apoſtolic order, to baptize none till they profeſs their faith in Chriſt; and that till then, they cannot be conſidered as <hi>qualified</hi> members for a goſpel church, nor be received into their fellowſhip at the Lord's table.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, before we are blamed too much, let a different line of conduct be proved from the writings of the <hi>evangeliſts</hi> or <hi>apoſtles,</hi> and it will be our happineſs if we are <hi>wrong</hi> to be <hi>convinced,</hi> that we may have opportunity to <hi>reform.</hi>

BUT that our reaſons for refuſing <hi>communion</hi> with other denominations, may more fully appear, let us go on to conſider the following things:</p>

         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>
               <hi>SECTION II.</hi> The impropriety of the Baptiſt Churches communing with thoſe of other Denominations conſidered. and their difference in Sentiment wore particularty pointed out.</head>
            <p>THE Baptiſt churches believe, that no perſon can be a <hi>diſciple</hi> of Chriſt, that is not capable of <hi>ſelf-denial;</hi> for the Author of our religion has ſaid, "Whoſoever he be of you that <hi>forſaketh</hi> not all that he hath, he cannot be my <hi>diſciple:</hi> Luke xiv. 33." "Let him <hi>deny himſelf</hi> and take up his daily <hi>croſs</hi> and follow me: Luke ix. 23." And if he be not a <hi>diſciple,</hi> he cannot be conſidered a <hi>proper</hi> ſubject of ſpecial ordinances.</p>
            <p>WE believe in <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That this one Lord is the Woman's SEED, the IMMANUEL, born of the Virgin, the one MEDIATOR between GOD and MAN, the HEAD of the Church, and ZION's KING,—a LEADER and COMMANDER of his people—the great <hi>Patern</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> for all true Believers.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. <hi>One Faith;</hi> that faith that <hi>works by love</hi> and purifies the <hi>beart;</hi> which is the only faith of GOD'S Elect, and which alone can give a right to ſpecial
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021665_0023_0FB4FDD9D3A78E20"/>ordinances; for without it 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe GOD. And that this <hi>one faith,</hi> is particularly in each qualified ſubject, and cannot give a right to any but thoſe that have it.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. <hi>One Babtiſm;</hi> that this one baptiſm is an immerſion in water, in the name of the <hi>triune</hi> GOD; which is to be continued until Chriſt's ſecond coming.</p>
            <p>SHOULD any ſuppoſe this <hi>one baptiſm</hi> to be the <hi>baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt and fire,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> I ſhall take leave to diſſent from their opinion; and give ſome reaſons for my own.</p>
            <p>THE baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt was ſpoken of by Chriſt and his Harbinger, as that which had not then taken place.</p>
            <p>I think any one would take ſingular freedom to ſay, that there was then no Chriſtians that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the bleſſings of grace in an ordinary converſion; if it be not ſo, this conſequence muſt follow—That thoſe whom Chriſt had choſen, ſome of whom he had <hi>ſent</hi> forth to teach and do miracles, were ignorant of the ſpirituality of religion, and were ſtill in their <hi>ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, further, if the <hi>baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> be the one intended, it would exclude water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in every mode:—For we can as eaſily conceive of <hi>two</hi> Lords, as of <hi>two</hi> baptiſms referred to one inſtitution.</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of baptiſms mentioned by the Apoſtle, Heb. vi. 2, has no reference to the goſpel inſtitution of baptiſm; but is the ſame <hi>Greek word</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:021665_0024_0FB4FDDCC8D67768"/>that is trat ſlated <hi>Waſhings</hi> in another chapter of the ſame epiſtle—Heb. ix. 10. There is a negation fixed to theſe baptiſms, and they were to be left, becauſe they were <hi>law ceremonies,</hi> and not <hi>goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT here will a queſtion ariſe, What are we to underſtand by the <hi>baptiſm</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt and fire? ſpoken of by John, Matt. iii. 11, and by Chriſt, Acts i. 5. John's words are—"I indeed baptize you with <hi>water</hi> unto repentance; but <hi>He</hi> that cometh after me is mightier than I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear; <hi>he</hi> ſhall <hi>baptize</hi> you with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt and fire.</hi>" Chriſt's words are—"And being aſſembled he commanded that they ſhould not depart from Jeruſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the Father; which, ſaith he, ye have heard from me, for John truly baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, not many days hence." Doubtleſs theſe, at this time, had as great a meaſure of the Spirit, as Chriſtians in general have, and yet were not <hi>baptized</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the explanation of the foregoing, we meet with in the beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning of the next chapter, ſoon after Chriſt's aſcenſion, "They were all with one accord in one place, and ſuddenly there came a ſound from Heaven, as of a mighty ruſhing wind, and it filled all the houſe where they were ſitting: and there appeared unto then: <hi>cloven longues like as of fire,</hi> and it ſat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and began to <hi>ſpeak with other tongues,</hi> as the Spirit gave them utterance: Acts ii, 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:021665_0025_0FB4FDE2252385C8"/>
HERE is the Holy Ghoſt and fire that was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.—For Jeſus was now glorified, and the Holy Ghoſt according to his promiſe given. I think it is far evident, that the baptiſm of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt and fire,</hi> did not reſpect the <hi>ordinary</hi> influences of God's ſpirit, either in the converſion of ſinners, or in its comforting influences on his people: But muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> beſtowed on the <hi>apoſtles</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> for the confirmation of the goſpel; ſuch as the gifts of <hi>tongues, healing, prophecying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>BUT as theſe obſervations may differ from the general opinion of others, therefore I muſt be a little particular. Will any perſon dare to ſay, that thoſe <hi>believers</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> baptized, were not true converts? If they were not, then <hi>Philip</hi> baptized a number of <hi>unqualified ſubjects,</hi> that were ſtrangers to the love of God. If they were <hi>true converts,</hi> I think my obſervation muſt ſtand; for it is further obſerved of them, that "when the apoſtles that were at Jeruſalem, had heard that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> had <hi>received the word of God,</hi> they ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> unto them, who grayed for them, that they might <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> (for as yet <hi>he</hi> was fallen upon <hi>none</hi> of then; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus.) Then laid they their hands on them, and they <hi>received the Holy Ghoſt:</hi>" Acts viii. 14, 15, 16. The ſame idea is further illuſtrated by St. Paul, who, when "he came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> found certain <hi>diſciples,</hi>" and "he ſaid unto them, Have ye <hi>received the Holy Ghoſt ſince ye believed?</hi>" Their anſwer was, "We have not
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021665_0026_0FB4FDE3A9557B60"/>heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt:" Acts xix. 1, 2—6. The apoſtle it ſeems preſumed, that if they were diſciples, they were baptized; therefore did not enquire, whether they were baptized, but unto <hi>what</hi> they were <hi>baptized.</hi> "And when Paul had <hi>laid his hands</hi> upon them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake with <hi>tongues and propheſied.</hi>"</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH they had never <hi>heard</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in theſe miraculous operations, yet they were <hi>diſciples</hi> and <hi>believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE I think I have a right to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>ceaſed</hi> when theſe miraculous gifts <hi>ceaſed;</hi> and that the <hi>one baptiſm</hi> referred to, is <hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> yea, even this <hi>baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> never ſuperceded or deſtroyed the neceſſity of <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt. See it exemplified, Acts x. 44—48.</p>
            <p>BUT let none conclude I mean to deny that Chriſtians have any <hi>influences</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt in this day; I do not: neither do I believe they were without them when Chriſt was upon earth, or even before he came. And yet theſe extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences were not given, for <hi>Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> Therefore the inſtitution of baptiſm ſtands unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon the firm <hi>baſis</hi> of a <hi>divine command,</hi> which will continue it until the end of time, not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>many</hi> ancient and modern <hi>corrupters;</hi> Socinians, Quakers. Univerſaliſts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE Baptiſts not only believe that this one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an inſtitution of Chriſt, but that it is ever to be adminiſtered in one <hi>mode,</hi> and to one kind of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021665_0027_0FB4FDE67AFBD2B0"/>
               <hi>ſubjects.</hi> Our opponents ſuppoſe (at leaſt many of them) that it may be adminiſtered upon a profeſſion of faith, or without it; either by <hi>immerſion</hi> or <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> They acknowledge immerſion to believers to be lawful baptiſm; could we, with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, allow the ſame of infant ſprinkling, much of our diſpute would be at an end. "But our fixed and avowed perſuaſion will not permit us to allow, that <hi>infant ſprinkling,</hi> though performed with the greateſt ſolemnity, is worthy of the name. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, though they conſiſtently with their own principles, may receive <hi>us</hi> to communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>them,</hi> yet we cannot admit them to fellowſhip with us at the Lord's table, without contradicting our profeſſed ſentiments. For it appears to us, on the moſt deliberate enquiry, that immerſion is not a <hi>mere circumſtance,</hi> or <hi>a mode</hi> of baptiſm, but eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the ordinance: ſo that in our judgment, he who is not immerſed is not baptized. This is one of our reaſons for refuſing communion to our Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſt brethren, whom in many reſpects, we highly eſteem, and towards whom we think it our duty to cultivate the moſt cordial affection."<note n="*" place="bottom">Booth's Apol. p. <hi>14.</hi>

            <p>BUT is this ordinance of our Lord left in ſuch <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,</hi> that an honeſt mind muſt be always at a loſs how to practice it? To plead this, is to <hi>impeach</hi> Chriſt, that he has not been as <hi>faithful</hi> in his <hi>own houſe</hi> as a <hi>ſon,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was as a <hi>ſervant:</hi> Heb. iii. 5, 6.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:021665_0028_0FB4FDEA00668A00"/>
BUT from whence does it appear that baptiſm is a duty? Not from any <hi>moral precept,</hi> but from a <hi>poſitive inſtitution.</hi> "All poſitive inſtitutions depend entirely upon the <hi>will</hi> and declaration of the perſon who inſtitutes them, with reſpect to the end and deſign of them; and alſo the due manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters to Biſhop Hoadley.</note> But are not <hi>poſitive inſtitutions</hi> as plain as <hi>moral precepts?</hi> If ſo, why do we <hi>blame</hi> the ſinner for not complying with one, and <hi>excuſe</hi> the Chriſtian for neglecting the other?</p>
            <p>BUT it is ſaid, they do not neglect it, but only practice it in a different way! But is this different way <hi>divine</hi> inſtitution, or ſomething ſubſtituted in its room? If the former, we may preſume that it is made plain in the word, as it is not deſigned for men of ſcience only, but for <hi>unlearned men</hi> and <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and for babes in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THE inſtance recorded in ſcripture concerning Saul who was ſent to deſtroy Amaleck, with the prophets reply to him at his return, may ſerve as a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> to diſcover the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The command was <hi>poſitive,</hi> and was in part obeyed; but "the beſt of the ſheep and oxen were ſaved alive." But Saul was very confident he had performed the will of the Lord, and thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed Samuel: "Bleſſed be thou of the Lord; I have performed the commandment of the Lord:" 1 Sam. xv. 12. And doubtleſs <hi>Saul</hi> would have carried his point, had not an inſpired prophet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him. It is likely <hi>Saul</hi> had ſome ſpecious
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021665_0029_0FB4FDEC0FABA478"/>pretences for his conduct: he might flatter himſelf that theſe ſheep and oxen might be a large ſaving of the <hi>property</hi> of Iſrael; and that to ſave them to <hi>do ſacrifice</hi> to the Lord, was a laudable deſign; he did not pretend he had the leaſt regard to <hi>ſelf</hi> in the whole affair, but was now prudently taking care that <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>'s altar might be loaded with the richeſt ſacrifices. But the prophet ſoon gave him to underſtand, that <hi>obedience</hi> to divine appointments, ſuch as depend entirely on an <hi>expreſs</hi> command, is better in the ſight of God than hecatombs of bleeding beaſts, or clouds of ſmoaking incenſe: <hi>For rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſs is as iniquity and idolatry:</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 23.</p>
            <p>WHEN the children of Iſrael were returned from their captivity, they gathered themſelves to Ezra the ſcribe, to be inſtructed in their duty out of the law—"And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhould dwell in <hi>booths</hi> in the feaſt of the ſeventh month: Neh. viii. 14." This was a <hi>poſitive inſtitution,</hi> and juſtly claimed the <hi>obedience</hi> of all Iſrael. But notwithſtanding this, it was not kept in the inſtituted way, from the days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> until the days of Nehemiah. Was the inſtitution to blame for their neglect, or muſt the blame fall on them? On them ſurely. But might not ſome plauſible objections be made againſt reformation? What if ſome had aſked the queſtion—"If this be ſo, why did none of the <hi>learned fathers</hi> find it out? Were not <hi>Samuel, David, Solomon, Jehoſhaphat, Aſa. Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> all good men? and they did
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021665_0030_0FB4FDF334EA6AD0"/>not keep this feaſt in booths." What if others had ſaid, "we do not underſtand the word <hi>booths</hi> in ſuch a point of light—a <hi>booth</hi> means a ſort of tent, the deſign of which is to ſcreen us from the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beams of the ſun, and defend us from the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the weather; and as our hooſes anſwer theſe purpoſes, we eſteem it lawful for us to eat this feaſt in them."</p>
            <p>BUT what would all theſe objections, and many more that might be made, avail in the mind of a man who was deſirous for reformation, and had his eyes open to read in the law of the Lord? "It was found <hi>written</hi> in the law of the Lord;" therefore it was a ſufficient reaſon for every one to engage in reformation, whoſe heart was brought to love the law of his God.</p>
            <p>WE profeſs to take the word of GOD, for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule of faith and practice; if ſo, we are not to follow the opinions of the beſt of men, though ever ſo learned and great, any further than they follow Chriſt, or walk according to his inſtitutions; "to the law and the teſtimony," this is our only guide in matters of religion. And from hence we find, that baptiſm is a <hi>poſitive inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, left in his church for the benefit of <hi>his</hi> people; concerning which we can know nothing but from the revealed will of the Great Lawgiver. Had the baptiſm of <hi>unbelievers</hi> been intended, it would have been <hi>declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> if it was either <hi>expreſſed</hi> or <hi>implied,</hi> the <hi>apoſtles</hi> muſt have underſtood it, and their <hi>practice</hi> would have diſcovered it; of which nothing certain has ever yet been made to appear.</p>

            <p>THEN ſurely we muſt be the moſt <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> ſet of Chriſtians in the world, to hold up the neceſſity of baptiſm by our <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and yet when we come to the Lord's table, <hi>practically deny it,</hi> by receiving thoſe to our communion whom we do not heſitate to tell the world, we look upon as unbaptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and ſo for the ſake of holding <hi>free communion,</hi> we muſt "<hi>build</hi> again the things that we have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> and thereby make ourſelves <hi>tranſgreſſors,</hi>" for once renouncing them.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>SECTION III.</hi> The arguments for free comraunion conſidered—others offered in vindication of the Cloſe Communioniſts.</head>
            <p>SHOULD all that has been obſerved in the preceding pages be aſſented to, yet this queſtion may be put: Cannot the Baptiſt churches <hi>commune</hi> with the <hi>Paedobaptiſts,</hi> where they obtain ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and are <hi>ſincere?</hi> The brother propoſing to commune informs the church to whom he applies, that he has reaſon to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> he was baptized in his infancy, and has never ſeen it to be his <hi>duty,</hi> to be baptized ſince.—Did he but ſee it to be duty, he would cordially comply with it; but as he does not, deſires to partake with them as he is.</p>
            <p>WHAT can the church do? Muſt the man be debarred from doing his duty in one inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot ſee it in another? Or will they drag him into the <hi>water,</hi> againſt the <hi>light</hi> of his own conſcience? Surely not the latter. Some reaſons muſt be given or the man ought to be received. But what is the ground of his application? Why, he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and is <hi>ſincere,</hi> and he is <hi>baptized</hi> to himſelf, or he conſiders himſelf ſo.</p>
            <p>THAT he is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the church is <hi>fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and that he may be <hi>ſincere,</hi> they do not pretend to deny; but <hi>ſincerity</hi> is not the <hi>term</hi> of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: out being <hi>conformed</hi> to the apoſtle's <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>coutinuing ſtedfaſtly therein:</hi> Acts ii. 42.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:021665_0033_0FB4FDFBA8C915F8"/>
IF ſincerity be the <hi>term of communion,</hi> why might not Paul have been admitted when he was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in good ſtanding in the <hi>Jewiſh church?</hi> But it may be objected that he perſecuted the ſaints of JESUS: it is true; but who can challenge his ſincerity from his own declaration? <hi>I verily thought with myſelf that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth:</hi> Acts xxvi 9. And whatever we practice that is not according to the will of Chriſt, is contrary there to, although we be ever ſo ſincere in doing it.</p>
            <p>BUT may we not ſuppoſe that ſome of all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations are <hi>ſincere</hi> although ever ſo <hi>erronious.</hi> But to illuſtrate the idea, ſuppoſe one who had been educated a Roman Catholic, ſhould become a true convert, ſo as to ſatisfy a judgment of <hi>charity</hi> —he aſks for communion at the Lord's table, but at the ſame time lets the church know, that he could not, with a good conſcience, receive the <hi>cup.</hi> Although he has renounced the church of Rome, the <hi>mother of abominations,</hi> yet he would not reject any thing that appears to him to be right, becauſe that church held the ſame; he now acts honeſtly, according to the beſt light he has. Would any Proteſtant church commune with him? Surely if they mean to practice <hi>free communion</hi> they ought to. The man is allowed indeed to be in an <hi>error,</hi> but then it is of that kind that is called <hi>"non-eſſential, not foundamental, merely circumſtantial"</hi>—"the <hi>ſtrong</hi> ought to bear the <hi>infirmaties</hi> or the <hi>weak,</hi>"—he muſt be received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:021665_0034_0FB4FDFEE8A9E598"/>
AT their next communion ſeaſon, there comes a <hi>diſciple of George Fox,</hi> who denies <hi>water-baptiſm</hi> in every mode, but he has got convinced of one <hi>error</hi> in his party, reſpecting the <hi>ſacred ſupper,</hi> and is now deſirous to teſtify his obedience to this <hi>inſtitution. Free communion</hi> is too <hi>liberal</hi> in its ſentiments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, his plea is <hi>ſincerity,</hi> which no one has a right to ſcruple, without falling under that ſevere reproof, "Who art thou that judgeſt another man's ſervant; to his <hi>own</hi> maſter he ſtands or falls." Neither of the foregoing inſtances can be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, than for a <hi>Baptiſt church</hi> to commune with a Paedobaptiſt, whilſt they hold him to be unbaptized.</p>
            <p>AND the arguments that will vindicate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>one,</hi> will ſerve the ſame purpoſe for the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it may be profitable here to have recourſe to the ſcripture doctrine in this matter, and it that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of ſuch a line of conduct, we ought to drop the diſpute; it not, to contend earneſtly for this article of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be acknowledged, that there is a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the two poſitive inſtitutions of Chriſt, and that one of them muſt be <hi>prior</hi> to the other. For a man cannot partake of the Lord's ſupper, and be baptized, at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>IT is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that theſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with regard to their order and connection, depend as much on the ſovereign will and pleaſure of the Lawgiver, as the appointments themſelves. "Here then the queſtion is, Has our ſovereign Lord
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021665_0035_0FB4FE000380D1F0"/>revealed his will, in regard to this matter?—To the law and to the teſtimony:" How readeſt thou? "To determine the query, we may firſt conſider the order of <hi>time</hi> in which the two poſitive inſtitutions of the new-teſtament were appointed:—That bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was an ordinance of God—that ſubmiſſion was required, and that it was adminiſtered to multitudes before the ſacred ſupper was heard of or had exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are undeniable facts."<note n="*" place="bottom">Booth's Apol. p. <hi>31.</hi>
               </note> John Baptiſt, the Apoſtles, and even the Son of God incarnate, all practically recommended baptiſm, at a time when it would have been impious to have eaten bread and drank wine as an ordinance of divine worſhip. Baptiſm therefore had the priority in point of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>LET us next conſider the order of <hi>words</hi> in the great commiſſion: when a riſen Saviour tells his diſciples, "ALL POWER is given to me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth, go ye therefore and teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, BAPTIZING them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS WHATSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EVER I HAVE COMMANDED YOU:" Mat. xxviii. 18, 19, 20. The firſt article of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is, to teach, then—what? To <hi>baptize,</hi> or to <hi>adminiſter the Lord's ſupper?</hi> let every conſcience judge.</p>
            <p>LET us next conſider the <hi>apoſtolic practice.</hi> It is very evident the apoſtles underſtood our Lord in the ſenſe for which we plead, and practiced accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021665_0036_0FB4FE0382153400"/>For when a number were "pricked to the heart, and erred, Men and brethren what ſhall we DO? Then Peter ſaid unto them, <hi>repent</hi> and"—what, break bread? Nav verily; but "be baptized every one of you." The willing converts followed his direction; "Then they that gladly received his word were <hi>baptized.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THE next ſtep was, to <hi>join themſelves to the church,</hi> and afterwards they broke bread. This is apoſtolic <hi>order,</hi> and cannot be denied, without contradicting the <hi>oracles</hi> of truth.</p>
            <p>WHEN Chriſt has thus revealed his will, for us to diſpute it, is rebellion; it rather becomes us with humility, to rejoice that he hath made the path of our <hi>duty</hi> ſo plain.</p>
            <p>IF what has already been obſerved ſtands conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with ſcripture, a contrary practice cannot be proved from the <hi>word,</hi> unleſs it is like a leaden rule, that will apply to any thing. Then if this be the order in which the two goſpel inſtitutions ſtand, we ſhall do well to conſider, who hath given us a diſpenſing power, to ſet aſide one which claims a <hi>prior</hi> right on the convert's obedience, for the ſake of indulging him in another.</p>
            <p>MOSES had no right to alter a ſingle pin in the <hi>tabernacle,</hi> but was admoniſhed to make all things according to the <hi>pattern</hi> ſhown in the mount. And whoſoever inverts the order of Chriſt's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, muſt be conſidered as dictating INFINITE WISDOM.</p>
            <p>THE next thing that I ſhall conſider is, the <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> drawn from St. Paul's <hi>words</hi> to the Romans,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021665_0037_0FB4FE04809C5770"/>
               <hi>Receive ye one another as Chriſt alſo hath received us:</hi> Rom. xv 7. Hence our opponents argue, that if GOD has <hi>received</hi> a perſon, and we have reaſon to ſuppoſe that he communes with them, we cannot, in the exerciſe of a Chriſtian temper, refuſe them. But is this <hi>receiving</hi> limitted to communing at the Lord's table? Is there no other way for us to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſt our love to our brethren of other denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but for us practically to give up what we conſcienciouſly believe to be the <hi>order</hi> of GOD'S houſe? Before we make ſuch a movement, it will be ſafe to enquire into the apoſtle's meaning, and inſtead of giving my own thoughts on the text, I chooſe rather to tranſcribe a paſſage from a Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt writer,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> who, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from what our opponents infer, obſerves—"This difference is glaringly forced and wide, diſcovering their ignorance of the true meaning and deſign of the text, who make it. The apoſtle is not here ſpeaking of admiſſion to church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at all; nor does he conſider thoſe to whom be writes in the preciſe light of the church univerſal, but as members of a <hi>particular</hi> church or body, among whom there was ſome difference of opinion about means, &amp;c. which was like to break their communing together, as is plain from the preceding chapter. The apoſtle ſets himſelf to prevent this, and to accompliſh a reconciliation: And after a number of healing things, he concludes with theſe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021665_0038_0FB4FE09E21403A8"/>words—<hi>Receive ye one another;</hi> that is, ve who are ſaints at Rome, who have agreed to walk together in the commandments and ordinances of the Lord Jeſus; ye who are profeſſedly united in church communion, receive ye one another in love, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſaints united in one body for mutual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Bear ye one another's burdens: watch over and admoniſh one another in love, notwithſtanding ſome difference in ſentiment among you, as to the eating certain meats, and regarding certain days; but let not that difference make any breach in your communion together as a church of Chriſt. But let the ſtrong dear with thoſe that are weak; and the weak not be offended with the liberty of the ſtrong. Judge not one another uncharitably; but let brotherly love continue. This is preciſely the apoſtle's meaning, as will appear to thoſe who look impartially into the connection of his argument, and by no means ſerves the purpoſe for which the objectors bring i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>." There is an eſſential difference between their eating or not eating meats in the apoſtolic times, and our being baptized or not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>prior</hi> to communion at the Lord's table. The <hi>latter</hi> being a ſolemn inſtitution of divine worſhip: out can this be aſſerted of the <hi>former?</hi> Surely it muſt be ſtraining things beyond bounds, to ſet theſe obſolete, antiquated rites, in contraſt with a goſpel inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Another argument made uſe of in favor of <hi>free communion</hi> is, that if they are GOD'S children, <hi>he</hi> communes with them; and if ſo, it would be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition for any to refuſe to come to the ſacred
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021665_0039_0FB4FE0CB7ECA680"/>table with them. But it is not what GOD can or does do, but his revealed will that is the rule of our duty. Many have left the <hi>word</hi> of GOD out of a partial regard to the characters of great and good men But it may be remembered, that when the LORD ſent the <hi>prophet</hi> from Judah to <hi>cry</hi> againſt the altar at Bethel, that he was forbid to eat bread or drink water in that place. For a time he kept cloſe to the <hi>word</hi> of the LORD, and proſpered. But after he was gone, an old prophet purſued after him, and finally prevailed with him to return; had he appeared as an open enemy, it is not likely the prophet would have heard to him; but this is the way in which he prevailed with him, by telling him—<hi>I alſo am a prophet—and that an angel ſpake unto me to bring thee back.</hi> But though a prophet, or an angel from heaven had ſpoken unto him, he had no warrant to leave the word of GOD; and for his diſobedience was ſoon ſlain of a lion.<note n="*" place="bottom">See this account, 1 Kings, xiii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER argument made uſe of by them who plead for <hi>open communion</hi> is, that we can join in prayer, either in our families or in public, with Paedobaptiſts, or can hear them preach occaſionally, and yet after all, cannot come to the Lord's table with them. It is true, and perhaps ſome cauſe can be ſhowed for our conduct. We eſteem it not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but to be our <hi>indiſpenſible duty,</hi> to manifeſt our love to all that love the Lord, in every way that is not inconſiſtent with a revelation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will in ſome other reſpects.</p>

I PRESUME it will be a given point, that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was abſolutely neceſſary for every male, in order to partake at the paſchal ſupper; this was not the effect of any bigoted notion in the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but by a poſſitive command of Jehovah: Exod. xii. 48. Had <hi>Enoch</hi> who walked with GOD as a ſaint, and who, as a prophet, foretold the coming of Chriſt to judgment—or <hi>Noah,</hi> who was an <hi>Heir of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> as well as a preacher or it—or <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> that illuſtrious <hi>type</hi> of the Great Meſſiah—had theſe been cotemporary with Moſes, and ſojourners in the ſame wilderneſs, they could not have been admitted to communion in the Iſraelit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church, without ſubmitting to <hi>circumciſion.</hi> Yet had Enoch been in the camp of Iſrael when <hi>Korah and his company mutinied,</hi> and had been diſpoſed to have given the rebels a lecture on the ſecond coming of Chriſt, I cannot ſuppoſe his offered ſervice would have been rejected by Moſes, merely becauſe he was not circumciſed.

Yet would any aſſert that our LORD would have admitted theſe Eccleſiaſtics to communion in ſpecial ordinances?—When the beloved diſciple ſaid, "Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him, becauſe he followed not with us:" Jeſus anſwered, "For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him not; for he that is not againſt us, is for us:" Luke ix. 49, 50. From hence it appears, that we ought to encourage thoſe who are fighting againſt the common enemy, and are propagating the common truth, although we cannot commune in ſpecial ordinances together.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER argument made uſe of in favor of open communion, is the conſequences that will follow upon cloſe communion, i. e. that if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot commune together in this world, how can they expect to enjoy fellowſhip together in Heaven.</p>
            <p>THIS is ſomething very frightful indeed! that there muſt be too heavens for ſeparate ſpirits!</p>
            <p>BUT this may be anſwered by attending to a few things. Who would dare to anathematize all thoſe who deny the uſe of both ordinances? Or who will venture to ſay, that among the different kindreds, tongues and tribes, who will appear in that illuſtrious throng, at the deciſive hour, there will be none who never ſaw nor practiced the ſacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in any form? Or who will affirm that none who are excommunicated perſons will ever be admitted into heaven?</p>
            <p>AND yet upon goſpel principles, it would be unlawful to commune with them while ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:021665_0042_0FB4FE18C00101D0"/>
BUT theſe objections muſt appear of no weight to the candid. For where is there a church of any denomination that there is not ſuch difference of opinion in ſome things among them, as at ſome times to produce trials, and at others, ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencions? And yet may we not ſuppoſe that <hi>one</hi> heaven will hold them all after death? Yes; death, the great <hi>leveller,</hi> will put an end to our <hi>party</hi> diſputes, and bring the duſt of contending chriſtians to reſt in ſweet agreement in the grave! equally ſo will the fiery trial, which ſhall burn up all the <hi>hay, wood and ſtubble,</hi> from the ſoul—bring the ſpirits of all good men to dwell in a ſtate of uninterrupted felicity.</p>
            <p>THE laſt thing that I ſhall conſider which is brought as a plea for open communion is, that the ſcripture account of baptiſm is left in ſuch darkneſs and ambiguity, both as to the ſubjects and mode, that nothing certain can be determined. Therefore it calls for our charity towards them who differ from us. It may be remembered, that when the talents were committed to the ſervants to occupy, the two that improved made no complaints; the other had got a <hi>hard</hi> maſter, an <hi>auſtere</hi> man; a great many difficulties ſtood in the way of duty. That the baptiſm of infants is not made plain, we ſhall not deny: but, that believers were baptized, is as plain as words can make it; and ſhines through the new-teſtament as if written with a <hi>ſun-beam.</hi> If ſprinkling be the mode intended in the new-teſtament, we muſt concede to the propoſition, that it is not made plain. It would ſeem like an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021665_0043_0FB4FE1A37B33B48"/>affair indeed, to relate, that both the <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator</hi> and the <hi>perſon baptized, went down into the water, and came up out of it</hi> again, when all that was to be done, was only to ſprinkle a little water in the face. Yea, to read in the volume of inſpiration that multitudes were baptized <hi>IN the river Jordan;</hi> and that they were <hi>baptized in Enon, becauſe there was MUCH water there,</hi> when a <hi>few baſons</hi> of water would have ſerved the purpoſe equally well: this would ſeem indeed to be ſo dark, that <hi>common ſenſe</hi> muſt have been at a loſs how to have reconciled this <hi>ancient account</hi> with <hi>modern practice,</hi> had it not been that ſome gentlemen of great invention, have lent their friendly aid, and caſt peculiar light upon the ſubject, by informing the world, that the large quantity of water was neceſſary for the uſe of the camels and aſſes the people rode upon; whereas the only thing that the ſcriptures bring into view, is the conveniency of <hi>baptizing.</hi> That the <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> conſider it as not made plain in ſcripture; or, that it is left to be practiced indifferently, as circumſtances may require, is abundantly evident from their conduct; for many of them adminiſter <hi>both</hi> ways; ſome times in the meeting-houſe, and then <hi>in a river.</hi> What ſtrange <hi>amphibious</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed!</p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Greek verb Baptizo</hi> has not been rightly explained, we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe it ever will be.</p>
            <p>AND this evidence we find in our favor from the various expoſitors upon it, that all the Baptiſts agree, that the word in its firſt or primary ſenſe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021665_0044_0FB4FE2542FBD6F8"/>ſignifies to <hi>dip</hi> or <hi>plunge,</hi> and only in a ſecondary and conſequential ſenſe, to <hi>waſh</hi>

               </note> and if others deny it, yet ſtill the evidence ſtands in our favor; for none would give it up againſt themſelves, if they were not obliged in juſtice to do it. A number of ancient, learned expoſitors upon the <hi>Greek,</hi> allow this ſenſe.<note n="†" place="bottom">Scapula, Schrevelius, Budaeus, Calvin, Beza Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon, Grotius, &amp;c. quoted with their words by Dr. Gill.</note> The matter is out of diſpute in our minds; and we really think, that the combination of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> recorded in the New Teſtament, have made it as <hi>plain</hi> as any others could, ſo that "He that runs may read;" ſo plain that "No wayfar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, though a fool, needs err therein." Yet many who have been educated in the theory of the chriſtian religion, from their early days, excuſe themſelves from this duty, becauſe they cannot ſee it.

                        <p>IT WAS at the requeſt of a number of you that I attempted to write; and it I ſhould fail of anſwering your expectations, yet ſtill I have the teſtimony of my conſcience, to the rectitude of my intention; and my inability you will tenderly impeach.—You will find a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in thoſe who object againſt our order, with regard to <hi>cloſe communion;</hi> ſome no doubt are to be conſidered in the light of thoſe we
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021665_0046_0FB4FE28E93020E0"/>meet with, Ezra iv. 2, who requeſted of thoſe Jewiſh Fathers, to build with them; their plea was, "We ſeek your GOD as ye do; and we do ſacrifice to him ſince the day of Eſar-haddon; King of Aſſur." Theſe were not admitted for they were enemies, and only faught to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw thoſe who were building.</p>
                        <p>BUT you will meet with others, who, joying and beholding your order, would gladly take privileges with you; who ſtand high in your eſteem as friends to the cauſe of truth; theſe demand the tendereſt expreſſions of your love—yet it is never to be expreſſed in a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to GOD'S revealed will. Therefore, if our profeſſion be conſiſtent with the <hi>word of truth,</hi> let our practice be ſo too. Let thoſe who open their doors for free communion conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not give more liberty than the ſcripture does, by ſitting down at the holy table with thoſe whom they look upon as unbaptized. They will do well to ſearch for a precedent for their conduct in the word of GOD. I am perſuaded, if they were to aſk the chriſtian world in general, they would readily join with the apoſtle and ſay, "We have no ſuch cuſtom, nor the churches of GOD" that were before us, as to receive unbaptized perſons to commune with us.</p>
                        <p>LET thoſe who practice according to their profeſſion, never be <hi>aſhamed</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt; but remember that it is enough that the <hi>diſciple</hi> be <hi>as</hi> his Lord, and the <hi>ſervant</hi> be <hi>as</hi>

Remember the apoſtles words to the Theſſalonians—"Now we command you, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walks diſorderly, and not after the traditions he received of us:" 2 Theſſ. iii. 6. It may be your duty to withdraw from them that you conſider as not conformed to the tradition of the apoſtles; ſo far as not to partake toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Lord's table.</p>
                        <p>But I ſhall cloſe with the words of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians:—"Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame things, and that there be no diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgments:" 1 Cor, i. 10.</p>
