            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Vermont,</hi> to publiſh to the impartial world, a further vindication of the conduct of thoſe inhabitants than hath been already done, and exhibit to all wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Beings whom it may concern, the intrinſic cauſes, motives and reaſons, of their aſſuming govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>IT is well known that this conteſt was not occaſioned by the late revolution, but exiſted many years before that the contending parties were greatly exaſperated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other; and that thoſe inhabitants had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from the deciſion of the courts, as by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the then province of <hi>New-York,</hi> to arms, and had anounced to the public their reaſon for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>A SHORT ſtate of the proceedings of both parties (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary to communicate to the public, in order to their rightly determining the merits of ſuch an important diſpute) is herewith given. And 1ſt. The government of <hi>New-York</hi> obtained the juriſdiction of the conteſted
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016183_0004_0F9BCC145662C620"/>territory in 1764, ex-parte and contrary to the minds of the original Grantees and Settlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and therefore ought to be conſidered as null and void from the beginning. And ſecondly, The undue uſe and oppreſſive exerciſe which they have ever ſince made of the power of juriſdiction towards thoſe inhabitants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' their legal claim of juriſdiction was ever ſo well grounded, would fully juſtify thoſe inhabitants in their oppoſition to that government, and in their aſſuming independence.</p>
            <p>NO SOONER had the government of <hi>New-York</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the juriſdiction of theſe lands, but they preſumed to re-grant ſundry large patents, interfering with prior grants from the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> at a time when the Grantees under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> were in full poſſeſſion of the very lands re-granted.</p>
            <p>THIS reprehenſible procedure of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid thoſe inhabitants under the neceſſity of remonſtrating againſt that government. They therefore impowered <hi>Samuel Robinſon,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (then of <hi>Bennington</hi>) their Agent, to lay the ſame before the King and privy Council, together with a humble Petition from thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, that the juriſdiction of thoſe lands might be reſtored to <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> again. The conſequences of theſe meaſures were favorable to the Grantees under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and were the means of obtaining the King's expreſs prohibition to the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> to make no grants of lands in the diſputed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, on pain of his <hi>higheſt</hi> diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE government of <hi>New-York</hi> did, nevertheleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in direct violation of the ſaid prohibition, to grant moſt of the prohibitted premiſes: and further proceeded to oppoſe the authority of the king, by erecting and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016183_0005_0F9BCC1510ABEDD8"/>eſtabliſhing the counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> which are contained in the territory in diſpute, though the king had ſignified to the ſaid government, his utter diſapprobation of the eſtabliſhment thereof. And all this when the now Independent States were ſubject to the royal authority.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1769, the claimants under the ſubſequent grants from <hi>New-York,</hi> and not reſiding on the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted premiſes, brought action of Ejectment in their ſupreme Court held at <hi>Albany,</hi> againſt ſundry actual ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers who claimed the ſoil by virtue of prior grants from <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> But moſt if not all the judges and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es (particularly Meſſrs. <hi>Duane</hi> and <hi>Kemp</hi>) which attended the court, were patentees under <hi>New-York;</hi> and ſome of them intruſted in the very patents, then on trial.</p>
            <p>The plantiffs appearing in great ſtate and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which together with their junto of land thieves, made a brilliant appearance; but the defendants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in but ordinary faſhion, having been greatly fatigued by hard labour wrought on the diſputed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and their caſh much exhauſted, made a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable figure at court. In fine, intereſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection and grandeur, being all on one ſide, eaſily turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſcale againſt the honeſt defendants, and judgment without mercy in favor of the claimants under <hi>New-York</hi> was given againſt them. In the courſe of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, a grant of the townſhip from <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> under which the defendants claimed being produced in court, and alſo a certificate from the Governor of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and his Secretary, that the ſaid grant was legally executed to the grantees whoſe names were mentioned on the back of the charter, it was nevertheleſs ruled that the ſame ſhould not be read in court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016183_0006_0F9BCC15CF36D238"/>
SOON after, writs of poſſeſſion were iſſued in form of law againſt the vanquiſhed defendants, and new actions of ejectment were commenced againſt other of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; but their ſpirit was too great to bear ſuch inſults any longer; they therefore reſiſted and defeated the officers in their attempts to gain poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>DIRECTLY after theſe tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THIS law had no ſooner been promulgated, but Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Tryon</hi> who then p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed over the government, gave orders to the militia of <hi>Albany</hi> county, to aſſiſt the ſheriff in executing the writs aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants being thus drove to the extremity of either quitting their poſiſſions or reſiſting the ſheriff and his poſſe. In this ſtate of deſparacy they put on forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and choſe the latter expedient, and managed with that bravery that they defended their poſſeſſions; and the ſheriff with his poſſe returned to their own land without any bloodſhed on the occaſion. But it ſhould be confeſſed that this event was not altogether owing to the valour of the <hi>green mountain boys,</hi> for the militia were moſt generally perſuaded that the cauſe of thoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants was juſt; and that the <hi>New-York</hi> patentees were oppreſſive and unjuſt, and therefore they would not hazard their lives to aſſiſt them in ſuch uſurpation of the rights of their fellow men, and in the event were ſure to be no gainers turn which way it would.</p>
            <p>AFTER this ineffectual muſter of the militia, the land ſchemers adopted different meaſures to accompliſh their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016183_0007_0F9BCC1692049C20"/>deſigns, perceiving that the militia would not fight for their ſubſequent and exorbitant claims; and as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were a jeſuitical and cowardly junto of ſchemers, not inured to danger, hardſhips, or the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of war, durſt not fight for their own claim; their accuſtomed way to carry points being to deceive, cheat, and over reach the commonality of their ſpecies under pretext of law, juſtice, and good government. Theſe are their horns of iron, and with them they do puſh. They were therefore obliged to follow their old and beaten road of politics; and by their influence cauſed a number of the leading men among thoſe inhabitants, to be indicted as rioters, deſigning to have made ſuch an example of them, as to fright the inhabitants in general to a tame compliance with the deciſions of their courts of law, or which is the ſame thing, to yield up their property to them, and become their tenants and ſlaves.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants in general were appriſed that this was their deſign, and guarded againſt it; were very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and vig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ent in defending their friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours indicted as aforeſaid; being fully perſuaded that the ſaid junto of patentees had in thoſe very indictments for their object, the very lands which they the aforeſaid inhabitants poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>SUNDRY proclamations under the ſignature of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Tryon</hi> were iſſued, for the expreſs purpoſe of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending thoſe inhabitants which he was pleaſed to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate riotous, licentious, diſorderly, &amp;c. and large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards therein were offered for that purpoſe; but the governor and whole catalogue of patentees, had the mortification to be baffled in their attempts to take ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oters (as they phraſed it) during the courſe of three years; and the green mountain boys prevailed againſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016183_0008_0F9BCC17617BE258"/>them, ſeized their magiſtrates and emiſaries; and in fine, all thoſe their abettors which dared to venture upon the conteſted lands, and chaſtiſed them with the whips of the wilderneſs, the growth of the land which they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted.</p>
            <p>AND on the 9th day of <hi>March</hi> 1774, the legiſlative authority of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> did paſs twelve acts of outlawry, againſt thoſe inhabitants, and they on their part publiſhed a declaration of a defenſive war, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the 26th day of <hi>April</hi> following; and extended their ſettlements and emigrants from <hi>New-England,</hi> increaſed their power, and they built fortifications in their frontier ſettlements, againſt the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and garriſoned them, and proſpered until the late <hi>glorious revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A PARTICULAR hiſtory of this controverſy from the commencement of it down to this aera, having been written by the writer of this vindication, and publiſhed in 1774. Intitled <hi>A brief Narrative of the proceedings of the government of</hi> New-York <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will be therefore needleſs, as alſo too prolix, to give the contents a place in this; and for this reaſon ſome memorable parts of it only are ſubjoined: and to the whole is added as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, nine ſections of the ſame; holding forth a clear confutation of a <hi>New-Yorkiſh</hi> doctrine, recently propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, of an antient right or theirs to the juriſdiction of the territory in diſpute, with a chain of arguments cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated on an extenſive ſcale, and predicated on unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable facts; evincing that the right of ſoil to the lands contained in the limits of the <hi>New-Hampſhire Grants</hi> was conveyed to the grantees, by virtue of the reſpective grants; that their right to the lands therein contained is indefeaſible; and that the royal adjudication of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016183_0009_0F9BCC1A122A2968"/>boundary line between the governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> ſhould have operated as a line of juriſdiction only, and not in any meaſure to effect the property of the ſubject. Without the conſideration of theſe arguments on the right of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of thoſe lands, a juſt concluſion on the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy cannot be drawn; for if thoſe ſettlements were an intruſion on the right of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> it would in a great meaſure extenuate their conduct towards them; but if on the grounds of juſtice and ſolid argument the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants are good and valid, it muſt of neceſſity invalidate the <hi>New-York</hi> interfering grants, and leave that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment no excuſe for their abuſe to thoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. This we refer to the public and proceed to the later ſtages of the controverſy.</p>
            <p>THE approaching rupture between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the <hi>Colonies</hi> was matter of ſerious reflection to the inhabitants of this frontier; their controverſy with <hi>New-York,</hi> having (at a great expence) been previouſly ſubmitted to the king and privy council, by the negociation of ſpecial agents at two different times, and was in a high probability of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in their favor; which influenced ſome of the inhabitants to take a part with <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> the more ſo, as this part of the country was a fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and of conſequence would be greatly under the enemy's power, who was then in poſſeſſion of <hi>Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, Crown-Point</hi> and St. <hi>Johns,</hi> and commanded the lake with a veſſel of force beſides. At the ſame time their ſettlements were extended on the eaſt ſide of the lake almoſt to the province of <hi>Quebec.</hi> This
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016183_0010_0F9BCC1A4FEB12C0"/>was their ſituation when on the very eve of a war with <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE battle of <hi>Lexington</hi> almoſt diſtracted them, for intereſt inclined them to favor the royal ſide of the diſpute, but the ſtronger impulſes of affection to their country, excited them to reſent its wrongs, and obtain ſatisfaction for the blood of their maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre'd countrymen. Their condition was truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and critical: their hopes were placed on the royal authority for their deliverance from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and oppreſſions of the government of <hi>New-York;</hi> but the ties of conſanguinity, perſonal acquaintance and friendſhip, ſimilarity of religion and manners to the <hi>New-England</hi> governments from whom theſe inhabitants had moſt generally emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, weighed very heavy in their deliberations; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the cauſe of the country was generally believed to be juſt; and that reſiſtance to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had become the indiſpenſible duty of a free people. But there was one very knotty query, which exerciſed the minds of their beſt politicians, viz. Provided they ſhould take an active part with their country. And furthermore. Provided an accommodation ſhould take place, and the colonies return to their former allegiance, what would then become of them or their remonſtrances againſt the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> lodged at the court of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> but this danger ſeems to have been luckily paſſed over.</p>
            <p>SOON after the news of the <hi>Lexington</hi> battle, the principal officers of the green montain boys, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principal inhabitants were convened at <hi>Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and attempted to explore futurity, but it was found to be unfathomable; and the ſcences which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016183_0011_0F9BCC1B1210E890"/>have ſince taken place, then appeared to be precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain. However, it was imagined that provided thoſe inhabitants were loyal to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the event of the war ſhould prove favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>America,</hi> and their ſtruggles for liberty ſhould bring about a revolution in ſtead of a rebellion; that in this caſe they ſhould rid themſelves of the grievous uſurpation of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and be entitled and readily admitted to any privileges which could reaſonably be expected on revolution principles, which undoubtedly will be the conſequence; (for it can hardly be doubted, that provided the ſaid inhabitants had exerciſed the ſame degree of loyalty to the king that they have to the country, they might have ſhared as great privileges from the royal favor, as they now requeſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, viz. Provided the event of the war had prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſucceſsful to <hi>Britain</hi> as it has to <hi>America.</hi>) And as every of the colonies and plantations were then taking arms for the mutual ſecurity of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and it was equally juſt and incumbant on the inhabitants of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants, to do the ſame. It was therefore reſerved to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part with the country, and thereby annihilate the old quarrel with the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> by ſwallowing it up in the general conflict for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; at that time not apprehending the leaſt danger (on the proviſo of a revolution's taking place) that congreſs would reſolve them to belong to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York;</hi> or in any manner counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their being deprived of their liberty by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them under the power of a government which they deteſt more than that of the Britiſh,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016183_0012_0F9BCC1BD13DC9B0"/>which they have manfully aſſiſted the United States to ſuppreſs.</p>
            <p>BUT the enemy having the command of lake <hi>Champlain</hi> and the garriſons contiguous to it, was ground of great uneaſineſs to thoſe inhabitants who had extended their ſettlements on the rivers <hi>Otter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creek,</hi> and <hi>Onion</hi>-river, and along the eaſt ſide of the lake aforeſaid, who, in conſequence of a war, would be under the power of the enemy. It was therefore projected to ſurpriſe the garriſons of <hi>Ticonderoga</hi> and <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> with the armed veſſel in the lake, and gain the command of that important paſs; in as much as ſuch an event would in a great meaſure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thoſe inhabitants from the enemy, obliging them to take poſt in <hi>Canada:</hi> but whether ſuch a meaſure would be agreeable to congreſs or not they could not for certain determine. But it was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that if thoſe poſts were not ſoon taken they would be ſtrongly reinforced, and become impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to any attack ſhort of a regular ſiege, for which, at that time, the country were very deficient in the articles of artillery, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHILE theſe matters were deliberating, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee from the council of <hi>Connecticut</hi> arrived at <hi>Bennington,</hi> with advice and directions to carry into execution the ſurpriſe of thoſe garriſons; and, if poſſible, to gain the command of the lake. Which was done without loſs of time.</p>
            <p>DURING near two years in the firſt of the war with <hi>Britain,</hi> the inhabitants of theſe conteſted lands go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned themſelves, and managed their internal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice under the direction of committees and conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they had done from the commencement of their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016183_0013_0F9BCC1C93A18728"/>controverſy with the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> a ſmall number of the inhabitants excepted, who are ſituate in the ſoutheaſt corner of <hi>Cumberland</hi> county, who adhere to the government laſt mentioned, and are part of them tories.</p>
            <p>ON the 15th day of <hi>January</hi> 1777, the inhabitants of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants to the weſtward of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi>-river, at a general convention, abrogated their former modes of government, <hi>viz.</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees and conventions, and declared themſelves A FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATE, and have formed their conſtitution and mode of government, elected their officers both civil and military; and made and eſtabliſhed a code of laws for the future government of the State.</p>
            <p>AND in conſequence of their frontier ſituation have been invaded by <hi>Britons, Heſſians, Savages,</hi> and more ſavage <hi>tories;</hi> and have (as they humbly conceive) in their various ſtruggles for liberty, fairly merited the ineſtimable enjoyment of it. This they conſider as the ultimate reward of their many expenſive toils, battles, and hazards; and for the attainment of which, they have endured ſuch an uncommon ſeries of concomitant evils.</p>
            <p>On the 23d day of <hi>February</hi> 1778, his excellency governor CLINTON, in purſuance of the requeſt of the Senate and Aſſembly of the State of <hi>New-York,</hi> iſſued his proclamation, which is here tranſcribed, with the anſwer to the ſame, which was publiſhed in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following.</p>

A PROCLAMATION.</head>
                        <p>WHEREAS the Senate and Aſſembly of this ſtate, <note place="margin">L. S.</note> did, by their ſeveral reſolutions paſſed the twenty-firſt day of this inſtant month of <hi>February,</hi> declare and reſolve, That the diſaffection of many perſons, inhabiting the north eaſtern parts of the county of <hi>Albany,</hi> and certain parts of the counties of <hi>Charlotte, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> clearly included within the ancient, original, true and lately eſtabliſhed bounds of this ſtate, aroſe from a conteſt, about the property of the ſoil of many tracts of land, within thoſe parts of the ſaid counties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively.</p>
                        <p>THAT the ſaid conteſt was occaſioned partly by the iſſuing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the reſpective governments of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the one part, and thoſe of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> on the other, antecedent to the late eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the eaſtern boundary of this ſtate; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an higher quit-rent reſerved on the ſaid lands, when re-granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> than were reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the original grants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> or <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> and the exorbitant fees of office accruing thereon; and partly by a number of grants made by the late government of <hi>New-York</hi> after the eſtabliſhment of the ſaid eaſtern boundary, for lands which had been before granted by the governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or one of them; in which laſt mentioned grants by the late government of <hi>New-York,</hi> the intereſt of the ſervants of the crown, and of new adventurers, was, in many inſtances, contrary to juſtice and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,

                        </p>
                        <p>THAT the aforeſaid diſaffection has been greatly increaſed, by an act paſſed by the legiſlature of the late colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the ninth day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy four, entitled, "An Act for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting tumultuous and riotous aſſemblies in the places therein mentioned, and for the more ſpeedy and effectual puniſhing the rioters." That many of the aforeſaid diſaffected perſons, though unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in their oppoſition to the authority of this ſtate labour under grievances ariſing from the cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es above mentioned, which in ſome meaſure extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their offence, and which ought to be redreſſed.</p>

                        <p>THAT an abſolute and unconditional diſcharge, and remiſſion of all proſecutions, penalties and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, under the above-mentioned act, ſhall be an eſtabliſhed preliminary to ſuch overtures; which overtures are as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>THIS proclamation, after mentioning a diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of many perſons inhabiting the northeaſt parts of the county of <hi>Albany,</hi> and certain parts of the counties of <hi>Charlotte, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:016183_0020_0F9BCC23D35A0678"/>proceeds to affirm that theſe tracts of country were clearly included within the ancient, original, true and lately eſtabliſhed bounds of the ſtate of <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT many, nay, almoſt the whole of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in thoſe counties, <hi>alias,</hi> the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> are diſaffected to the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> will not be diſputed. This is a fact: But it is not a fact, that the ancient, original and true bounds of <hi>New-York</hi> included thoſe lands. The firſt intimation that ever ſaluted the ears of the public, aſſerting this doctrine, was, from a proclamation of governor <hi>Tryon</hi>'s, dated the 11th day of <hi>December,</hi> 1771, which begins thus: <q>Whereas, it is the ancient and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible right of this colony, to extend to <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi>-river as its eaſtern boundary.</q> This aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been anſwered at large in my Treatiſe on the Conduct of this Government towards the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Settlers, to which I refer the reader, and at preſent obſerve, that as the quoted aſſertions in theſe proclamations, are wholly without foundation, they need only to be as poſitively denied as they are aſſerted. The fact is, that the tract of land which now comprehends the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> was univerſally known to be in the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> Thus it was placed by all Geographers in their maps, 'till the year 1764, when the now <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, for certain polical reaſons, which I ſhall mention, extended the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York</hi> over the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niſes, by his ſpecial royal authority. At the time of the alteration of this juriſdiction, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies had fir'd the minds of king and parliament againſt the growth and riſing power of <hi>America,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016183_0021_0F9BCC2410A26858"/>at this time they began to advance men and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into power, with a political deſign to cruſh the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>America. New York</hi> had ever been their favorite government: They could almoſt vie with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in the art of vaſſalaging common people, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſing every idea of liberty from the human mind, by making and keeping them poor and ſervile. This <hi>Great Britain</hi> well knew, and therefore ſheed a large territory from <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and aſided it to <hi>New-York,</hi> to depreſs the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the one, and enlarge and extend the other. A well concerted plan: But the <hi>green mountain boys</hi> diſconcerted it, by throwing their weight in to the ſcale of congreſs, which, thank GOD, has fairly ponderated. Thus may be ſeen the deſign, as well as date, of the original, ancient and true bounds of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi>'s being extended over the ſtate of <hi>Vermont;</hi> and for the ſame reaſon it was thus extended by <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> it will undoubtedly be curtailed by congreſs.</p>
            <p>As to the acts of outlawry, mentioned in the proclamation, they died a natural death the firſt day of <hi>January</hi> 1776, as may be ſeen from the act itſelf, here quoted: <q>And be it further enacted by the authority aforeſaid, that this act ſhall remain and continue in full force and effect, from the paſſing thereof, until the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> which will be in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-ſix.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſubjects of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> were under no apprehenſions from theſe old lifeleſs acts: Nor do I conceive, that the preſent legiſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> have laid them under any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016183_0022_0F9BCC24D4547BA8"/>in granting their a pardon. It was a matter which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

In the lifetime of this act, I was called by the <hi>Yorkers</hi> an outlaw, and afterwards by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> was called a rebel; and I humbly conceive, that there was as much propriety in the one name as the other, and I verily believe, that the king's commiſſione<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s would now be as willing to pardon me for the ſin of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, provided I would afterwards be ſubject to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as the legiſlature abovementioned, provided I would be ſubject to <hi>New-York;</hi> and, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I had as leave be a ſubject to the one as the other, and, it is well known, I have had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with them both.</p>
            <p>NEXT, I propoſe to conſider that part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation called Overtures, which are contained in the three firſt articles. Article 1ſt. <q>That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons actually poſſeſſing and improving lands, by title under grants from <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay,</hi> and not granted under <hi>New-York,</hi> ſhall be confirmed in their reſpective poſſeſſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS firſt article cannot be conſidered of any material conſequence, inaſmuch, as among almoſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016183_0023_0F9BCC25C0D07730"/>the whole poſſeſſions referred to in the article, there are but very few if any, but what are covered with <hi>New-York</hi> grants.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond article is as follows: <q>That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons poſſeſſing and improving lands, not granted by either of the three governments, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their reſpective poſſeſſions, together with ſuch additional quantity of vacant land, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contiguous to each reſpective poſſeſſions, as may be neceſſary to form the ſame into a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent farm, ſo as the quantity of land to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each reſpective poſſeſſion, ſhall not exceed three hundred acres.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER of theſe two firſt articles, called Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, affect the controverſy, except in ſome very few inſtances, inaſmuch as all, or in a manner all the poſſeſſions ſpoken of, were firſt granted by <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> except ſome few which were granted by <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay;</hi> and then, laſtly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> poſſeſſions regranted by <hi>New-York.</hi> This being the caſe, what has been hitherto propoſed, does not reach the eſſence of the controverſy, as the <hi>New York <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> very well know; beſides, it is not in the power of the government to confirm any of thoſe poſſeſſions which have been already granted, and therefore become the property of the grantees, as will be more fully diſcuſſed in its proper place. I proceed to the third article of the much boaſted Overtures.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THAT where lands have been heretofore grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> or either of them, and actually poſſeſſed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, and being ſo poſſeſſed, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016183_0024_0F9BCC2652C44A70"/>granted by <hi>New-York,</hi> ſuch poſſeſſion ſhall be confirmed, the poſterior grant under <hi>New-York</hi> notwithſtanding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH it is abſolutely out of the power of the ſaid legiſlative authority, to confirm the poſſeſſions mentioned; yet, to diſcover their want of generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their propoſal, I ſhall, in the firſt place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a trifling proportion of thoſe poſſeſſions could be confirmed upon their own ſtating, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the confirming clauſe in the article, only confirms the poſſeſſor, who being ſo poſſeſſed at the time that the <hi>New-York</hi> grant was ſaid, and has no reſpect to any additional poſſeſſion carried on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the grant took place: The identical words are, <q>And being ſo poſſeſſed, were afterwards granted by <hi>New-York;</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> After ſuch poſſesſion was actually made, and the poſſeſſor being ſo in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the time the grant took place, ſuch poſſesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be confirmed, but any later poſſesſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be included in the condition of <q>being ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed;</q> for, a later poſſesſion was no poſſesſion at all at the time the condition of poſſesſion took place; and conſequently, every poſſesſion which has been begun in the ſtate of <hi>Vermont,</hi> ſince the lands were granted by <hi>New-York,</hi> muſt be loſt to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, and fall into the hands of the <hi>New-York</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, with all other uncultivated lands in the ſtate; and all our purchaſes of thoſe lands from <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> fall to the ground, together with our poſſesſions, which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed an hundred fold.</p>
            <p>THESE Overtures have hitherto been conſidered only in a grammatical and logical ſenſe, allowing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016183_0025_0F9BCC27189CE740"/>them their own conſtruction; I now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in a law ſenſe. A legiſlative authority, within its own juriſdiction, may confirm a poſſeſſion on vacant land, by making a grant of the ſame to the poſſeſſor: But, for the legiſlative authority of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> to pretend as they do in their proclamation, to vacate any grants, made by their own authority, in favor of any poſſeſſion, and to confirm ſuch poſſeſſions, by nullifying and defearing their own grants, is the height of folly and ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For, the lands being once granted, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paſſeth to the grantee, who is become the ſole proprietor of the ſame; and he is as independent of that legiſlative authority which granted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as any perſon may be ſuppoſed to be, who purchaſeth a farm of land of me by deed of conveyance; and it is as much out of the power of that legiſlature to vacate a grant made by them, or the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in favor of any poſſeſſor, as it is out of my power to vacate my deed of conveyance in favor of ſome ſecond perſon. It is contrary to common ſenſe to ſuppoſe, that the property of the ſubject is at the arbitrary diſpoſal of the legiſlature: If it was, they might give a grant to day, and vacate it to morrow, and ſo on, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> This would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very nature and exiſtance of perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as the whole would depend on the ſovereign will and laſt act of the legiſlature: But the train of the matter is, the firſt conveyance will, and ought to hold good; and this defeats all ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid on this ſubject, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the overtures in the proclamation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:016183_0026_0F9BCC27D1441AE0"/>forth, are either romantic, or calculated to deceive woods people, who, in general, may not be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to underſtand law, or the power of a legiſlative authority.</p>
            <p>I HAVE further to evince my arguments on this ſubject, by the concurring opinion of the Lords of the Board of Trade, on complaint made to them from thoſe very perſons, poſſeſſing the land we are ſpeaking of. That clauſe of their report which is ſimilar to what I have argued, is in theſe words: <q>Such ſubſequent grants made by the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> however unwarrantable, cannot be ſet aſide by any authority from his majeſty, in caſe the grantees ſhall inſiſt on their title.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS it appears, in a trial (of the ſame caſe we are treating of) before the board of trade, that the king, under whoſe authority the government of <hi>New-York</hi> had, in an oppreſſive manner granted thoſe very lands, could not, by his royal authority, vacate or ſet aſide the grants; yet the preſent legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> proclaim to the world, and pledge the faith of government, that they will do it. But enough has been ſaid on the impoſſibility of it, as well as on the ungenerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the propoſal: And as to the quit-rents, the General Aſſembly of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their expediency, and probably releaſe them all.</p>
            <p>WHAT has been obſerved, anſwers every part of the proclamation worth notice, as the five laſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles had an entire reference to the three firſt; though it may be worth obſerving, that the time of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe overtures are run out, and it is my
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016183_0027_0F9BCC289460F310"/>opinion, that but few of the ſubjects of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> have cloſed with them. The main induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had in anſwering them was, to draw a full and convincing proof from the ſame, that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, beſt, and moſt eligible, I had almoſt ſaid, the only poſſible way of vacating thoſe <hi>New-York</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering grants, is, to maintain inviolable the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the legiſlative authority of the independent ſtate of <hi>Vermont.</hi> This, at one ſtroke, overturns every <hi>New-York</hi> ſcheme which may be calculated for our ruin, makes us free men, confirms our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, "and puts it fairly in our power to help our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves" to the enjoyment of the great bleſſings of a free, uncorrupted and virtuous civil government.</p>

IT is apprehended that what has been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imadverted on the firſt of theſe proclamations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a clear refutation of the eſſential parts of both; eſpecially to thoſe who are acquainted with the circumſtances of the granting and ſettling thoſe lands, but to the public in general, who are not. The anſwer is not ſufficiently explanatory: we have therefore thought it expedient, to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional obſervations on the firſt of them, with a full anſwer to the latter. Inaſmuch as the leading gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> in both public and private company, when diſcuſſing on the controverſy, do not heſitate, in the moſt poſitive manner, to affirm, and ſtake their honor, that their government have really offered (thoſe deluded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> a full and authentic confirmation of their lands granted by <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay;</hi> but that they are, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, "refractory and licentiouſly diſpoſed." The truth of this matter muſt be learnt from ſuch part of the aforeſaid proclamations called overtures, which is all that ever have been pretended to be made from that government to thoſe inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Governor <hi>Clinton</hi>'s firſt proclamation begins with an air of penitence, pointing out a number of grievances, which he admits thoſe inhabitants "have laboured under, which, in ſome meaſure, extenuate their offence, and which ought to be redreſſed." This then is the point at iſſue, whether thoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are calculated for that purpoſe, or are adiquate to it, or not: or whether they were not rather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to deceive and inſnare the people to whom they were made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:016183_0032_0F9BCC2C4FD2CBE8"/>
"THAT the ſaid conteſt was occaſioned, partly by the iſſuing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the reſpective government of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the one part, and thoſe of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> on the other, antecedent to the late eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the eaſtern boundary of this ſtate."</p>
            <p>PREVIOUS to this eſtabliſhment, which was in 1764, the government of <hi>New-York</hi> had granted but two ſmall parcels of land in the new territory of <hi>Vermont,</hi> namely, the patent of <hi>Hooſick,</hi> in 1765, which is ſuppoſed to extend into the townſhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> and to include five or ſix thouſand acres of land in ſaid town, which is ſituate in the ſouthweſt corner of the ſtate of <hi>Vermont:</hi> and alſo the patent of <hi>Wallumſcock,</hi> in 1739, is ſaid to interfere with the townſhips of <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> and <hi>Bennington;</hi> includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about five thouſand acres of land: theſe are all the <hi>New-York</hi> patents which interfered with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>Vermont,</hi> at the time of the ſettlement of their eaſtern boundary,; "and partly by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of grants made under the late government of <hi>New-York,</hi> after the eſtabliſhment of the ſaid eaſtern boundary, which had been granted by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, or one of them; in which the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned grants by the late government of <hi>New-York,</hi> the intereſt of the ſervants of the crown, and of new adventures, was, in many inſtances, contrary to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and policy, preferred to the equitable claims for confirmation of thoſe who had patented the lands under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> or <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THIS confeſſion comes very near the truth, tho' in the ſentence <q>was, in many inſtances, contrary
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016183_0033_0F9BCC2D13502EF0"/>to juſtice and policy:</q> It ſhould have been ſaid, in every inſtance contrary to juſtice and policy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it in a great meaſure comprehends the main object of injuſtice on which the controverſy aroſe, and conſequently the main ſource of grievancies may be deduced from it.</p>
            <p>THE government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> previous to the ſettlement of the ſaid boundary line, (and when thoſe lands were univerſally ſuppoſed to be in that government) had granted one hundred and thirty-ſix townſhips, ſix miles ſquare, in the territory of the now ſtate of <hi>Vermont.</hi> Previous to theſe grants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> the government of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay</hi> had granted ſundry tracts of land in the territory aforeſaid, which in the ſettlement of the boundary line between them and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> in 1739, fell within the juriſdiction of the latter, and was by them moſtly confirmed to the original grantees under <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> No ſooner had the government of <hi>New-York</hi> obtained juriſdiction of the ſaid territory, but they proceeded to re-grant the lands aforeſaid to new adventurers, in prejudice to the grantees and actual ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay:</hi> But remonſtrances from them againſt the oppreſſions of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> as mentioned aforeſaid, procured the king's prohibition, which is as follows.</p>

"That an abſolute and unconditional diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and remiſſion of all proſecutions, penalties, and forfeitures, under the above-mentioned act, ſhall be and eſtabliſhed preliminary to ſuch over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures."</p>
            <p>As the laws alluded to in the ſaid act were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and the term for their continuing in force expired more than two years; conſequently they were as tho' they had not been, in every ſenſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that they intailed an eternal diſgrace on the government of <hi>New-York</hi> for enacting them, which infamy hath been renued by the aforeſaid propoſal of a mock pardon; uſhered in as an eſtabliſhed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary to certain overtures, which the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York</hi> were making to the citizens of <hi>Vermont.</hi> It ſeems they expected that this would be conſidered as an eminent diſplay of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pave the way for their overtures which were equally empty and impertinent.

            <p>FROM fifteen years acquaintance with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York, Vermont</hi> is by no mean, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to truſt this important controverſy to their deciſion of juſtice and equity, as it has hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from every idea of thoſe rules of moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which are practiſed by virtuous governments; their notions of juſtice and equity ſeem to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and unjuſt; at leaſt, every ſample of it which they have as yet exhibitted to thoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants appears to be ſo; probably a habit of inſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſubjects has beat it into their heads, that it is juſt; and thus people commonly conceive it to be juſt to inſlave <hi>negroes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS ſtrange that the ſaid legiſlature had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this difficulty which the ſaid inhabitants la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor under before they made the offer; for though the legiſlature may, for all that can be objected to their former conduct, be really honeſtly diſpoſed; yet ſuch a belief could hardly rationally be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gain credit among a people who have ſuffered ſuch flagrant and high handed oppreſſions from both the legiſlative and executive authority; and where it is the intereſt and very genius of the government, to inrich individuals on the tenantage, poverty and ſlavery of the great maſs of their ſubjects, a little ſeriour reflection might have determined them not to make ſuch a propoſal; and conſequently, not have put us to the bluſh in anſwering the ſame. It is hoped that this freedom of writing will be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016183_0037_0F9BCC30D19CF110"/>as we are obliged in this defence, to give our reaſons for rejecting theſe overtures.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the propoſal of the aforeſaid le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, every inhabitant in the conteſted territory would be liable to a trial at law for his land, in ſome way which the legiſlature ſhall provide, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his tide. Thoſe inhabitants have ſcent too much money already in land trials at the <hi>New York</hi> courts, but could never have the charters under which they held their land, ſo much as read in court.</p>
            <p>But it may be argued, that agreeable to the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Confederation of the United States, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons holding under grants from different govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may have a right of petitioning for a deciſion, agreeable to the method therein preſcribed. But this would give birth to new troubles. The farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Vermont</hi> are unſkilled in law, and by no means a match for the over-grown wealthy <hi>New York</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees; but inſufficient as they may be ſuppoſed for the taſk, they have, upon this plan, to go thro' a courſe of law in the ſtate of <hi>New-York;</hi> and then, for certain, have to petition agreeable to the mode of trial pointed out by the articles of confederation; and it will be readily conceived, that not many of them are able to defray ſuch an expence, or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of managing ſuch an important lawſuit.—Beſides, the articles of confederation are not yet ſubſcribed to by the ſeveral United States; and it is uncertain whether they ever will; eſpecially as they now ſtand. And conſequently the grantees holding under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent grants have, as yet, no right to a deciſion by petitioning in the manner before-mentioned.</p>

WE come now to the conſideration of governor <hi>Clinton</hi>'s laſt proclamation of the 31ſt of <hi>October</hi> 1778.</p>
            <p>"WHEREAS the Senate and Aſſembly of this ſtate, did by their concurrent reſolutions, paſſed the 21ſt day of <hi>February</hi> laſt, propoſe certain overtures with reſpect to the controverted lands in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſtern parts of the county of <hi>Albany</hi> and certain parts of the counties or <hi>Cumberland, Charlottes</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in order to quiet the diſorders prevailing in that part of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>"AND WHEREAS the ſaid reſolutions have been miſrepreſented by ſome, and miſunderſtood by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and are deemed not to apply to the caſes of many perſons entitled to relief, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>"AND WHEREAS the Senate and Aſſembly, in order more effectually to remove ſuch apprehenſions and more fully to explain the ſaid reſolutions, and manifeſt the equitable intentions of the legiſlature, have by their concurrent reſolutions paſſed this preſent ſeſſion."</p>
            <p>THE public would naturally by this ſpacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the reſolve hereafter to be mentioned, imagine that the aforeſaid equitable intention of the legiſlature, would ſhine in robes of juſtice and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity; and explain the firſt proclamation alluded to, in ſome ſpiritual ſenſe, very different from its literal meaning: but in ſtead of that, we find the ſubſequent patents under the government <hi>New-York</hi> virtually confirmed, and the grantees and actual ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> expoſed to the ſame or ſimiler intriegues which they ever have been by that government ſince they laid their interfering patents on thoſe lands, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

"<hi>Reſolved,</hi> That with reſpect to all ſuch lands which have heretofore been granted by the governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> or <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> and have not been ſince granted by the government of <hi>New-York;</hi> that all ſuch grants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> or <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> ſhall be confirmed and declared good, valid and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, to all intents and purpoſes, as if the ſame had been made by the government of <hi>New-York.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THIS reſolve which the ſaid legiſlature are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call an overture to the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> is a palpable inſult and affront to the common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mankind; inaſmuch as not only the ſame le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature as well as every of thoſe inhabitants of common ſenſe, very well know that all the lands of any conſiderable conſequence which have been granted by the governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> have been long ſince actually granted by the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> as has been before particularly repreſented; ſo that this laſt product on from the ſenate and aſſembly of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> as exhibitted in the ſaid procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is big with miſchief and manifeſt deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the claimants and actual ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſenate and aſſembly of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> have in the ſame proclamation, propoſed a very extraordinary arbitration between them the ſaid legiſlature, and the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> and ſubmit it to congreſs to appoint the arbitrators.</p>
            <p>THEIR propoſal is as follows. "<hi>Reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> That in all caſes of diſputes ariſing between perſons claiming under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay</hi>

            <p>THIS propoſal is really whimſical, or calculated to rid themſelves of the fulfilment of confirming certain poſſeſſions in the diſputed territory, for the faithful performance whereof they pledged the faith of government, as may be ſeen in governor <hi>Clinton</hi>'s firſt proclamation, and the abſurdity and utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of ſuch a confirmation being pointed out in the anſwer to the ſame of the 9th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt. It ſeems that the ſaid legiſlature have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to rid themſelves of this difficulty by laying it on congreſs: but it ſhould be conſidered, that neither the ſaid legiſlature or congreſs, are parties concerned in the caſe; the diſpute, as it reſpects the interfering grants, lies between the grantees of the three governments reſpectively: they, and only they, have a right of trial at common law, or to refer it to arbitration, provided they agree; but it is no part of the buſineſs of the ſaid legiſlature or of congreſs, or both together, to bring forward ſuch an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the ſaid reſolve propoſeth: as on ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (for congreſs are too wiſe to do it) ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs adopt the ſaid propoſal, and elect certain men to determine a diſpute between the legiſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> and ſuppoſe furthermore, that ſuch deciſion ſhould be in favor of the inhabitants; yet this would be
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016183_0041_0F9BCC349434D618"/>no bar againſt a proceſs at law againſt thoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by the <hi>New-York</hi> patentees, who would, after a hundred ſuch chimerical arbitrations, have the ſame right of trial at common law, as they now have; for the legiſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to be a party in theſe cares or to have any right to an arbitration, any more than the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of the ſtate of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> or any indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſon whatſoever; nor is it poſſible for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> or Congreſs, to ſettle thoſe diſputes any other ways but upon the principles of common law; ſo that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the ſaid legiſlature appears to be weak and impertinent.</p>
            <p>THESE overtures bear a near reſemblence to thoſe of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament to the united ſtates; in which caſes it is not to be ſuppoſed, that there was any ſincerity. No favor is either aſked or expected by the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont</hi> from the legiſlature of the ſtate of <hi>New-York;</hi> they do not blame them for not confirming their grants under <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay;</hi> for they know that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the ſame lands have been ſince granted by the late government of <hi>New-York,</hi> it is out of their power to confirm their poſſeſſions; but they blame them for pretening to do it when they know they cannot do it: and alſo that they do not deſign to do it, as appears from the curious reſerve of confirming "all ſuch lands which have heretofore been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

FROM the foregoing animadverſions on theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations it manifeſtly appears; that the new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> are purſuing the meaſures adopted by the old; which is the plan that they are determined to affect, or nothing at all. From firſt to laſt they have put all at ſtake upon it; and it is no ways probable that they ſo much as deſire to comprehend <hi>Vermont</hi> in their juriſdiction abſtractly conſidered from it, for the haired ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them and thoſe inhabitans, is ſimilar to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> averſion.</p>
            <p>NOTHING can be more repugnant to the polity and genius of that government, than to extend their juriſdiction as aforeſaid, on any other terms, but to engroſs the lands, and vaſſalage its inhabitants. To illuſtrate this propoſition, we will ſuppoſe this territory to be included in the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York;</hi> and likewiſe, that it was populated, and the inhabitants held their property in that equal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which they do at preſent; or as is common in the <hi>New England</hi> ſtates, which will be the caſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the right of ſoil be held under the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grants; this would make a diſcord in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and be a ſtanding reproach to the inſlaved part of the ſtate; from whence animceities and ſtrife would conſtantly ariſe, as one party would be for ſlavery, while the other would be for liberty, which would imbroil the government, and end in a civil war; for their genius, polity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, ſpirit and manners, would be as diametrically oppoſed to each other as they now are, or as liberty is to ſlavery. A people ſo oppoſite to each other in civil, political, and we may add, religious ſentiments, can never ſubſiſt long
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016183_0043_0F9BCC360FE273B8"/>under the ſame government, for the demonſtration whereof we appeal to the current hiſtory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>AND this the government of <hi>New-York</hi> have been very ſenſible of; and therefore have from firſt to laſt, exerted themſelves to divide the diſputed terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory into large patents among themſelves and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites, ſo as not to endanger their ſlaviſh mode of government, and avoid the difficulties before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>THIS the government of <hi>New-York</hi> are alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of, and are therefore indefatigable in their applications to congreſs to procure a reſolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the government of <hi>Vermont</hi> from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings as ſuch, and to decree, that the free citizens thereof, ſhall ſubmit to the government of <hi>New-York:</hi> imagining, that in conſequence of ſome ſuch like reſolve, that they may procure a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force from the united ſtates, to carry into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution the reduction of <hi>Vermont;</hi> an enterpriſe which their own militia ſee a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>THE government of <hi>New-York</hi> never had a juſt right of juriſdiction over the territory of <hi>Vermont.</hi> It was obtained by their ſolicitation ex-parte, and without either the knowledge or approbation of the inhabitants, who as ſoon as opportunity permitted, remonſtrated againſt it before the king and council; and furthermore complained of the oppreſſions of that government in appropriating their lands and poſſeſſions for the emolument of their favorite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers.</p>

               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:016183_0045_0F9BCC37905D2DB0"/>
HAD the government of <hi>New-York</hi> ſanctified the baſe and illegal manner of acquiring a pretended legal claim of juriſdiction, by a virtuous and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent adminiſtration; and in ſtead of monopolizing the ſoil, had confirmed the prior grants under the governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> clear of fees and expence; the inhabitants would probably, by degrees, have excuſed them, and reluctantly ſubmitted to their government; but inaſmuch as the reverſe of this has taken place, and a premeditated deſign of uſurpation hath uniformly manifeſted itſelf in acquiring the claim of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exerciſing the ſame; it ought therefore in juſtice to be conſidered as null and void from the beginning, on account of the illegal meaſures, falſe repreſentations, and undue influence, under which it was obtained and exceriſed. Furthermore, tho' the government of <hi>New-York</hi> had ever ſo good and legal a claim to the juriſdiction, the mercenary, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, and inhumane uſe which they have made of it conſidered abſtractly, ſhould in juſtice, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the rules of ſound policy, be a final bar againſt any further exerciſe thereof.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants on the weſt ſide of the range of green mountains, never pretended to aſſociate or connect with the government of <hi>New-York</hi> in any ſenſe whatſoever, but have managed their internal and external police wholly independent of them as has been before related: though that government have made uſe of every artifice and low cunning to intice and perſuade them to it; <hi>viz.</hi> by propoſing a confirmation of lands to certain perſons which they thought to be fit inſtruments to inſlave the reſt;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016183_0046_0F9BCC3853DAC380"/>commiſſions civil and military were likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſome with like views, but the main body of the people were virtuous; and not only ſo, they had not the offer of either a confirmation of their lands or a commiſſion to every of them; and it is moſt probable, that theſe offers which were actually made were fallacious; and that if the ſaid govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been confirmed, the propoſed favorites would have ſhared much the ſame fate as is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the tories would have done in conſequence of the ſubjugation of the country at large by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Britain.</hi> However, there were a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of depraved and mean ſpirited raſcals which bit at the bait, and would probably have aſſiſted that deſigning government of land clenchers, to divide the people, and finally inſlaved them, had not the integrity and heroiſm of the green mountain boys prevented it, making it dangerous for any to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch commiſſion, or ſecure his farm on the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of his neighbours. Nevertheleſs the ſame ſort of intrigues more or leſs took place on the eaſt ſide of the ſaid range of mountains: the counties of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi> were erected, and for a time partly eſtabliſhed under the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> and in violation of the then king's authority, but injuſtice and oppreſſion reigned to ſuch an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable degree, that ſtrife and oppoſition to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was the conſequence which finally termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> maſſacre on the 4th day of <hi>March</hi> 1774, which put a final period to the grand uſurpation of the government of <hi>New-York</hi> on the eaſt ſide of the range of green mountains, and the main body of the people from that time till now,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:016183_0047_0F9BCC3B49BF54B0"/>have reprobated the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and have not ſuffered a court to be convened and held in either of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AT the time the government of <hi>New-York</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with the other ſtates, the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont</hi> had formed their conſtitution, elected their chief, and other magiſtrates, and were in full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of government; and as they were free and unconnected with any ſtate or body politic, had a juſt right ſo to do. This right they received from nature, nor were they beholden to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> or any other power ſhort of the <hi>omnipotent. New-Hampſhire</hi> had forſaken and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected them, and <hi>New-York</hi> tyrannized over them as much as they poſſibly could, (or dare) and they were a people between the heavens and the earth, as free as is poſſible to conceive any people to be; and in this condition they formed government upon the true principles of liberty and natural right; nor can the government of <hi>NewYork</hi> acquire any right of juriſdiction over them in conſequence of confederating with the other free ſtates of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> inaſmuch as the ſtate of <hi>Vermont</hi> was at that time not only independent of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> but of any and every of the nuited ſtates.</p>
            <p>THE royal adjudication of the boundary line afore-mentioned, was temporary in its nature, and arbitrary in its extention and conveyed nothing of the nature of a charter, grant, or permanent juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:016183_0048_0F9BCC3B5803B868"/>to the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> but receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its life and ſpirit by a miſtical communication which it may be ſuppoſed to have every moment from the ſovereign will of the royal adjudicator; from that ſource only this line crew all its ſupport, as the branch does from the vine from whence it ſprings; and the declaration of independence cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vital union, occaſioned this line like a lamp to go out which exhauſted of oil and leave no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its exiſtence; from which moment the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary claim of the <hi>New-Yorkiſh</hi> juriſdiction over the territory of <hi>Vermont</hi> expired, and the inhabitants thereof reverted to a ſtate of nature. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the government <hi>New-York</hi> 1ſtly forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their claim of juriſdiction by the illegal meaſures made uſe of in acquiring it. And 2dly, by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal and oppreſſive exerciſe of it. And 3dly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have loſt it by the annihilation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> king's authority in conſequence of the late revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by which means the ſaid adjudicated op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive juriſdictional line became null and void to all parties, and is as though it had not been.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, this frontier country was under the greateſt neceſſity of forming government; the inhabitants were obliged to exerciſe not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal policy among themſelves, but an external po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy againſt foreign invaſions; this they dare not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

THE government of the infant ſtate was, as it were, in <hi>embryo,</hi> when the haughty general <hi>Eurgoyne</hi> was penetrating the country; his ſpacious procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation filled the air with a tyrants awe; intimidated the weak, the ſervile and baſe, but inraged the ſtrong, the generous and the brave. Mean while the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the new ſtate was very indefatigable in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigns againſt him; not only by forming their own militia into regular battalions under brave of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in order to oppoſe him, but by exciting the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> to aſſiſt them: while theſe matters were tranſecting, general <hi>Schuyler</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the militia of this ſtate to march to <hi>Saratoga,</hi> but government would not permit it, inaſmuch as they apprehended that <hi>Bennington</hi> and its vicinity was an object of deſtruction by the enemy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the brave general STARK with his detachment arrived at a lucky moment, and being chearfully joined by the green mountain boys, fell on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with relentleſs fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, which terminated in the two memorable and glorious battles of <hi>Bennington,</hi> and was the firſt check to the progreſs of a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enemy; which proved the ſalvation of the new ſtate, and had its ſalutary influence on the pending cauſe of the independent ſtates of <hi>America</hi> at large, and is a ſtriking proof of the good policy of aſſuming government.</p>
            <p>ANY one who is acquainted with mankind, and things, muſt know that it would be impracticable to manage the political matters of this country without the aſſiſtance of civil government. A large body of people deſtitute of it, is like a ſhip in the ſea without a helm or mariner, toſſed with impetuous
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:016183_0050_0F9BCC3CD35CF478"/>waves. They could not enjoy domeſtic peace and ſecurity, conſidered abſtractly, from a <hi>Britiſh</hi> war and <hi>Yorkiſh</hi> uſurpation, without civil regulations; the two laſt conſiderations do in the moſt urgent manner excite them to ſtrengthen and confirm the government ſet up by the conſent, approbation and authority of the people, which is the fountain of all temporal power, and from which the citizens of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> have already experienced ſuch ſignal advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. This puts them on an equal footing with their <hi>NewYork</hi> adverſaries, and will finally enable them to baffle all their machinations and devices which nothing elſe can poſſibly do.</p>
            <p>USURPATION and injuſtice was the primary cauſe of the ſeparation and revolt of the <hi>Engliſh American</hi> colonies from <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> and this was alſo their grand reaſon and juſtification for ſo doing; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the ground of their right to independency. Theſe reaſons are abundently concluſive and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, as exhibitted by congreſs at large; and there appears to be a great degree of ſimilarity in this controverſy with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government with that of <hi>Vermont</hi> againſt the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> except in this reſpect, that the territory of <hi>Vermont</hi> was never under the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York;</hi> although by fraud, injuſtice, and the conniv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> court, they procured a royal order, purporting ſuch a claim; which, in reality, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from a complication of intereſted and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical views, between them and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> court; the latter promoted and extended the power and influence of the former in <hi>America,</hi> to promote and aid in the ſubjugation of it; (for at that time the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:016183_0051_0F9BCC3D906F65C0"/>projection was forming) and it is well known that <hi>New-York</hi> was their favorite government; and it hardly admits a diſpute but that the intrinſic cauſe of the royal extenſion of the juriſdiction was to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the deſigns which have ſince been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>America;</hi> this and the <hi>Quebec</hi> bill was of a piece, and the motive of their extention the ſame, to more effectually bribe them governments to their intereſt, as ſubſequent and reciprocal tranſactions may more fully evince.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed with the parallel. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> government claimed an excluſive right of taxing the colonies in all caſes whatſoever; ſuch a prerogative would unavoidably have terminated finally in abject ſlavery, as has been fully illuſtrated by many inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious writers, and verified by the univerſal experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mankind; but the government of <hi>New-York</hi> took a more direct and immediate method, for at one blow they ſtruck at the landed property of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> by ſtretching their ſubſequent interfering patents over them; this was more like a combination of land thieves, than a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment who covering the lands and lobors of the inhabitans, which, but a little before by iniquitous concerted meaſures at the <hi>Britiſh</hi> court (in ſtead of ſlaves) they proved to be denominated their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The mutilating the charter of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay</hi> by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, was a high hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtride of arbitrary power, and ſtruck the very nerves of liberty, but not ſo fatal as though they had appropriated the ſod of the colony to new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, as in the inſtance of the interfering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents before mentioned; for nothing which can be
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:016183_0052_0F9BCC3E50A09F50"/>done to any people is capable of ſo effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving them, as the monopoly of their lands; when this is the caſe with a people, it is idle for them to diſpute any more about liberty; for a ſovereign nod of their landlord, cannot fail to over awe them, and by degrees eraſe the natural images of liberty from the mind, and make them grovel out a conteptable and miſerable life.</p>
            <p>THE deteſtable acts of outlawry paſſed the 9th day of <hi>March</hi> 1774, by the legiſlative authority of the colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> particularly againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont</hi> was, in ſubſtance, a poſitive declaration of war againſt them: by theſe acts they declared thoſe inhabitants out of their protection; and abdicated the government, provided they may be ſuppoſed at that time to be poſſeſſed of any right thereto. The fact is, they appealed to arms; in this caſe they muſt effect the conqueſt of <hi>Vermont,</hi> or give up their pretentions to the government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> on the 26th day of <hi>April</hi> following, publiſhed a declaration of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive war againſt the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> as aforeſaid, and warlike preparations were making on both ſides; but the <hi>Britiſh</hi> invaſion has procraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated the determination of the matter till this time; and when this great and aſtoniſhing revolution ſhall be fully ſettled, ratified, and confirmed, it will be early enough for <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Vermont</hi> to proceed to the ſettlement of their controverſy.</p>
            <p>BUT to continue the parallel. Thoſe acts of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry according to the expreſs tenor thereof, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered their courts of judicature, to award ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death againſt any of thoſe inhabitants as
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:016183_0053_0F9BCC3F11DB3A60"/>ſhould be capitally indicted, although they were not perſonally before ſuch court; and in like manner, any other ſentence of puniſhment ſhort of death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of the ſaid inhabitants which ſhould be criminally indicted without any hearing, mearly on indictment itſelf; and alſo gave a full indemnifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any and every of their ſubjects, for killing, maiming or wounding, thoſe inhabitants which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſuch execution of law: in fine, the real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of theſe laws were to obtain poſſeſſion of the farms of thoſe inhabitants, or to make thoſe who had the magnanimity to oppoſe them outlaws, and kill them where ever they could be found, that they might poſſeſs and enjoy the country; for ſuch as they could not kill on the ſpot they only had to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict capitally, and procure a ſentence of death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, from their court of judicature, (which was eaſily done) and then every of their ſubjects or ruffians, became legal executioners; and from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of public or private rewards, were at liberty, nay, under obligations to kill and exterpate them from the lands coveted, in any manner, and by any ſtratagem which might beſt ſerve ſuch inhumane purpoſſes; for all which ſavage cruelties, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators had governmental indemnification; and thus the inhabitants (which they would fain have to be their ſubjects) were obliged either to give up their inheritance, or, in the <hi>Yorkiſh</hi> ſenſe of the word become outlaws, fellons, rioters, &amp;c. and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the dangers and hazards of the ſhocking evils before mentioned, which nothing but the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit and unconquerable fortitude of the green mountain boys prevented taking place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:016183_0054_0F9BCC3FD00EFE10"/>
MUCH more might be ſaid as to the injuſtice, tyranny, oppreſſion, and malevolence of theſe laws, but it is needleſs to animadvert any further on them, inaſmuch as they carry their own refutation along with them; they are therefore ſubjoined verbatim to this vindication; with the original anſwer to the ſame, publiſhed ſoon after they made their public appearance, and ſubmitted to the public conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with this obſervation, that among the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary edicts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government towards the colonies, none were equally oppreſſive to this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their declaration of war. Their act for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the ſubjects of the colonies acroſs the ſea for trial for crimes committed or ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this country, was a daring ſtroke againſt the liberties of a free people; for though they were permitted a perſonal hearing, yet it was attended with great embarraſſments, and inſurmountable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and diſadvantages, to be forced to a trial in a ſtrange country, deſtitute of acquaintance, friends, or evidence, to make a defence; and probably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money or credit; this would be a ſhocking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be reduced to, eſpecially by law, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal deſign of which, was to protect and promote the liberty and happineſs of mankind. This bears a near reſemblance to thoſe acts of outlawry, tho' it is hardly ſo replete with malicious turpitude; and therefore a more certain deſtruction would have been the fate of the inhabitants of <hi>Vermont,</hi> had thoſe laws taken place; who, on a landjobbers indictment, and a landjobbing courts judgment, without hearing, to ſuffer death, or other puniſhment, by virtue of the laws of an infamous landjobbing legiſlature.</p>

THE local diſtance of <hi>Vermont</hi> from the ſeat of government in the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> is near four hundred and fifty miles from its extream parts, which would make government chargable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient; and abſtracted from all other conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, would conſtitute a ſufficient reaſon for the independence of <hi>Vermont;</hi> nevertheleſs, provided thoſe inhabitants were obliged to ſubmit to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York,</hi> they would wiſh to have the diſtance ten times greater.</p>
            <p>THE people of <hi>Vermont</hi> conſider themſelves as being virtually in union with the united ſtates, from the time that they took poſſeſſion of lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> and the garriſons depending thereon, in behalf of the united ſtates, in <hi>May</hi> 1775; from which early period of the revolution, they have taken an active part with them, and have purſued invariable, the ſame object, <hi>viz.</hi> liberty; have participated in all their troubles; and with them have hazarded all that is worth living or dying for: ſuch a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of intereſts, and mutual co-operation, in ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defending the ſame, conſtitutes the very nature and eſſence of union and confederation, nor can there be more than a meer formal declaration requiſite to fully eſtabliſh a confederation between them.</p>

                                    <p>WHEN we conſider the numberleſs troubles, and almoſt inſurmountable difficulties which our
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016183_0060_0F9BCCD39DD96B20"/>infant ſettlements have been forced to ſtruggle with ſince its firſt beginning, which have been occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an unequal and biaſſed adminiſtration of law, ever ſince our unhappy misfortune of being annexed to a government in which the intereſt of the greater part of the leading gentlemen thereof are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to our's. The tyrannical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they take to enſlave us, (we hope) will not fad to juſtify us in the following arguments and reſolves thereon; for we think it an intolerable hardſhip, and piece of inhuman cruelty, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to give ſufficient proof of our loyalty and obedience to government but at the reſignation of our whole fortunes, in the purchaſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, we have ſuffered an infinity of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. While we view the ſpirit of the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in their reſolves, we cannot but reflect with ſome regret, on what may of conſequence prove the reſult (without an alteration) of their preſent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but there are ſcarce any circumſtances that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely exclude hope; therefore we are not yet in total deſpair; for this moment we happily call to mind, that the general aſſembly of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, about two years ago, did annex all that part of the <hi>Bay</hi> province weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, to that UNLIMITED county of <hi>Albany;</hi> but their ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious grappling not being of a ſufficient ſtrength for ſuch an unreaſonable burthen, it failed, by which they loſt their ideal booty.</p>
                                    <p>THE reader will doubtleſs obſerve, that in the reſolves of the aſſembly aforeſaid, there is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word mentioned in regard to the title of the land conteſted for, but that they level all their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:016183_0061_0F9BCCD4569A7020"/>ſpleen, and point all their malice at notorious riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they call them, and make a pretended ſhew and figure, as though they were great ſticklers for good order and government; although at the ſame time every perſon of common ſenſe, who has had any acquaintance and knowledge of the controversy, abſolutely knows, that out goodly and, with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thereon, is the only ſubject matter and grand object of the whole controverſy; and give the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> but that, and the matter would be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to their eternal ſatisfaction; and it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the words riotous diſorderly, licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grantees and preſent occupants, for the whole courſe of the ſucceeding century.</p>
                                    <p>FOR the truth of the caſe is, the executors of the law, are moſt (if not all) of them the pretended claimants to the lands whereon the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grantees and occupants dwell; and their judgments on writs of ejectment, brought by the <hi>New-York</hi> patentees, have not hitherto failed to correſpond with their imaginary intereſts; but were they honeſt men they would not undertake to be judges in their own caſe, or in any other wherein the reſolution thereof would make a preſident for their own, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in title of land wherein judge and plaintiff are connected in one common intereſt: ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of law is contrary to the law of reaſon and nations.</p>
                                    <p>THEREFORE our caſe ſtands thus, if we ſubmit to their execution of law, and become obedient and ſubmiſſive ſubjects of their deſigning government, we muſt ſoon yield to be their tenants and ſlaves;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016183_0062_0F9BCCD5107DD510"/>and we cannot ſee reaſon to conform to any law which will apparently bring us and our poſterity into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or manifeſtly deprive us of our property; but inaſmuch as we boldly adhere to the maintenance of our property, which to us is very precious as it would be to the <hi>New-Yorkers,</hi> was it in their hands.

                        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this prohibition, and one or two more of the ſame general import, and from the ſame authority, the government of <hi>New-York</hi> have lapped their patents on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> charters, and in conſequence thereof demand at
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:016183_0064_0F9BCCD69621B1F8"/>common law, the land on which the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grantees and occupants dwell; and from hence has ariſen the numerous troubles and diſturbances between the government of <hi>New-York</hi> and its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſubjects, the ſettlers under <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> This has alto been the ſource of all licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and confuſion, riotouſneſs, &amp;c. complained of by that government againſt the ſettlers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                        <p>AND whereas the true ſtate of our grants hath been already laid before the worthy lords of the board of trade and plantation, and they having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and wiſely deliberated upon its ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, did on the third day of <hi>December,</hi> A. D. 1772, make their report in favor of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grantees, to his moſt gracious majeſty, whoſe royal confirmation we daily expect; and on the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and good faith of this report, many hundreds of induſtrious (and many of them wealthy) families have purchaſed and moved upon the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grants, nothing doubting of that title.</p>
                        <p>WE therefore humbly report to the ſaid general committee of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, as our opinion, 1. That as we over have, ſo for the future we will remain loyal and dutiful ſubjects to our moſt rightful ſovereign GEORGE the third, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean ourſelves agreeable to the good and wholeſome laws of the realm, and fight for the dignity of his majeſty's crown and government at all times when there may be a call for it, viewing him as our poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical father, and relying on him to be protected in our property.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="65" facs="unknown:016183_0065_0F9BCCD7518DA318"/>
2. THAT as we purchaſed our lands of one of his majeſty's governors, and on the good faith of the crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> we are determined to maintain thoſe grants, againſt all oppoſition, until his majeſty's royal pleaſure ſhall be known in the premiſes.</p>
                        <p>AND whereas we have never made any further reſiſtance to government, than the law of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which the law of GOD and nature enjoyns on every intelligent, wiſe and underſtanding being; we therefore are fully of the opinion to reſolve,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. THAT ſuch of the magiſtrates and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental authority of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> as have purſued, and have been acceſſary in the ſcheme of indicting our friends and neighbours as rioters; and have by intrigue and ſtratagem of various ſorts, endeavored to take them, and puniſh them as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals; thereby to diſhearten and terrify the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers to that degree, that they may tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſinherited; have acted contrary to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and deſign of the good and righteous laws of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> which, under a juſt adminiſtration, never fail to ſecure the liberty and property of the ſubject; are thereby guilty of great inhumanity to its reſpective ſubjects. We therefore reſolve, That as a country, we will ſtand by, and defend our friends and neighbours ſo indicted, at the expence of our lives and fortunes. And we would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the general aſſembly of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> to wait the determination of his majeſty, relative to the title of thoſe lands, and deſiſt from taking us as rioters, to prevent the unhappy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that may reſult from ſuch an attempt.</p>

AND fourthly, and laſtly, reſolved, That for the future, every neceſſary preparation be made, and that our inhabitants hold themſelves in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at a minute's warning, to aid and defend ſuch friends of our's, who, for the merit to the great and general cauſe, are falſely denominated rioters; but that we will not act any thing more or leſs, but on the'defenſive, and always encourage due execution of law in civil caſes, and alſo in criminal proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are ſo indeed; and that we will aſſiſt, to the utmoſt of our power, the officers appointed for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>THE foregoing arguments, narrations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, being laid before the general committee of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, and was read ſundry times, and carefully examined; and after mature deliberation, Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> chairman, put the votes to tryal, whether the foregoing was approved of as an anſwer to the reſolves of the general aſſembly of the province of <hi>New-York?</hi> and it was paſſed in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative. And it was furthermore the advice of this committee, that the foregoing be forthwith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the public papers, to the intent that all officers, magiſtrates, and perſons whatſoever, may know, that if they preſume to take the rioters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, they do it on their peril.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:016183_0080_0F9BCCE416627800"/>public, not only for ourſelves but for the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grantees, and occupants in general; that the ſpring and moving cauſe of our oppoſition to the government of <hi>New-York</hi> was ſelf-preſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſtly, the preſervation and maintaining of our property: And ſecondly, ſince that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo incenſed againſt us, therefore it ſtands us in hand to defend our lives; for it appears by a late ſet of laws paſſed by the legiſlature thereof that the lives and property of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers are manifeſtly ſtruck at; but, that the public may rightly underſtand the eſſence of the controverſy, we now proclaim to thoſe law-givers, and to the world, that if the <hi>New York</hi> patentees will remove their patents that have been ſubſequently lapped and laid on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> charters, and quiet us in our poſſeſſions, agreeable to his majeſty's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and ſuſpend thoſe criminal proſecutions againſt us for being rioters (as we are unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination) then will our ſettlers be orderly and ſubmiſſive ſubjects to government; but be it known to that deſpotic fraternity of law-makers and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, that we will not be fooled or frighted out of our property; they have broke over his majeſty's expreſs prohibitions, in patenting thoſe lands, and when they act in conformity to the regal authority of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> it will be ſoon enough for us to obey them. It is well known by all wiſe and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons in the neighbouring governments, (that have animadverted on the controverſy) that their pretended zeal for good order and government, is fallacious, and that they aim at the lands and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the grantees and ſettlers aforeſaid; and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:016183_0081_0F9BCCE4CEED22F0"/>that they ſubvert the good and wholeſome laws of the realm, to corroborate with, and bring about their vile and mercenary purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>AND, inaſmuch as the malignity of their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards us, hath flamed to an immeaſurable and murtherous degree, they have in their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled laws, calculated for the meridian of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, paſſed the 9th of <hi>March,</hi> 1774; ſo calculated them, as to correſpond with the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs of their minds and morals; in them laws, they have exhibited their genuine pictures. The emblems of their inſatiable, avaricious, overbearing, inhuman, barbarous, and blood-guiltineſs of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and intention is therein portraited in that tranſparent image of themſelves, which cannot fail to be a blot and an infamous reproach to them, to poſterity.—We cannot ſuppoſe that every of his majeſty's council, or that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the general aſſembly were active in paſſing ſo bloody and unconſtitutional a ſet of laws; undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, ſome of them diſapproved thereof; and it is altogether poſſible, that many that were active in making the law, were impoſed upon by falſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, and acted under miſtaken views of doing honor to government; but be this as it will, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that there was a majority. and it has been too much the caſe with the government, for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deſigning ſchemers, and land-jockeys, to rule the ſame. Let us take a view of their former nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and circumbſcribed boundaries, and how, that by legerdemain, bribery and deceptions of one ſort or other, they have extended their domain far and wide; they have wrangled with and encroached on
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:016183_0082_0F9BCCE74A7EAD10"/>their neighbouring governments, and have uſed all manner of deceit and fraud to accompliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: their tenants groan under their uſury and oppreſſion; and they have gained, as well as merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſapprobation and abhorrence of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the innocent blood they have already ſhed, calls for heaven's vengeance on their guilty heads; and if they ſhould come forth in arms againſt us thouſands of their injured and diſſatisfied neighbours in the ſeveral governments, will join with us, to cut off, and extirpated ſuch an execrable race from the face of the earth!</p>
                        <p>THIS piece is not ſuppoſed to contain a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the new conſtructed laws aforeſaid; for ſuch a large <hi>two year old,</hi> hath never before been ſeen in <hi>America,</hi> it being of an enormous and monſtrous birth; nor is it ſuppoſed to give the legiſlators their full characters: but ſo much may ſuffice for the preſent. To quote the laws, and make remarks thereon, would be matter ſufficient for a volume: However, we will yet make ſome ſhort abſervations,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, NEGATIVELY, it is not a law for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York</hi> in general, but,</p>
                        <p n="2">2d, POSITIVELY, it is a law but for part of the counties of <hi>Charlotte</hi> and <hi>Albany;</hi> viz. Such parts thereof as are covered with the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and it is well known thoſe grants compoſe but a minor part of the inhabitants of the ſaid province; and we have not preſentative in that aſſembly. The firſt knowledge we had of ſaid laws, was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of them; which informed us, that if we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, three or more of us together, to oppoſe (that which they all legal) authority, we ſhall be
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:016183_0083_0F9BCCE7D807B008"/>adjudged felons, and ſuffer the pains of death; and that ſame fraternity of plotters knew, as well as we, and the generally of the people in the adjacent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, that they have for a number of years laſt paſt, endeavored to exerciſe ſuch a courſe of what they call law, that had they not been oppoſed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe grants (called the MOB) in the executing the ſame, they would, before this time, have been in poſſeſſion of that territory, for which the laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid are calculated. Therefore the caſe ſtands thus: If we oppoſe civil officers in taking poſſeſſion of our farms, we are, by theſe laws, denominated fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons; or if we defend our neighbours who have been indicted rioters, only for defending our property; we are likewiſe adjudged felons. In fine, every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their monarchial government is deemed felony, and at the end of every ſuch ſentence, there is the word DEATH! And the ſame laws further impowered the reſpective judge, provided any perſons, to the number of three, or more, that ſhall oppoſe any Magiſtrate, or other civil officer, and be not taken, that after a legal warning of ſeven days, if they do not come and yield themſelves up to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain officers appointed for the purpoſe of ſecuring them; then it ſhall be lawful for the judges afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to award execution of DEATH, the ſame as tho' he or they had been convicted or attainted before a proper court of judicature, &amp;c. The candid reader will doubtleſs obſerve, that the diabolical deſign of this law, is to obtain poſſeſſion of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grants, or to make the people that defend them out-laws, and ſo kill them whenever they can catch them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="84" facs="unknown:016183_0084_0F9BCCE8919F4AA0"/>
THOSE bloody law-givers know we are neceſſitated to oppoſe their execution of law, where it points directly at our property, or give up the ſame: but there is one thing is matter of conſolation to us, viz. that printed ſentences of death will not kill us when we are at a diſtance; and if the executioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us, they will be as likely to fall victims to death as we: and that perſon, or country of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, are cowards indeed, if they cannot as manfully fight for their liberty, property and life, as villains can do to deprive them thereof.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>New-York</hi> ſchemers accuſe us with many things, part of which are true, and part not.—With reſpect to reſcuing priſoners for debt, it is <hi>falſe.</hi> As to aſſuming judicial powers, we <hi>have not,</hi> except a well-regulated combination of the people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their juſt rights, may be called ſo. As to forming ourſelves into military order, and aſſuming military commands, the <hi>New-York</hi> poſſies, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary preparations, oppreſſions, &amp;c. <hi>obliged us to it.</hi> Probably Meſſ. <hi>Duane, Kemp,</hi> and <hi>Banyer,</hi> of <hi>New-York,</hi> will not diſcommend us for ſo expedient a preparation; more eſpecially ſince the decrees of the 9th of <hi>March,</hi> are yet to be put in execution: and we flatter ourſelves, upon occaſion, we can muſter as good a regiment of mark's-men and ſcalpers, as <hi>America</hi> can afford; and we now give the gentlemen above-named, together with Mr. <hi>Bruſh,</hi> and Col. <hi>Ten Broeck,</hi> and in fine, all the land-jobbers of <hi>New-York,</hi> an invitation to come and view the dexterity of our regiment; and we cannot think of a better time for that purpoſe, than when the executioners come to kill us, by virtue of the authority their
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:016183_0085_0F9BCCE9526B6C70"/>judges have lately received to award and ſentence us to death in our abſence. There is ſtill one more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table complaint againſt us, viz. That we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and manaced ſeveral magiſtrates, and other civil officers, ſo that they dare not execute their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective functions. this is <hi>true</hi> ſo far as it relates to the magiſtrates. But the public ſhould be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what the functions of thoſe magiſtrates are: they are commiſſioned for the ſole purpoſe of doing us all the harm and miſchief they poſſibly can, thro' their adminiſtration and influence; and that they might be ſubſervient to the wicked deſigns of the <hi>New-York</hi> chemers. Theſe are their functions; and the public need no further proof than the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that they are the tools of thoſe extravagant law-makers; and it muſt be owned, they acted with great judgment, in chuſing the moſt infernal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their purpoſe,</p>
                        <p>DRACO, the <hi>Athenian</hi> lawgiver, cauſed a number of laws (in many reſpect; analogous to thoſe we have been ſpeaking of) to be <hi>written</hi> in blood. But our modern <hi>Draco</hi>'s determine to have their's <hi>verified</hi> in blood. They well know we ſhall more than <hi>three,</hi> nay, more than <hi>three times three hundred,</hi> aſſemble together, if need be, to maintain our common cauſe, till his majeſty determines who ſhall be and remain the owners of the land in conteſt. "<hi>Wilt not thou poſſeſs that which Chemoth, thy God, giveth thee to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs?</hi>" So will we poſſeſs that which the Lord our God (and King) giveth us to poſſeſs.</p>
                        <p>AND laſtly, we addreſs ourſelves to the people of the counties of <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>Charlotte,</hi> which inhabit to the weſtward of, and are ſituated contiguous to the <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> grants.</p>

GENTLEMEN, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS, PROVIDENCE having allotted and fixed the bounds of our habitations in the ſame vicinity, which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the intercourſe of trade and commerce, hath formed an almoſt univerſal acquaintance and tie of friendſhip between us, and hath laid ſuch a foundation of knowledge, that your people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cannot but be ſenſible that the title of our land is in reality the bone of contention; and that as a people, we behave ourſelves orderly; and are induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, and honeſtly diſpoſed; and pay juſt reference to order and good government; and that we mean no more by that which is called the MOB, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our juſt rights and properties. We appeal to the gentlemen merchants, to inform whether our people in general, do not exert themſelves to pay their juſt debts; and whether ever they have been hindered by the country's MOB, in the collection of their dues. But as the magiſtrates, ſheriffs, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheriffs, coroners, and conſtables of the reſpective counties that hold their poſts of honor and profit under our bitter enemies, we have a jealouſy, that ſome of them may be induced (to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe on whom they are dependant, and for the wages of unrighteouſneſs, offered by proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to preſume to apprehend ſome of us, or our friends: We therefore advertiſe ſuch officers, and all perſons whatſoever, that we are reſolved to inflict <hi>immediate death</hi> on whomſoever may attempt the ſame. And provided any of us or our party ſhall be taken, and we have not notice ſufficient to relieve them, or whether we relieve them or not, we are reſolved to ſurround ſuch perſon or perſons, whether at his or
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:016183_0087_0F9BCCEAD2B30C60"/>their own houſe or houſes, or any where that we can find him or them, and <hi>ſhoot ſuch perſon or perſons dead.</hi> And furthermore, that we will <hi>kill</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> any perſon or perſons whomſoever, that ſhall <hi>preſume</hi> to be acceſſary, aiding or aſſiſting in taking any of us as aforeſaid; for by theſe preſents we give any ſuch diſpoſed perſon or perſons to underſtand, that, altho' they have a licence by the law aforeſaid to <hi>kill</hi> us; and an "indemnification" for ſuch murther from the ſame authority; yet they have no indemnification for ſo doing, from the <hi>green mountain boys;</hi> for our lives, liberties and properties, are as verily precious to us, as to any of the king's ſubjects; and we are as loyal to his majeſty or his government, as any ſubjects in the province: but if the governmental authority of <hi>New-York</hi> will judge in their own caſe, and act in oppoſition to that of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and inſiſt upon <hi>killing</hi> us to take poſſeſſion of our "vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards" come on, we are ready for a game of ſcalping with them; for our martial ſpirits glow with bitter indignation, and conſumate fury, to blaſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal projections.</p>
                        <p>IT may be the reader, not having ſeen the law referred to in this piece, and not being thoroughly acquainted with the long and ſpirited conflict that hath ſubſiſted between the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> nor of the progreſſive, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and monopolizing diſpoſition of the court party of the latter of thoſe provinces; may be apt to imagine that the ſpirit of this writing is too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, inaſmuch as it deſtines whoever preſumes to take us as felons or rioters, to immediate death; but let the wiſe conſider the ſtate of the cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">

1. PROVIDED we on our part be taken, we have by them laws the ſentence of death already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt us, on proviſo more than three of us aſſemble together to maintain and defend our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, till his majeſty determines the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. And,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. MAY it be conſidered, that the legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the province of <hi>New-York</hi> had no conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional right or power to make ſuch laws, and conſequently that they are null and void, from the nature and energy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they merit no place among the laws of the realm of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but are the arbitrary league and combination of our bitter and mercileſs enemies, who, to obtain our property, have inhumanly, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly, and maliciouſly, under the ſpecious and hypocritical pretence of legal authority, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for order and government, laid a ſnare for our lives. Can the public cenſure us for exerting ourſelves nervouſly to preſerve our lives in ſo criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a ſituation? For by the laws of the province, into which we are unfortunately fallen, we cannot be protected in either property or life, except we give up the former to ſecure the latter; ſo we are reſolved to maintain both, or to hazard or looſe both.</p>
                        <p>FROM hence follows a neceſſary inference, That inaſmuch as our property, nay, our lives, cannot be protected (but manifeſtly ſtruck at) by the higheſt authority in the province to which we at preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; therefore in the interim, while his majeſty is determining the controverſy, and till he ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his royal authority, and ſubject the authority
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:016183_0089_0F9BCCEC527236B8"/>aforeſaid to their duty, or re-annex the diſtrict of diſputed lands to the province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> or ſome way in his great wiſdom and fatherly cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, put the diſtreſſed ſettlers under <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> on an equal footing with our brother ſubjects in his realm; we are under neceſſity of reſiſting, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto blood, every perſon who may attempt to take us as felons or rioters as aforeſaid; for in this caſe it is not reſiſting law, but only oppoſing force by force; therefore inaſmuch as by the oppreſſions aforeſaid, the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers are reduced to the diſagreeable ſtate of anarchy and confuſion; in which ſtate we hope for wiſdom, patience and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, till the happy hour his majeſty ſhall graciouſly be pleaſed to reſtore us to the privileges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen.</hi>

               <p>AS the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> rely on their charters from that government as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and ground of their title to the property of the land in conteſt; ſo, on the other hand, the claimants under

                  <hi>New-York,</hi> predicate and ground their title to the ſame land on the validity of their patents from <hi>New-York:</hi> This brings the point in iſſue between the reſpective claimants to this ſingle queſtion, namely, <hi>Which of the ſaid governments conveyed the fee of the land in conteſt?</hi> For it is ſelf-evident both could not. And up in exploring the controverſy, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverting on the merits of the different claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to ſtand the teſt, and adjudged valid, it will of neceſſity invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the other. In the diſcuſſion of this ſubject, and ſearching into the merit of the reſpective claims, it is neceſſary to inſpect into the validity of the grant from king CHARLES to the duke of YORK, from which foundation only, the government of <hi>New-York</hi> deduce their right of patenting the lands in conteſt; yet the matter of fact is, that neither the government of <hi>New-York</hi> as ſuch, or any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual therein, has ever had any conveyance of any land from the duke of <hi>York,</hi> nor doth any landlord or perſon whatever, in the government hold the fee or property of their land, by virtue of any convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the duke of <hi>York;</hi> but they hold the fee of their lands on a very different footing, viz. by conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that king <hi>Charles</hi> gave to his brother <hi>James</hi> duke of <hi>York,</hi> the fee of the lands weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the head of <hi>Delaware-Bay;</hi> and allowing the fee to be ſtill veſted in him, his heirs or aſſigns, upon this hypotheſis no perſon in the province of <hi>New-York</hi> hath the fee or property of the land they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, the fee remaining the property of the duke of <hi>York,</hi> his heirs or aſſigns. And further, upon the ſame
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:016183_0092_0F9BCCEE9064F5E0"/>principle, thoſe identical patents under the ſeal of <hi>New-York,</hi> which were laid on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, are in their own nature, equally null and void, with all other conveyances of land in the ſaid province which have been given by the crown, the fee thereof being veſted in the duke of <hi>York,</hi> &amp;c. So that the grantees under <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> are both, upon this ſtating of the caſe, equally deſtitute of the fee of the land conteſted for: But, upon this ſtating, the grantees under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> have the argument of ſettlement, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and poſſeſſion, on their ſide; which is abundantly ſufficient to give the priority, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of title to them; ſo that neither the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> or their patentees, gain any thing by building their title on the ſaid grants to the duke of <hi>York;</hi> for if there be any thing in it, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats their own title as well as that of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> proving too much for their purpoſe, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. But, if the lands contained in the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s grant reverted back to the crown, then the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s patent became extinct, null, and abſolutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the ſaid reverſion happened in conſequence of the ſaid duke's abdicating the throne—turning papiſt, or by any formal ſurrendery, or by any means whatever, provided the fee became reveſted in the crown, then the ſaid charter became extinct, as aforeſaid; ſo that whether the fee of the land in diſpute ſtill remains in the ſaid duke of <hi>York,</hi> his heirs or aſſigns, or reverted, or was ſurrendered to the crown, none of all this will in the leaſt juſtify the government of <hi>New-York</hi> or its patentees, in
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:016183_0093_0F9BCCF0EED63FE8"/>founding their pretenſions of title to the lands afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by virtue of the aforeſaid grant from king <hi>Charles</hi> to the duke of <hi>York.</hi> For, take the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one way, and it overturns both the title of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> alſo, leaving the latter in occupation and poſſeſſion of the diſputed premiſes, and that only, being intirely deſtitute of the fee; and the <hi>New-York</hi> claimants deſtitute of the leaſt colour of title whatſoever. But, take the argument the other way, viz. Provided the fee of the lands aforeſaid reverted and been reveſted in the crown, then the ſaid lands at the time of firſt granting were crown lands the ſame as though the duke of <hi>York</hi> had never exiſted. But the truth of the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is this, the under proprietors all except <hi>William Penn,</hi> who had the ſeveral countries par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled out to them by the duke of <hi>York,</hi> which was contained in his grant; ſurrendered their charters to the crown, whereby <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> became royal governments: This then being the ſtate of the caſe, the lands in diſpute became crown lands, and the governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> as well as <hi>New-York</hi> crown officers, or king's agents, and it is of no conſequence to the king which of his governors grants his land, if ſo be they be granted to and ſettled by loyal and induſtrious ſubjects, thereby adding to the revenue of the crown and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging and ſtrengthening the kingdom. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſuppoſed, and admit for ſuppoſition only, that the governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> exceeded his proper limits in granting crown lands, muſt the grantees who have ſettled thoſe lands, paid one of the crown officers for granting the ſame, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their ALL, in ſettling and cultivating his
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:016183_0094_0F9BCCF18F58F480"/>majeſty's wilderneſs land, and who are truly loyal ſubjects, be turned off the ſaid land by thouſands, and reduced to ſtarving poverty, together with their numerous families, becauſe one of the crown officers either ignorantly or deſigningly impoſed upon the people by granting crown lands over his bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more ſo as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed that the ſubjects are capable judges of the juriſdiction of governments, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there ſhould be the greateſt care taken to guard the ſubject from injury in all caſes of this nature; the truth of which will more fully appear by the following conſiderations, viz. That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuppoſed error in granting the ſaid lands, yet the great end of the crown in granting of it is compleatly anſwered; and provided the ſubjects i. e. the ſettlers are quieted in the fee and poſſeſſion of the ſaid lands, they will not be injured, ſo that upon this hypotheſis, neither king nor ſubject would ſuſtain damage: Indeed no perſon in the realm could have juſt cauſe of complaint. True, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective governors of <hi>New-York</hi> may inſinuate, that upon this ſtate of the caſe, the governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> has cheated them out of their fees for granting the ſaid lands—though it is evident, if crown officers are faithful to the king and ſubjects, they could take no more money for granting crown lands, than a reaſonable compenſation for their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the other governor's being ſuppoſed to grant the lands, ſaves the ſaid governor of <hi>New-York</hi> the trouble; ſo that the argument is brought to this ſingle point only at laſt, that upon ſuppoſition the governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> exceeded his proper
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:016183_0095_0F9BCCF26234D9E8"/>limits in granting thoſe lands, yet neither king nor ſubjects are injured, (provided the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> hold the fee of the ſaid land as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove) except the governors of <hi>New-York,</hi> and if they be ſuppoſed to be honeſt men, the trouble of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the land would be equal to their fees had they granted it; ſo that they have not been injured a whit more in this caſe, than they be ſuppoſed to have injured the ſubjects by taking exorbitant fees for granting the ſame lands; which to them is no injury at all, but a providential check to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their avarice. So that the reſpective gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>New-York,</hi> in an equitable ſenſe, are no looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this affair; or at moſt the privileges would be ſo very inconſiderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, eſpecially when ſet in competition with the ſhocking and univerſal deſtruction that would overſpread a large country of his majeſty's good ſubjects, provided they be diſpoſſeſſed of the lands aforeſaid. This ſeems to be the genuine ſequel of the argument, even upon the <hi>Yorker</hi>'s own ſtating it.</p>

               <p>IT is not conceeded to on the part of the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> that the governor did in fact exceed his proper limits in granting thoſe lands, the contrary will abundantly appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſiderations, viz. Before and at the time the ſaid governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> granted thoſe lands they were reputed to be within his juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this was the opinion of both learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, the wiſe as well as ſimple, thus is was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:016183_0096_0F9BCCF3130A11B8"/>planed in all ancient and modern maps down to the year 1764, when, by royal determination, the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> was extended over this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted diſtrict of land. But the general opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this royal adjudication was, that the province of <hi>New-York</hi> extended its juriſdiction but twenty miles to the eaſtward from <hi>Hudſon's</hi>-river, ſo general was this opinion, that the beſt maps of the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective provinces, and the hiſtory of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> adopted it as ſettled; it is of very great weight in the queſtion to ſhew how univerſal this maxim was, and that the unprejudiced and accurate geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> in his map compoſed ſo late as the year 1755, which with great propriety and certainty aſcertains the ſame limits, this map has the more authority as it was according to the certificate of Mr. <hi>Pownal,</hi> ſecretary to the board of trade, and was undertaken with the approbation and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the lords commiſſioners for trade and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and is chiefly compoſed from draughts, charts, and actual ſerveys of different parts of his majeſty's colonies and plantions in <hi>America,</hi> great part of which have been ſince taken by their lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips orders and tranſmitted to the office of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of ſaid colonies. This twenty mile line was ſo far from being deemed unfavorable to <hi>New-York,</hi> that we find the commiſſioners from that province ſo late as the year 1767, made an offer to thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachuſett-Bay</hi> to let a line at twenty miles diſtance eaſt of <hi>Hudſon's</hi>-river be the diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their reſpective provinces, which the latter commiſſioners would not then agree to it, being thought by them too much in favor of <hi>New-York,</hi>

               <p>THOUGH it is true in the year 1771 the province of <hi>New-York</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> public act of their general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, did annex all that part of the province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> to the weſtward from <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, to their county of <hi>Albany;</hi> and it is likewiſe true that in the year 1773, the governors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective provinces met at <hi>Hartſord,</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and came to a mutual agreement to ſettle that line at twenty miles diſtance eaſtward from <hi>Hudſon's</hi>-river, which was the hypotheſis of that ſettlement, which hath ſince been ratified by his majeſty.</p>
               <p>THE report of the lords commiſſioners for planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affairs in 1753, ſtates the following facts, from which is neceſſarily inferred that <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended its juriſdiction to the weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river,—"There are, ſays their lordſhips, about 60,000 acres of land ſituate on the weſt ſide of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi>-river, which were purchaſed by private perſons from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to whom the land had been laid out, by the government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> as an equivalent for two or three townſhips which the latter purchaſed from the former, this tract of land by the determination of the boundary line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the provinces of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay</hi> in 1739 is become a part of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi>"—Thus we have their lordſhips ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents that the juriſdiction of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over part of the very lands in conteſt, weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, as long ago as the year 1739, at which time <hi>New-York</hi> never dreamed of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016183_0098_0F9BCCF49650EFB8"/>extending their claim to <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river.—There is another glaring and indiſputable evidence of the former weſtern extent of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> viz. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to ſort <hi>Dummer</hi> which was built by the <hi>Bay</hi> province in 1724, and garriſoned at their expence a great number of years; but upon its being excluded from their juriſdiction by the ſettlement of the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictional line, between them and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> in 1739, the <hi>Bay</hi> province repreſented to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home, that the ſaid diſtrict of land and fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> having been determined to be the property of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> they were no longer obliged to garriſon and maintain it, and praying, that as it was neceſſary to the defence of the country, that <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> might be directed to ſupport it. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, an order paſſed the king and council in 1744, that the governor and commander in chief of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> ſhould forthwith move the aſſembly, in his majeſty's name, to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proviſion for that ſervice; and at the ſame time informing them that in caſe they refuſed to comply with ſo reaſonable and neceſſary a propoſal, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would find himſelf under a neceſſity of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fort, with a proper diſtrict of land contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thereto, to the province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> who cannot with juſtice be required to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fort no longer within their boundary. In conſequence of this, <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> did maintain this fort, and paid a demand of arrears for its main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance, to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> In the mean time <hi>New-York</hi> was never a competitor for the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, willing as ſhe is to enjoy the advantage of granting and engroſſing the ſaid lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:016183_0099_0F9BCCF551AB77D0"/>
THIS being the caſe, the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> by the royal decree, was obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> and it being on the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, and on this very identical diſtrict of land now in diſpute, can that government be juſtly charged with granting lands in the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> when but a little before his majeſty in council had adjudged the ſame lands to be in the ſaid govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> and ordered them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, as by maintaining fort <hi>Dummer,</hi> &amp;c. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at that time <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> did extend its juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river; otherwiſe the king had ordered the government of <hi>New-York</hi> to have maintained fort <hi>Dummer.</hi> Nothing can be more flagrantly evident than, that the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> had a right to grant crown lands where the crown compelled them to defend. From hence it appears, that the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> had a legal right to grant the lands now in diſpute, and that, that government and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's good ſubjects, the grantees of and ſettlers on the ſaid lands, acted upon honeſt and honorable principles, in granting, purchaſing &amp; ſettling the ſame, and on the other hand it appears, that the government of <hi>New-York</hi> in re-granting the ſame land, acted quite the reverſe; and the more unpardonably ſo, as they granted great part of it in open defiance to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's authority manifeſted unto them by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prohibition, dated the 24th day of <hi>July</hi> 1767.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been already elucidated it appears, that the adminiſtration of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> extended weſtward of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi>-river,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016183_0100_0F9BCC5A427DB9D0"/>and that this was the general ſenſe of the nation (till aſcertained as aforeſaid) is real mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact.—True no determination of his majeſty or reports of the lords of trade had before particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized how far the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſhould extend weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river: but ſuch determinations of their's mightily ſtrengthened the common opinion, nay, fully confirmed it, that that government extended weſtward to a twenty miles diſtance eaſt from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river. This was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion both of king and ſubjects at the time the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> granted thoſe lands; and adventurers could not conceive of any interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate boundary in one place more than another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river and the twenty mile limit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; nor had they any apprehenſion that the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> would extend to the weſtward of that limit. This twenty mile line took univerſal and deep impreſſion on the minds of geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, and was the underſtanding of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, and was thus portrayed in all former maps. The certainty of this general opinion may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrated from the conſideration that none of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects applied to the government of <hi>New-York</hi> for grants of thoſe lands, till after the alteration of juriſdiction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <hi>New-York</hi> ſcriblers, that their government extended patents from within the ſaid twenty mile line acroſs the ſame, and on ſome part of the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in diſpute, many years before the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> granted thoſe lands—which will be hereafter conſidered: But, would further add, it is matter of diſpute whether the adminiſtration at home
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:016183_0101_0F9BCC4509C3E890"/>would recognize thoſe patents granted by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York,</hi> on the premiſes aforeſaid; though antecedent to thoſe granted by <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> inaſmuch as the royal adjudication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the government of <hi>York York</hi> to grant them lands, which by royal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication of the line of juriſdiction between <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> fell within the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> in 1739, as aforeſaid. However, for argument only, we will ſuppoſe the governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>New York</hi> had each of them equal authority to grant thoſe lands—then on this ſtating the caſe, prior granting would of conſequence be priority of title. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, upon this hypotheſis, being good and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid both in law and equity, muſt neceſſarily defeat any ſubſequent grant from the crown or its repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, being as authentic, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as any conveyance of the fee of land from the crown can poſſibly be.—Thus it appears upon this moſt favorable conceſſion to thoſe on the part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the argument preponderates in favor of the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> as their grants are prior to thoſe of <hi>New-York,</hi> (except in the inſtances of the old parents, yet to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.)</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the expreſs words of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, that the grantees were not only entitled to the fee of the lands therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, but alſo to all the enfranchiſements, and each and every of the privileges and immunities that by law his majeſty's ſubjects in the province of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> enjoy; ſo that at the ſame time the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:016183_0102_0F9BCC451AA384E0"/>were veſted with the fee of the land, they were enfranchiſed with, and entitled to all the privileges and immunities contained in their charters; as the holding of fairs, chooſing town officers, and making and mending their own roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it ſhould be the future pleaſure of his majeſty, to continue the ſaid lands in the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> (which by the ſettlers aforeſaid is hoped will not be the caſe) that the claimants and ſettlers under the ſaid grants, will nevertheleſs have his majeſty's gracious appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to enjoy without let or moleſtation, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of incorporation therein contained; the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees having ever conſidered thoſe privileges as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably connected with the grant of the fee-ſimple.</p>

               <p>FROM the facts and reaſons that have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the foregoing ſections, it manifeſtly appears, that the title of the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> to the lands in queſtion is indefeaſible; yet ſtill there are ſundry conſiderations that may ſerve more abundantly to confirm and eſtabliſh this title beyond heſitation. As,</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, The far greaſt part of the extent of juriſdiction of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and great part of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> depended entirely on his majeſty's pleaſure, being wholly in the arbitration of the crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real grant on which the original circumference of the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> founded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but ſixty miles from the ſea into the country,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:016183_0103_0F9BCC45DACED6B8"/>to the weſtward, terminating about twenty miles caſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river. This government was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enlarged by his majeſty's commiſſion to <hi>Benning Wentworth,</hi>

M. <abbr>Eſq</abbr> captain general, governor and commander in chief in and over the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> (then follows the enlargement,) and the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories depending thereon in <hi>America.</hi>—Theſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories are that extenſion of juriſdiction beyond their firſt circumſcribed limits, terminating ſouth of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> called the province. This territorial extenſion of juriſdiction is altogether in the arbitration of the crown to curtail or extend as before repreſented. This being the caſe, the reſpective governors can no other way be judges of the extent of their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:016183_0104_0F9BCC469973B388"/>but by directions given them in their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, together with his majeſty's expreſs proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and public determinations relative thereto, as in the inſtance of the royal adjudication in 1764; a publication of which, by his majeſty's order, gave his ſubjects to underſtand, that it was his pleaſure that the territorial juriſdiction of <hi>New-York,</hi> ſhould extend to the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, which includes the diſputed premiſes within that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; before this it was impoſſible for the ſubjects to know it; if they could have underſtood it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his majeſty's proclamation certifying the ſame, ſuch proclamation would have been needleſs and impertinent. The truth of the matter is, his majeſty in 1739, determined <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> government ſhould cover the preſent diſputed premiſes; he alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his determination in 1764, whereby <hi>New-York</hi> extended its territories over the ſame land. And the king has an undoubted right to alter and regulate the juriſdiction of royal governments as may ſeem to him mete, ſo long as his royal power exiſts; and for the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> to amuſe people of common ſenſe, pretending that it is the ancient and indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right of the colony of <hi>New-York</hi> to extend to the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, as its eaſtern boundary, is the very height of folly. It was in the nature of things abſolutely impoſſible his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty himſelf ſhould have known that to have been the caſe the moment before he determined it, and equally inconſiſtent that the ſubjects ſhould know it before his majeſty proclaimed it.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the repreſentation which was laid before his majeſty by Lieutenant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:016183_0105_0F9BCC47638886F0"/>
                  <hi>Colden,</hi> as an inducement to prefix the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, the eaſtern boundary of the province of <hi>New-York</hi>—That they were argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of conveniency, holding up to view that it would be greatly to the advantage of the inhabitants on the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, to be under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>New-York;</hi> which arguments are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the idea of antecedent right of juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Likewiſe, from hence we may ſee the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of that government or its patentees, in founding their right in fee to the lands in conteſt, by virtue of the ſaid royal adjudication of the boundary line on the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it cannot operate to their advantage ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the date of that adjudication, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cannot be conſidered any thing more than a mere line of juriſdiction between the reſpective go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>
               <p>IT ſhould be furthermore conſidered, that neither governments were veſted with the fee of thoſe lands; their caſe in this reſpect, is quite the reverſe of that of proprietary governments, who have a right to appropriate the ſoil. In royal governments, it is true, the governors have a delegated authority from his majeſty to grant crown lands; and in ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments it is a prerogative of the crown to alter the limits of juriſdiction; his majeſty hath a right to re-annex the diſputed premiſes to his province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> (in which it formerly was, and on the faith of which the claimants under that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment purchaſed and ſettled the ſame lands) or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate it into a new government, or continue it under the preſent juriſdiction, as his royal wiſdom
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:016183_0106_0F9BCC48107F2CD0"/>may diſcern to be beſt for the governed: But, upon ſuch alterations of juriſdiction, private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is never changed or ſubverted. For, if the property of the ſubject be in the arbitration of the crown, and liable to the ſame viciſſitudes and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with juriſdiction, this would deſtroy the very nature of property, and would render a king abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and deſpotic, which is perfectly inconſiſtent with the conſtitution of the kingdom.—Therefore, to convey or alienate property, is the ſacred prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the rightful OWNER.—Kings and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors (in the kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle therewith. There is indeed as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwen the change of juriſdiction, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the property of the ſubject, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkneſs, although ſince the ſaid royal adjudication in 1764, the <hi>New-Yorkers,</hi> have endeavored to blend them together to anſwer ſiniſter and lucrative purpoſes.—They were ſenſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, that ſuch the aforeſaid arguments were concluſive againſt their monopolizing the fee-ſimple of ſaid lands; and as it is very common for people, who are upon a deſign of engroſſing the property of their neighbour, to ſet up ſome ſpecious pretence of right, to vindicate themſelves from the imputation of diſhonor and reproach; ſo in the preſent caſe, the <hi>New Yorkers</hi> endeavored to draw the curtain of the duke of <hi>York</hi> over their knavery, and under the feigned character of heirs, to that apoſtate duke, claim the lands aforeſaid, and fancy themſelves the owners of towns, (fields) and houſes that they build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.</p>

               <p>It appears from the ſequel of the repreſentations, narratives and arguments contained in the <hi>New-York</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:016183_0109_0F9BCC4A500DE4D0"/>pamphlet, that the government of <hi>New-York</hi> do not pretend to any conveyance of the fee of the lands in conteſt from the duke of <hi>York.</hi> But their grand hypotheſis is, that the juriſdiction of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the firſt eſtabliſhment, was predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on, and bounded by the deſcriptive limits of the ſaid grant; and conſequently, that the diſputed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes was never in the government of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> and, that that government never was veſted with authority to grant thoſe lands, and alſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the grants by them made, are in their own nature void. This is the ſum of the <hi>New-York</hi> arguments relative to their title to thoſe lands. Here</p>
               <p>FIRST, it is neceſſary the deſcriptive Limits of the above rehearſed Charter be brought under Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; which includes the countries of <hi>St. Croix,</hi> adjoining <hi>New-Scotland, Pemaquid,</hi> the river <hi>Kene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beque,</hi> and the iſlands known by the names of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe countries lying eaſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, and within the actual juriſdiction of the provinces of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay, New-Hampſhire,</hi> &amp;c. and at preſent not contended for on the Part of <hi>New-York.</hi> Their general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the "ſtate of the right." &amp;c. had done well to have informed the public, whether their "anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and indiſputable right" of juriſdiction extended to every part of the deſcriptive limits of the grants aforeſaid, and if not, to which part it was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and when done, and by what authority; whether their governors commiſſions, at any time, particularized and determined to what part of the limits of the ſaid duke's grant their juriſdiction ſhould extend, more than another, or to the whole;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:016183_0110_0F9BCC4B10567AD8"/>or, whether any royal edict or proclamation, had ever thus given them ſuch predicated limits of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: this is abſolutely neceſſary for them to do, in ſupport of their title to the lands in queſtion. And furthermore, it is requiſite for them to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that thoſe lands were actually contained in ſuch their former limits of juriſdiction: but, if the government of <hi>New-York</hi> from royal determination, cannot extend juriſdiction to any
one part of the deſcriptive limits of the grant aforeſaid, more than to another; then, on this hypotheſis, their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on includes the whole limits contained in the grant, or none at all; that it includes the whole, will not be pretended, and that any party, as predicated on them limits, cannot be made to appear: but on the contrary, it appears his majeſty and council had no reference to any part of the limits of this grant, in determining the boundaries of the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York</hi> in 1764, as may appear from the royal order itſelf, an extract of which is as follows: <q>His majeſty with the advice of his privy council, doth order and declare, That the weſt banks of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Connecticut,</hi> from whence it enters the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> as far north as the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary between the ſaid two provinces</q>—that parrallel of latitude is alſo eſtabliſhed it's north boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary. The ſource of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river is ſuppoſed to be ſomething to the northward of latitude forty-five, and comes much from the north-eaſt, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance after it paſſes that latitude; but it is notorious, that the ſource of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river is far ſouth of it; ſo that by comparing the deſcriptive li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:016183_0111_0F9BCC4BCF535AE8"/>of the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s grant, with thoſe expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the royal order, they will be found to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially different. The limit of that part of the duke's grant which reſpects the preſent arguments, is in the words following: <q>Together alſo with the ſaid river called <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, and all the lands from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay;</q> which limit in any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtruction of it, can include but part of the diſputed premiſes, (which ſaid premiſes extend and are bounded on the forty-fifth degree of north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,) as will more fully appear in a further diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that line. But,</p>
               <p>FIRST, it is manifeſt that the king and privy council, in determining the extent of the juriſdiction of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> did not proceed upon the idea of that government's having any antecedent right of juriſdiction to thoſe lands. Had that been the caſe, the royal order had been predicated on the boundary lines of the duke's grant afareſaid, and could not have comprehended any more land than <q>from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay;</q> and theſe bounds are ſo looſe, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impoſſible to found a line of juriſdiction thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the deſcriptive limits thereof, which may be ſeen at large in the fore part of this ſection. Therefore, ſuch part only as is neceſſary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the indeterminate bounds before ſpoken of, is here quoted; which, after deſcribing the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and that it abuts upon the main land <q>between the two rivers there called or
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:016183_0112_0F9BCC4C96605908"/>known by the ſeveral names of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river,</q> begins the deſcription under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <q>together with the ſaid river called <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s river.</q> Obſerve, that as the deſcription of this river is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following diſcriptions in ſaid grant; nothing more can poſſibly be included in it, but a diſcription of the river only, excluſive of one foot of land on either ſide. The ſecond diſcription <q>and all the land from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay.</q> The beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematition on earth cannot aſcertain theſe limits, except upon arbitrary principles, as there can be no prefixed place on <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river where to erect the firſt bounds; and as to any particular place on the "eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay," where to erect a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is altogether undetermined in this diſcription: But, inaſmuch as it includes all the land from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, &amp;c. there is a little better foundation to eſtabliſh the firſt bounds than the ſecond. It ſeems in order to include all as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, it would be neceſſary to extend either to the head of the river, or to the moſt northerly extention of the whole ſtream, to make the firſt bounds; and provided this imaginary bounds ſhould extend north of the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, it would ſo far exceed the ſettlement of the line in 1764. Be this as it will, the moſt northerly part of the river, which would moſt likely be the head, would be the moſt favourable on the part of <hi>New-York,</hi> for to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a firſt bounds, and from thence to extend a ſtraight line to ſome place on the eaſt ſide of <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>-bay; this is ſomething of a natural conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:016183_0113_0F9BCC4D596DA8A8"/>on the indeterminate deſcriptive limits aforeſaid, without exploring <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, which in this caſe is neceſſary. And, firſt, in tracing ſaid river to its ſource, it is found towards it's extremity, to come much out of the north-eaſt. This being the caſe, a ſtraight line from its head to <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay, would croſs ſaid river and include a large tract of land on the eaſt ſide, and perhaps croſs the river ſundry times; the conſequences may be drawn thus, that where the line may be ſuppoſed to croſs the laſt time ought to be the firſt real north boundary, of the "ancient and indiſputable" limit of juriſdiction of <hi>New-York.</hi> For, if the bounds at the head of the river before ſpoken of, be ſo eſtabliſhed, it would include conſiderable land on the eaſt ſide of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, within the old boundary of <hi>New-York,</hi> which is contrary to any idea to be gained from the diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive limit aforeſaid, viz. <q>and all the land from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, &amp;c.</q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed firſt boundary better purporting with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <q>and all the land from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay,</q> between the head of the river, and the place where the imaginary line was ſuppoſed to paſs? To this it may be anſwered, that a place between theſe two, ſo far up the river as in tracing a ſtraight line from thence, to <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay, would not croſs the river, may better agree with the above deſcription: Still, from none of theſe imagined lines, from the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent imagined bounds, or from any other projected, poſſible, firſt bounds, can ſuch a ſtraight line be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, till the place for the ſouth-weſtern boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:016183_0114_0F9BCC4E109BA1F8"/>on the "eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay" be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And the vagueneſs of the deſcriptive limit is ſo great, that it cannot be determined whether that bounds ſhall be at the northern extremity of the eaſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay, or at the ſouthern, where it communicates with the main ocean, or at any other intermediate place between theſe two: ſo, that from the uncertainty of the ſecond bounds, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eſtabliſh the firſt, ſo as exactly to include "all the land from the weſt ſide of the ſaid river to the eaſt ſide of ſaid bay," and no more. And,</p>
               <p>THUS it is demonſtrated from the vagueneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and obſoleteneſs of the diſcriptive limits of the grant to the duke of <hi>York,</hi> before quoted at large; that it is in the nature of things abſolutely impoſſible to aſcertain it. From hence follows a ſecond neceſſary inference, viz. That it is equally impoſſible and contradictory, that governmental ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ſhould be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain juriſdiction, in its own nature incapable to be determined, is in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty none at all. And from hence follows a third inference which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the ſequel of the argument on the ſubject of property, concerning the lands in queſtion, to be in favour of the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire:</hi> For, it is in the laſt place equally contradictory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as in the caſe of the abſurdity of aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the limits of the pretended "ancient" juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>New-York,</hi> predicating it on vague and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate boundaries, that, that government ſhould predicate their right to the fee of lands, by them thus unaſcertainable; for as uncertainty and natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of a juriſdiction's being rendered determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:016183_0115_0F9BCC505B0DA8C0"/>makes it in reality to be none at all; ſo the idea of property, predicated thereon is equally imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. True it is, by the royal determination in 1764, the eaſt line of <hi>New-York</hi> extended to the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river. Which may be foundation for conjecture, that that limit might have reference to a deſcription in the duke's grant aforeſaid, "and all the lands from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river," &amp;c. Yet when the repreſentation made by lieut. governor <hi>Colden,</hi> to his majeſty in council, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this pamphlet, under the head of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, &amp;c. comes to be conſidered, it will reflect light on this point. The arguments made uſe of in the ſaid repreſentation were thoſe of conveniency and advantage to the ſettlers on thoſe lands to be in the government of <hi>New-York:</hi> and, that the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river was a good and certain boundary," &amp;c. Theſe were undoubtedly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderating motives of determining the weſt banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to be the eaſt boundary of <hi>New-York,</hi> and ſuch arguments are utterly inconſiſtant with the notion of an "ancient indiſputable right" of juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſtill another conſideration which may be of moment in the obſervation of this, ſo trumpt up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> to the lands in conteſt: If it be admitted a line ſhould be drawn from the moſt northerly part of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the moſt north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay; ſtill, it is by no means probable ſuch line would include more than one half (if ſo much) of the lands in diſpute ſo far as may be judged from the latitude and longitude of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:016183_0116_0F9BCC511165B470"/>the reſpective objects: for conſidering the courſe of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, which is nearly from north to ſouth, except towards its extremity; and the ſea coaſt, from the river's mouth, together with <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>-bay, forming alſo an indened line, to the ſouth of weſt; the land included in theſe limits, by a line drawn from <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to <hi>Delaware</hi>-bay as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, would (excepting the ſmall promontory formed by the mouth of the bay and the ocean) lye in the figure of an obtuſe angled triangle; and the courſe of the ſaid line from the river to the bay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to occular ſurvey, would be from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt a ſouthweſterly direction: which very badly comports with the preſent north and weſterly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of juriſdiction of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> at <hi>Crown-Point, Detroit,</hi> &amp;c.—It may here well be obſerved, the ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſeem to be in a critical ſituation; every arbitrary meaſure under the preſent adminiſtration of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> is excerciſed againſt them; and provided they flee to the eaſtward to procure inheritances, there they are fore-cloſed, the deſcriptive limits of the ſaid ancient juriſdiction covers them, (to wit) the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c.—Yet there is another large un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known country to the weſt and northweſt, which has been but partly explored; and provided theſe people, inſtead of fleeing, to the eaſtward, ſhould turn their courſe to thoſe countries; there, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable but that <hi>New-York</hi> would encircle them with another odd deſcription of domain contained in their governor's commiſſions, i. e. <q>
                     <hi>A. B.</hi> captain general governor and commander in chief in and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:016183_0117_0F9BCC51ECE56880"/>over the province of <hi>New-York,</hi>
                  </q> next follows the deſcription hinted <q>and the territories depending thereon, in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the foregoing deſcriptions of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York,</hi> it appears they lay claim to ſo extenſive a domain three different ways, or have three different modes or modifications in comprehending and engroſſing their progreſſive limits. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſtly. THE Province of <hi>New-York</hi> which falls ſhort of and terminates conſiderably ſouth of the city of <hi>Albany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly. "THE territories depending thereon in <hi>America.</hi>" Theſe territories comprehending ſuch plantations, on extra-provincial land, as are and have been carried on adjoining to the province till its territories, are at preſent extended to <hi>Detroit,</hi> and the neighbourhood thereof, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The limits of the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s grant, and inaſmuch as the grantees and ſettlers on the lands in diſpute, hold their title under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and that government had for ſeveral years exerciſed their juriſdiction over thoſe lands, even till 1764.—Therefore in this caſe the government of <hi>New-York</hi> could not extend their territorial ſort of juriſdiction over the premiſes; for ſuch ſort of juriſdiction might be challenged on the part of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> (if it ſhould be admited at that time ſaid premiſes were extra-provincial lands) and that with far the moſt propriety. Inaſmuch as that government had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the land and began ſettlements thereon. Add to this the following clauſe in governor <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s commiſſion, which they viewed to be of great weight in this caſe, which, after deſcribing the former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016183_0118_0F9BCC528FB8E700"/>of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> 
                  <q>and from thence extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weſt till it meets with his majeſty's other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</q> Add to this alſo, the reaſons held forth in the chain of arguments, contained in the three firſt ſections; all which were too potent for the <hi>New-York</hi> territorial ſort of dominion to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. At that juncture, therefore, the lawyers, land-jobbers, politicians, &amp;c. planed out the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid three modes of juriſdiction predicating it on the deſcriptive limits of the grant to the duke of <hi>York.</hi> And on this new modled plan breathed an air of "ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT OF" juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently to the fee of the lands in conteſt.</p>
               <p>THE firſt intimation that ever ſaluted the ears of the publick, aſſerting it to be the ancient right of the colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> to extend to <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river as its eaſtern boundary, was diſcoverd from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation given under the hand of <hi>William Tryon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> governor of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> &amp;c. and dated the 11th day of <hi>December,</hi> 1771. His proclamation begins after the following manner: <q>Whereas it is the ancient and inconteſtble right of this colony to extend to <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, as its eaſtern boundary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was drawing a poſitive concluſion from fictitious, and till that time, unheard of premiſes; and rather influenced people in the ſeveral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to purchaſe and ſettle under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> than diſwade therefrom; for common fame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, were a barrier againſt the belief of this <hi>New-York</hi> doctrine, which from the time of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al adjudication in 1764, was by the proclamation
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:016183_0119_0F9BCC535157BA50"/>aforeſaid, antidated to "ancient." That this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine till then, was inconteſted, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public conſideration, and has ever ſince been conteſted.</p>
               <p>SHOULD this their new hypotheſis be admitted; yet, as hath been before obſerved, theſe limits could include but part of ſaid lands, according to the beſt judgment that can be formed without an actual and accurate ſurvey of the deſcriptive limits of ſaid grant; which if the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> can do and fairly demonſtrate, to any able mathematicians, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petant and impartial judges, that they have rightly aſcertained thoſe limits, it is engaged on the part of the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> that they ſhall yield up to the land-jobbers of <hi>New-York,</hi> their lands and labours: an object which undoubtedly would be grateful and pleaſing to them; and which they have many years been in purſuit of, and have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had the mortification to be baffled. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily incumbant on the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> in order to found title to thoſe land on this new ſcheme.</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, to aſcertain the limits of their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bounds. This the claimants under <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> will expect compleated, or hear no more of thoſe "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" boundaries of <hi>New-York.</hi>

               <p>THE general aſſembly of the colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> in their ſtate of the right of that colony, &amp;c. page 3d, wave the right of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by firſt diſcovery,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016183_0120_0F9BCC54131423D8"/>as being foreign to their purpoſe, and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> poſſeſſions are only material to be ſupported; and claim no further right by way of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but priority of poſſeſſion. Yet in the ſame page in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <q>when the firſt war between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> became inevitable, king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, by letters patent dated the 12th day of <hi>March</hi> 1663-4, granted to his brother the duke of <hi>York</hi> the tracts of country, which comprehend <hi>New-York.</hi> To render this gift effectual, before the war was proclaimed, a fleet and land forces were ſent out to remove the <hi>Dutch</hi> and put the duke in poſſeſſion.</q>—The circumſtancies that attended the making this grant, and ſending the armament to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it effectual, is a ſufficient reaſon to determine that the government at home, at that time, viewed the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſettlement as an intruſion, and poſſeſſion (which is all they rely on) gained by treſpaſs, in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal conſtruction, is no poſſeſſion at all. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had prior right to all the countries from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude, by virtue not only of diſcovery by <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot</hi> and others, but by being in actual poſſeſſion of ſeveral parts of the premiſes, is matters too well known to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
               <p>WHETHER there was real ſeiſin in the crown or not at the time of granting theſe countries, is not truly in queſtion; ſince every grant ſo made is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtibly valid againſt the king, his heirs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and the colony of <hi>New-York</hi> being entirely dependant on the crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> for their title; priority of charter is therefore neceſſary to be determined.</p>

THE grant of king <hi>James</hi> the firſt to the council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> bearing date at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 13th day of <hi>November,</hi> in the eighteenth year or his reign, comprehends all the lands, iſlands, &amp;c. from forty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude, through the main land from ſea to ſea. "On the 19th day of <hi>March</hi> 1628, the council of <hi>Plymouth</hi> under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeal, did grant to ſir <hi>Henry Roſwell,</hi> ſir <hi>John Young,</hi> and others, their heirs and aſſociates for ever, all that part of <hi>America,</hi> lying between the great river there, commonly called <hi>Monomack,</hi> alias <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> river, within the ſpace of three miles to the northward of the ſame river, called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomack,</hi> alias <hi>Merimack,</hi> or to the northward of any or every part thereof, and in length and longitude of and within all the breadth aforeſaid, throughout the main lands there, from the Atlantic or weſtern ſea or ocean on the eaſt part, to the South ſea on the weſt part."</p>
               <p>THIS deed of ſale at the ſuit of the grantees, with a charter of incorporation, was granted and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by king CHARLES the firſt, the 4th day of <hi>March</hi> 1629, wherein the limits are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame with thoſe in the <hi>Plymouth</hi> conveyance; and the proviſo of CHARLES, that the actual ſettlement of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of other chriſtian ſtates to determine the extent, the ſame as was the proviſo in <hi>James</hi>'s grant to the <hi>Plymouth</hi> company.</p>
               <p>THIS ſame charter of incorporation was adjudged void in the high court of chancery of <hi>England</hi> in 1684; from which the aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> in their ſtate, &amp;c. page 5th, take occaſion to ſay <q>the title of that colony now ſolely depends on their
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:016183_0122_0F9BCC5593D9C1B0"/>new charter of 1691.</q> Nevertheleſs, the right of ſoil to all and every part of the deed of ſale afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, remained indefeaſible; for, only animadvert back to the <hi>Plymouth</hi> conveyance, and obſerve, that the right in fee, was by them conveyed to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees; and trace it to king CHARLES'S charter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, which only veſted the grantees with powers of government. Though it is true, this charter contains all the formality neceſſary in the conveyance of the fee; yet is, ſo far as reſpects the fee, no more than a duplicate of what was before granted, which neither adds nor deminiſheth; and it is eaſy to ſee, that the court of chancery could not vacate or make void, at moſt, any thing more than thoſe incorporate privileges; and likewiſe as eaſily diſcernable that nothing more was attempted. Thus the colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> ſtill hold their right in fee, by conveyance from king JAMES to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> who were their grantors.</p>
               <p>IN the next place it may be obſerved, that in 1691 the privileges of incorporation were reſtored; tho' our authors, in their ſtate &amp;c. endeavor to curtail the colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> by conſtruing their laſt charter to extend no further weſt than the eaſt limit of the colony of <hi>Connecticut.</hi> Their words are theſe, "theſe words <hi>(as far as)</hi> being in the caſe of the grant of the crown on the ſuit of the party, in legal conſtruction, carry the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny no farther weſtward than till it meets the colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and not to <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, and much leſs to the weſtward of it." Be theſe bold aſſertions as they will, and provided it be here admitted, for argument ſake, that the powers of juriſdiction of the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:016183_0123_0F9BCC5650C7BB08"/>province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay be ever ſo much curtailed, yet one propoſition we can verily be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of viz. That it is not in the power of king or chancery to curtail or deprive them of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
               <p>IT is to be further obſerved, that however our authors may criticiſe upon the gramatical or legal conſtruction of ſelected words or phraſes; yet, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attention to the following real facts, will clearly point out the inconſiſtency of ſuch ſophiſms.</p>
               <p>FIRSTLY, <hi>Connecticut</hi> charter, granted by king CHARLES the ſecond, the 23d day of <hi>April</hi> 1662, was bounded and extended in length, by and with the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> firſt charter, granted by king CHARLES the firſt, the 4th day of <hi>March</hi> 1629, which inconteſtibly extended agreeable with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid diſcriptive limits of the deed of ſale from the council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to ſir <hi>Henry Roſwell,</hi> ſir <hi>John Young,</hi> &amp;c. and extended through the main land in longitude to the ſouth ſea on the weſt part.</p>
               <p>THIS charter, as above, being nullified in the high court of chancery of <hi>England</hi> in 1684, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again in 1691, wherein the weſt extent of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is predicated by that of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and this weſt limit of <hi>Connecticut</hi> being predicated by the old charter of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay, and expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in longitude to the South ſea on the weſt part, exactly extends the preſent charter of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi>-bay, with its powers of juriſdiction to all, and every part of the limits of the old nulled char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is the natural and legal ſenſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent charter of the colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay, predicated on undeniable facts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:016183_0124_0F9BCC57120B7DD8"/>
IN the next place 'tis neceſſary to conſider the charter of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which our authors inform ſhould not extend weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, in the words following: <q>This being a crown grant on the ſuit and petition of the grantees, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken moſt beneficially for the king. The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive words, and the intention of the grant, will in legal conſtruction be ſatisfied by giving the colony the ſame length as the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay; and it is plain both from the recital and the ſaving clauſe in the <hi>Plymouth</hi> patent, on which the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſett</hi>'s title was founded, that the latter cou'd not in any ſenſe, extend to the weſtward of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi>-river.</q> As this their aſſertion is founded on the hipotheſis of <hi>Connecticut</hi> charter's being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated on that of the <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi>'s, and therefore the arguments before exhibited on that head, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concluſive for the eſtabliſhing the weſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> nothing more is neceſſary for that purpoſe, but a recital of the diſcriptive words of their charter, granted ſubſequent to their purchaſe from the council of <hi>Plymouth</hi> by king CHARLES the ſecond, the 23d day of <hi>April,</hi> 1662, <q>bounded on the eaſt by <hi>Narraganſet</hi>-river, commonly called <hi>Narraganſet</hi>-bay, where the ſaid river falleth into the ſea; and on the north by the line of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> plantation; and on the ſea, and in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as the line of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from eaſt to weſt: that is to ſay, from the ſaid <hi>Narraganſet</hi>-bay on the eaſt, to the South ſea on the weſt part.</q> Thus it appears and only by the demonſtrations aforeſaid, but from the expreſs words of the deſcriptive limits of the charter itſelf,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:016183_0125_0F9BCC57D53415D8"/>which cannot admit of a double meaning, (curious as our authors be in the art of playing with words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) that it is the unqueſtionable right of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Connecticut</hi> to extend its weſtern boundary to the South ſea on the "weſt part;" and in this that colony agree, who are now challenging their right in fee to thoſe limits, and actually making plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as at <hi>Suſquebannah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>BY this time, undoubtedly queries will ariſe in the mind of the reader, what will become of the grant to the duke of <hi>York,</hi> if the <hi>Maſſachuſett's</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> colonies extend "to the South ſea on the weſt part?" The following intelligence from our authors will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an anſwer to this query; who, after deſcribing ſaid grant further inform, in page 3d of the ſtate, &amp;c. That <q>a fleet and land forces were ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and put the duke in poſſeſſion.</q> Accordingly, on the 27th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1664, the <hi>Dutch</hi> governor <hi>Stuyveſant,</hi> ſurrendered by capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the countries the <hi>Dutch</hi> then poſſeſſed, to king CHARLES the ſecond; when among other terms it was ſtipulated, <q>that all the people ſhall remain free denizens, and ſhall enjoy their lands, houſes, and goods, whereſoever they are within this country, and diſpoſe of them as they pleaſe.</q> Thus, by conqueſt, the king became reveſted with his right to the lands conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for, as the king had antecedently diſpoſed of the eſtate the crown was poſſeſſed of in theſe countries, to the colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay; therefore, his right now could not extend any further than the actual conqueſt, which, in legal conſtruction, muſt
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:016183_0126_0F9BCC5AD3708060"/>be ſatisfied with, and can extend no further than the actual poſſeſſions deſcribed in the forementioned capitulation. A further information is in page 4th, <q>To remove any doubt of the validity of the dukes title, either from the want of ſeiſin in the crown when it originated, or on account of the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conqueſt by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was confirmed to his royal highneſs by further letters patent, dated the 29th day of <hi>June,</hi> 1674.</q> That there was want of ſeiſin in the crown at the time of firſt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is inconteſtible; for, as above ſaid, the king by antecedent grants had diveſted the crown of its right, and by this conqueſt became reveſted: So that from this, occaſion will be taken to ſay, that in fact the province of <hi>New-York</hi> was originally ſounded on conqueſt, and the limits of it, as before mentioned, circumſcribed by the <hi>Dutch</hi> poſſeſſions pointed out in the terms of capitulation. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unfavorable this concluſion may be thought on the part of <hi>New-York,</hi> yet, as the crown had prior to either of the duke's grants, diſpoſed of its right to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> colonies—if it was not thus founded on conqueſt, it hath no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation at all; and its having any place for exiſtence, is but an "intruſion on the rights" of thoſe other colonies. Furthermore, it is myſterious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, admitting that that government was thus founded, to ſuppoſe the duke could be lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor; inaſmuch as by the conditions of capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fee then acquired to the crown, paſſed to the <hi>Dutch</hi> inhabitants, who then became <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:016183_0127_0F9BCC5BB5740178"/>
THOUGH this tract of land now in conteſt, was contained in the original grant to the council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> yet as they never made any conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the crown on the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that grant, the 7th day of <hi>June,</hi> 1635. From which it may be objected, on the part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the above conciſeneſs in the circumſcription of the boundaries of their colony is too great; for, that the grant to the duke muſt hold good where the crown, at the time of granting, was veſted with a right to the lands granted. In anſwer, it has been argued in the preceeding ſection, that it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether the limits of the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s grant included this tract of land, or if any, how great a part; and that the limits of ſaid grant cou'd not be aſcertained—and that governmental juriſdiction, and property cou'd not be predicated on ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete and uncertain bounds.

               <p>As has been before obſerved, the deſign of the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s grant was to include the <hi>Dutch</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; or in other words, that it never was valid any further than to ſuch poſſeſſion, which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, reverted to the crown, and no farther than theſe limits, to interfere with the charrer colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> And as a twenty miles line to the eaſtward from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river would include the moſt eaſtern extent of the afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned poſſeſſions, the reaſon why ſuch a line was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to as the boundary between the colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-York:</hi> But, as theſe poſſeſſions to the northward of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> fell far ſhort of this twenty mile line, or were ſo inconſiderable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as not to come within the capitulation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; therefore the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony contended with <hi>New-York</hi> for a further weſtern extent than twenty miles eaſt from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river; but the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs government of <hi>New-York,</hi> ever uneaſy within its own boundaries, preſumed unrelenting, to intrude on, and conteſting for the juſt rights of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts,</hi> by extending their patents far to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of twenty miles from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which the greateſt diſturbances have ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen between the inhabitants of the reſpective colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſundry of the conflicts ſo ſevere, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blood ſpilt in the conteſt redened the hands of the intruders; but finally a boundary line was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to by the reſpective governments in 1773, at a twenty miles diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, which has ſince been ratified by his majeſty.</p>

IN the ſtate of the right, &amp;c. page 4th, is the moſt extraordinary account of alienation of property that is to be found in the annals of hiſtory. <q>The duke continued proprietor and chief governor of this province till he aſcended the throne, when his right merged in the royal authority, on his abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it paſſed to king <hi>William,</hi> his ſucceſſor, as lord proprietor and royal ſovereign.</q> That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the duke's acceſſion to the throne his right of government merged in the royal authority will not be denied; but, that his right in fee conſequently paſſed to king <hi>William</hi> as his ſucceſſor, wants great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proof than a bare aſſertion; our authors ſhould have explained this matter; 'tis taken for granted they will not pretend that king <hi>William</hi> was heir at law to the duke's eſtate, and they mention no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance from the duke to the king, but ſay the "duke's right merged in the royal authority;" to ſuppoſe it is poſſible that right ſhould paſs to king <hi>William,</hi> as lord proprietor, is ſo great an abſurdity that it wants a name.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page they further inform, that <q>in the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s commiſſions to his ſeveral lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant governors Major <hi>Edmond Androſſ,</hi> on the firſt day of <hi>July</hi> 1674, and Colonel <hi>Thomas Dongan</hi> on the 30th day of <hi>September</hi> 1682, among other deſcription of the boundaries of this province are expresſly comprehended all the land from the weſt ſide of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river to the eaſt ſide of <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>-bay.</q> Note, thoſe commiſſions were nom the duke before he aſcended the throne; undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in his commiſſions to his lieutenant Governors, he had reference to the limits of his grant, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016183_0130_0F9BCC5DD179B1A0"/>their boundaries: but after his abdication, and the acceſſion of king <hi>William</hi> and queen <hi>Mary,</hi> we find a commiſſion from their majeſty's to <hi>Henry Slaughter,</hi> to be materially different. <q>King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by their commiſſion, dated the fourth day of <hi>January,</hi> in the firſt year of their reign, appointed <hi>Henry Slaughter,</hi> to be governor of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the territories depending thereon in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </q> The ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly (ſtiled our authors) further inform, that <q>in all ſubſequent acts and commiſſions this colony is deſcribed by the ſame words, the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the territories depending thereon in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi>
                  </q> No arguments need be uſed to prove, for it is ſelf-evident, their majeſty's had ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent idea of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> than what had been before deſcribed by the duke's commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his lieutenant governors, and a little attention to the original ſtate of that government, will explain that difference. Our authors further inform, page 17th, <q>The <hi>Ranſſelaer</hi> family are not indebted to the government of <hi>New-York</hi> for their eſtate, they continue to enjoy it by an act of juſtice and not of favor; it was originally a <hi>Dutch</hi> colony of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, granted to their anceſtors by the <hi>Dutch Weſt-India</hi> company, who held it as a part of <hi>New-Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> under the ſtates general.

               </p>
               <p>IT may be further offered in objection on the part of <hi>New-York,</hi> that allowing the foregoing arguments relative to the territories, and that <hi>Renſelaerwyck</hi> was, before the aera of the aforeſaid determination, in fact annexed to the government by the territorial

This cannot operate in favor of <hi>New-York,</hi> for, in addition to what has been before argued to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the reader is deſired to obſerve, that king <hi>James</hi> the ſecond, who was this ſame duke of <hi>York,</hi> abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the throne in 1688, and his eſtate reverted to the crown of <hi>England,</hi> and this grant became veſted in the crown, the ſame as though the duke or his grant had never had an exiſtance.—Nor have any of their governor's commiſſions, from <hi>Henry Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the firſt governor appointed by king <hi>William</hi> and queen <hi>Mary,</hi> down to this preſent aera, ever been predicated on, or had the leaſt reference to the limits of that grant.</p>

               <p>THE government of <hi>New-York</hi> make the greateſt outcry againſt her ſiſter colonies, taxing them with intruſion, violence and encroachment; and at the ſame time, are flagrantly more guilty of the ſame avaricious, unjuſt, and hoſtile wickedneſs than all the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh America.</hi> Their capricious land jobbers have a ſurpriſing faculty in carrying their points; at the ſame time they are encroaching upon their neighbours, provided they meet with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, they will cry out in the moſt exagerating exclamations, violence, riot, treaſon, &amp;c. and at the ſame time, not heſitate to trample upon his majeſty's authority, (the particulars of which may be ſeen in the proceeding narrative.) They are great advocates
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:016183_0133_0F9BCC600FFBEF28"/>for law, order, and <hi>good</hi> government; theſe are their <hi>borns of iron, and with them do they puſh the poor and needy, when they get them into their net. Their way is as the way of a ſerpent upon a rock,</hi> and it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult <hi>to trace their footſteps:</hi> They complain of the lawleſs, factious, and riotous conduct of the ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> yet know, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the moving cauſe of all the diſturbances they complain of. It is incredible to ſuppoſe a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of farmers expoſed to the perpetual fatigues and laborious toile of cultivating a wilderneſs country, ſhould under a juſt adminiſtration of law, become "a confederacy of inſurgents." Was it only that natural preſumption being ſo much in favor of thoſe inhabitants, it is humbly conceived, that all wiſe and unprejudiced perſons will, at leaſt ſuſpend their judgments concerning them, till the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> can clearly evince, that theſe people are in reality, without cauſe, tumultuous, diſorderly, &amp;c. And, inaſmuch as the facts of this controverſy is ſo fully ſet forth in this treatiſe, the reader is thereto refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a clearer exhibition.</p>
               <p>OUR authors' in order to maintain their claim to the lands in conteſt, and if poſſible, to include it within one of the deſcriptive limits of the grant to duke of <hi>York,</hi> tell us many ſtrange things about the colonies of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts:</hi> that <hi>Connecticut</hi> "in legal conſtruction" ſhould not have extended to the weſtward of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river; and that their ſettlements weſt of that river were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion on the right of the colony of <hi>New-York;</hi> yet, nevertheleſs for peace ſake, and rather than conteſt with "a powerful neighbour," they ſettled with
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:016183_0134_0F9BCC60D3E955F8"/>that colony at twenty miles diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river.</p>
               <p>THEY further inform, that <q>the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> claim ſtands by no means in ſo reſpectable a light as that of <hi>Connecticut,</hi>
                  </q> and in legal conſtruction, ſhould extend <q>no further weſtward than till it meets the colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and not to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi>-river, and much leſs to the weſtward of it.</q> Our authors being men of great learning and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſoon extended their ancient right of juriſdiction over ſuch part of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony as lay to the weſtward from <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, and this their ſcheme in ſtopping the weſtern extenſion of that colony where it meets <hi>Connecticut,</hi> may be reckoned as one among the greateſt of their political atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. "And it is worthy a remark," that had the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony extended weſt to the South ſea, it could not have met <hi>Connecticut,</hi> but muſt have extended parallel with it, in the ſame direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To give this pleaſing ſcheme ſome kind of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they argue the nullity of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> firſt charter, and introduce the duke of <hi>York</hi>'s grant as the oldeſt title, page 5th, <q>the <hi>Maſſachtſetts</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was vacated, and the title of that colony now ſolely depends on their charter of 1691.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YET they allow, that that colony obtained the right of ſoil from the council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and that the charter of king <hi>Charles</hi> dated the 4th day of <hi>March</hi> 1628-9, <note n="*" place="bottom">This is the charter ſpoken of as vacated, which was done as has been before largely treated of in 1684.</note> veſted them with powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (it's needleſs to animadvert on theſe
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:016183_0135_0F9BCC61916581A8"/>ſtrange accounts) however, after they have charmed their imaginations with the fruitleſs idea of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ancient tight to all that part of the <hi>Bay</hi> province weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, they complain bitterly of the encroachments of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> page 8th. <q>Under circumſtances ſo favorable to the rights of this colony, we have great reaſon to complain of the unwarrantable encroachments under the authority of the government of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi>-bay, by which a valuable tract extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river, within twenty miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, has been wreſted from us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THEIR conduct ſeems the more inexcuſable, as they muſt have known that ſuch encroachments were not only diſreſpectful to his majeſty's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and big with great miſchiefs and diſorders, but were highly injurious to private property, great part of theſe lands having anciently been granted to his majeſty's ſubjects under the great ſeal of this colony.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEN they proceed to recite their old grants, which they tell us <q>cover the country the whole breadth of the <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi>'s claim:</q> The manor of <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelacrwyck,</hi> granted in 1685, and extending twenty-four miles each ſide from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river; and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onhook,</hi> in 1705, which extends about thirty miles from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river; and <hi>Hooſick,</hi> in 1685, which extends about thirty miles from the river. It ſeems to have been a political and univerſal principle with the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> to begin their patents within the twenty mile line, and extend them eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, that by this means they might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to encroach on, and jockey their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:016183_0136_0F9BCC624FF12D40"/>colonies more or leſs, out of their lands, as ſubſequent policy, intriegue and power, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.</p>
               <p>THAT government, thus extended their patent into <hi>Connecticut,</hi> one in particular, into the townſhip of <hi>Saliſbury;</hi> and it has ever been their practice to wrangle till they find by experience, that neither by ſophiſtry, law, or hoſtility, they can maintain their exorbitant claims, and then capitulate on as good terms as they can; and conclude with branding their competitors with diſhoneſty, encroachment and many hard names, and don't ſcruple to impeach their governmental authority, (as in the caſe juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay) with being diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his majeſty's authority, and guilty of great miſchiefs and diſorders; although the authority of their own government, by their unjuſt, avaricious encroachments on the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> even to <hi>Conuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi>-river, laid the foundation of thoſe diſorders, and they might have added blood-ſhed; yet their aſſembly have the impudence to palm it all upon the authority of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE claimants under <hi>NewHampſhire</hi> are ſo happy as to be almoſt exempted from any <hi>New-York</hi> claims, by patents from that government prior to their's; the aforeſaid <hi>Hooſick</hi> and <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> patents being the only ones of this nature, the former includes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one quarter of the townſhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> on which part were about four ſettlers, when it was granted by <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> This townſhip is bounded ſoucherly by the north line of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi>-bay, and extends weſt as far as the <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colonies; the latter, i. e. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumſcock</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:016183_0137_0F9BCC646A2FED40"/>patent, was granted under the common ſeal of the province of <hi>New-York,</hi> the 15th day of <hi>June</hi> 1739. This patent is ſaid to interfere with the townſhip of <hi>Bennington,</hi> and it is matter of diſpute, whether in its firſt location, it included more than about thirty or forty acres within that town, tho' it ſeems the patent by its deſcriptive limits, extends further into the town, and the patentees produce a map correſponding with thoſe limits. This monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is well known by the <hi>Bennington</hi> people, and is on the weſtern edge of the town; and there has never been a diſcovery of any lines of the ſurvey of that location to the eaſtward of this monument. The many circumſtances of this nature, amount to almoſt a certainty, that the patentees never made any actual location further interfering with <hi>Bennington,</hi> than as aforeſaid; notwithſtanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one eighth part of the town; which lands are exceeding good in nature, and are ſettled wholly underthe <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> title, by induſtrious farmers, who form a wilderneſs ſtate, have cultivated and brought the moſt of it under good improvements, with many valuable houſes, barns and orchards; ſome of them annually mowing at leaſt eighty tons of hay, and raiſe other produce of the country in proportion. Not the leaſt improvements of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were ever made in that town, except by theſe inhabitants; neither had they the leaſt knowledge of a pretence of any <hi>New-York</hi> patents extending there till ſeveral years after they had ſettled the land. As has been before obſerved, there were about four ſettlers on that part of <hi>Hooſick</hi> patent, included in
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:016183_0138_0F9BCC64922C5030"/>the townſhip of <hi>Pownal,</hi> when it was granted; and if the author has a right information, there has not been any more ſettlements made under the <hi>New-York</hi> title ſince, though there had ſundry families ſettled on the premiſes included as aforeſaid, under the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> title.</p>
               <p>As the ſtate and circumſtances of ſuch part of the townſhips aforeſaid as are included in the old patents, are materially different in many reſpects, from the circumſtances of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants in general; it will therefore be neceſſary that this matter have a particular conſideration; and that none of the aforeſaid arguments be conſidered in this caſe but what are truely applicable; and in this review of the caſe, it will be admitted, that the old <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumſcock</hi> patent includes ſuch part of <hi>Bennington</hi> as the plan the patentees exhibit doth contain.</p>
               <p>IT is taken for granted that the royal determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the boundary line in 1764 could not extend the government of <hi>New-York</hi> antecedent to the date of that order, which was a manifeſtation of royal power, and which was the ſole cauſe of that extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore, at the time the government of <hi>New-York</hi> granted the forementioned old patents, they could have no greater authority for ſo doing than what they were then in fact poſſeſſed of: It remains therefore to be conſidered, whether the patents from the government of <hi>New-York</hi> are valid or not, ſo far as they interfere with the townſhips of <hi>Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Pownal.</hi> And firſtly, it has been proved that the province of <hi>New-York</hi> as deſcribed in their governor's commiſſions, doth not extend ſo far north as the city of <hi>Albany;</hi> therefore the northern
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:016183_0139_0F9BCC65504709B8"/>tracts of country which theſe patents of <hi>Hooſick</hi> and <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> cover, muſt be conſidered as belonging to their ſecond ſort of domain, (to wit) the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It has alſo been ſhewn, that theſe territories are not circumſcribed to any particular limity, but that they were originally meant to include ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grants that were independent of the province and adjoining ſettlements, on extra-provincial lands: probably that government may have authority to grant land to the weſt and north-weſt, where it is indiſputably unappropriated, and where the claim of none other government could interfere: but it will be inſiſted upon, on the part of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> ſettlers, which are included in the aforeſaid old patents, that the government of <hi>New-York</hi> had no right to extend any of their patents to the caſtward of a line equivalent to that which conſticutes the bounds between <hi>New-York</hi> and the colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts.</hi> This limit was ever thought by the people in general of the colony of <hi>New-York,</hi> as well as thoſe of the adjacent colonies, to be the eaſtern boundary of <hi>New-York,</hi> until the aera of the late determination, which extended it to the river <hi>Connecticut:</hi> and labouring men that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the world of mankind, are obliged to form their judgments of the juriſdiction of governments by the common received opinions of mankind they are converſant with; and even admitting they make an erroneous judgment, yet, in the preſent caſe, as the lands were of but little value, excluſive of their toil and cultivation; and as the farmers in reality uphold the ſtate, it is therefore not only incumbent on the laws, but on the policy of the ſtate to defend them
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:016183_0140_0F9BCC661F567218"/>in caſes of this nature—it muſt be admitted that where the limits of governments are clearly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and notoriouſly known, that a farmer treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing in this manner on another's property, muſt bear the loſs. But, provided a country of people be generally under a deception as to matters of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and purchaſe land and make great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, and all on a miſtaken footing; men in ſuch circumſtances ſhould be conſidered in the moſt favorable light. For, as not only individuals, but the country about them were in the ſame manner deceived, and therefore, at the time of purchaſing and ſettlement, they were utterly deſtitute of the means of knowledge; yet, however, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to, that thoſe farmers on whoſe account the preſent arguments are exhibitted, are under a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception about this matter; for of all ſorts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental juriſdiction, the <hi>New-York</hi> territorial was the weakeſt, looſeſt and moſt vague; it was rather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional and political, than poſitive; and in its own nature almoſt or quite incapable of being extended faſter than ſettlements were actually carried on, or at moſt the lands expoſed to this territorial juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould not be patented faſter than his majeſty's ſubjects are diſpoſed forthwith to ſettle. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of granting ſo faſt may be pleaded on account of order—the policy of government may demand it; otherwiſe an occaſional juriſdiction would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unable to abilitate the government to make conveyance of the right in fee; although it is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable that ſuch a jurisdiction in matters of meer government, is to all intents and purpoſes, equal to poſitive juriſdiction; but with reſpect to having a
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:016183_0141_0F9BCC66CECF2340"/>power to convey the fee of lands, is matter of doubt: But thus much with propriety may be inferred, that a title ſo weak and impotent ſhould not claim ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over the leaſt conception of title whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; a meer poſſeſſion is of itſelf abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to maintain the right in the poſſeſſor, and on a judicious trial at common law, (could ſuch an one be had) would be adjudged paramount to it.</p>
               <p>THERE is another conſideration that muſt totally extinguiſh and obliterate all poſſible remaining idea of right, that the patentees of <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> may be ſuppoſed to have the ſaid tract of land included in the limits of the townſhip of <hi>Bennington.</hi> Only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the date of that patent, which is on the 51th day of <hi>June</hi> 1739, and compare it with the time of the commencement of the ſettlement of <hi>Bennington,</hi> which was in the ſpring of the year 1760, and there will be found to be twenty-one years from the date of this patent, to the beginning of the ſettlement under <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi>—in all this time there was not the leaſt ſettlement or poſſeſſion made in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; although the expreſs condition of the patent was, that it ſhould be ſettled in three years from the time of granting. Poſſibly in all that time the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees might have got ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> tenants on ſome weſtern part of the patent, which, with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York,</hi> may be denominated a fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the condition of ſettlement; many large tracts having been patented, ſome ſince and others longer ago than <hi>Wallumſcock,</hi> which are yet moſtly a howling wilderneſs. This practice of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New-York</hi> in extending their patents to the eaſtward of a twenty mile line from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:016183_0142_0F9BCC6793396300"/>hath ever been conſidered as a diſingenious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing policy in that government; thereby to lay a foundation for intruding on the rights of their neighbouring colonies; and has been attended with many diſagreeable conſequences, as has been before obſerved. And as that government have given up their exorbitant claims where they interfered with the right of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> it would undoubtedly be their wiſeſt way to do the ſame with reſpect to ſuch claims as interfere with the right granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great ſeal of the province of <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> and inſtead of treating the people that have ſettled thoſe lands under that title, as rioters and felons; to exerciſe that juſtice and humanity towards them, which becometh governors to the governed.</p>
               <p>IT remains ſtill, that there be a ſummary view exhibitted, relative to the rule of right which ſhould take place with reſpect to the ſettlers under each government, that are ſettled on ſuch part of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned patents as are included in the townſhips of <hi>Bennington</hi> and <hi>Pownal.</hi> And although ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of title is in favor of thoſe under <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> nevertheleſs, as the line of juriſdiction in thoſe times of granting and ſettlement, was not expresſly aſcertained or known. Under theſe circumſtances, it would not only be bad ſtate-policy, but great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity and injuſtice to the ſubject; for either the government of <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs them, inaſmuch as both challenge a legal right; therefore, either title ſealed and confirmed with the ſweat and toil of the farmer is abundantly paramount to the other.</p>

OUR authors, in their appendix, page 19th miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the plea of the <hi>Bennington</hi> people, in ſaying, <q>To reaſon on their own principles, if equity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the claims of others under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> on account of priority of interfering grants, it would have afforded a fatal plea againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bennington;</hi> becauſe they ought then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have yielded up all the lands which are covered by more ancient patents.</q> The people of <hi>Bennington,</hi> or rather the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> have ever inſiſted, that at the time the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> granted thoſe lands they had good right ſo to do; but that <hi>New-York</hi> had not. This matter is illuſtrated and proved by many arguments, and real facts in this treatiſe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the 2d and 3d ſections, to which the reader is referred. 'Tis true, provided the <hi>Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> people had no further conſiderations in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of title, but the priority of interfering grants—according to this method of arguing, they ought to yield up ſuch part of that town as interferes with <hi>Wallumſcock</hi> patent; but the conſideration of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is undoubtedly, with the many other matters, material to be conſidered, as argued aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>HAVING gone through with the remarks on the <hi>New-York</hi> pamphlet, ſo far as immediately reſpects the title of thoſe lands which has been the principal cauſe of the publication of this treatiſe—ſhall next<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed to detect ſome notorious and diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſrepreſentations contained in the pamphlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:016183_0144_0F9BCCB8903E43A0"/>particularly in the appendix. In this brief review, it would be too tedious, as well as needleſs, to trace the authors through all their diſguiſed and fictitious repreſentations, and intricate windings. Shall therefore paſs on with noteing ſuch of their exhibitions as are the moſt cruelly fallacious; among which the ſtory of the extention of the townſhip of <hi>Bennington,</hi> merely by a vote of the inhabitants at a town meeting, to the weſtward from where it was intended to be granted, and within ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, is the moſt flagrantly opprobrious. The ſtory may be ſeen recorded in the 4th page of their appendix. <q>The grantees of the townſhip of <hi>Bennington,</hi> diſcovered that the ſituation of the tract according to the intention of the grant, would be both inconvenient and unprofitable, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a large proportion of mountain; and they therefore, by no better authority than a vote of town meeting, preſumed to extend it to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward within ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As this repreſentation in all and every part is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely groundleſs, and no pretence of proof to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, but is the meer calumnious aſperſion of thoſe who have an implacable haired to the <hi>Bennington</hi> people, a poſitive denial of the facts alledged would be ſufficient refutation of thoſe facts. Nevertheleſs as the aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have made a principal engine of this infamous ſtory of their own creation, to deſtroy the good character of the people afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by repreſenting them to the government at home as the vileſt of inſurgents and out-laws—and inaſmuch as the facts alledged are capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof by mathematical certainly, and ſundry demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:016183_0145_0F9BCCB95350A038"/>of this ſort having been actually made, (though not with a view of diſproving this calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as it had not then been publiſhed,) by admen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurations of the diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, to the weſterly line of <hi>Bennington,</hi> all which agree that it is at leaſt twenty miles. Mr. <hi>Samuel Robinſon</hi> for once made an actual menſuration of that diſtance, and found it to be twenty miles and thirty-five chains; his affidavit and Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Wood</hi>'s toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an atteſted copy of the ſurvey of that town by Mr. <hi>Matthew Cleſſon,</hi> the ſurveyor, is thought expedient to tranſcribe in its following order, which will abundantly ſerve to exculpate the people of <hi>Bennington</hi> from that odium wherewith they have been branded. The author is furthermore eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally directed by the inhabitants of that town, to <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the government of <hi>New-York</hi> to vindicate what their aſſembly have before alledged, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other accurate menſuration of the diſtance from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, to the weſterly line of <hi>Bennington;</hi> and further notify that aſſembly, that as omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as they may conceive themſelves to be, they muſt nevertheleſs recede from the calumny where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have abuſed the inhabitants of that town, or continue under the relentment of thoſe inhabitants:</q> Which take an additional affront at the ill uſage, inaſmuch as our opponents tell us page 3d, it is to <q>be tranſmitted for the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the government at home;</q> and further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that it was to guard againſt the impoſitions which from the want of candor, they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive the ſaid ſettlers, who "ſpared no art or act of violence," would by their agents deceive the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:016183_0146_0F9BCCBA137EDC28"/>at home, and therefore they had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to tranſmit a narrative of thoſe ſettler's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, for the information of that government. It ſeems the ſaid aſſembly fully reſolved that the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers and agents from the want of candor, would endeavour artfully to deceive, &amp;c. and that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were as fully reſolved to over match them in a game of that ſort, being greater practitioners than peaſants: but artful as they are, they made a fatal miſtake in advancing for matter of fact that which in its own nature is incapable of proof, and what has been diſprov'd by evidence of a mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical nature, and capable of further diſ-proof by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual menſuration. It is no ways marvellous that thoſe gentlemen which govern in that aſſembly have an antipathy againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Bennington,</hi> who have had a great ſhare in defeating them in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining poſſeſſion of the country of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grants. It ſeems they are not inſenſible of their merit, for, ſay they, <q>it is to this townſhip erected by a charter in itſelf void, and ſo greatly abuſed, that we are to aſcribe all the oppoſition which has ſince been given to the juriſdiction of <hi>New-York.</hi>
                  </q> It is evident that theſe gentlemen have an evil eye upon <hi>Bennington</hi> inhabitants; for, when they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the oppoſition to their juriſdiction, they take care to repeat the aforeſaid groundleſs aſperſion, by adding theſe words, "erected by a charter in itſelf void, and ſo greatly abuſed." They ſtill proceed upon this their favorite topic, and draw particular inferences from it to their advantage, <q>for by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſituation</q> of <hi>Bennington,</hi> 
                  <q>it is made to comprehend a large part of <hi>Wallumſcock,</hi> which was granted under the ſeal of this province ſo
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:016183_0147_0F9BCCBAD87CAD40"/>early as the year 1739.</q> This their ſcandalous aſſertion is twice repeated in page 8th. One of the paſſages is as follows: <q>Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll,</hi> one of the moſt eminent counſel of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> of <hi>Albany,</hi> were concerned for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</q> When theſe gentlemen found <hi>Breakenridge</hi>'s farm to be within ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, and greatly to the weſtward of what the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> had admitted to be the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>New-York</hi>—they told him that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſet up any principle for his defence.

               <p>THIS is far from being the true ſtate of the caſe. Sundry cauſes which had been tried, were determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> perceived it was expending money to no purpoſe, to maintain a ſuit at law againſt the <hi>New-York</hi> patentees, as they had ſuch a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things too tedious to particularize, was the cauſe why Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi> would not defend the aforeſaid ſuit in trial; but there was not a word ſaid, (as he informs me) between him and his ſaid attornies, about his farm's being within ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river; nor is it likely ever ſuch a thing was mentioned in <hi>Albany</hi> county; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:016183_0148_0F9BCCBB8F7BCA78"/>being ſo well known. Undoubtedly, this was wrote "for the information of government at home," thinking the fallacy would not there be detected it being at ſo great a diſtance.</p>
               <p>OUR authors, page 10th, after giving a narrative of a riotous and tumultuous outrage, committed by the inhabitants of <hi>Bennington,</hi> for which proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had iſſued from the earl of <hi>Dunmore,</hi> againſt the principal authors of the diſturbance "which could not be brought to juſtice," then they introduce a particular charge againſt Mr. <hi>Breakenridge,</hi> which is entirely deſtitute of foundation, viz. That he was one of the principal rioters. To this they join the former calumny of the weſtward extention of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> "by a vote of their town meeting;" and add to both theſe, the groundleſs ſtory of Mr. <hi>Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenridge</hi>'s council's inability to ſet up any principle in his defence, by reaſon of his being ſeated "with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river. "All theſe fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions blended together, make conſiderable of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, in their own words. <q>
                     <hi>James Breakenridge</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah Carpenter,</hi> were two of the moſt inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the offenders: the firſt had ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, where he knew it was impoſſible, on their own principles, that he could be protected by the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> claim, he had declined a fair trial, and ſuffered judgment by default.</q> With reſpect to Mr. <hi>Breakenridge</hi>'s being active in any expeditions (the <hi>New-Yorkers</hi> denominate riots, mobs, felony, &amp;c.) it is well known through the country of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, he has not. In the 18th &amp; 19th pages of the appendix, they repeat their former
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:016183_0149_0F9BCCBC530723B8"/>aſperſion againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Bennington</hi> in the moſt virulent and emphatical language—<q>And what is ſtill more ſhameful, they contend, they arm, they fight for lands, as a part of <hi>Bennington,</hi> which lies within ſeventeen miles of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river, and which the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver claimed, but admitted to be beyond their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</q>

               <p>OUR authors in the twenty-ſeventh and finiſhing page of their narrative, diſcover great invention and ſubtilty, who after giving an account of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumſtances of the town of <hi>Hinſdale</hi> which has, ſay they, "been taken up by a royal mandamus." This townſhip had firſt been granted by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay, and upon the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the boundary line between the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> in 1739, it fell within the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the inhabitants and proprietors, who in addition to their title, had alſo the <hi>Indian</hi> right. This townſhip, by the determination of the boundary line between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> fell within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <hi>Howard,</hi> after it had been ſettled about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years. The aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> in order to ſcreen their government from the imputation of the blame juſtly due to ſo reprehenſible a conduct, endeavor to palm it on the government at home, ſee page ſixth, with reſpect to <q>
                     <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> a townſhip in the ſouth-eaſt corner of <hi>Cumberland</hi> county. Even this is not to be aſcribed to our government, it proceeded from a much greater, and the higheſt authority. A mandamus was produced from the crown, on the report of the board of trade, and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:016183_0153_0F9BCCC0DF51D668"/>by the advice of the privy council, which veſted the grantee with a right of election, an act deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in itſelf, and ſuperceding the agency of the governor and council here, and the uſual forms.</q> A very extraordinary repreſentation! The nature of a royal mandamus is diametrically oppoſite to this interpretation. The right of election in the grantees, is reſtricted entirely to crown lands which are unappropriated; in ſuch lands, the grantee has a right of election, and common ſenſe may teach, that neither a mandamus or any other crown grant canſubvert the property which the ſubject holds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crown by prior grants; and though there be ever ſo many alterations in the juriſdiction, ſundry of which have perplexed the town of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> yet this ſhould have no effect on the property of the ſubjects.—Theſe grantees are likewiſe withheld from interfering on the right of the <hi>Indian</hi> ſubjects.—Yet, it ſeems Col. <hi>Howard</hi> had the vanity to locate his mandamus on the old plantation of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> which was firſtly appropriated by a purchaſe from the <hi>Indians;</hi> ſecondly, by a grant from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay, and thirdly, by the government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and fourthly, by an uninterupted poſſeſſion and occupancy about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>
               <p>THE ſubterfuge the gentlemen make uſe of to rid their government from diſhonor, in making this laſt grant of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> is very extraordinary; it ſeems not well calculated "to be tranſmitted for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the government at home!" who are undoubtedly competent judges of their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus's, and no doubt will eaſily diſcern their laſt
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:016183_0154_0F9BCCC19B89AAD8"/>error to be worſe than the firſt. Such prepoſterous granting of lands, is criminally injurious to the ſubject, as it never fails to embarraſs the different claimants with many concomitant difficulties. Yet, ſtill to caſt the blame due to their government, on the king's mandamus, is more daringly injurious to the higheſt authority in the nation.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, the maner of redreſs preſcrided for the ſufferers, viz. the old proprietors of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> is the moſt ſhocking piece of contrivance, page 27, <q>
                     <hi>Hinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> a ſmall townſhip which has lately been taken up by virtue of a royal mandamus, is alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate—but even here the poſſeſſors may be relieved, by a ſuitable compenſation, equal to the value of their improvements in crown lands, free from the expence of fees.</q> Theſe gentlemen in their great clemency have alſo conceded that the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers in general may be thus conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>on the ſame terms, may be aſſigned to each of thoſe who are ſeated on the ſoil, actually appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to others by the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the poſſeſſions of which cannot for that reaſon be confirmed; ſuch a proportion of crown lands as the governor and council ſhall judge to be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to their reſpective improvements.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEN they proceed to deſcribe the tract, <q>a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and extenſive country, in the northern part of the county of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and between <hi>Connecticut</hi>-river and lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> ſtill remains unpatented by their government, and might be planted and cultivated by theſe people:</q>—What a ſurpriſing condeſcention this! the poſterity of the original proprietors of <hi>Hinſdale,</hi> eſpecially, to be allowed the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:016183_0155_0F9BCCC253EBEE08"/>privilege to pull up ſtakes, quit their farms and poſſeſſions, houſes, orchards, &amp;c. and join company with the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers in general, and trudge off to the north-eaſt part of the wilderneſs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and there commence another ſettlement, leaving their pleaſant habitations, fields, tenements, and country, in exchange for a howling wilderneſs; a pretty exchange!—and this to gratify a number of <hi>New-York</hi> cormorants. But, let's ſtop a little and conſider—whether it would not be more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to change the ſcene, and ſo the <hi>New-York</hi> patentees remove their patents, that interfere with the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, and lay them in ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> as neither government have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated it.</p>
               <p>A ſufficient reaſon to be offered in ſavor of the latter of theſe projects, is, that the ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> are in deed, and in truth the lawful owners and proprietors of the lands they poſſeſs, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demonſtrated in the preceding ſections. Although theſe gentlemen have in the courſe of their narration, flung out very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary hims of rewarding his majeſty's ſoldiery, by the diſtribution of thoſe lands, yet they may here again be reminded, (which may further ſerve as the above reaſon) that his majeſty's proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed the ſoldiery to make their pitches on unappropriated and vacant lands, this therefore they muſt do, at the hazard of loſing their grants or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitching. For thoſe lands which being antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted by the crown, by the agency of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and council of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> muſt forever exclude the ſoldiery from pitching thereon; and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:016183_0156_0F9BCCC316DBEDC0"/>put it entirely out of the power or the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> or the crown, to grant them to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon. And when it is conſidered, that the <hi>New-York</hi> land-jobbers have, long ſince purchaſed great part of the ſoldiery rights, and that for a mere trifle, and laid them out of themſelves, at their own riſque; their arguments on that ſubject cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute greatly to the removal of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> ſettlers, to the exterior part of <hi>Charlotte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR authors have given a tedious hiſtory of the ſuits at law, which have been commenced by the <hi>New-York</hi> patentees, againſt the claimants and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupants under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and have exhibited many ſpecious appearances of fairneſs, equity, and impartiality in their trials. However, the reader muſt obſerve, that in every of thoſe, ſo boaſted of candid trials, the defendants, by the reſult, were to be diſpoſſeſſed of their farms. They then continue to tell of the entire ſatisfaction of the vanquiſhed, (together with ſuch of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> claimants as attended the courts) relative to the validity of the <hi>New-York</hi> title.—Soon after this, they give a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing account of riots and outrages, committed by theſe ſettlers, and mention <hi>Allen</hi> by name, (who they ſay, but a little before was ſo fully perſuaded of the validity of the <hi>New-York</hi> title) as one of their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This narrative is in itſelf incredible, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that men who were convinced, they had had an impartial trial at law, and of the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of their own title, and the authenticity of that of their opponants, would raily to arm, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of legal authority, and in defence of their own invalid title; eſpecially, after they had publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:016183_0157_0F9BCCC3D12F1FC8"/>their own ſentiments concerning that matter.</p>
               <p>Now follows another quotation from our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which is no leſs than a barefaced inſult o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe inhabitants, and one of the boldeſt of miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. <q>If the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> claimants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined that they were aggrieved by the deciſions of our judges, the means of redreſs were in their own power; and they ought to have ſued their writs of error, and in the legal and ordinary mode, to have referred their cauſe to the final ſentence of his majeſty. But to expect a remedy incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the adminiſtration of juſtice, and the rights of the ſubject either beſpeak the greateſt ignorance or preſumption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>COULD they once get this eſtablished, that there ſhould be no acceſs to his majeſty or trial, but in this "ordinary mode," it would no doubt, be to their entire ſatisfaction; trials in that government would then eaſily become deciſive; for in no caſe wherein the demand of the plaintiff is below the ſum of five hundred bounds, a writ of error in favour of the defendant can iſſue. And the <hi>New-York</hi> attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies who compiled the <hi>New-York</hi> ſtatings, and are alſo patented under that government, well knew that every action brought againſt the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> claimants has been deſignedly laid below that ſum. Yet they were poſſeſſed of that extreme bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aver in expreſs terms, that <q>if the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> claimants imagined that they were ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved by the deciſions of their judges, their means of redreſs were in their own power,</q> i. e. by way of a writ of error.</p>

THERE is nothing exhibitted in this <hi>New-York</hi> pamphlet which more ſenſibly deſerves reſentment than their pretenſions of indulgencies, favors, &amp;c. conferred on theſe claimants by that government—<q>To the honor of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> it may juſtly be aſſerted, that the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> claimants have received every mark of favor and indulgence which the circumſtances permitted.</q> Such hypocriſy debaſes human nature, is the peſt of ſociety, partakes of faiſhood and treachery; and what renders it pecularly vile is that it uſurps the feat of virtue, and deſtroys faith in communities, and is the ſource of cruel jealouſy. Had the govern-of <hi>New-York</hi> been truly friendly to thoſe ſettlers, it had been returned again; and mutual good will ſupplied the place of hatred and ſtrife. But alas! ſo long as the fee of the country of the <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> grants is the object in view, by the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> how it is poſſible for peace and good order to take place, can't well be conceived. Well would it be for that government, and infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> were they annexed to ſome other government; but they ſay, no. Query, why? The anſwer is eaſy. They would then looſe ſight of the aforeſaid deſirable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: otherwiſe, ſurely they would be glad to part with ſuch rebellious ſubjects as they repreſent them to be. For the truth no doubt is, that they are in hopes ſome better fortune may in future attend them. And that they can take and execute ſome of the leading men among theſe inhabitants; and ſo frighten and impoſe on the reſt; and finally, by this means avail themſelves of their eſtates and ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:016183_0159_0F9BCCC55619F198"/>the country. This is all they can deſire in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it under their juriſdiction. That they have in reality a view to this, will further appear by ſome memorable ſentences recorded in the 25th page of their appendix. "We may," ſay they, <q>readily conceive, that <hi>Breakenridge</hi> and his party, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant reaſon to wiſh for an alteration of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The public crimes and private wrongs which they have perpetrated, muſt make them look forward to the hour of tranquility, with the moſt anxious apprehenſions. The injured may then demand ſatisfaction for all their ſufferings—An attonement muſt then be made to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the violation of its laws.</q> Here the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers may read their intended doom, in conſequence of the ability of the government of <hi>New-York.</hi> And one reaſon why this government have not already deſtroyed the inhabitants of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> grants, with fire and ſword, is their want of ability; and this inability, in great part, conſiſts in this, that the common people in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are univerſally of opinion that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants have a good right to thoſe lands, and ſhould not be moleſted in the peaceable enjoyment of them, and conſeqently will not aſſiſt their civil officers in taking poſſeſſion of their tenements, or them as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oters. That they are no further turbulent than what is neceſſary to defend their perſons and properties, from the cruelty and monopoly of their rulers. This is the ground of all the lenity, forbearance and indulgence of that government towards thoſe inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and it is hoped, if theſe exceſſive favors ſhould be paſſed over without their thanks, they may yet be excuſed for the neglect.</p>

As the deſign of this ſection was, in a conciſe manner, to point out ſome of the moſt notorious extravagancies of the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> the ſubject can't with propriety be paſſed over, without taking a ſhort review of the forementioned laws of that colony, which are the moſt apparent portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their horrid malevolence and caprice. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe laws, which are evidently calculated with a deſign of extirpating the inhabitants, by them laws alluded to from their goodly land, nay, from the face of the earth; is no leſs than laviſhly foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own ſhame; laws that ought, and are contemned and diſregarded by every lover of virtue. Laws and ſociety-compacts were originally deſigned to protect the ſubjects in their property. Loyalty and ſubordination to
ſuch government, is eſſentially neceſſary, for the good of ſociety, and all good and liege ſubjects will ſupport ſuch laws and legiſlators. But, as in the preſent inſtance, when laws, in their original deſign and adminiſtration, are degenerated from the good ends for which laws and government were inſtituted, terminating in the ruin and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſociety it ſhould ſecure and protect; from the ſame principles, viz. ſelf-preſervation, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are obliged to reſiſt and depoſe ſuch govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And, inaſmuch as thoſe laws, together with ſome remarks on them, are to be ſeen in the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of this performance, ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, with leaving the reader, from his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, to paſs ſuch ſentence concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as may appear reaſonable.</p>

                           <head>EXTRACT from a Report of the Lords of Trade, to the Committee of his Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy Council, for Plantation Affairs, dated <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 3d, 1772.</head>
                           <p>UPON the fulleſt examination into all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which at preſent conſtitute the ſtate of that diſtrict between the rivers <hi>Hudſon,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut;</hi> out of which, the greateſt diſorders and confuſion have ariſen. It ſeemeth to us, that the principal objects of attention in the conſideration of any meaſures that can be ſuggeſted for reſtoring public tranquility, and quieting poſſeſſions, are,</p>
                           <p>FIRST, thoſe townſhips, which having been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally ſettled and eſtabliſhed under grants from
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:016183_0166_0F9BCCCB513CEEF0"/>the government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-bay, fell within this diſtrict, by the determination of the northern boundary of that province, in the year 1740.</p>
                           <p>SECONDLY, Thoſe grants of land made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this diſtrict, by the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> previous to the eſtabliſhment of the townſhips laid out by the governor of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> after the concluſion of the peace; and which land now lies within the limits of ſome one or other of thoſe townſhips.</p>
                           <p>THIRDLY, Thoſe townſhips, which having been originally laid out by the governor of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> either continue in the ſame ſtate, or have been confirmed by grants from <hi>New-York,</hi> and alſo, thoſe which have ſince originated under grants from the latter of thoſe colonies.</p>
                           <p>WITH regard to thoſe townſhips which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt of the abovementioned deſcriptions; when we conſider their nature and origin, and the numberleſs difficulties to which the original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of them muſt have been ſubjected in the ſettlement of lands expoſed to the incurſions of the ſavages, and to every diſtreſs which the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the <hi>French</hi> in time of war could bring upon them; and, when we add to theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the great reaſon there is to believe that the grants were made upon the ground of military ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the enemy; we do not heſitate to ſubmit to your lordſhips our opinion, that the preſent proprietors of theſe townſhips, ought, both in juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and equity, to be quieted in their poſſeſſions: And, that all grants whatſoever, made by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:016183_0167_0F9BCCCC10F66458"/>of <hi>New-York,</hi> of any lands within the limits of thoſe townſhips, whether the degree of improvement under the original grant had been more or leſs; are, in every light which they can be viewed, oppreſſive and unjuſt: But as we are ſenſible that ſuch ſubſequent grants made by the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> however unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cannot be ſet aſide by any authority from his majeſty, in caſe the grantees ſhall inſiſt on their title; we ſubmit to your lordſhips, whether it might not be expedient, in order to quiet the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal proprietors in their poſſeſſions, to propoſe that all ſuch perſons who may claim poſſeſſion of lands within the limits of ſuch townſhips under <hi>New-York</hi> grants, ſhould upon condition of their quiting ſuch claim, receive a grant under the ſeal of <hi>New-York</hi> upon the like terms, and free of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, of an equal number of acres in ſome other part of the diſtrict lying between the rivers <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Connecticut;</hi> and in caſe where any actual ſettlement or improvement has been made by ſuch claimants, that they ſhould in ſuch caſe, receive fifty acres of waſte land for every three acres, they may have improved.</p>
                           <p>WITH regard to thoſe grants made by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York,</hi> which fall within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond deſcription, and upon which any actual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement has been made; they do appear to us to deſerve the ſame conſideration; and that the proprietors thereof ought not to be diſturbed in their poſſeſſions, whether that improvement be to a greater or leſſer extent: But we beg leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to your lordſhips, that in both theſe caſes no
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:016183_0168_0F9BCCCCD9F2E608"/>conſideration ought to be had to any claim, where it ſhall appear that no regular poſſeſſion has ever been taken, and no actual ſettlement ever been made.</p>
                           <p>WITH regard to thoſe townſhips which fall within the laſt mentioned deſcription, we ſubmit to your lordſhips our opinion, that provided ſuch townſhips do not include lands within the limits of ſome antecedent grant, upon which actual improvement has at any time been made, it would be adviſeable they ſhould be confirmed as town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, according to the limits expreſſed in the grants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and that all perſons having poſſeſſion of any ſhares in the ſaid townſhips, either as original grantees, or by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or conveyance, and upon which ſhares any actual improvement or ſettlement has been made, ought not in juſtice to have been, or to be in future, diſturbed in the poſſeſſion of ſuch ſhares; nor ought they to be bound to any other conditions, whether of quit rent or otherwiſe, than what is contained in the grant.</p>

               </q>
               <p>THESE inducements are indiſputably authoritative, and need no commentation: Yet notwithſtanding the priority and preferance of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> title to that of <hi>New-York,</hi> and the ſo many corroberating and concomitant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to the claimants under the former, to ſettle and cultivate thoſe lands; yet the aſſembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts of their ſtate of the right, &amp;c. and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the appendix, treat thoſe inhabitants, merely on account of ſuch ſettlement, with the moſt extreme injury; who, inſtead of arguing, only declaim againſt them, and go on in a gradation of conſequences drawn from falſe premiſes, till they have dragged them from their true character of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, to that of uſurpers, rioters, and felons. Although the quotations from our authors have already been lengthy, yet that a precedent of their injuſtice may not here be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the following, from the third page of their appendix is inſerted.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>BUT though the ſame principles have been explained, and enforced in ſeveral acts and proclamations of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as on repeated trials in our courts of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:016183_0169_0F9BCCCD92D8BCD0"/>they have left no ſuitable impreſſion on the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious claimants under <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> On the contrary, in contempt of the dictates of juſtice, the deciſions of law, and the civil authority, have their encroachments, which were few in number at the time of the royal determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, been increaſed and extended in a tenfold proportion; and that in general by men, who cannot plead that they were deceived or ignorant of the nature or merit of their claim, which it appears, were too notorious to have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped their obſervation, but who in ſpite of every warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and remonſtrance to deter them, which human pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could deviſe, engaged as volunteers on the ſide of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and wilfully plunged themſelves into the controverſy. To extenuate their own indiſcretion and miſconduct, calumny and miſrepreſentation are their only reſource; and accordingly without the leaſt reaſon, they charge the government of <hi>New-York</hi> with partiality, and every land holder under it, upon whom they have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, with injuſtice and and oppreſſion; aſſerting, that becauſe they have ſanctified their claim by a wrongful poſſeſſion, they ought peacebly to enjoy the fruits of their uſurpation. To mortify their pretentions they have ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no art or act of violence, however criminal; and after all, as if they were really injured, and the objects of regard, they do not heſitate to carry their complaints to the throne, and by ſpecial agents to ſolicit ſome extraordinary act of favour, by which their offences may be paſſed over with impunity, and their encroachments perpetuated in prejudice to thoſe who enjoy a clear title from the crown, under the great ſeal of <hi>New-York.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As this clamorous quotation is already moſtly anſwered, ſhall only remark, as to thoſe ſettlers extending their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments in a ten fold proportion, ſince the royal deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. It hath been fully evinced that this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpected juriſdiction only, and the before recited royal order and report of the board of trade, were accounted ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to exclude all manner of doubts in the minds of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> claimants of the validity of their title. They
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:016183_0170_0F9BCCCE547E8560"/>truly cannot plead that <q>they were deceived or ignorant of the nature or merit of their claim.</q> This matter was elucidated by the higheſt wiſdom and authority in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they rejoice in the clemency of their ſovereign, and in the wiſdom and impartial juſtice of the honourable board of trade, exhibited as aforeſaid, upon which encouragement thoſe claimants have greatly extended ſettlements on thoſe lands, in a more ſpecial manner on <hi>Onion</hi> river and lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> between the townſhip of <hi>Panton,</hi> which abuts on the lake oppoſite <hi>Crown Point,</hi> and the ſaid river, and north of it almoſt to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, and preparations are vigorouſly making to extend theſe ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the very bounds of the province of <hi>Quebec</hi> It is ſeldom any new country ſettles with ſuch rapidity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oppoſitions they meet with from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>New York:</hi> The expence of clearing roads, building mills, moving to and ſettling in that wilderneſs country only for two years laſt paſt, would amount to no very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſum. And thoſe ſettlers from the foregoing reaſons, do not in the leaſt heſitate, but that they in ſo fulfilling the conditions of their charters, have and are acting agreeable to his majeſty's will and pleaſure; and that thoſe labours will not only be for their own emolument, but for the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Britiſh empire, and addition of the crown reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
               <p>THE aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> have been very particular in their hiſtory of the tumults and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots made by thoſe ſettlers, in oppoſition to that government, (many of which facts muſt be confeſſed to be true) though they have carefully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their manyfold provocations, yet, with all their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity have given but a very imperfect idea of thoſe tranſactions. I ſhall here, therefore, waving particulars, give a general review of the oeconomy of thoſe ſettlers in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to that government. For defending their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they were indicted rioters, the next thing was to defend rioters; then they had two objects of protection, viz. their perſons, as well as property: They were at firſt greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated at the empty appearance of law, that their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:016183_0171_0F9BCCCF11434FC0"/>were ſo converſant with, ſometimes deſpairing of maintaining their poſſeſſions; yet upon extremity, rather than quit their ſubſtance to the inſatiable raviſhers, would rally and fruſtrate their deſigns: Thus, when the ſheriff of the county of <hi>Albany</hi> with his poſſe came to diſpoſſeſs ſome of them, they moſt generally, boldly took up arms and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed leaders. Matters having come to this, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the inhabitants aſſembled and appointed committees of ſafety in the ſeveral towns throughout their ſettlement; this general committee have the conducting of the public affairs of the country for its ſecurity, till his majeſty ſettles the controverſy. They have erected ſeveral companies, which by the votes of the ſoldiers are furniſhed with officers, theſe companies form a regiment which are known by the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant character of <hi>green mountain boys,</hi> who are generally in the prime of life, well verſed in the uſe of fire arms, and of robuſt conſtitutions; probably no American regiment in an interior defence could excel them, or that would willingly contribute to the ſupport of the crown of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> for it is obſervable, that ſuch ſubjects that will not fight for their property, will never fight for their king. And, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inſtructions from the committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing againſt the government of <hi>New-York,</hi> but on the defenſive.</p>
               <p>IT is in the nature of things impoſſible to paſs a right judgment on the conduct of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſettlers, without taking into view the treatment of the government of <hi>New-York</hi> towards them. All caſes muſt be determined upon the peculiar circumſtances attending; no act can ſcarcely be conceived of, which, under certain attending circumſtances might not be lawful. It will be readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the part of thoſe ſettlers, that, provided the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-York,</hi> and its patentees have a clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible right to thoſe lands; and that they are intruders, and by force and violence have maintained ſuch encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then, they are truly guilty, in manner as the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>New-York</hi> have alledged: But on the contrary, if thoſe ſettlers have a legal and inconteſtible right to thoſe
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:016183_0172_0F9BCCCFD125BD70"/>lands, that they proſecute ſettlement on the good faith of that title, and the ſundry approbations of both their title and ſettlement from the Britiſh adminiſtration, then, they are not guilty in manner as thoſe gentlemen have declared; and the impartial public, inſtead of viewing them as uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, rioters and felons, will juſtify them in their conduct, and eſteem them as good members of ſociety, leige ſubjects to the crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and good ſoldiers for defending their perſons and properties.</p>
               <p>THUS, is humbly ſubmitted the ſtate of the controverſy, which has for many years ſubſiſted between the government of <hi>New-York</hi> and the ſettlers under <hi>New-Hampſhire;</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice muſt every act ſtand or fall; if thoſe ſettlers are in the wrong, they are criminally ſo, but if not, then the allegations of their opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</p>
