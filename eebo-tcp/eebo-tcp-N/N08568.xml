            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>CAPTAIN DISNEY, with five other Gentlemen, reſiding in the Diſtrict of <hi>Montreal,</hi> had been taken up in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1766, for the cruel Aſſault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted about two Years ago, upon Mr. <hi>Thomas Walker.</hi> They were apprehended by Virtue of Warrants of the Honourable WILLIAM HEY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Majeſty's Chief-Juſtice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Quebec,</hi> which are ſounded upon a long, minute, and poſitive Information given againſt them, upon Oath, before the ſaid Chief Juſtice, by <hi>George M'Govock,</hi> a Soldier of the 28th Regiment of Foot, who declared himſelf to have been an Accomplice with them in that Affair, and to have been an Eye-witneſs of all the proceedings in it. The Perſons ſo apprehended immediately came to <hi>Quebec,</hi> and applied to the Chief-Juſtice to be bailed; and many of the principal Perſons in the Province offered to become bound for their Appearance, at the enſuing Seſſion of the Supreme Court, at <hi>Montreal,</hi> in order to take their Trials. But, by reaſon of the Magnitude of the Crime, (it being a Capital Offence, of a very odious Nature) and the Poſitiveneſs of the Charge againſt them, the Chief-Juſtice thought he was not at Liberty, conſiſtently with the Rules of Law, to admit them to Bail; grounding his Opinion herein, both on the general Principles of the Law relating to Bail in criminal Caſes, and on ſome very ſtrong modern Authorities on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and particularly the two Caſes of <hi>Acton</hi> and <hi>Greenwood,</hi> reported in Sir <hi>John Strange</hi>'s Reports, Page 851 and 1138, which ſeem to be deciſive in the Point. They were therefore committed to Cuſtody, but confined in the eaſieſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Manner poſſible in Mr. <hi>William Grant</hi>'s Houſe, at <hi>Montreal,</hi> which is ſaid to be the beſt Houſe in the Province; it having been ſuggeſted, as a Ground for this Indulgence, that the King's Priſon at <hi>Montreal</hi> was in bad Repair, and not in a fit Condition to receive them. On the 28th Day of the <hi>February</hi> following, in the Year 1767, the Chief-Juſtice held a Seſſion of the Supreme-Court of Judicature at <hi>Montreal,</hi> both for criminal and civil Matters, which was continued by ſeveral Adjournments to the Middle of <hi>March.</hi> And about the 8th or 9th Day of <hi>March,</hi> a Bill of Indictment, that had been preſented to the Grand Jury againſt Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> by the Attorney-General was returned by them a true Bill; and on the 11th Day of the ſame Month, Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> was tried upon this Indictment, and acquitted.</p>

            <head>After the Priſoner had pleaded not guilty to the Indictment, and the Jury were duly ſworn and charged to try the Iſſue, the Caſe was opened to the Court and Jury by FRANCIS MASERES, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Majeſty's Attorney-General for the Province of <hi>Quebec,</hi> (who was the only Perſon of Counſel for the Crown on this Occaſion) in ſome ſuch Manner as hereafter followeth:</head>

            <p>IT is my Duty, as Proſecutor for the Crown, on the preſent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to lay open to you the Circumſtances of the Crime with which the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands charged; which I am perſuaded you will look upon as one of the moſt outrageous Violations of the of the public Peace and Order that ever was brought before a Court of Juſtice; Nothing leſs than aſſaulting a Magiſtrate of unblemiſhed Character in his own Houſe, in the Night-time, with an Intention to murder him;—and this in Revenge for an Act done by him as a Magiſtrate, in Conjunction with three other Magiſtrates of the Province, in Support, as he thought, at leaſt, of the Laws and Liberties of his Country.—If this is an Action that ought not to be the Subject of a Proſecution, ſurely nothing can deſerve to be ſo: And if thoſe who are charged with being guilty of it are juſt Objects of the Compaſſion of the Public, I know not what Offenders can excite their Indignation. It approaches in a great Degree to the moſt dangerous of all civil Crimes, High Treaſon itſelf, as it has an immediate Tendency to over awe, to check, and even entirely to ſtop the Proceedings of the Magiſtrates of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in the Adminiſtration of Public Juſtice; without which our excellent Laws are but a dead Letter, and our boaſted Liberties and Properties an empty Sound: And it was attended with Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of deliberate Malice, Revenge, and Cruelty, that, in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Perſons not deſtitute of the Feelings of Humanity, muſt make it completely odious: To which may be added the leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Circumſtance of the cowardly Manner of its Execution, if the employing ten or twelve armed Men to ſurpriſe and attack one poor, unſuſpecting, unarmed Man, ſitting peaceably at Home in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his Wife and Family, can entitle it to that Appellation.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I am ſorry to obſerve further, that the Perſons who committed this Outrage were Military Men: For ſurely this is an Aggravation of the Offence. It is in them an Act of Treachery: It is betraying the high and honourable Truſt repoſed in them by their King and Country, by employing to the Purpoſes of Revenge and Malice thoſe Arms which had been put into their Hands for the Protection of their Fellow-Subjects, and the Maintenance of the Public Tranquility.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I will now lay before you, in the firſt Place, the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that gave riſe to the Crime with which the Priſoner at the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010958_0005_0F852F26A1647E10"/>
Bar ſtands charged, and afterwards the Manner and Circumſtances of its Execution and the Share the Priſoner at the Bar took in it.</p>
            <p>When the Civil Government was eſtabliſhed in this Province, in the Year 1764, a Number of Perſons, in the Diſtrict of <hi>Montreal,</hi> were commiſſioned by Governor MURRAY, to act as Juſtices of the Peace for that Diſtrict, and new and great Powers of determining. Matters of Civil Property, not belonging to thoſe Magiſtrates in <hi>England,</hi> were given them by the great Ordinance of <hi>September</hi> 17th, of that Year, by which the Courts of Judicature were erected. Among the Perſons ſo commiſſioned were Mr. <hi>Thomas Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dumas St. Martin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knipe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lambe:</hi> Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as I am informed, all of them acted in their new Office with Honour and Integrity, and gave general Satisfaction to the People by their diligent Endeavours to promote their Welfare. There was one Abuſe in particular which they earneſtly laboured to reform, as it was then very generally and very ſeverely felt by the Inhabitants of <hi>Montreal,</hi> and the Subject of frequent Complaints. This was the Oppreſſion exerciſed by ſome Officers of the Army, under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Pretence of their Right of billetting Soldiers. The Power of appointing Billets was often employed by them to ſerve the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of gratifying their private Diſguſts, and of extorting Money from the People. Three or four of the moſt drunken and riotous of the Soldiers would be ſent to take up their Quarters at the Houſe of a ſubſtantial Citizen, that was thought able to pay a good Price for an Exemption. This would alarm him, and oblige him to make the humbleſt and moſt earneſt Intreaties to be excuſed from receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; upon which an Intimation would be given him, that, if he would conſent to pay Six or Eight Dollars a Month in Lieu of it, he might be excuſed, and the Soldiers with that Money would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves other Quarters. This the poor Man would readily ſubmit to (if he could by any Means raiſe the Money) rather than ſee his Houſe taken up, his Furniture broken and ſpoil'd, his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions waſted, and ſometimes his Wife and Daughters inſulted by ſuch boiſterous and profligate Inmates: And thus by paying the Tax required he would obtain his Exemption. They would then go to another Citizen of two, and by the like Menaces extort from them the like Contributions. Thoſe were the Oppreſſions which Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and his Fellow-Magiſtrates endeavoured to remove. Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> in particular, drew out a Scheme for billeting the Soldiers, by which he made it appear, that there was no Neceſſity that more than two Soldiers ſhould ever be quartered in one Houſe, whereas there were ſeveral Houſes at that Time that were burthened with five or ſix: So that the Hardſhips the People laboured under in this Reſpect were by no Means Evils of Neceſſity (in which Caſe they ought patiently to have been ſubmitted to) but were mere Abuſes of Power, to anſwer theſe ſiniſter Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010958_0005_0F852F26A1647E10"/>Gentlemen, in the Beginning of the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1764. Complaint, that took its Riſe from this Power of billeting, was brought before Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dumas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lambe,</hi> the Juſtices of the Peace before mentioned, againſt Captain <hi>Benjamin Charnock Payne,</hi> of the 28th Regiment, which proved the immediate. Occaſion of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Sufferings. Captain <hi>John Fraſer,</hi> Pay-Maſter-General of the Troops in the Diſtrict of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal,</hi> and one of the Priſoners now in Cuſtody on Account of this Affair, had been billeted by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Chriſtie,</hi> the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſter-General, on the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Reamue,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman in <hi>Montreal,</hi> where he accordingly reſided till the latter End of <hi>October,</hi> or Beginning of <hi>November,</hi> 1764, at which Time he was appointed to an Office by which he became entitled to, or at leaſt poſſeſſed of, a Houſe at the Public Expence; upon which he left his Quarters at Mr. <hi>Reaume</hi>'s Houſe, and went to live in the Houſe, ſo aſſigned him. Mr. <hi>Reaume,</hi> imagining his Billet was at an End, immediately invited Mr. <hi>Knipe,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, who was at that Time in the Commiſſion of the Peace, and who occupied the Rooms underneath thoſe poſſeſſed by Captain <hi>Fraſer</hi> and had hired thoſe likewiſe of Mr. <hi>Reaume,</hi> at the Time that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fraſer</hi> was about to leave them, but had not yet taken poſſeſſion of them, to come and take Poſſeſſion of them according to his Agreement. But he was prevented from doing ſo by Captain <hi>Payne,</hi> who took, Poſſeſſion of them in the Name and Right of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fraſer,</hi> who inſiſted that he ſtill retained a Right to theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and might either occupy them himſelf, if he ſo thought fit, or permit any other Perſon to occupy them in his Name. Mr. <hi>Reaume</hi> deſired Captain <hi>Payne</hi> to reſign them to Mr. <hi>Knipe,</hi> to whom he had let them; but Captain <hi>Payne</hi> refuſed to quit them, and inſiſted upon his Right to continue in them by Virtue of Captain <hi>Fraſer</hi>'s Billet. Mr. <hi>Knipe</hi> thought theſe Pretenſions of Captain <hi>Fraſer,</hi> to occupy theſe Quarters thus by Deputy, to be both hard and illegal, and wrote two or three Letters to him to complain of them: But, inſtead of receiving any kind of Satisfaction, he was anſwered in a Style of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and unſufferable Inſolence. Upon this he applied to the other Juſtices for Redreſs; and Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dumas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> held a Court in Mr. <hi>Reaume</hi>'s Houſe, to inquire into the Affair; and being ſatisfied by the Depoſitions of Mr. <hi>Knipe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Reaume,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Knipe</hi> had, by a fair Agreement, hired the Apartments in in Queſtion of Mr. <hi>Reaume,</hi> long before Captain <hi>Payne</hi> came into them, and being of Opinion likewiſe that Captain <hi>Fraſer</hi>'s Right to them was at an End the Moment he became poſſeſſed at the Public Expence of another Lodging, which he thought a better one, they determined that Mr. <hi>Knipe</hi> had a legal Right to the Apartments, and that Captain <hi>Payne</hi> ought to reſign them to him. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010958_0006_0F852F27512A8FD0"/>
in Conjunction with Mr. <hi>Lambe,</hi> a fourth Juſtice of the Peace, they ſigned a Warrant to a Bailiff, to command Captain <hi>Payne</hi> to quit that Lodging. In what Manner this Command of the Juſtices was to be enforced, I do not find to be certainly agreed. Thoſe who are diſpoſed to cenſure this Proceeding of the Juſtices, ſay that there was a Clauſe in the Warrant commanding the Bailiff to carry Captain <hi>Payne</hi> to Priſon, if he refuſed to quit the Lodging, and ſhould make Reſiſtance; others inform me otherwiſe: This however ſeems to be certain, that it was never their Intention that Captain <hi>Payne,</hi> ſhould be impriſoned. This will appear by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Part of their Conduct.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I will now minutely inquire how far theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Juſtices were legal, that is, how far they had Right to inquire into and determine this Conteſt between Mr. <hi>Knipe</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Payne,</hi> and to enforce their Deciſion of it (if they did ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it) by the Penalty of Impriſonment. But I will only obſerve that there ſeems to be a very reaſonable Ground for ſuppoſing that all theſe Things were within their Juriſdiction by Virtue of the Powers before mentioned, given by the great Ordinance of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 17, 1764, to any two Juſtices of the Peace to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any Diſputes concerning Matters of Civil Property, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Value of ten Pounds, which probably might take in the preſent Conteſt. Nor need we inquire whether or no the Deciſion they thought proper to make, that Captain <hi>Payne</hi> had no Right to theſe Apartments, was good in Point of Law: Though here, as well as before, I ſhould incline to think that the Law was with them: For, if we conſider that the being free from the Neceſſity of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Soldiers is one of the greateſt and moſt valued Privileges of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject—that it is one of the great Points of Liberty aſcertained and confirmed for ever by that beſt of Laws in the Statute-Book, the Petition of Right in the third Year of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt—That all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> had been introduced into this Province by the great Ordinance of the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> 1764, and that theſe favourite and beneficial ones were promiſed by the King's Proclamation, in 1763—and that in <hi>England</hi> itſelf the Troops are only quartered hi Public-Houſes, but never in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones; and that only by Virtue of a particular Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, annually paſſed for that purpoſe; we ſhall nor wonder at the unwillingneſs ſhewn by theſe worthy Magiſtrates to allow of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of billeting Soldiers upon private Houſes upon any other Ground but that of mere Neceſſity; or for any longer Time than ſuch Neceſſity continued; of which, in the Caſe then before them, there could be no Pretence, ſince the Moment Captain <hi>Fraſer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Houſe from the Government, in conſequence of his new Employment, which by going to live in it he acknowledged to be better than his Quarters, it was evidently no longer neceſſary that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010958_0006_0F852F27512A8FD0"/>
thoſe Quarters ſhould belong to him. But whether they were right or wrong in their Opinions upon theſe Points is not very material. This is certain, that they meant to determine a Matter that they took to be within their Cognizance, and that they meant to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it according to Law, and to do Juſtice to the Perſon they thought to be aggrieved. They therefore ought rather to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Thanks of their Fellow-Subjects for their faithful and ſpirited Diſcharge of their Duty, than to have become the Objects of ſo deep and deadly a Revenge.</p>
            <p>This Warrant of the Juſtices of the Peace was ſerved upon Cap-<hi>Payne</hi> the next Day, or rather, if it be true that there was a Clauſe of Impriſonment in it, but half ſerved by one of the Bailiffs of of the Diſtrict. For the Bailiff ſhewed it him, and required him to give up the Apartments to Mr. <hi>Knipe;</hi> but did not, upon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's refuſing to do ſo, offer to make him a Priſoner, or convey him to the Gaol. He neither laid hold on him, as is uſual in Arreſts, nor ſaid to him, <hi>You are to my Priſoner,</hi> nor told him that he had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to carry him to Priſon. But Captain <hi>Payne,</hi> as if anxiouſly deſirous of ſuffering an Indignity that might ſerve to irritate the Soldiers to a high Pitch, and diſpoſe them to ſome deſperate Act of Revenge againſt Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> inſiſted upon going to Priſon, and forced the Bailiff to ſhew him the Way thither. The Bailiff com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the Captain went to Gaol: And when he got there, the Keeper of the Priſon was unwilling to receive him, becauſe he had not a Warrant directed to himſelf to authorize him to do ſo. But the Captain inſiſted upon continuing in the Priſon. In the mean Time the Bailiff went and acquainted the Juſtices with what had happened, who immediately ſent him back to the Priſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint Captain <hi>Payne</hi> that he was not a Priſoner in Conſequence of their Warrant, that it never was their Intention to commit him to Priſon, and that he might go out of the Priſon when he pleaſed: And at the ſame Time they ſent him a Billet to be quartered at Mr. <hi>Croſton's</hi> Houſe, which was the very beſt Public-Houſe in the whole Town, the Magiſtrates being unwilling, except where Neceſſity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged them to it, to give Billets upon private Houſes. Captain <hi>Payne,</hi> however, thought fit to continue in the Priſon, notwithſtanding theſe Declarations from the Juſtices that he was at Liberty to leave it whenever he pleaſed; and that his Impriſonment might be the more public and make the deeper Impreſſion on the Spirits of the Soldiers, he had Recourſe to a more formal Method of obtaining his Diſcharge from it, by applying to the Chief-Juſtice of the Province for an <hi>Habeas Corpus:</hi> And by this Means he was ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>When the Circumſtances of this Affair came to be public, and it appeared that Captain <hi>Payne</hi> had been a voluntary Priſoner, and had continued ſo for ſeveral Days, it was by moſt People made the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010958_0007_0F852F281693D4B8"/>
Subject of Mirth and Laughter. This enraged the Captain to a high Degree, and made him reſolve to ſeek ſome immediate Revenge againſt the Juſtices, and moſt particularly againſt Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> as having been the moſt active Man amongſt them in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints about the billeting of Soldiers, and, as he imagined, the principal Promoter of the Warrant by which he was ordered to give up his Quarters, and in conſequence of which he had committed himſelf to Priſon. Soon after a Reſolution was taken to puniſh Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> for his Inſolence (that was the Language they made uſe of) by ſetting a Mark upon him, or by disfiguring him in ſome ſignal and diſgraceful Manner: And ſome of the wickedeſt and moſt deſperate Soldiers of the 28th Regiment, under the Direction of two Sergeants of the ſame Character, Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> and Sergeant <hi>Rogers,</hi> were employed to put it in Execution.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, we ſhall produce a Witneſs that was himſelf employed in this Buſineſs, and was preſent at the Execution of it, and who is conſequently well acquainted with all the Circumſtances attending it. His Name is <hi>George M'Govock,</hi> and he is a Soldier of the 28th Regiment.</p>
            <p>He will tell you, amongſt other Things, Gentlemen, that on <hi>Monday</hi> the 3d of <hi>December,</hi> 1764, that is, three Days before the Perpetration of this Crime, he was deſired by Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> (who and before that Time acquainted him with the Deſign and engaged him to be an Actor in it) to go with him to Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Montreal</hi> (a Lieutenant and Adjutant of the 28th Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who was deeply concerned in this Affair) to meet ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were Friends, as the Sergeant told him, to the Deſign of configuring Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> though they were not of the 28th Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to take an Oath of Secrecy never to diſcover any of them if they ſhould happen to be preſent at the Execution of it: That he accordingly went with Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> to Lieutenant <hi>Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi>'s; and that when they got there, the Lieutenant himſelf opened the Door to them, and was accompanied by Captain <hi>Daniel Diſney,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, and Lieutenant <hi>Simon Evans,</hi> of the 28th Regiment: That Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi> ſaid to him in the Paſſage, in the Preſence of Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Evans,</hi> and Sergeant <hi>Meas,</hi> ſome Words to this purpoſe, George, <hi>this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (pointing to Captain <hi>Diſney</hi>) <hi>and others that are within, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that you would promiſe that, if any of them ſhould make any Attempt to disfigure</hi> Mr. Walker, <hi>you will never diſcover it, and that you would for their further Security, take an Oath to keep it ſecret:</hi> That there upon he conſented to take the Oath, and took it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> adminiſtering it to him on a Book which Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi> produced, and which the Witneſs believes to have been a Bible. Lieutenant <hi>Evans</hi> at the ſame Time threatened him, that, if ever he diſcovered it, he ſhould ſoon be made an End of,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010958_0007_0F852F281693D4B8"/>
wherever he might happen to live, and that he himſelf would blow his Brains out. <hi>Tottenham</hi> thereupon ſaid to <hi>Evans,</hi> that he need not be afraid of his diſcovering the Matter; for that Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> and Sergeant <hi>Rogers</hi> knew him very well, and could anſwer for his being faithful.</p>
            <p>After this Converſation in the Paſſage, Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> and the Witneſs <hi>M'Govock</hi> went into the Parlour with Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Tottenham</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Evans;</hi> and there they ſaw the following Perſons, Captain <hi>John Campbell,</hi> of the 27th Regiment, Captain <hi>John Fraſer,</hi> the Perſon already ſpoken of, Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Chriſtie,</hi> Deputy-Quarter Maſter-General; M. <hi>St. Luc la Corne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joſeph Howard.</hi> He ſtaid in this Room about a Quarter of an Hour, during which Time the Reſolution taken to diſfigure Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was the general Subject of the Converſation. They all expreſſed their Approbation of this Deſign, and their Hopes that it would ſucceed. This Witneſs ſays that this Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was addreſſed to him or Sergeant <hi>Meas,</hi> or ſpoken with an evident Intention that they ſhould hear it; and that Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi> further explained to him the Deſign of introducing him and Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> into that Company to be that they might know that thoſe Gentlemen who were there aſſembled were Friends to the Deſign of disfiguring Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and that therefore they might not be ſurpriſed or alarmed if they ſhould ſee them engaged in the Execution of it, either before, or at the ſame Time with, and as Aſſiſtants to, the Gentlemen of the 28th Regiment.</p>
            <p>Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi> and the Witneſs then quitted the Parlour, after a Stay of ſomething more than a Quarter of an Hour, and went, by Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi>'s Direction into the Kitchen to drink, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards returned home about Nine o'Clock.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, What I have here laid before you concerning this Converſation at Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi>'s Houſe, and the Oath of Secrecy adminiſtered to this Witneſs by the Priſoner at the Bar, I have ſpoken from the Depoſition of this Witneſs, which I have here in my Hand and before my Eyes, with particular Care not to go one Jot beyond the Contents of it.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I muſt further inform you, that this Oath of Secrecy had a great Effect upon the Mind of this Witneſs; a Circumſtance that adds conſiderably to the Credit of his Teſtimony. When he had made his firſt Depoſition, which made mention only of Perſons to whom this Oath of Secrecy did not relate (which Depoſition he ſwore to before Mr. <hi>Dumas St. Martin,</hi> the Juſtice of Peace, on the eight Day of laſt <hi>September</hi>) he was aſked whether that Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition contained all he knew of the Matter; upon which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that it did not, but ſaid he would not reveal any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not do it without accuſing certain other Perſons that were concerned in that Affair, whom he conceived himſelf to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010958_0008_0F852F28D60B3BF8"/>
be under an Obligation never to diſcover, in Conſequence of an Oath of Secrecy he had taken for that Purpoſe. He was afterwards brought before his Honour the preſent Chief-Juſtice, to confirm and ſwear again to this Depoſition in the Preſence of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and myſelf. And his Scruple about the Oath of Secrecy being then mentioned as an Objection to his telling the reſt of what he knew, he declared that he would be guided by the Opinion and Advice of the Chief-Juſtice and myſelf concerning the Obligation of this Oath: And upon our telling him that we thought ſuch an Oath unlawful and void, that it was unlawful to take ſuch an Oath, and ſtill more unlawful to keep it, as it was contrary to a prior and ſtronger Obligation that every Man is under, for the Sake of the Public Good, to declare the whole of what he knows concerning any public Crimes, when called upon to do ſo in the Courſe of a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inquiry, he was perſuaded to give up his Scruple and declare the reſt of what he knew, which makes the Contents of his ſecond Depoſition. This Depoſition I took down in the Courſe of a very long Examination in the Preſence of his Honour the Chief-Juſtice and Mr. <hi>Walker;</hi> and can ſafely affirm that every Word of it came freely from the Witneſs without any Suggeſtions whatſoever from Mr. <hi>Walker;</hi> whoſe Conduct with reſpect to this Witneſs, ſo far as I have been able to obſerve it, has been ſo very ſtrict and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that, inſtead of bribing him to ſwear as he ſhould dictate to him, as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Enemies have given out, to invalidate this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Teſtimony, he has barely allowed him a neceſſary Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſince he has made thoſe Depoſitions, (not without ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction and Complaints of the Witneſs on that Account) and has cautioned him over and over to ſay nothing but what he was abſolutely ſure of: And now, ſince this Witneſs has been at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal</hi> he has not taken, as I believe, the juſtifiable Precaution (nor have I, nor any other Perſon to my Knowledge, taken it for him) of reading over to this Witneſs either of his Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Order to refreſh his Memory againſt the preſent Trial. We leave him to relate to you what he can himſelf recollect of the Circumſtances of this cruel Tranſaction, unaſſiſted either by our Admonitions or his own former Accounts of them. I will not proceed in the Narration of this unhappy Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the 4th of <hi>December,</hi> the Day after the Meeting above-mentioned at Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi>'s Houſe, a Plot was laid in Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi>'s Houſe in the Preſence of this Witneſs by Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geant <hi>Meas,</hi> Sergeant <hi>Rogers, John M'Laughlin, James Coleman</hi> and <hi>Daniel Aſhman,</hi> Soldiers of the 28th Regiment, to way-lay Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> that very Might about the Duſk of the Evening upon his Return from his Store-Houſe to his Dwelling-houſe, which were at the Diſtance of about a Furlong from each other. The Deſign was to beat and disfigure him. (The Word conſtant
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010958_0008_0F852F28D60B3BF8"/>
uſed in all their Conſultations was, <hi>To disfigure.</hi>) And the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaw them go accordingly in the Evening into proper Places for accompliſhing their Purpoſe, armed with Bayonets, and one of them with a Broad Sword. They ſtaid upon the Parade in Hopes of meeting with Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> till paſt Eight o'Clock, and then went Home, concluding that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> muſt have gone Home by ſome other Way. And this Witneſs heard ſome of them that Evening, give this Account of their Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>On the next Day, the <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> another Deſign was concerted at Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi>'s Houſe, between the Hours of Ten and Eleven o'Clock in Morning, to way-lay Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> again that Evening near his own Dwelling-houſe, in Order to beat and disfigure him. This Witneſs was preſent at Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi>'s Houſe at the Time this Deſign was concerted; and the Perſons who concerted it were Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant <hi>Rogers,</hi> Sergeant <hi>Meas, M'Laughlin, Coleman, Aſhman,</hi> and <hi>Philip Caſtles,</hi> another Soldier of the 28th Regiment. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly about Eight o'Clock that Evening theſe Perſons did ſet out from Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi>'s Houſe to different Parts of the Town, in Parties of two Men each. <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Coleman</hi> were in one of theſe Parties, and did meet with Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and were ſeen and taken Notice, of by him, as he will inform you, as Perſons, who, by their Looks and Behaviour, ſeemed to have ſome Deſign of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. But they were prevented from doing it by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſome People that had happened to come out juſt at that Time and followed Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and who, theſe Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians apprehended, might interpoſe in his Defence or raiſe an Alarm in the Neighbourhood. They therefore returned to Sergeant <hi>Meas</hi>'s Houſe about Nine o'Clock. The Witneſs <hi>M'Govock</hi> heard them afterwards give this Account of their Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the 6th of <hi>December,</hi> the Aſſault was actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And though they had hitherto, according to the Account of <hi>George M'Govock,</hi> intended only to beat and disfigure Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> in ſuch a Manner as to leave a laſting Mark of Diſgrace upon him, they now ſeem to have changed their Purpoſe to a ſafer and more complete Revenge, by reſolving firſt to murder him, and then to carry off one of his Ears in Triumph, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do the Scalp of an Enemy. That this was their Deſign at the Time of committing this Aſſault, will appear, not only from the Manner and Violence of the Blows they gave him, ſome wounding him on the Head with all their Force with Broad Swords, one with a Tomahawk, another with an Iron Bar upon the Loins, with a Deſign to break his Back but from the Words ſpoken by them at that Time, ſuch as that the would finiſh and diſpatch him, and their Declarations that they though he had been dead before they left him. Thoſe Words, and the Blows which they accompanied, and moſt of the Circumſtances attending the Aſſault itſelf, will be proved to you by the Teſtimony of Mr.

               <hi>Walker</hi> himſelf, as well as of the other Witneſs; and the Preſence of Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, on that Occaſion, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and animate the Soldiers who give, the Wounds, will be proved to you by the united Teſtimony of Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a Quarter before Nine o'Clock at Night, as Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> were ſitting in their Hall at Supper, a ſudden Noiſe was heard at the Door, as of a Number of People ſtriving haſtily to get into the Houſe. This Noiſe was occaſioned by their violent Manner of opening the Outer-Door, though ſhut only upon a Latch. Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> upon hearing it immediately cried out <hi>Entrez,</hi> imagining it was, a Number of <hi>Canadians</hi> coming to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Buſineſs as a Juſtice of Peace, as he had that whole Day had a great many ſuch Applications: But almoſt in the ſame Inſtant, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Door, and ſeeing through the Glaſs of the inner Door a Crowd of black Faces riſing one above another, as they ſtood on the Steps without, ſhe cried out with the utmoſt Surpriſe, <hi>Good God! What is this! This is Murder; this is the Army come to revenge themſelves.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> ſaw them firſt; becauſe ſhe ſat with her Face to the Door. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſat at the other End of the Table, with his Back to the Door and very near it; I think he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have been more than four Feet from it, which is a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Gentlemen, it will be proper you ſhould attend to. While Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> was crying out in the Manner I have mentioned, the Ruſſians entered the Room, burſting open the inner Glaſs-Door and breaking one of the Panes of Glaſs; and Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> clearly diſtinguiſhed Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, to be one of them, notwithſtanding the Crape he had over his Face, which is but an indifferent Diſguiſe. Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> turn his Head back at the Inſtant they were entering, which gave him an Opportunity of having one ſhort, but full View of them, and at a very ſmall Diſtance, before he received a Blow: And it was in this full and near View of them that he clearly diſtinguiſhed Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> amongſt their Number. He alſo took ſuch Notice of two other Faces among them, that he thinks he ſhould know them again whenever he ſhould ſee them: But he declares they are not any of the Priſoners now in Cuſtody in this Place, nor any other Perſons whoſe Names he is acquainted with.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, upon the Sight of theſe Aſſaſſins, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up from his Chair, and in riſing received a Wound on the Fore-Part of his Head with a Broad-Sword. This Wound was five In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, and was given with ſuch a Force that one of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Servants, who was then attending him and ſaw it given, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it muſt be mortal to him. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> however did not ſink under it, but recollecting that his Arms were in his Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he endeavoured to make towards it, in Hopes of making
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010958_0009_0F852F2C15F2E198"/>
ſome Defence, and for that Purpoſe ruſhed into the Parlour which lay between the Hall and the Bed-Chamber. But he received ſo many Wounds from five or ſix of the Ruſſians as he paſſed, that he never could reach the Bed-Chamber, but ſunk down, ſpent with Wounds and the loſs of Blood, into an armed Chair that was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the further Corner of the Parlour adjoining to the Door of the Bed-Chamber. In this helpleſs Condition he received ſeveral more Wounds and Blows all over his Body, both with Bludgeons and ſharp Weapons, and in particular one very dangerous Blow on the Bone of his left Leg with ſome Iron Weapon, which the Witneſs <hi>M'Govock</hi> will inform you was given him by one <hi>Clark,</hi> who was by Trade a Smith, who carried with him a Piece of Iron fitted to his Hand beſides a Bludgeon. He continued in this Situation for a ſhort Time, half a Minute, perhaps, or a Minute, almoſt deprived of his Senſes, but was rouſed to make one more Attempt to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Terror occaſioned by the Threat of inſtant Death. For he heard a Voice, which ſeemed to come from the oppoſite Corner of the Room, pronounce theſe Words, <hi>Damn him, let me come to him, and I'll diſpatch the Villain with my Sword.</hi> Upon this he looked up, and ſaw two Perſons, whom he conjectured to be Officers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards him from the oppoſite Corner of the Room, from which the Voice had ſeemed to come, one of whom was armed with Piſtols, and the other held a Small Sword in his Hand, which he pointed at Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Breaſt. This latter Perſon Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> believed to be the Priſoner at the Bar; but as his Eyes were then full of Blood from the many Wounds he had received, and his Mind in great Confuſion, he will not take upon him to ſwear it was he. But <hi>M'Govock</hi> the Accomplice, who was preſent on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will confirm the Suſpicion of Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and inform you that he ſaw Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> advance in that Manner, with his Sword drawn, towards Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and heard him pronounce thoſe Words. Whoever it was, you will obſerve, Gentlemen, that it proves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a Doubt that the Intention of the Aſſaſſins at this Time was to murder Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and not barely to disfigure him. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> reſolved, though quite unarmed, to do what he could to defend himſelf, and accordingly advanced towards theſe two Perſons and attacked them furiouſly with his Fiſts, and had the good Fortune to put aſide the drawn Sword with his left Hand without receiving a Thruſt from it. But he was immediately ſurrounded by the other Ruſſians. One of theſe Seized him by the Throat; and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> did the ſame to him, and at the ſame Time endeavoured to get near the Fire-Place in Order to take up the Shovel or Tongs for want of better Weapons. Upon this another of them took hold of his Right Thigh, and they both together endeavoured to lift him up and lay him on the Fire; the Terror of which cruel Death giving him new Strength and Spirit, he diſengaged himſelf from them both,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010958_0010_0F852F2D110577B8"/>
by ſuddenly putting his Hands againſt the Chimney-Piece, and puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from it with all his Force. But in the Inſtant of his doing this he received a deep and dangerous Wound from another of the Aſſaſſins on the left Side of the Head near the Crown, which felled him to the Ground; and ſoon after, while he lay helpleſs on the Floor, he received another moſt violent Blow on his Loins, which would have broke his Back (as no Doubt it was intended to do) if it had not been for a large Silver Buckle in the Waiſtband of his Breeches, which received the Blow and ſomewhat broke the Force of it, which was ſuch that the Buckle was very much bent by it. After this blow on the Back, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> continuing to lie helpleſs and almoſt motionleſs on the Floor, with his Face downwards, one of the Villains either knelt or ſat upon his right Side, and cut off a Part of his right Ear, and endeavoured at the ſame Time to cut his Throat: But finding this to be difficult by Reaſon of the Motions Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> made to prevent it by ſqueezing his Head down cloſe to his Shoulders, and putting up his left Hand (the little Finger of which was by this Means cut to the Bone) and being in a Hurry to get away, as the Neighbourhood began now to be alarmed, he made of with the Reſt of his Companions without effecting it, and carried off the Ear in Triumph. They thought however that they had left Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> either dead or in a dying Condition: For Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> heard one of them ſay, juſt before they went off, <hi>Damn him, he is dead,</hi> and another ſay, <hi>We have done for him.</hi> And with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indeed they might ſuppoſe ſo, ſince there are very few Men in the World that could have ſurvived ſuch a Number of Wounds and Blows as he had received, they being no fewer than Three Score, of which Eight were dreadful Wounds from ſharp Weapons, and Fifty-two were Confuſions.</p>
            <p>The Ear was immediately carried to Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his own Examination, where he ſays that two Men in diſguiſe and maſked, or with their Faces blacked, came into his Houſe about 9 o'Clock at Night, and throwing down a Piece of Fleſh upon the Table, ſaid, <hi>There's that Raſcal</hi> Walker's <hi>Ear,</hi> and then withdrew without ſaying a Word more. Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of General <hi>Burton</hi>'s Guard, and Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> the Surgeon's Mate of the Regiment, were at that Time with Mr. <hi>Tottenham.</hi> But it does not appear that they made any Attempt to ſtop the Men who brought them the Ear. As ſoon as they were gone, Mr.<hi>Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> wrapped the Ear up in a Piece of Paper, and ſent Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> with it to General <hi>Burton,</hi> who ſome Hours after ſent it to Mr. <hi>Lambe,</hi> the Juſtice of Peace before-mentioned, to be diſpoſed of as he ſhould think proper.</p>
            <p>Theſe Particulars of this Aſſault will all be proved to you by Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> himſelf without the Aſſiſtance of the Accomplice, whoſe Evidence however will confirm them and acquaint you with the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010958_0010_0F852F2D110577B8"/>
Names of the principal Perſons concerned in the Execution of them. He will tell you that the Blow on the Head that brought Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> to the Ground and quite ſubdued him, was given him by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant <hi>Meas</hi> with a Tomahawk, and that the Perſon who gave him the Blow on his Back when he was down was <hi>Thomas Donnelly,</hi> who afterwards boaſted of it in the Hearing of the Witneſs, and ſaid he thought he had broke his Back; and that Sergeant <hi>Rogers</hi> was the Man that cut off his Ear and carried it off.</p>
            <p>While ſome of theſe Ruſſians were employed in attacking Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in the Manner that has been related, others of them were employed in aſſaulting and driving away the reſt of the Family. Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> and Miſs <hi>Heard</hi> (who is ſince married to Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> who was ſitting at Supper with Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> and <hi>John Lilly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Clerk) eſcaped through the Kitchen into the Yard; where, not being purſued, they remained till the Affair was over. <hi>John Lilly</hi> was attacked by ſome of the Ruſſians, who gave him three deep Cuts on the Head with a Broad Sword, one of which knocked him down; but recovering himſelf pretty ſoon; he ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with one of the Fellows and puſhed him into a Window, and then ruſhed out at the Street Door through the Midſt of a Party of five or ſix more of the Ruffians that guarded it, in Order to alarm the Neighbours; to prevent which two of their Number purſued him, the reſt crying out to them, <hi>Damn him; ſhoot him; don't let him eſcape.</hi> But they did not overtake him. And <hi>William Fontaine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Servant, who was waiting upon him at Supper at the Time of this Aſſault, was purſued by one of them with a naked Broad-Sword in his Hand into the Gallery: There he eſcaped the Fury of his Purſuer by leaping down from the Gallery into the Yard through ſome of the broken Rails. The Stroke aimed at him by his Purſuer fell upon the Rails of the Gallery, and, as he believed, upon his Coat, as he afterwards found it had been cut.</p>
            <p>Such, Gentlemen, were the Circumſtances of this tragical Affair. Before I proceed to lay the Proofs of them before you, I will beg leave to mention a few Obſervations concerning the Nature of the Charges contained in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>The firſt Charge in the Indictment is for a well known and very high Offence at the Common Law, called a Burglary; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in breaking; and entering; a Man's Houſe in the Night time with an Intent to Commit a Felony. In the preſent Caſe it is charged that the Felony intended to be committed was a Murder, of which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, when you have heard the Proofs of the Particulars I have opened to you, you will have little Room to doubt. If this Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Ruſſians who aſſaulted Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is proved to your Satisfaction, together with the Preſence of the Priſoner at the Bar at this Tranſaction, you muſt find him guilty of this firſt Charge in the Indictment, which will render the Conſideration of the ſecond
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010958_0011_0F852F2E5C456958"/>
Charge of leſs Importance. But if it ſhould appear to you that the Priſoner was concerned in this Affair, but that there was no Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to murder Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> (though this is what I cannot well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) the Priſoner muſt be acquitted upon the firſt Charge, and found guilty only upon the Second.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Charge is founded upon the famous Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for preventing malicious Maiming and Mutilation, paſſed in the 22d. Year of CHARLES the II. and uſually known by the Name of the <hi>Coventry-Act,</hi> from the brave Sir <hi>John Coventry,</hi> whoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were the Occaſion of making it. Concerning this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament two very ſtrange Opinions have been entertained by ſome Perſons in this Province: The Firſt is, that the Act of Parliament is not in Force in this Province; the Second, that, ſuppoſing it to be in Force here, the Injury done to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> does not fall within it. I will endeavour to ſhew the Falſhood of both theſe Opinions.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid in Support of the Firſt of theſe Opinions, that this Law is not in Force in the other Provinces of <hi>North-America,</hi> and therefore ought not to be ſo here. This Concluſion is by no Means juſt. This Province has nothing to do with the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>North-America;</hi> nor indeed have thoſe other Provinces any Connection with each other. The Laws in each Province are different from thoſe in every other, as the different Acts of their Aſſemblies (which have exerciſed a Legiſlative Authority in them) and the different Dates of their original Settlement by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have contributed to vary them. And the Laws of all the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are, from the ſame Cauſes, different from the Laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> itſelf. The common Principle, upon which they all ſeem to be eſtabliſhed, I apprehend to be this; that every Set of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Planters, upon their firſt occupying and ſettling a new Colony, have carried with them the Laws of <hi>England</hi> then in Force at the Time of their leaving it to go to the new Colony: That this is the original Syſtem of Laws which they imported into the new Colony; and that this Syſtem was increaſed or varied either by new Acts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament paſſed ſince the Settlement of the Colony, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſs Words extending to it, or by the Acts of their own Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies under the Powers communicated to them by the Royal Charters. Thus the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in Force in the Reign of JAMES the I will be the Baſis of the Laws of a Colony that was firſt ſettled in his Reign: And in ſuch a Colony the <hi>Coventry-Act,</hi> which was made in the Reign of CHARLES II. will not of Neceſſity be a Part of the Law of the Colony, becauſe that Act does not expreſsly mention the Colonies: It will therefore be, or not be, a Part of the Laws of ſuch a Colony according as their Governor, Council, and Aſſembly ſhall have, or have not, adopted it, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that thoſe provincial Legiſlatures have a legal Power to make Laws of that high Importance. And thus it may happen that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010958_0011_0F852F2E5C456958"/>
ſome of the <hi>North-American</hi> Colonies this Law may be in Force, and not in others. Whether in Fact it is in Force in any of them, we need not here inquire. With Reſpect to this Province, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this excellent Act of Parliament is as much in Force here as Magna Charta, or the Petition of Right, or the Law of HENRY VIII. that takes the Benefit of the Clergy from Wilful murder of Malice aforethought, or any other the moſt uſeful or moſt reſpected Laws of <hi>England:</hi> For it is founded on the ſame Authority with them, namely, the Authority of the great Ordinance of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Country, General MURRAY and his Council, of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 17, 1764, by which they introduced into this Province, at one Stroke, the whole Syſtem of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> then in Force, and conſequently among the reſt this excellent Act of Parliament. That Ordinance inſtitutes the preſent Court of King's-Bench, or Supreme Court of Judicature, in which we are now aſſembled, and ordains that the Chief-Juſtice of the Province, who preſides in it, ſhall hear and determine all criminal and civil Cauſes agreeable to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which certainly muſt mean the Laws of <hi>England</hi> then in Being. And beſides, the Chief-Juſtice's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which you have heard read, runs in the ſame Style with this Ordinance, and directs him to hear and determine all Matters that come before him agreeably to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Province hereafter to be made. Either therefore this great Ordinance (upon which all the Proceedings of the Courts of Judicature in the Province, both civil and criminal, have been founded ever ſince the paſſing it) and likewiſe the Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the King's Commiſſion to the Chief-Juſtice, are void and of no Authority, and none of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are now in Force in this Province, but the <hi>French</hi> Laws that prevailed here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conqueſt are the only Laws that are really ſtill in Force (as they certainly would have been if this Ordinance had not been made) or it muſt be allowed that this excellent and beneficial Law, called the <hi>Coventry-Act,</hi> was introduced here by that Ordinance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the otter Laws of <hi>England</hi> in Being at the Time of paſſing it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Opinion, that the Injury done to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> does not come within the <hi>Coventry-Act,</hi> though not ſo intirely deſtitute of all Colour of Reaſon as the former Opinion, will yet, I believe, upon Examination appear to be ill-grounded. The <hi>Coventry-Act</hi> ſays, that, whoever ſhall on purpoſe, and of Malice-aforethought, cut or diſable the Tongue, put out an Eye, ſlit the Noſe, cut off a noſe or Lip, or cut off or diſable any Limb, or Member, of any Subject, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in ſo doing to maim or disfigure him, ſhall be guilty of Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without Benefit of Clergy. Theſe are the Words of the Act, in which it is certain the Cutting off an Ear is not mentioned. But Gentlemen, is it not plainly comprehended within the Word <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:010958_0012_0F852F2ECFB85678"/>
To what Purpoſe, after enumerating the ſeveral Features of the Face, does the Statute add the Words <hi>Limb or Member,</hi> unleſs it be to extend its Protection to all the other Organs of the Body by uſing the moſt general and comprehenſive Words the Language affords. Certainly by the Word <hi>Limb</hi> we muſt underſtand the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Parts of the human Body that are ſeperate from the Trunk, namely, the Arms and Legs, and perhaps the Hands and Feet, and by the Word <hi>Member</hi> the ſmaller Parts of it, ſuch as the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and particularly the Ears, as being more likely to be the Object of a malicious Intention to disfigure by Reaſon of the Reſemblance of ſuch an Injury to a diſgraceful Puniſhment in ſome Caſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the Law; which is the very Sort of Injury this Statute was intended to prevent.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, this Act of Parliament has always been reckoned a moſt excellent and ſalutary Law. It was paſſed in Oppoſition to the Court, as a Law of indeſpenſable Importance, in the peaceable Part of the Reign of King CEAELES the II. in Conſequence of a baſe piece of Cruelty committed upon Sir <hi>John Coventry,</hi> a Member of Parliament at that Time, by aſſaulting him in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, and ſlitting his Noſtrils. This was done, as it is generally ſuppoſed, at the Inſtigation of the Court, and probably of the King himſelf, in Revenge for ſome light Expreſſions thrown out By Sir <hi>John Coventry,</hi> in a Debate in Parliament, reflecting on the King's known Debauchery. Yet notwithſtanding the Provocation given by this perſonal Reflection on the King, the Parliament thought this barbarous Aſſault ſuch a flagrant Violation of all the Rules of Juſtice and Humanity, that they immediately prepared a Bill to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Perpetrators of it incapable of receiving the King's Pardon, and to make all future Offenders in the like Kind liable to be puniſhed with Death; and to this Bill the King gave the Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And it muſt be obſerved, that the Parliament that did this was not a factious ill-diſpoſed Parliament, that took a Pleaſure in propoſing Things that might be diſguſtful to the Court; but it was that Parliament which, of all that ever ſat in <hi>England,</hi> was moſt devoted to the Crown, and diſpoſed to concur in almoſt every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Propoſition that came from it—which had repeatedly ſupplied that King with large Sums of Money, notwithſtanding the continual Waſte and Miſapplication of them, and which, to gratify the Pride and Revenge of his firſt Miniſter, the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the reſt of the vindictive Royaliſts that had returned from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, had paſſed ſeveral penal Laws (which ſtill ſubſiſt) to proſecute the Proteſtant Diſſenters, had repealed the excellent Act obtained with ſo much Difficulty from CHARLES the I. for ſecuring to the Nation a Meeting of Parliament at leaſt once in three Years, and had almoſt eſtabliſhed paſſive Obedience by a Law. Yet even this compliant Parliament thought this a neceſſary Law—ſo neceſſary
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010958_0012_0F852F2ECFB85678"/>
as to inſiſt upon the paſſing it in Oppoſition to the Wiſhes of the Court. And ever ſince that Time it has met with the univerſal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and has received ſo much Countenance from the Judges, and been deemed ſo highly remedial and beneficial to the Subject, that in the only two Caſes that have happened upon it (one of which happened about a Year and a Half ago, and the other was the well known Caſe of <hi>Cook</hi> and <hi>Woodburn</hi>) it has met with a large and liberal Conſtruction. This I am ſure of, that neither of thoſe Caſes comes ſo clearly within the Spirit and Meaning of the <hi>Coventry-Act</hi> as the Caſe now before you does, which ſeems indeed to be the very Sort of Outrage that Act was deſigned to guard againſt: And it ſeems likewiſe to come within the Letter of it by giving the Word <hi>Member</hi> uſed in the Statute, that, I will not ſay, liberal, but natural Interpretation that has been already mentioned. But theſe Conſiderations will, as I apprehend, become of little Conſequence by the ſtrong Proofs by which, I doubt not, you will be convinced that at the Time of committing the Aſſault the Ruffians who committing it had an Intention to murder Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> I will now, Gentlemen, call the Witneſſes for the Crown in Support of this Indictment, without treſpaſſing any longer on your Patience.</p>

When I had received this Stroke I roſe up and paſſed through them to get into the Parlour, in order to paſs through it into my Bed-Room, where my Sword and Piſtols were, in order to make ſome Defence. I then received many Blows (but cannot tell how many) Paſſing through the Parlour Door, they following me in ſuch a Hurry, burſt open the Standing-door (they were Folding-doors) being ſo many of them. Coming to the further End of the Room, and ſtriving to get into my Bed-Room, two Men ſtood at the Chamber Door, and fore-cloſing me, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my opening it; beat me ſo much, and with ſuch a Number of Strokes. They cloſed me round with a Curtain, which I ſuppoſe prevented their Daſhing my Brains out. Was ſome Time in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but how many Blows I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there, cannot tell. But there was Fifty-two Contuſions or Bruiſes. I was ſwelled from the Shoulders to the Fingers End, there was not a free Part all over my Body. I received a Wound on my Leg, but don't know when. Whilſt in the Corner I had no Remembrance of being off my Feet; but ſeeing the Marks of my bloody Head againſt the Wall imagine I had loſt my Senſes; but remember hearing a Perſon ſay, <hi>let me come to him, I will diſpatch the Villain with my Sword;</hi> this was the firſt Thing I heard; and that rouſed me, and then was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſell my Life as dear as poſſible. Having ſeen Major <hi>Diſney,</hi> not knowing that I had ever diſobliged him, I expected Life, till I heard thoſe Words. Major <hi>Diſney</hi> had a Crape on his Face, and I diſcovered his Face through the Crape. Believe by the Figure that it was he that made uſe of thoſe Words, having ſeen him in the Room before I received ſo many Blows, but I cannot ſay poſitively that I knew his Voice, and do not recollect particularly what Dreſs he was in. Before I received any Blows, or any Thing in the outward Room, I was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced that was Major <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> A Perſon made at me and I parried the Blow with my left Hand and ſtruck at him. At the Inſtant the Words were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced two or three People came up to me with Swords levelled, but do not know whether any Body made a Paſs at me or not, but upon my taking Courage they retreated back: My Eyes were then full of Blood. They then cloſed; one collared me; I ſeized and held him, till another took me by the right Thigh, and ſtrove to lift me and ſet me on the Fire, I then turned myſelf round ſetting my Hands againſt the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (the Marks of my five bloody Fingers are on the Jambs of the Chimney) and tore the Side of my Shoe with the Force, and in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round I received a Stroke (which the Doctor ſaid was that of a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010958_0013_0F852F35E9804098"/>
Tomahawk) which fell'd me to the Ground, ſenſeleſs; how long I laid there cannot tell. The firſt Remembrance after that Stroke was a ſevere Blow on my Loins, whether by a Tomahawke or Bludgeon, I do not know, but feel it to this Day in bad weather. After that Blow a Man kneel'd, or ſat on my right Side, and I felt as if he was attempting to cut my Throat; I then moved my Head and Shoulders and put any Hand up, thinking it was his Thumb, but found a ſharp Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And he cut the little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my left Hand to the Bone; and it was a Fortnight before I knew that I had loſt my Ear. I thought they had aimed to cut my Throat, and thought (at the Time) they had done it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiving that Wound I heard a Voice from one of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſent ſay, <hi>the Villain's dead;</hi> another ſaid, <hi>damn him, we have done for him.</hi> A third Perſon ſpoke, but I could not rightly underſtand what he ſaid, but heard ſome Words; then having loſt my Senſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es can give no further Account; but when I did recollect found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Arms of <hi>William Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> my Servant, and one Mr. <hi>Piſtolet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The bloody Clothes, Shirt, and the Ear in Spirits were then brought into Court and expoſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Between Eight and Nine O'Clock I heard a great Noiſe. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Servant, after climbing over the Wall, knocked at our Back-Door, the Kitchen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did you do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> My Father opened the Door for the Servant, and was much ſurpriſed at his crying Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was aſſaſſinated; on which I and my Father went to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe to ſee what was the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but my Father did not enter Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, but I entered with the Servant, and found Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſtretched on the Floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> his Senſes when you entered?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He had not Time to anſwer. I heard ſome Cries in the Street, and feared that ſome of them were in or about the Houſe, and finding myſelf alone, took a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to go out of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you meet any of the Ruffians coming out of the Houſe.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you find the Houſe emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, only Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Family?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I only ſaw Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> was out in ſome of the back Houſes, as I heard ſome Cries.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did they ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They thought that ſome of the Perſons might ſtill be hid in ſome Part of the Houſe</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When you left the Houſe did you return a ſecond Time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I would have entered, but Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> at the Door hindered the People going in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did you obſerve in that little Time when you ſaw Mr. <hi>Walker?</hi>

            <p>"I Beg leave to trouble you with a few Obſervations upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that has been produced in the Priſoner's Defence. This Defence ſeems to conſiſts of two Parts, The one is an Attempt to prove that the Priſoner was engaged in Company at Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s Houſe, during the Time of the Aſſault upon Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and conſequently that he could not be preſent at it; the other is an Endeavour to diſcredit the Witneſs <hi>Magovock,</hi> by ſuggeſting that there are Contradictions in his Evidence, and making him paſs for a Man of a bad general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.—This, I think, is the Plan and Subſtance of the Defence.</p>
            <p>"As to the firſt Part of this Defence, the Preſence of the Priſoner, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> any Weight in Oppoſition to a poſitive Charge, ſupported by witneſſes of Credit: And this for a very obvious Reaſon, becauſe it the eaſieſt of any Sort of Evidence to be contrived by the Friends of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010958_0028_0F852F424F1F5A68"/>
the Priſoner in order to ſave him, if they are Perſons, as too often is the Caſe, whoſe Attachment to his Welfare will lead them to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Bounds of Truth in his Behalf. To make this Kind of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any Degree ſatisfactory, it is neceſſary that ſeveral ſtrong Circumſtances ſhould concur. The Witneſſes, who teſtify the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Priſoner at another Place at the Time of the Commiſſion of the Crime, ought to be Perſons of undoubted Credit, free from any Connections with the Priſoner (whether of Kindred, or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or Intereſt of any Kind) that may in the lead tend to biaſs them in his Favour; the Place at which they ſaw him ought to be far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from that where the Crime was committed, ſo far diſtant that it ſhould be impoſſible, or next to impoſſible, for a Man to go from the one Place to the other in the Time between the Commiſſion of the Crime and his being ſeen at the other place: This Place ought likewiſe to be a public Place, where People who have no perſonal Acquaintance with each other meet by Accident, and the Perſons who atteſt the having ſeen him there ſhould be Perſons unconnected and unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with each other, as well as with the Priſoner. This would be a Proof of an Alibi that would deſerve conſiderable Regard. Thus, if Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> had been proved to be at <hi>Quebec,</hi> which is 180 Miles diſtant from <hi>Montreal,</hi> at the Time of committing this Aſſault, or within a few Hours, or half a Day, of that Time—and this, not by one or two Friends, who ſhould ſay that they ſaw him there that Day in private, but by Witneſſes that had no particular Acquaintance with him, and who ſhould teſtify that they ſaw him at ſome public Place there, as, for Example, on the Parade exerciſing the Soldiers, or on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, or at Dinner with a numerous Company at the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Table; and if the Witneſſes who had ſworn this ſhould likewiſe tell you to what Cauſe or particular Circumſtances it was owing that they could remember their having ſeen him there on the Day of this Aſſault, when they, probably, are not able to recollect on what Day they ſaw him immediately before, or immediately after, it— Such a Teſtimony would really be important, and might perhaps deſerve to be ſet in Oppoſition to the poſitive Evidence of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in Support of the Charge.—But how different from this is the Alibi Evidence that you have heard! Three Ladies, and Dr. <hi>Robertſon,</hi> have told you that Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> ſpent the Afternoon and Evening with them a Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Montreal,</hi> not two Hundred Yards diſtant from Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe.

The other Lady, Mrs. <hi>Landrieves,</hi> is a very intimate Acquaintance and Friend of Capt. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s. And Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi> has given ſtrong Proofs of his eager De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to get both this and all the other Priſoners for this Affair diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and has gone much greater Lengths for this Purpoſe than the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010958_0028_0F852F424F1F5A68"/>
mere Love of Juſtice and a Concern for accuſed Perſons, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be innocent, uſually carries Men to: He has, ſince the Chief-Juſtice has been in the Town holding the Seſſions of the Supreme-Court, been buſily exerciſing his Office of a Juſtice of Peace with Reſpect to this Affair, by taking Depoſitions relating to it. I leave it to him to explain, or to you to conjecture, whether he could have any other Deſign in doing ſo, than to influence, in a clandeſtine Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Minds of Men in Favour of theſe Priſoners, by ſetting up a Parcel of private Evidences taken thus before him, in Oppoſition both to that which ſhould be offered to the Grand-Jury, and to that which ſhould be given here publickly in Court before you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in Support of the Proſecution. One of the Perſons whom he has thus examined, has ſince made Oath before the Chief-Juſtice, in my Preſence, that he had been thus examined, upon Oath, by this very Zealous Magiſtrate. Such, Gentlemen, are the Witneſſes that are brought to ſupport this Alibi.</p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, theſe Witneſſes have not told to you to what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumſtance it is owing that they remember ſo exactly the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they ſpent their Time on the 6th of <hi>December,</hi> 1764; without which it muſt needs appear ſtrange that they ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it ſo exactly. Can they tell where and in what Company, and in what Manner they ſpent their Time on the 6th of <hi>December,</hi> 1765, or even on the 6th of laſt <hi>December,</hi> though only three Months paſt? —Or can you, Gentlemen, thoſe of you that were then in <hi>Montreal,</hi> remember diſtinctly where and how you ſpent your Afternoon and Evening on that very ſame 6th of <hi>December,</hi> 1764? If you cannot, is it not ſomewhat ſurpriſing that theſe Witneſſes ſhould be able to do it ſo exactly, without ſome particular Circumſtance to induce them to take Notice at the Time, or ſoon after, of the Manner in which they ſpent that Day? This Circumſtance I ſhould have been glad to be informed of.—Was it that they ſuſpected that Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> or Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> or Captain <hi>Campbell,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Simon Evans,</hi> or any other Perſon in that Company at Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s, would ever be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed or queſtioned about this Aſſault upon Mr. <hi>Walker?</hi>— Such an early Suſpicion, Gentlemen, would, in my Opinion, have been no ſmall Preſumption that ſome of that Company were guilty of it.—What other Conjecture to form concerning the Cauſe of their remembering ſo well the Manner and Company in which they ſpent that Day I know not.—'Tis certain they have help'd us to no other.</p>
            <p>'But Gentlemen, other Things in their Evidence afford Matter of Surpriſe. They not only remember of what Perſons the Company conſiſted, and how they ſpent their Time, but declare that they are confident that Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> was preſent in the Company during the whole Time that each of themſelves was preſent there, though that Time was near five Hours.</p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, this bold Aſſertion deſerves to be examined, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010958_0029_0F852F45E2F5D828"/>
that you may fully underſtand it, and aſſign to it its proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Credit, which I believe you will judge to be but little. It may be underſtood in two different Senſes: It may mean either that theſe Witneſſes in their Eyes continually fixed upon Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> ſo that he never was out of their Sight and Obſervation during the whole five hours, which would indeed be a poſitive Aſſertion abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Charge; or it may mean that they did not indeed keep the Priſoner continually in their Sight during that whole Time, but only that they ſaw him there at ſeveral different Times during their being together, and that they did not miſs him or obſerve that he quitted the Company during that whole Time; and therefore that they, by Inference, conclude that he did not quit it, becauſe, if he had done ſo, they think it highly probable that they muſt have taken Notice of it.—'Tis in this latter Senſe the Evidence of theſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, muſt be taken: The other is too bold, or rather deſperate, a Kind of Evidence for any People to deliver in a Court of Juſtice with any Expectation of being believed: And accordingly you muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Gentlemen, that when the firſt Witneſs was aſked whether ſhe had her Eyes fixt continually upon Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> during the whole Time (which ſhe muſt have ſaid if ſhe had meant poſitively to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he was there the whole Time) ſhe readily anſwered that ſhe did not keep her Eyes thus continually fixed upon him, but that ſhe ſaw him there very often, and never obſerved that he left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which ſhe ſays ſhe could not but have done if he had ever left them, becauſe the Company was but ſmall: And the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes anſwered in the ſame Manner. Now this is not a poſitive Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion that Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> was there all the Time: It is only a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Propoſition, or a Declaration that they did not obſerve him to leave the Company in all that Time, which is a very different Thing. For, Gentlemen. This Declaration, that they never obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him leave the Company, may be true, and yet the Inference they would draw from it, that he never left it, may not be ſo: He may have left the Company more than once, and they not have obſerved it, eſpecially for ſo ſmall a Time as five or ſix Minutes, which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his attending a Tranſaction that happened only at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Two Hundred Yards from the Place where the Company was aſſembled, And therefore, Gentlemen, the Evidence of theſe Witneſſes, ſuppoſing it to be ſtrictly true, does not poſitively prove the Priſoner's Alibi, but only gives Room for a probable Inference in Support of it, which being but a Preſumption, ought not to be ſet in Oppoſition to the poſitive Teſtimony of three Witneſſes in Support of the Charge againſt him.</p>
            <p>'But, Gentlemen, we may go ſtill further. This Evidence of the Priſoner's Alibi is not even a <hi>very ſtrong</hi> Preſumption. For where is the great Improbability of a Perſon's abſenting himſelf once or twice from a Company of eleven Perſons (which was the Number
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010958_0029_0F852F45E2F5D828"/>
aſſembled at Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s) for a ſhort ſpace of Time, ſuch as five or ten Minutes, without being obſerved by the other Perſons in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that too with ſuch particular Attention that they ſhall be able to recollect it a long Time after?—Such a Want of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Motions of the reſt of the Company, as not to recollect ſuch little Abſences of ſome one of them, is ſurely by no Means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common. Gentlemen, I appeal to yourſelves, whether when you happen to be in a Company of a Dozen People for five Hours together, who are met together for the Sake of Mirth and Amuſement, you are apt to watch each Perſon in the Company ſo very carefully that you can falſely declare afterwards, upon Oath, which of them abſented himſelf from the Company for a little While, and which did not, and can be ſure that during the whole Time ſuch or ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon of the Company never left it, even for the Space of five or ten Minutes? Gentlemen, is it your Cuſtom to watch your Company ſo narrowly: I believe I may ſay that it is not.—And in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> preſent Caſe is not the Difficulty of obſerving and remembering <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Particulars increaſed by the Variety of Paſtimes with which this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany amuſed themſelves?—They were not all the while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Parties at Cards, or in dancing, in which Caſe they might perhaps obſerve what became of their Partners and the others engaged at play with them: But they ſpent Part of the Time in making Syrup, Part of it in dancing, Part of it drinking Tea, and Part of it, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (which is worthy your Attention) in playing at Blind-man's-buff. Can they be ſuppoſed, during all thoſe different Amuſements to have been ſo very watchful of each other? They ſhould at leaſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thoſe parts of the Time they were playing at Blind-man's-buff, during which they acted the part of the blind-Man.</p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, I could not but admire the Rapidity and the Poſitiveneſs with which ſome of theſe Witneſſes delivered their Evidence, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the firſt Witneſs. The Anſwer was ready almoſt before the Queſtion was pronounced. I believe ſhe never repeated her Creed or her Catechiſm more readily or nimbly. She told you the exact Times at which each different Amuſement began, as readily and preciſely as if ſhe had been reading an Account of them from Minutes of that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon's Entertainment taken down at the Time. One Thing only eſcaped her uncommon Memory, till ſhe was induced to reccollect it, by a poſitive Queſtion put to her concerning it. This was that ſhe herſelf was abſent from the Company for Part of the Time this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany has been ſaid to continue together. Gentlemen, this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhe forgot to tell you in her original Account: it was drawn from her in the Croſs-examination. But when ſhe did declare it, I make no Doubt, Gentlemen, that you obſerved the great Importance of it. Gentlemen, it tends to nothing leſs than to make her Evidence and that of Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> (who was abſent with her for that little Time) I ſay, it tends to nothing leſs than to make the Evidence of both theſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010958_0030_0F852F4693686A10"/>
Witneſſes (admitting it all to be ſtrictly true) of little or no Effect in ſupporting the Priſoner's Alibi. For obſerve only the Time of this Abſence. This Witneſs and Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> have both of them told you that it happend about three Quarters of an Hour after Eight o'Clock, that is, as near as can be judged, at the very Time of the Aſſault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> Juſt at this critical Time they left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and went to Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi>'s Houſe for a Table-Cloth, leaving the Company employed in no common Amuſement, ſuch as Cards or Dancing, that might require the Preſence of them all, but fitting round the Stove till the Supper ſhould be ready: They ſtaid away ſome little Time, which they think was about five Minutes, and then returned to Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s. Gentlemen, this Time of their Abſence may not improbably be a good deal more than five Minutes—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Quarter of an Hour, or twenty Minutes. Such Miſtakes in the Meaſure of Time happen every Day, where People judge of it without looking at a Watch, as theſe Ladies have declared that they did.</p>
            <p>'In this ſmall Space of Time it was poſſible, for aught that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Evidence of theſe two Ladies, for Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> to have have quitted the Company and ſtept Home to his Lodging, and, there making the little Alteration in his Dreſs which was neceſſary to diſguiſe him, to have gone into Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, and been preſent for two or three Minutes during the Aſſault upon him, to overlook and encourage the Perſons employed in it. The change of Dreſs for this Purpoſe would take up a very ſhort Time. It was only throwing off his Coat, and flipping on a <hi>Canadian</hi> Gown inſtead of it, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Crape over his Face and a cut-round Hat upon his Head with the Crape tucked in under it. This was the only Change made in his Dreſs from that in which he appeared at Dr, <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s: For the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's Witneſſes have told you that he was that Day dreſſed in Scarlet and Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> obſerved that he had a red Waiſtcoat and red Breeches under his <hi>Canadian</hi> Gown.</p>
            <p>'This ſlight Change of his Dreſs he might eaſily make, and be preſent at Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, for a few Minutes, then change his Dreſs again and return to Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s, in the Compaſs of a very ſmall Time. We may therefore conſider the Evidence of thoſe two Ladies as contributing very little to ſupport the Priſoner's Alibi. It it muſt therefore reſt principally upon the Teſtimony of Mrs. <hi>Campbell,</hi> a Lady that is the Wife of one, and the Daughter of another of the Priſoner's now in Cuſtody for this Aſſault, and that of the very friendly Dr. <hi>Robertſon,</hi> whoſe Zeal in the Defence of theſe Gentlemen has been ſo great as to lead him to take Depoſitions concerning this Affair, even ſince the Chief-Juſtice has been here in Town to hold this Seſſion.</p>
            <p>'Such, Gentlemen, is the Alibi to which you are deſired to give Credit: An Alibi declaring the Priſoner to have been at a Place not Two Hundred Yards diſtant from the Scene of the Offence. Pretended to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010958_0030_0F852F4693686A10"/>
be proved by four Witneſſes, but in Truth not poſitively proved by any one of them, (none of them ſwearing that they had the Priſoner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in Sight during the whole Time they were together) but grounded upon a Preſumption only, and not a very ſtrong one, that, if he had quitted the Room, though for a very ſmall Space of Time, as five or ten Minutes, during any Part of the five Fours they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they muſt have taken Notice of it.—And even this poor Preſumption is found, upon a Croſs-Examination, to be ſupported by only two of theſe Witneſſes, the other two having confeſſed that they themſelves were abſent from the Company for a little Time, juſt at the critical Juncture of the Commiſſion of the Crime—And this Proof, imperfect as it is, made by Witneſſes under a ſtrong and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Biaſs in the Priſoner's Favour. This wretched Alibi you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to believe in oppoſition to the poſitive Teſtimony of three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, two of whom are Perſons of unblemiſhed Character, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from Prejudice againſt the Priſoner, and the third was an Accomplice in the Fact. You cannot, Gentlemen, remain long in Doubt which of theſe two Teſtimonies to prefer.</p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, I have ſaid that Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> are perfectly free from Prejudice againſt the Priſoner. I will explain what I mean by that Aſſertion. It cannot be pretended that they are free from Reſentment againſt the Priſoner: They muſt be exempt from human Paſſions if they were: But their Reſentment ariſes merely from this very Injury with which he is now charged, and from their own certain Knowledge of his concern in it. That, and the Priſoner's Declaration before-hand, That he would be revenged upon Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> for his Ill-treatment of Captain <hi>Payne,</hi> are the only Grounds that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has for any Reſentment againſt Captain <hi>Diſney.</hi> And ſuch a Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be called a Prejudice againſt Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> or in any Degree affect the Credibility of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Evidence or this Occaſion, becauſe the very Exiſtence of ſuch a Reſentment ſuppoſes neceſſarily that of the Crime with which the Priſoner ſtands charged as the Cauſe and Ground of it. It might indeed affect Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Evidence on any other Proſecution againſt Captain <hi>Diſney,</hi> either for an Injury done to another Man, or for another Injury done to himſelf: But in the preſent Caſe it cannot have any ſuch Effect. Till this unhappy Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or a very little Time before it, Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> had lived upon good Terms with each other. Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> himſelf has informed you that he did ſo: He has declared that he always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a Reſpect for Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> (that, I think, was his Expreſſion) and expreſſed it in Coverſation whenever he had Occaſion to ſpeak of him: And he has called a Witneſs to prove that he did ſo. And Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has told you that he truſted ſo much to the Profeſſions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Captain <hi>Diſney</hi> had often made him, and was ſo conſcious in his own Mind of his never having given him any Cauſe of Offence, that, when he diſtinguiſhed him among the diſguiſed Ruffians that
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010958_0031_0F852F4799BE6888"/>
were come to aſſaut him, he was encouraged by the Sight of him to hope that his Life was not in Danger, and that the Miſchief intended him was only a ſevere Beating, or Wounding, or ſomething ſhort of Death, in Revenge for the imaginary Inſult upon Captain <hi>Payne,</hi> till he was forced to think otherwiſe by thoſe dreadful and murderous Words, pronounced from the oppoſite Corner of the Room by the Man who advanced againſt him with a drawn Sword, <hi>Damn him, let me come to him, and I'll diſpatch him with my Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, this Evidence of Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> appears to me to be ſo weighty, that' if the Alibi Defence of the Priſoner had been ſupported by poſitive Evidence abſolutely inconſiſtent with the Charge —if not two only, but all the four Witneſſes had poſitively ſworn, that at eight o'Clock exactly they had ſat down to play at Whi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with the Priſoner, and that they had never left the Table till the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came from General <hi>Burton</hi> with the News of the Outrage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> but had been all the While either at the Table playing themſelves, or near it, looking on upon thoſe who did play, and that the Priſoner had never cut out, but had been one of the Players during the whole of that Time, ſo that he muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before their Eyes.—and if the Perſons who teſtified this had not been the intimate Friends of the Priſoner, or the Wives and Daughters of the other Priſoners, but Perſons entirely unconnected, and very little acquainted, with them—I ſay, Gentlemen, that is the alibi Defence of the Priſoner had been ſupported by ſuch a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Teſtimony inſtead of the imperfect and precarious Evidence which you have heard, yet ſtill the Evidence in Support of the Charge would deſerve to be preferred to it.—This may, at firſt Sight, ſeem a harſh Poſition: But it will be found upon Examination to be built upon a Principle of Candour and Charity, which directs us to think as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable of human Nature as the Circumſtances of the Caſe will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us. Gentlemen, it would be a bad Dilemma for you to be reduced to, if you were really under a Neceſſity of diſbelieving the Witneſſes on one Side or other, and conſequently of ſuppoſing thoſe on one of the Sides to be guilty of wilful Perjury. But if you were reduced to this Dilemma, to which Side would a moderately good Opinion of human induce you to impute the Perjury? To thoſe who give Evidence to take away the Priſoner's life or to thoſe who give Evidence to ſave it? Is it not more natural that Men ſhould commit Perjury to reſcue a Man from Danger than in order to effect his Deſtruction? In the former Caſe they may think perhaps that the Benevolence of the Intention with which they commit this Crime may ſomewhat extenuate the Guilt of it; in the latter Caſe they muſt feel that the Guilt of the Perjury is aggravated an Hundred-fold by the Wickedneſs of the Intention with with it is committed. The former is a Crime which Men of looſe Principles may be ſuppoſed capable of committing, and which indeed is very frequently committed; the latter is a Crime too black for even
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010958_0031_0F852F4799BE6888"/>
wicked Men, and ſeldom or never known to have been practiſed.— But, Gentlemen, you are fortunately not reduced to this Dilemma, ſince the Evidence advanced in the Priſoner's Favour has been ſhewn to be not irreconcileable with the Evidence in ſupport of the Charge. The Priſoner may have ſpent that Evening in the Company of his three fair Witneſſes, and yet have been abſent for a ſhort Time to partake in the Revenge taken againſt Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> without being miſſed by them.</p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, that the Priſoner ſpent that Evening either in the Company at Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s, or in ſome other numerous Company. I think is highly probable. I ſhould have imagined he had done ſo if he had produced no Witneſſes to prove it: For it is but a reaſonable Precaution for any Man to take, who intends to be concerned in any dangerous Tranſaction, for which he may afterwards come to be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. He thereby furniſhes himſelf with a ready Defence againſt any Accuſation of having been engaged in it that happens to be made in a looſe and general Manner, without narrowly enquiring into Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. How can it be ſuppoſed, will he ſay, that I was preſent at ſuch a Tranſaction, when ſuch and ſuch Perſons can teſtify that much about the Time at which it happened, or at leaſt not above half an Hour or an Hour, before or after it, I was in their Company, employed in Dancing or ſome other ſuch innocent Amuſement." ſuch a Defence will do very well to anſwer the Suſpicions and Hints thrown out againſt him in common Converſation, and will paſs with many People for a full Juſtification; and, perhaps, with a little Improvement (if the Witneſſes are well diſpoſed towards the Priſoner) by varying the Time and other Circumſtances in the Manner requiſite, it may meet with Credit even in a Court of Juſtice; whereas, if he had ſpent his Time at Home in a ſolitary Manner till the Time of committing the Crime, he could have nothing of this Kind to ſet up in Oppoſition to the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony in ſupport of the Charge againſt him.</p>
            <p>'Theſe, Gentlemen, are the Obſervations I thought it neceſſary to offer to you concerning this boaſted Evidence of the Priſoner's Alibi, which makes the principal Part of his Defence. I am ſenſible they have taken up too much of your Time; but I knew not how to make them ſhorter. I hope therefore you will excuſe this Prolixity, and at the ſame Time will further indulge me with leave to make a few Remarks on the ſecond Part of the Priſoner's Defence, which conſiſts in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcredit the Witneſs <hi>Magovock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, it is of no great Conſequence in the preſent Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what Degree of Credit this Witneſs deſerves, as the Change is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by two Witneſſes of indiſputable Credit without him. However, I can ſee no Reaſon for treating his Evidence with the Contempt which the Gentlemen of Council with the Priſoner have affected to ſhew for it. He certainly is not a good Man: No Body has pretended that he was ſo. He owns that he was an Accomplice in this wicked Action, which no good Man could be concerned in: And Lieutenant <hi>Ma Kay</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:010958_0032_0F852F484EB32F00"/>
has ſaid, that, when he knew him in the Army, he was ſometimes guilty of Theft, and has been puniſhed for it by a Court Martial. I readily believe this. But does this render what he ſays as a Witneſs in a Court Juſtice of no Weight or Conſequence? Does it follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Soldier has been guilty of Theft, a Crime too common amongſt them, that therefore he will be guilty of the great and deliberate Crime (one of the moſt heinous that can be committed) of ſwearing falſely in a Court of Juſtice to take away another Man's Life? Surely it does not: And the Law, Gentlemen, in the Caſe of Accomplices deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines that it does not: For it allows their Evidence to be received againſt their Fellow-criminals, nay, to be alone the Ground of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, without any other poſitive Teſtimony, provided there is ſome concomitant Evidence ariſing from Circumſtances to make it probable. Numbers of People have been condemned upon ſuch Evidence, and with the general Approbation of all the World: And there are now in <hi>Quebec</hi> Goal two Soldier under Sentence of Death, for breaking open Mr <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s Cellar in the Night Time, and ſtealing a Caſk of Wine from it, who were convicted upon the ſingle Teſtimony of an Accomplice with them in the Fact, together with a Proof by Mr. <hi>Woolſey</hi> and his Clerk that the Cellar had been broke open by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body or other and the Wine taken away. How much more then does ſuch a Teſtimony deſerve to be regarded when it does not ſtand ſingle, but is made uſe of only to confirm the poſitive Teſtimony of two other Witneſſes of indiſputable Credit, which is the Caſe with the Evidence of this Witneſs on the preſent Proſecution.</p>
            <p>'Gentlemen, the Credibility of a Witneſſes Teſtimony does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend merely upon the Goodneſs of his Character. The Probility of the Story he relates, the Agreement of it with other well-known Facts, the Minuteneſs and Particularity of the Circumſtances he mentions; and his Illiterateneſs and Ignorance and utter Incapacity to invent them, if he was wicked enough to endeavour to do ſo, may make his Evidence deſerve to be believed by thoſe who have no Oppinion of his Virtue. Theſe, I preſume, are ſome of the Grounds upon which the Law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Evidence of Accomplices, and allows it to have conſiderable Weight: And theſe are the Grounds upon which the Evidence of this Witneſs <hi>Magovock</hi> deſerves to be regarded. Gentlemen, can you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Witneſs, who can neither write nor read,—I ſay, can you ſuppoſe him capable of inventing ſo long and particular a Story as he has related to you, and which is attended with ſome Circumſtances ſo uncommon and ſurpriſing? Is it likely that he ſhould think of ſo remarkable a Circumſtance as that of the Conſultation at Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi>'s Houſe on the Monday preceding the Aſſault, in which the Priſoner at the Bar adminiſtred to him the Oath of Secrecy, unleſs theſe Things had really happened? Would he have refuſed to deliver his whole Evidence about this Matter at once in his firſt Depoſition, if he had not been under the Reſtraint of ſuch an Oath? Is there any Reaſon to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010958_0032_0F852F484EB32F00"/>
ſuppoſe that he is ſo refined and ingenious a Villain, as to able to invent ſuch a Story about an Oath of Secrecy, merely to make himſelf paſs for a Man of ſome Conſcience, and give Credit to the reſt of his Evidence? I cannot, for my Part, have either ſo bad an Opinion of his Heart, or ſo good an one of his Underſtanding, as to ſuppoſe this: His Teſtimony therefore deſerves the ſame Degree of Credit as is uſually given to the Evidence of Accomplices, notwithſtanding the Endeavours that have been uſed to aſperſe his general Character. It remains that I make a few Remarks upon the Evidence he has delivered at this Trial, and the Inconſiſtencies which the Gentlemen of Counſel for the Priſoner have obſerved between the different Parts of it, and between ſome Parts of it and the Evidence of ſome of the other Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>'One of theſe Contradictions is, that he ſaid in his Croſs-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that he carried the Intelligence concerning the Progreſs of the Aſſault upon Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> to Captain <hi>Payne</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi> at Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe, whereas he had before ſaid that Captain <hi>Payne</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham</hi> were, during that Aſſault, ſtanding in the Street in which Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe is ſituated, near the Houſe of one <hi>Bellair,</hi> a Baker, which is almoſt directly over-againſt Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s Houſe. Gentlemen, I doubt not you muſt have obſerved that this Miſtake was never made by the Witneſs, but by the Counſel that croſs-examined him, who, throughout the whole Croſs-examination, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to confound the Witneſs and bewilder his Underſtanding, by aſking him a Variety of Queſtions unconnected with each other and without any Method or Regard to the Order of Time, with a View to draw him in to make ſudden Anſwers that might not be confident with each other. But in this he was diſappointed by the Steadineſs and Clearneſs with which the Witneſs gave his Anſwers to all the Queſtions that were put to him. With Reſpect to the pretended Contradiction now under Conſideration, the Witneſs's Evidence was really as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: The Priſoner's Counſel had aſked him whether he had ſeen Captain <hi>Payne</hi> before he went into Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, to commit the Aſſault; to which the Witneſs anſwered that he had ſeen him before at Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe, and that they had come out from thence at the ſame Time. After another Queſtion or two, the Counſel aſks him where it was he carried the Intelligence concerning the Progreſs of the Aſſault to Captain <hi>Payne</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham;</hi> and the Witneſs anſwers, in the Street near Mr. <hi>Bellair</hi>'s Houſe, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt over-againſt Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s. Thereupon the Counſel pretends that this is inconſiſtent with his former Anſwer; for that in that he had declared that he had carried the Intelligence concerning the Aſſault to Captain <hi>Payne</hi> at Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe. But the Witneſs immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately anſwered, that the Counſel had greatly miſtaken him; for that he had never ſaid any ſuch Thing, but only that he had ſeen Captain <hi>Payne</hi> before at Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe, and that Captain <hi>Payne</hi> had ſet out with them from that Houſe: And this, Gentlemen, I dare ſay

you obſerved to have been really his Evidence. Indeed this is a Mi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> concerning its Progreſs. In Truth that Part of Mr. <hi>Waelker</hi>'s Street which was near Mr. <hi>Bellair</hi>'s Houſe, and, within a Dozen Yards of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s, was the Spot he all along mentioned as the Place <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which he delivered his Intelligence to Captain <hi>Payne</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Tottenham,</hi> both in his Anſwers to the Queſtions put to him by the Court and in his Croſs-Examination by the Priſoner's Counſel.</p>
            <p>'The next Contradiction imputed to him is, a Miſtake in Point of Time. He ſaid it was about eight o'Clock, or a little before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Ruffians left Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe to go to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s to make the Aſſault, and that it was near nine o'Clock, but not quite nine when the whole Affair was over: And yet he ſays in another Part of his Evidence that he believes the Aſſault did not take up above a Quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of an Hour. Gentlemen, I confeſs there is this Inaccuracy in the Witneſs's Evidence, and am deſirous that it ſhould have its due Weight with you in the Priſoner's Favour. But can this much avail him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> —Can the Miſtake of a poor common Soldier concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Time of a Tranſaction he relates, when he judged of it only by gueſs and without either Watch or Clock, impeach the Credibility of his Teſtimony concerning the Tranſaction itſelf, when that Teſtimony is rational and conſiſtent with itſelf in every other Particular? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gentlemen, it cannot. Miſtakes of half an Hour, or even a whole Hour, are frequently made by Men who obſerve Time much more carefully than ſuch Perſons as the Witneſs can be ſuppoſed to do; and indeed they hardly deſerve to be called Miſtakes, becauſe the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Clocks is ſufficient to account for them. This ſeems to me to ſo uſual and natural, that, in my Apprehenſion, no Evidence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concerning the preciſe Time of any Action deſerves to be much regarded, though delivered by the moſt reſpectable Witneſs, unleſs the Perſon who delivers it declares at the ſame Time that he looked at a Clock or a Watch at the Time the Action happened, or immediately before or after, or elſe took particular Notice that it happened at the Time with ſome other regular Tranſaction that is always carried on at a fixt Hour, ſuch as the ringing of the Bell of a Church or Convent for Morning or Evening Prayers, or ſome other ſuch remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. Without ſome ſuch Circumſtance I can eaſily imagine that the moſt honeſt and judicious Perſon in the World may miſtake
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010958_0033_0F852F4F98983420"/>
a full Hour in the Time of any Tranſaction he was preſent at, and ſhould think it a mere chance if he was exact. In the preſent Caſe the Witneſs ſaid he believed it was a little before eight when they ſet out from Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe to commit the Aſſault: in which, I am perſuaded he miſtook the Time by more than half an Hour, for that it muſt really have been more than half an Hour after eight; at leaſt by Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Clock; becauſe Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> and the Clerk and Servant, who have been examined in ſupport of the Proſecution, fix the Time of the Aſſault pretty exactly. And where now is the great Wonder that a common Soldier, who had no Watch, and whoſe Mind was flurried with the thoughts of a dangerous Expedition he was going to be concerned in, and with ſome ſtrong Liquor he had taken to prepare himſelf for it ſhould think it was only eight o'Clock when in Truth it was half an Hour or forty Minutes after?—I ſay, what is there to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at in ſuch a Miſtake? More eſpecially when we conſider that poſſibly the Clock at Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe, if there was one there, or, if there was not, the Clocks in his Neighbourhood, by which he and his Family had judged of the Courſe of Time during that Day, might very well be forty Minutes flower than Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi>'s. Surely it deſerves very little Conſideration. Thoſe triffling Inaccuracies, which may be ſo eaſily accounted for, ſeem to me on the Contrary to add Strength to the Evidence of a Witneſs rather than to render it leſs cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, ſince they ſhew that the Witneſs anſwers fairly and honeſtly what his Memory ſuggeſts to him, without having artfully framed a regular Story with every Circumſtance in exact and perfect Order, that he might guard againſt the Poſſibility of a Surpriſe.</p>
            <p>'The next Contradiction inſiſted on by the Counſel for the Priſoner is that concerning the Priſoner's Dreſs. Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> has ſaid that he was dreſſed in a <hi>Canadian</hi> Gown, and the Witneſs <hi>Magovock</hi> has ſaid that he was dreſſed in a Blanket Coat. Gentlemen, there is a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency between theſe Teſtimonies. But, I believe, you will hardly think it of much Importance. It is eaſy for <hi>Magovock</hi> to have miſtaken the Dreſs of Major <hi>Diſney</hi> amongſt the Number of Perſons he ſaw on that Occaſion, and yet to be very certain of his Perſon; as the Perſon of a Man makes a much ſtronger Impreſſion upon the Mind and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Spectator than his Dreſs. And it muſt be remembered that <hi>Macgovoek</hi> has told you that Major <hi>Diſney</hi> was not one of the Party that dreſſed themſelves at Sergeant <hi>Mees</hi>'s Houſe, and ſet out from thence to go to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s (in which Caſe it might perhaps be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Macgovock</hi> ſhould remember his Dreſs exactly) but was one of the additional Party that came in to aſſiſt and protect the former, whoſe ſeveral Dreſſes it can hardly be ſuppoſed that he can recollect with perfect Exactneſs.</p>
            <p>'But, Gentlemen, the main Foundation of this Objection to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govock</hi>'s Teſtimony is by no Means favourable to the Priſoner, as will appear if we conſider it a little further. The Objection I take to be as follows: Macgovock's <hi>Evidence concerning Major</hi> Diſney<hi>'s Dreſs is
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010958_0034_0F852F504C238370"/>
cntrary to Mrs.</hi> Walker<hi>'s, and therefore falſe; and conſequently the reſt of his Evidence is likewiſe either falſe or doubtful.</hi> What then, is it admitted that Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Evidence concerning the Priſoner's Dreſs on that Occaſion is true? Nothing More is wanted on the Part of the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The Priſoner was preſent at the Aſſault in a <hi>Canadian</hi> Gown according to Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Evidence; and <hi>Macgovock</hi> has been Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his Dreſs, and deſerves therefore no Credit in any other Part of his Teſtimony. Let then his whole Evidence be ſet aſide as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good for nothing, ſince Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Evidence is thus admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be true.—But if Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Evidence is not allowed to be true—if the Perſon ſhe ſaw there in a <hi>Canadian</hi> Gown was not Major <hi>Diſney,</hi> but ſome other Perſon—then where is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of her Teſtimony with that of <hi>Magovock</hi>'s? She may have been miſtaken in the Perſon ſhe took for the Major, and yet the Major may have been there in a different Dreſs, that is, in a Blanket-Coat, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to <hi>Macgovock</hi>'s Evidence. The moſt that can be made of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, if a miſtake about the Priſoner's Dreſs can be thought to be of ſuch high Importance, is to get rid of the Evidence of one of theſe two Witneſſes; in which Caſe the Proſecution will reſt upon the Evidence of the other of them, and of Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Theſe are, far as I can recollect, the principal Contradictions in the Witneſs <hi>Magovock</hi>'s Evidence on which the Gentlemen of Counſel with the Priſoner have inſiſted: And, I preſume, Gentlemen, after what has been offered to your Conſideration by way of Reply to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that have been attempted to be drawn from them, that you will be clearly of Opinion that they do not materially affect the Credit of the other Parts of this Witneſs's Teſtimony. But, as has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, the whole Evidence of this Witneſs might very well be ſet aſide, if there was Reaſon for it, and yet the remaining Proof in ſupport of the Proſecution would be more than ſufficient to be the Ground of a Conviction, being the poſitive Teſtimony of two Witneſſes of indiſputable Credit. Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> who have ſworn that they ſaw the Priſoner in Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe at the Time of the Aſſault. This is a ſolid and ſubſtantial Proof in ſupport of the Proſecution, which neither the imperfect preſumptive Evidence of the Priſoner's Alibi, given by Witneſſes ſtrongly byſſed in his Favour, and by the Wives and Daughters of Fellow-Priſoners, nor the Miſtakes of a third Witneſs (though they had been as important as they have been ſhewn to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable) can impeach. One Thing only can be alledged to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Weight of it and plead ſomewhat in the Priſoner's Favour, which I doubt not, Gentlemen, has already occured to you: I mean the Circumſtance of the Priſoner's being ſaid to have been diſguiſed by a Crape that covered his Face. This, it might be thought, muſt have made it difficult for Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> to deſcern the Features of his Face; without which it is poſſible, and, in Favour of Innocence, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be preſumed, that they had miſtaken ſome other Man that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010958_0035_0F852F526DAEB7A8"/>
the Priſoner in Size and Shape to be the Priſoner himſelf; and that the Hurry of their Spirits on ſuch an alarming Occaſion had ſtrengthed the Impreſſion made by ſuch a Reſemblance and contributed to confirm them in this Miſtake. This is, in my Opinion, the moſt important Conſideration that can be offered in the Priſoner's Favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, Gentlemen, in anſwer to it I muſt obſerve, that both Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> have ſworn that they diſtinguiſhed the Features of his Face which takes away all Room for ſuch a Miſtake. And that it is by no Means difficult to diſcern a Man's Features through a Crape you will eaſily be convinced upon trial. Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> has brought here into Court a Peice of Crape of the ſame Kind with that which was drawn over the Face of the Man ſhe took to be the Priſoner (and which is of the ſame Kind that Officers wear upon their Arms for mourning in Order to enable you to make this neceſſary Trial. Take this with you, Gentlemen, when you withdraw to conſider of your Verdict of this important Occaſion, and try yourſelves how far it is capable of concealing a Perſon's Features. I believe you will find it to be but a poor Diſguiſe, and will ſoon be of Opinion that Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> at the Diſtance of about ten Feet, and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> at that of only four Feet might very well have been able to diſcern the Features of the Perſon upon whom they fixed their Eyes to have been thoſe of the Priſoner at the Bar.'</p>
            <p>The Attorney-General having ended his Reply, the Chief-Juſtice ſummed up the Evidence to the Jury, who, after withdrawing for about half an Hour, brought in their Verdict that the Priſoner was Not Guilty: And the Priſoner was thereupon diſcharged.</p>
