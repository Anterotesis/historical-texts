            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<date>Nov. 1, 1740.</date>
               </dateline>
               <salute>My dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LAST Night and this Morning I read your Queries and Scruples. Whether they were compiled by Church Members or Miniſters of the Presbyterian Perſuaſion, I ſhall not take upon me to determine. I think I may ſay, with <hi>David</hi> on another Occaſion, <hi>Joab's Hand is in this</hi> If your Miniſters were really the Authors, and you only their Repreſentatives, they have not acted ſimply. They had better have ſpoken out. I ſhould as readily have anſwered them as you. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>He that hateth Reproof, is Brutiſh</hi>: And if I know any thing of my own Heart, I ſhould think myſelf obliged to any one that convinces me of any Error, either in Principle or Practice. I therefore aſſure you, that I do not find the leaſt Reſentment ſtirring in my Soul againſt thoſe (whoever they be) that propoſed the <hi>Queries,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rev. <hi>Preſbytery</hi> that adviſed you to ſend them to me in a Publick Manner: No, I rejoice in it; becauſe it gives me an Opportunity of doing what my Friends know I have for ſome time propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To correct ſome Paſſages in my printed Sermons. I think it no Diſhonour to retract ſome Expreſſions that have formerly dropped from my Pen, before God was pleaſed to give me a more clear Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> I think, did ſo before me. The Lord's Dealing with me was ſomething out of the common Way. I can ſay, to the Honour of rich free diſtinguiſhing Grace, that I received the Spirit of Adoption before I had converſed with one Man, or read a ſingle Book, on the Doctrine of <hi>Free Juſtification by the imputed Righteouſneſs of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. No Wonder then, that I was not ſo clear in ſome Points at my firſt Setting out in the Miniſtry. Our LORD was pleaſed to enlighten me by Degrees; and I deſire your Prayers, that his Grace may ſhine more and more in my Heart, till it breaks forth into perfect Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004859_0004_100E038E4F788688"/>But to come to the exceptionable Paſſages in my Sermons. You blame me for ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 17. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2d. <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.</hi> I acknowledge this is not ſufficiently explain'd. It ſhould have been expreſs'd thus, "All the <hi>moral communicable</hi> Perfections of the Deity." tho' perhaps not one of my Readers really thought I meant any others. Again, <hi>Man was the Perfection of the</hi> moral <hi>and</hi> material <hi>World.</hi> Let it ſtand thus, "The Perfection of the <hi>viſible</hi> World"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 22. &amp; 23. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> where ſpeaking of a godly Man's riſing by Repentance after a Fall into Sin, I ſay, <hi>Waſhes the Guilt of Sin away by the Tears of a ſincere Repentance joined with Faith in the Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST." — This is falſe Divinity; — I would now alter it thus, —
<q>Recovers his former Peace, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his Acts of Faith on the perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of JESUS CHRIST.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 79. <hi>Vol</hi> 1, where ſpeaking of making the Glory of God our End, I ſay, <hi>And which</hi> alone <hi>can render any of our Actions acceptable in God's Sight</hi>"—It ſhould be—
<q>And without which <hi>any</hi> of our Actions cannot be acceptable in God's Sight.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 16, <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. where I ſpeak of ſome <hi>Who vainly</hi> depend <hi>on their own Righteouſneſs, and not on the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>imputed to and inherent in them, as neceſſary to their eternal Salvation.</hi>" — To avoid all Miſtakes, I would expreſs myſelf in this Manner, —
<q>Who have neither <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs imputed to them for their Juſtification in the Sight of God, nor Holineſs wrought in their Souls as the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that, in order to make them <hi>meet</hi> for the Enjoyment of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vol.</hi> 1, <hi>p.</hi> 7. where it ſtands thus, <hi>We muſt be new Creatures in order to qualify us for</hi> being ſavingly <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> read, "to qualify us for <hi>living eternally</hi> with Chriſt."</p>
            <p>The ſeeming Contradiction in my Sermon, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2, <hi>p.</hi> 128, compar'd with <hi>Vol.</hi> 2, <hi>p.</hi> 137, I think may be reconciled by that Paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>After you believed you were ſealed by the Spirit of Promiſe</hi> Your arguing on this, <hi>Page</hi> 20, <hi>Sect</hi> 7, I think is not quite ſo clear. Might you not have as reaſonably blamed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004859_0005_100E039075979EA8"/>
               <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> for ſaying to a dead Man, <hi>Lazarus come forth</hi>? However, inſtead of <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi>" <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 137, Let it be read, "ſanctifying Spirit."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>P.</hi> 33. where it is now read, <hi>The Man Chriſt Ieſus is ſpiritually formed in your Hearts.</hi>—I would alter it thus, "That Chriſt is formed within you."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p</hi> 53, <hi>The many Souls that are nouriſhed weekly by the ſpiritual Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt by your Means.</hi> —Let it be alter'd for theſe Words,
<q>Nouriſh'd weekly at the Lord's Supper by your Means.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſee no reaſon to alter my Explanation of the Words, <hi>Baptizing them into the</hi> Nature <hi>of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt</hi>; and, <hi>Chriſt ſpiritually conceived in the Heart of</hi> Eve. — I mean no more by theſe Expreſſions than the Apoſtle, when he ſays, <hi>Know you not that Chriſt is in you, unleſs you be Reprobates?</hi> And again, <hi>We are made Partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vol.</hi> 2, <hi>p.</hi> 128, Theſe Words <hi>[In the Lord's Prayer]</hi> may be left out. Tho' if the Word <hi>Name</hi> ſignifies God's Attributes according to your own Confeſſion, why may it not ſignify his Eſſence? What are God's Attributes but GOD himſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vol.</hi> 1 <hi>p.</hi> 14 After <hi>eſſential ones too,</hi> inſert, "if Perſons are capable of performing them" And by <hi>eſſential</hi> is meant <hi>neceſſary</hi> in that Order of Means which God has appointed.</p>
            <p>THESE, if I miſtake not, are all the Paſſages in my Sermons which you object againſt.— And now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that I am not aſhamed to own my Faults, I can inform you of other Paſſages as juſtly exceptionable. — In my Sermon on <hi>Juſtification,</hi> I ſeem to aſſert <hi>Univerſal Redemption,</hi> which I now abſolutely deny. — In my <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian,</hi> I talk of Works procuring us ſo high a Crown.—In my Sermon on the <hi>Marks of the New Birth,</hi> I ſay, <hi>We ſhall endure to the End, if we continue &amp;c.</hi> —Theſe and perhaps ſome other Paſſages, tho' capable of a candid Interpretation, I now miſlike, and in the next Edition of my Sermons, God willing, I propoſe to alter them.—In the mean while I ſhall be thankful to any that will point out my Errors, and I promiſe, by divine Aſſiſtance, they ſhall have no Reaſon to ſay,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004859_0006_100E039201ED4D28"/>
that I am one who hates to be reformed —<hi>Let the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſmite me, it ſhall be a Kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oil, which ſhall not break my Head: for yet my Prayer alſo ſhall be in their Calamities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for your Inſinuating that I countenance Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> in his Errors, it is no ſuch Thing. — I prefaced <hi>Halyburton</hi>'s Memoirs before I ſaw what Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> wrote. And ſince I have ſeen it have more than once ſaid, If I had known what Mr. <hi>Weſley</hi> had wrote I would not have prefaced the Book at all. — I do not underſtand Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> in his Interpretation of thoſe Words, <hi>He that is born again of God ſinneth not</hi>; and therefore have torn that Part of his Preface out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe Books which I have given away lately, and have acquainted him wherein I think he errs in this particular, in ſundry of my Letters.</p>
            <p>You wrong me if you think I am an <hi>Antinomian.</hi> — For when I ſay, <hi>God made no ſecond Covenant with</hi> Adam, I mean no more than this, —
<q>God made no ſecond Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> in his own Perſon in behalf of his Poſterity. Nor did Man's Acceptance in the Sight of God after the Fall, depend either wholly or in part on his Works, as before the Fall.—</q>
Whoever reads the Author of <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> will find he thinks otherwiſe; and I believe your Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> will not thank you for defending <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> as you ſeemingly have done in your late Queries.</p>
            <p>Your Objection concerning my favourable Opinion of ſome particular <hi>Quakers</hi> I converſed with, and alſo about ſome <hi>particular Promiſes</hi> which I think have been made me, you may ſee ſatisfied in my Anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s laſt paſtoral Letter, and in a Letter ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and publiſhed in one part of my Journals.</p>
            <p>I am no Friend to <hi>caſting Lots</hi>; but I believe, on <hi>extraordinary Occaſions,</hi> when Things can be determined no other way, God, if appeal'd to and waited on by Prayer and Faſting, will anſwer by Lot <hi>now</hi> as well as formerly.</p>
            <p>You condemn me for preaching <hi>extempore,</hi> and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I am helped often <hi>immediately</hi> in that Exerciſe:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004859_0007_100E0393C2336A60"/>
But thouſands as well as myſelf are thankful for the ſpecial Aſſiſtances which God has afforded me in that Exerciſe. — You likewiſe cenſure me as one that would lay aſide Reading; but I am of Biſhop <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Mind, <hi>Study without Prayer is Atheiſm; Prayer without Study, Preſumption.</hi> — Blame me not for the Warmth of ſome of my Adherents, as you call them. One of your Miniſters knows, how ſharply I rebuked one of them for his Warmth at <hi>Fog's Mannor.</hi> I am for loving as Brethren, and wiſh all would copy after the lowly JESUS. — But then I cannot diſcommend thoſe (ſuppoſing they do it in the Spirit of Meekneſs) who exclaim againſt <hi>dry ſapleſs unconverted</hi> Miniſters — Such ſurely are the Bane of the Chriſtian Church.</p>

And I appeal to your own Hearts, whether it was right, eſpecially ſince you heard the conſtant Tenor of my preaching in <hi>America</hi> has been <hi>Calviniſtical,</hi> to cenſure me as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Arminian,</hi> becauſe a few unguarded Expreſſions dropped from my Pen juſt as I came out of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford?</hi>—Could Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> or the Author of <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> ſay ſo? — But I have done —The LORD be with you — I am a poor frail Creature: And as ſuch, I beſeech you to pray for</p>

               <p>I HAVE ſeen your printed Anſwer to certain <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> lately publiſhed, and obſerve with great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the Evidence you there give of a truely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Humility. And it is this emboldens me to tell you, that in my Opinion you have not in all Points ſet Things right; but ſome of your Corrections are as liable to Exceptions as the Paſſages you have corrected, I will give you a Specimen: Inſtead of,
<q>Adam <hi>was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity,</hi>
                  </q>
you correct it,
<q>
                     <hi>All the</hi> moral communicable <hi>Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Deity.</hi>
                  </q>
—Was not Man created a little lower than the Angels? And if ſo, were there not ſome <hi>moral Perfections</hi> communicated to <hi>them,</hi> which were not communicated to <hi>him</hi>? For otherwiſe in what Senſe could he be ſaid to be <hi>inferior</hi> to them? And it would be abſurd to ſay, that any Thing could be <hi>communicated</hi> that was not <hi>communicable.</hi> — I hope I have a true Senſe of the Power and Uſefulneſs of your Miniſtry, and wiſh it, from my Soul and Spirit, all the Succeſs it deſerves: But at the ſame time ſincerely wiſh, that all Errors may be removed, and every Let and Hindrance taken away. I therefore beg, that you will furniſh me with the Means of Anſwering what may be objected to the above Paſſage, by leaving a Letter at Mr. <hi>Franklin</hi>'s, directed to</p>

                  <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN your Anſwer to the <hi>Queries</hi> you ſay, That <q>To the Honour of free diſtinguiſhing Grace, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Adoption, before you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with one Man, or read a ſingle Book, on the Doctrine of <hi>Free Juſtification by the imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; and, therefore, no Wonder that you was not ſo clear in ſome Points at your firſt Setting out in the Miniſtry.</q>
— This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to me ſeems clearly to imply, That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption alone, without the Aid of human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation or Books, is not ſufficient fully to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh a Chriſtian Miniſter, but that human Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Books are abſolutely neceſſary, in order fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>enlighten</hi> him. — As I underſtood you in this Senſe, and further, That
<q>it is not yet <hi>perfect</hi> Day Day with you</q>
I concluded you would readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any of your Errors, even now, ſince you are not yet fully enlightened; and more eſpecially, as you ſay in your Anſwer to the <hi>Queries,</hi>
                  <q>That you ſhall be thankful to any that will point out your Errors; and promiſe, by Divine Aſſiſtance, they ſhall have no Reaſon to ſay, that you are one who hates to be reformed.</q>
— It was upon the Strength of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that I thought it proper, not only to pray that
<q>God's Grace might ſhine more and more in your Heart,</q>
but alſo to trouble you with my Letter of the 11th Inſtant.</p>
               <p>The high Opinion I had entertained of your great Candour, Sincerity, and Zeal for Truth, induced me to expect an Anſwer; and I would ſtill gladly receive that Satisfaction. But as I find you have hitherto decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, and for which I am at a Loſs for a good Reaſon; I therefore take this Occaſion to let you know, That if you any <hi>longer decline</hi> doing what every Chriſtian En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer has a Right to demand of you upon ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I will immediately call upon you in a publick Manner, by printing both this and my former Letter.</p>
