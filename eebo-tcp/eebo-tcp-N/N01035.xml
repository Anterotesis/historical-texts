            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Whereupon ſome of them asked me, whether I would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied if they read it in their private Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?

Upon which they appointed me to come to the ſame place the next Morning as ſeven of the clock for an anſwer: accordingly I did, where my Book was returned to me again, ſome ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it holds forth things contrary to what we have done, both in our publick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and printed Books, and may make a Diviſion amongſt us To which I anſwer'd, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have alſo added ſomething more at the end of that Epiſtle which I preſented to them, to ſhow the difference between the <hi>Miniſtration of the Moral Law,</hi> (written in the hearts of all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi>) and of the <hi>Miniſtration of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (written on the heart of Gods Children by the Spirit of the living God) the one being the <hi>Light of Condemnation,</hi> the other being the <hi>Light of Life,</hi> or the <hi>Light of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> through Faith in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and both proceeding from one and the ſelf-ſame God.</p>
            <p>And as to what I have written to the <hi>Obſervers of the Seventh-Day Sabbath,</hi> Theſe may certifie thee, that after it pleaſed God, through his rich Grace in Chriſt Jeſus, to take away the Guilt of my Sins from my Conſcience, and to ſend the Spirit of his Son into my heart, whereby he did reveal unto me his love, and his acceptance of me in Jeſus Chriſt; this unſpeakable Mercy did greatly engage my heart to love God, &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ſearch the Scriptures, that there by I might know how to ſerve God acceptably,

But I continuing a diligent ſearcher of the holy Scriptures, and begging at the Throne of Grace for direction in the way of Truth, it pleaſed God to open my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to underſtand the Scriptures, and to ſee that the 7th Day Sabbath was but a Sign (under the Law) of a Goſpel Reſt that Chriſt gives the Soul, and that the ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Law was nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt: I could then no longer obſerve the 7th Day Sabbath without defiling my Conſcience; for faith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.27.

I then wrot to thoſe my Brethren that kept the 7th Day Sabbath, ſhowing them how it was but a Sign or ſhadow of a better thing that was to come by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſince have writ this following Epiſtle to them, wherein is opened the Covenant of the Law, and the Covenant of Grace, the firſt Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a figure of the ſecond; which Covenant, with all the Rites and Ceremonies of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until the eſtabliſhment of the New Teſtament by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; in which Teſtament contains the ſubſtance of all thoſe things ſhadowed out in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and tho' the ſhadowing part of the Law was nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, and ſo ceaſed, as they were ſigns and ſhadows, yet it is as eaſie for Heaven and Earth to paſs as it is for one Tittle (of what was ſhadowed out by the Law) to eſcape of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulfilled by Chriſt in the ſubſtance of it; for what God had before determined ſhould be fulfilled by Chriſt, was propheſied of by the Law, as well as by the Prophets, as is to be ſeen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.13.

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001232_0011_0FB135D5A5ADFB18"/>living Waters, which did proceed from the Throne of God and of the Lamb; for you was then adorned as a Bride prepared to meet her Husband, and many of you did run to and fro, and know edge was encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that Day; for your Earthen Veſſels were fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O how did Chriſt, your loving Husband imbrace you in the Arms of his Love! for he knew that you were no Harlot, but true to him. O how great was your love to him in that day! many waters could not quench it, neither could the floods drown it; it utterly contemned all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and pleaſures of this World, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracea him alone; Tribulation could not ſeperate you, nor Diſtreſs, nor Perſecution, nor Famine, nor Nakedneſs, nor Peril, not Sword; yea, in all things you were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorers in that day, through him that loved you and eſpouſed you to himſelf.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001232_0013_0FB135D9006DF858"/>
And now, <hi>Brethren,</hi> I have further to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you concerning the two Trees in the miſt of the Garden of God, the one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Tree of Life,</hi> the other, called, <hi>The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</hi> The Tree of Life, with its Branches, repreſents the ſtate of Chriſt, with his Members: The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, with its Fruit and Branches, repreſents the ſtate of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity. It was the purpoſe of God before theſe two <hi>Adams</hi> were brought forth, that the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger, and that the firſt ſhould be a figure of him that was to come, that ſo Gods choice might ſtand, not of Works, but of him that calleth, having before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger, which accordingly after appeared, for the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> for the ſake of one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the forbidden Fruit, ſold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſo loſt the Bleſſing, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited. For it was the purpoſe of God to take our Nature, and ſo to have the glory of all his Works himſelf; and therefore he made the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his own Image, and after his own likeneſs, in reſpect that he made him upright, and to be immortal, and gave him dominion over the fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Field, yea, and over all the Earth;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001232_0014_0FB135DA40B9F960"/>and thus he bore the Image of God, but was not God; but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is the Lord from Heaven a quickening Spirit, in his divine Nature, who made all things for the honour of himſelf.</p>
            <p>When the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uit, his Eyes were opened, and not before, and a divine Light of the righteous Law of God did manifeſt to him both good and evil, and let him ſee his juſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for his Tranſgreſſion; for the Sword of Gods Juſtice ſtopt the way to the Tree of Life, and ſentenced him to dye, ſo that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> might ſee and know nothing by it but Death; it left him without any ground of hope of Mercy, yea, it read to him this doleful Sentence, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſhalt ſurely dye,</hi> and ſo left him. So that he could not come at the Tree of Life to eat of that, but by the free gift of God, who promiſed, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head;</hi> for he that had the power of Death was the Devil, who was now become the god of this world, ruling in their hearts, ſo that now there was no recovery of man, but by a Reſurrection from the dead; for there could be no Redemption from Gods Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, in eating of the forbidden Fruit, but immediately his Eves were opened, and a divine Light ſhined in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001232_0015_0FB135DB9FE0D3E0"/>him, to give him the knowledge of good &amp; evil, that by it the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> might judge the World at the Reſurrection of the Body. And tho' this Light in all men be the true Light of Condemnation, and lighteth every one that cometh into the World, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Life of God, yet it gives us no life, but condemns us to death; for it was not the gift of God to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity for Juſtification, but upon their own perfect Obedience to it; but it was for a Light to <hi>Adam</hi> and to his Poſterity, that by it they might ſee their own Nakedneſs, upon their Diſobedience, and fear Gods Wrath and Juſtice for the ſame; for the Righteouſneſs of this Light is not to be found in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> not in his Poſterity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is their Condemnation; but it is the free gift of Righteouſneſs, through Faith in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who hath received the Promiſe of the Spirit, and ſent it into our hearts, and ſo we come to have our Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs covered with a Garment that God cloathes us withal, and not of our own making; for it is not works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we can do, that is acceptable to God, but it is his own work, in creating us a new, through Faith in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Seed of the Woman, that God did then promiſe ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head, &amp;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001232_0016_0FB135DD133FCF88"/>ſo come to obtain the Kingdom himſelf, who is the Tree of Life, and gives to them that believe on him, to eat of it, that they may live forever; for he hath power to raiſe the dead, and hath overcome him that hath the Power of Death, in that he was raiſed from the dead, as it is written, <hi>This is he that liveth, and was dead, and behold be liveth for evermore, and hath the Keys of Hell and Death,</hi> and will at the laſt day open the Graves that the dead may come forth, and doth now quicken whom he will, being the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Garden. And thus we come to be living Branches of it, and come to receive the Righteouſneſs of this Light, by the free gift of God, through Faith in Chriſt; for the natural man is ſenſual, not having the Spirit of Chriſt; and the Spirit of Chriſt is the Righteouſneſs of the Law, or of this divino Light, ſo that no man can by anyendea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to perform the Righteouſneſs which this Lighs requires, ever be able to perform it. So that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſent to be a Saviour to ſuch as this Light doth juſtifie, but to be a Saviour to ſuch as ſee all their endeavours to live up to it, to be in vain; for it is the true Light that makes all men ſee what dwells in them, and that the Law of Sin, that dwells in their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001232_0017_0FB135DE90E18880"/>Members, hath Dominion over them, and compels them to rebel againſt this Light of Righteouſneſs, which ſhines in them; ſo that they are in a ſtate of Death and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to Righteouſneſs, and by it ſee all hope in themſelves to fail, and to prize the rich Mercy of God, which comes by the Death &amp; Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin, ſo that through Faith in his Blood we receive the gift of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Light, by his Spirit ſent into our heatrs, which Righteouſneſs this light juſtifies, and no other; and when we have received this Righteouſneſs into our hearts, through faith in the Blood of Chriſt, this Light diſcovers to our certain knowledge, that we are made partakers of Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſheſs, which Righteouſneſs was with God before the World was made, but Man being in a ſtate of ſin, doth not comprehend that this Light proceeds from the Life of God, or divine Nature of Chriſt, and that Gods Wrath cannot be pacified but by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience to it; for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this Light, is both of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture; for this Light proceeds from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nal Life that was with God, and was God, and it lays the ſinful World naked either to Gods Judgment or Mercy, ſo that his Mercy
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001232_0018_0FB135E2AC202C50"/>and Juſtice may both be ſeen by this Light that ſhineth in Darkneſs, but the Darkneſs doth not comprehend it; and by it that Man whom God hath appointed will judge the World.</p>
            <p>Now we receive the Spirit of Adoption by the hearing of Faith preached by the Goſpel, and thereby believing in the God that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead; for it is he that hath received of the Father the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, and only through Faith in his Name we receive it; for him hath God the Father ſealed, and given him a Name above every Name, and hath made him Heir of all things that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did poſſeſs, as a figure for a time; and all that believe in this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> do receive the Spirit of Adoption, which witneſſeth with their Spirits that they are the Children of God, and if Children then Heirs of God, and jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt Heirs with Chriſt; for he hath given us his Spirit in earneſt, until we come to inherit the purchaſed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, which will be when all things come to be reſtored from the bondage of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for it is ſubjected under hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, tho loſt by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>) then ſhall God reign as viſible as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now ſince the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and promiſe of the ſecond, God (under the Law) did appoint ſhadows and figures of the Birth and Sufferings, Death and Reſurrection of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> which were as a School-Maſter or Inſtructor to his Church, that they might ſee a Reſurrection from the dead by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that his People might hope to come to enjoy the Garden of Happineſs by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> tho' loſt by the firſt And tho' we have eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo come to receive the Light of Condemnation to Death thereby; ſo alſo, we that believe have eaten of the Tree of Life, through Faith in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and thereby is Life and Immortality brought to light by his Reſurrection from the dea.</p>
            <p>And as the Law and Prophets did prophecy of the coming of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to wit, of his Birth, of his Death, and of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection that is to ſay, of God becoming Man, and ſo laying down his Life, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it up again, and thereby to give aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Children of a Reſurrection; ſo we have the Teſtimony of his Apoſtles in Scripture, that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is come, &amp;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001232_0020_0FB135E55471A868"/>that he did dye, and that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, and that he is the Son of God, and Heir of his Fathers Inheritance, which Inheritance the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; and that God did confirm their Teſtimony of his Reſurrection, by many Signs and Wonders, and Miracles and Gifts of the holy Ghoſt, which Signs &amp; Wonders God wrought by their hands, <hi>Heb</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And alſo the Scripture teſtifieth, That the holy Ghoſt is a Witneſs of his Reſurrection to all them that obey him, yea, God hath raiſed us up, together with him, to newneſs of Life, that is to ſay, ſo many as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him by Faith, he having taken away from us the guilt of ſin, and free'd us from the fear of Wrath to come, ſo that we can boldly ſay, <hi>O Death, where is thy string!

And as to the power of his Reſurrection, God gives an immediate Witneſs to that alſo; for as the God-head of Chriſt hath raiſed him from the Dead, ſo alſo doth his God-head quicken us, and raiſes us up together with him, who were before dead in ſin, and will alſo raiſe up our Bodies at the laſt Day.</p>
            <p>And as God hath taken our Nature, even the ſeed of the Woman, and ſo conſequently the Seed of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> (for the Woman was taken out of the Man) I ſay, as God hath taken of our fleſh and blood, ſo alſo

But thoſe that are under only the firſt Miniſtration of the Knowledge of good and evil, are under the Condemnation of it, if ever they have rebelled againſt it, and it is their Condemnation becauſe of their ſin, and will never juſtifie them from their ſin, which they have once committed, and therefore can never come to Salvation by following it, after one Tranſgreſſion committed, but always ſee before their Eyes Gods Cherubims ſtanding with a flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword to keep the way of the Tree of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001232_0032_0FB17C7EECD73B98"/>Life, that by this Light within them they may ſee nothing but Death for their Sin, and are never afterable to come to Salvation by their endeavouring to live up to this Light, tho' they could do it, by a perfect Obedience, ever after one ſin committed; and therefore Chriſt came to ſave only ſuch as are ſinners againſt it, by miniſtring to them that Life that the Tree of Life was a figure of; and when they come under this ſecond or Goſpel Miniſtration, they eat of the Tree of Life, and then come to ſee Life in themſelves, even the Life of God that quickens them, who were before dead in their Sins and Treſpaſſes, but now are come to ſee Life and Righteouſneſs in themſelves, not by their endeavouring to follow the Light within, for to obtain Salvation by their ſo doing, but they are now come to ſee that the Gift of Life and Righteouſneſs is given to them through Faith in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, tho' they had not done that good, the knowledge of which God had placed in them, nor avoided the doing of that evil, of which God had placed the knowledge in them, but had thus ſinned againſt the Light within, which was ſent into the World to condemn the World for ſin, for it was the firſt Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but God ſent not his Son into the

            <p>I can truly ſay with the Apoſtle, That I have many things to ſay concerning the Prieſthood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but it is hard to be uttered, becauſe ye are dull of hearing divine and ſpiritual things; when indeed the heart and mind of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are fixt on ſpiritual things, it is both life and peace to them, but when their hearts and minds are ſet upon the obſervation of ſome outward Rudiments or ſhadowing figures of the law, it brings death upon the ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the mind is ſet upon the ſhadows of heavenly things &amp; not upon Chriſt himſelf, who is the ſubſtance and head of all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001232_0047_0FB17C9A093C49D0"/>and Power whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I am greatly ſenſible that the Man-hood of Chriſt is preached up and generaly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and belived on, with a dead faith, from the report of the holy Scriptures; and in a carnal way rejoyced in, believing he is the Saviour of the World; but as to his divine nature, many Profeſſors are ſtrangers to it, and know nothing of the power and vertue of it; for it is his divine nature that imputes the Righteouſneſs of God to us; it is his divine nature that quickens us, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth us againſt the power of ſin; it is his divine nature that reveals to us our Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and that ſanctifies us, and is our life, and light, and wiſdom, yea, the divine nature of Chriſt applies to us all the virtues of the Sufferings of his Man-hood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reveals to us, the truth of the hiſtory of the Scriptures about his Sufferings, ſo that we can ſet to our ſeal that the Scripture is true.</p>
            <p>I have written unto you, <hi>beloved Brethren,</hi> concerning the two Covenants, and do deſire you in a Chriſtian love to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to ſee whether theſe things be ſo or no.</p>

So that Chriſt is the Mediator of a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes; for if the firſt Covenant had been without fault, there had been no place for a ſecond; for God finds fault with them, ſaying, My

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001232_0062_0FB17CB55D2D1DC0"/>Teſtament given at <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> And it is eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs, than one Tittle of the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> to fail; for Chriſt came not to deſtroy it, but to fullfil it in every jot and tittle of it, and alſo to fullfil in us the Righteouſneſs of that Law Written on the Tables of Stone, called, the Old Teſtament or Covenant, and to bring us into that Reſt which <hi>Adam</hi> by Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion loſt. So that in the firſt Covenant there was only contained a Temporal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which was but a ſign or ſhadow; and there was Will'd an Inheritant, but it was but the earthly <hi>Canaan;</hi> there was a Law of Obedience, but it allowed no Mercy to the Tranſgreſſor, neither did it afford any ſtrength to the ſinner, in that it was Weak, neither did it miniſter Righteouſneſs to the Soul, ſo that it was altogether helpleſs.</p>
            <p>But in the New Covenant is contained the Subſtance of thoſe things; for in it We have the Remiſſion of ſins by the Blood of Chriſt, figured out under the firſt Covenant by the Blood of Beaſts, and the gift of that Righteouſneſs required in the <hi>Law;</hi> it gives us ſtrength againſt ſin; for by it We have the gift of the Spirit of God, by which we mortifie the Deeds of the Body, and without which we can no ways ſerve God acceptably, Which Spirit Witne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Upon the conſideration of theſe things. We ought to give the more earneſt heed; for if the Word ſpoke by Angels and Writ upon Stone, was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Diſobedience received a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward, how then ſhall We eſcape, if We neglect ſo great Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt!

            <p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The man that bore a burden on the Sabbath Day (to wit, his Bed, <hi>Joh</hi> 5.10.) prophaned it in ſo doing, and was as blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the Prieſts; for that Sign under the Law was not the Sabbath, any more than that Circumciſion, commanded to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was the Circumciſion, and therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, That is not Circumciſion that is outward in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.

            <p>It is a common ſaying, that the Scripture ſaith, A righteous Man falleth into ſin ſeven times a day, which falſe Report ſeems to be raiſed from this Text of Scripture, tho' it intends quite another thing, and not a falling into ſin, as the Conſequents of it make it appear; for, ſaith the Text, <hi>Lay not wait, O Wicked Man, againſt the Dwelling of the Righteous, neither ſpoil th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001232_0071_0FB17CC4B08DD328"/>hence we may obſerve, that the holy Ghoſt cautions and forbids the Wicked man laving wait againſt the Dwelling of the Righteous, thinking thereby to ſpoil his reſting place, which reſting place is in God, upon this conſideration, For a righteous man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again; which implyes as much as if it ſhould ſay, Tho' he ſhould f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll before thee ſeven times, yet ſhall he riſe up again; for his ſtate is not like the Wicked, for the Wicked when they come to fall, it is into Miſchief. so that this place of Scripture doth not at all intend falling into ſin, but into Perils, through the means of the Wicked, but they ſhall riſe up again; for it is written, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not againſt me, O mine Enemy; when I fall I ſhall ariſe,</hi> Iſa. 54.17. <hi>No Weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another place of Scripture, which is groſly wreſted, is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. where the Lord ſaith to <hi>Paul, My ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs;</hi> they ſay, <hi>Paul</hi>'s weakeneſs and infirmities (there mentioned) is meant, ſin, which in ſo ſaving they make <hi>Paul</hi> ſeem very abominable; for he ſaith moſt gladly, <hi>Therefore will I rather glory in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:001232_0072_0FB17CC657EB3EC8"/>it? Surely Nay. And after this manner do they wreſt the Scripture to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Whenas this place of Scripture doth plainly ſhew, that the faithful Children of God, who are perfected in the Doctrine of Chriſt, do come to obtain a perfect ſtrength againſt the Power of ſin, as appeareth by comparing <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. with the 8 &amp; 9 <hi>verſes;</hi> for faith <hi>Paul, And leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, there was given me a Thorn in the fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buffer me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi> From hence we may obſerve, That <hi>Paul</hi> had abundance of Revelations, and left he ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through them, there was given him a Thorn in the fleſh, which was the Meſſenger of Satan, to buffet him, which was ſome evil Motions working in his fleſhly Body, which he compareth to a Thorn in the fleſh, which will terrifie a man till he can get rid of it; and the end of God in exerciſing <hi>Paul</hi> under theſe Temptations, was, that he might not be exalted in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but might learn by them the Doctrine of Humility; Theſe Temptations or evil Motions that did work in <hi>Paul</hi>'s fleſh, he found to be too ſtrong for him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and therefore beſought the Lord,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001232_0073_0FB17CC90F345198"/>that it might depart from him; the anſwer of the Lord to him, was, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Thus we may ſee how God was pleaſed to exerciſe <hi>Paul,</hi> to humble and abaſe him, under the fence of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmities, and then in ſhewing him moſt graciouſly his All-ſufficiency, in making his own ſtrength appear perfectly in <hi>Paul,</hi> and thereby giving him the Victory. From hence we may Note, That when Pride was in <hi>Paul</hi> he was under the buffeting War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, but when he was humbled under it, ann by it had learned Humility, then God revealed his perfect ſtrength in him, and gave him the Victory over the power of ſin; and when <hi>Paul</hi> came thus to ſee his own weakneſs, not being able to with-ſtand the power of ſin, he was greatly abaſed and humbled, and did glory in the ſight that he had obtained of himſelf: And thus he comes not to glory in himſelf, any otherwiſe than in the ſight that he had obtained of his own weakneſs and infirmities, that the power of Chriſt might reſt on him, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him Gods perfect ſtrength, againſt the Motions of ſin; and when <hi>Paul</hi> had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Learning, rightly to know his own weakneſs and infirmities, ſo as to glory in them, being abaſed in himſelf, lowly and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001232_0074_0FB17CC9E876D360"/>humble, and to know the Almighty Power of God, and his readineſs to help the humble and lowly in time of need; then did he come (as in the <hi>10th verſe</hi>) to take pleaſure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in Perſecutions, and in Diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake; for when I am weak (ſaith he) then am I ſtrong, that is, becauſe he ſees his own Weakneſs, and is humble and lowly in himſelf, but is ſtrong by Faith in God, whom he knows will give him the Victory; ſo that when he is thus Weak in himſelf, then is he ſtrong in God by Faith.</p>
            <p>From this recorded Experience of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is our Wiſdom to learn of Chriſt, who was meek and lowly in heart, and then we ſhall find Reſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, by Gods perfect ſtrength that did appear in him, againſt the ſtrength and powerful Motions of Sin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Warfair he could not reſt quietly, for it was like a pricking Bryar or grieving Thom in the fleſh, which was ſuffered of God ſo to be, to teach him Humility, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Weakneſs and Gods Strength made perfect in him; and thus he comes to glory in thoſe two fore-mentioned things. And this is the Saints Perfection in this Life, even when Gods ſtrength is made perfect in us, againſt the power of ſin. And this is the Perfection that I have born Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001232_0075_0FB17CCB69FCBBC8"/>to, for which I have ſuffered Repreach from ſuch as never ſaw Gods ſtrength at any time made perfect in them againſt the <hi>power</hi> of ſin, neither will they believe the Truth of it, becauſe the God of this World hath blinded their Eyes.</p>
            <p>Another place greatly wreſted, is in <hi>James</hi> 3, 2 <hi>For in many things we Offend all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here ariſeth a Queſtion from this Text, <hi>What we are to underſtand by Offending all? Whether all the Church is here meant to Offend, or whether ſome particular Perſons is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Offend all the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> The following words do anſwer the Queſtion, being compared with <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>If any man Offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect Man, and able alſo to bridle the whole Body.</hi> From hence we may Note, that he ſpeaks of Offending with the Tongue; for ſaith he, <hi>If any Man Offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect Man;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with <hi>verſ</hi> 1. which faith, <hi>My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be not many Maſters, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater Condemnation;</hi> which imports, Be not of a Domineering or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly Spirit, for ſuch are apt to Offend all the Church of Chriſt in many things, with their ungovern'd Tongue; and whereas he faith, <hi>We ſhall receive the greater Damnation</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:001232_0076_0FB17CCCEA485358"/>that is to be underſtood, ſo many of us as are of an exalted Maſterly Spirit, for it is ſuch of us as Offend all, by not bridling our Tongue; for this Offending all is with an unbridled Tongue, as is to be ſeen in the 3d &amp; <hi>4th verſes,</hi> compared with the 5 &amp; 6 <hi>verſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They mention alſo <hi>James</hi> 4.5. ſay they, the Apoſtle ſaith, That the Scripture ſaith, the Spirit that dwelleth in us, luſteth to envy; whenas the Apoſtle is ſpeaking to Adulterers and Adultereſſes, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe and is ſhewing to them what the Scripture ſaith of the Spirit that was in the adulterated old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6, 5. and is in all of us, that are gone out of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and got into the Spirit of the World, and ſo have gone a whoring from God.</p>
            <p>They greatly wreſt many paſſages of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> words in the <hi>7th</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to their own deſtruction; for the Apoſtle is ſetting forth the miſerable ſtate of man, as he is in the fleſh, and not in Chriſt, and he makes uſe of himſelf to ſet it forth, which is moſt proper and decent for a man rather to nominate hinſelf, to ſet forth the wretched, miſrable and ſinfull ſtate of man, then to reflect it upon another
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001232_0077_0FB17CCE8D292018"/>or upon them that are not yet delivered from that ſtate.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>was a converted man when he wrot the ſaid Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> It is very true, for he was not in a <hi>wretched ſtate,</hi> then wanting deliverance, or a carnal man ſold under ſin; as he there makes uſe of himſelf (as he was in his unconverted ſtate) to open the miſerable ſtate of the unconverted man, ſold under ſin, beind in a wretched and undeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſtates as he there ſets it forth, under the denomination of himſelf. Now when he hath ended the <hi>7th Chapter,</hi> having ſet forth the carnal, unconverted ſtate of man, who is ſold under ſin, being in a wretched captivated ſtate of Death, while he is in the fleſh and not in Chriſt, ſo that tho' he willeth that which is good, yet he is ſo under the power of Satan, that he finds no ability to perform that which is good, by reaſon that there is the law of fin in his Membes, which law of fin proceeds from the Kingdom of Satan, and warreth againſt the law of his mind, and bringeth him into Captivity to the law of ſin, which is in his Members, and make him cry out againſt his wretchedneſs, and ſtate of Death that he is in, deſiring deliverance, which can come only and alone by Jeſus Chriſt, I ſay he
<pb facs="unknown:001232_0078_0FB17CD0CE742E18"/>having thus ſet forth the miſerable ſtate of man out of Chriſt, in the next place he ſets forth the happy ſtate of man in Chriſt, as throughout the 8 <hi>chap.</hi> which begins thus, There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit. But in the <hi>7th Chap.</hi> (faith he) for when we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death, <hi>v.</hi> 5. But in the <hi>8th Chap. v.</hi> 9. he ſaith to them that are in Chriſt, But ye are not in the fleſh. In the <hi>7th Chap.</hi> 23.24 <hi>verſes,</hi> he ſaith of the Unconverted, <hi>But I ſee another Law in my Members, waring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in my Members, O wretched Man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death.</hi> In <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 2. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Converted ſtate, he ſaith, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of ſin and Death. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 14. ſpeaking of the Unconverted ſtate of Man, he ſaith, For we know that the Law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. to ſet forth the miſerable ſtate of the carnal Man, he ſaith, To be carnally mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Death, becauſe the carnal Mind is
<pb facs="unknown:001232_0079_0FB17CD2945DE5D0"/>Enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 15. he ſheweth, That an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſtate is a ſtate of Bondage and Slavery, for a man doth that which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, and what he would do, that he doth not; and what he hateth, that he doth; all which ſheweth, he is under the power of ſin; this ſtate cannot but be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Spirit of Bondage, to fear Gods Wrath. But in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.15, 16, &amp; 17 <hi>Verſes,</hi> he ſheweth, That the Converted hath not the Spirit of Fear, but hath the Spirit of Adoption, and can call God Father, by the Witneſs of Gods own spirit, which reveals to the ſoul Gods Love, and gives the Soul a certain knowledge, that it is an Heir of eternal Life, by the immediate Witneſs and Revelation of God and every one that believes hath this Witneſs of God in himſelf, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Thus it appears, according to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Teſtimony, That there be ſome that wreſt <hi>Paul's</hi> Writings to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as they do alſo other Scriptures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture which they wreſt, to maintain a ſinning Life, is <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit
<pb facs="unknown:001232_0080_0FB17CD3ACF7DB28"/>againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look but into the fore-going Verſe, and it will ſhew the reaſon why theſe could not do the things they would, and why this Battle did ariſe in them, to wit, the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, for the Spirit of God in them did not want ſtrength to overcome and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the Body, and to have given them the Victory through Faith in God, but they were Diſobedient Children, and did not walk in the Spirit, but did bite and devour one another, as in the 15 <hi>verſ.</hi> which Contention did ariſe through Pride, contending about the Works of the Law; for it is written, <hi>Only through Pride cometh Contention;</hi> had they been ſowing to the Spirit, they would have reaped the fruit of Peace, as in the <hi>22th verſ.</hi> and not of War in themſelves, but they ſowing to the fleſh, did cauſe a War in themſelves, and one againſt another; for as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. They that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts. Now when the fleſh is crucified, dead and buried how can it make war againſt the Spirit, any more than a dead man can make war againſt a living man? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 11.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001232_0081_0FB17CD532781310"/>but while Humility is wanting, that Soul cannot expect a perfect Reſt and Peace; for if it ſhould enjoy that, Pride would encreaſe, and therefore God doth not reveal in ſuch a one his perfect ſtrength, but lets them labour to humble them, that they may not glory in themſelves, but in him who gives them ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture which they wreſt, to defend the power and authority of ſin, is 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8 <hi>If we ſay that me have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will appear plainly that this Scripture is ſpoken to the unconverted, yea, this whole Chapter is written, not to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but to the Unbeliever, as thus appears in the <hi>3d verſ</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> This [<hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi>] that is to ſay, the Saints; for, ſaith he, that which we have ſeen and heard, declare We unto You, that Ye [<hi>alſo</hi>] may have fellowſhip with Us; The Word [<hi>alſo</hi>] imports, as We are come into fellowſhip with God, ſo We deſire, that Ye [<hi>alſo</hi>] may come into this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001232_0082_0FB17CD6D1702068"/>with us. So that it appears plainly, that he writes to ſuch as were not yet come into fellowſhip with the Saints. The truth of this alſo appears in the <hi>9th Verſ.</hi> If We confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs. From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that theſe to whom he writes, had not yet made confeſſion of their ſins, neither were cleanſed from all Unrighteouſneſs; but it is evident that <hi>John</hi> had confeſſed his ſins, and that God had been faithful and juſt to forgive him his ſins, and had cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from all unrighteouſneſs. It is alſo evident, that all thoſe that are cleanſed from all unrighteouſneſs, walk in a clear Light, and therefore have a perfect ſight that they are Gods Children; for it is the ingrafted Spirit of Truth in their hearts that ſanctifies them; ſo that it is evident, whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that they have fellowſhip with God, and are not in this Light, they do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, as appeareth in the 5, 6 &amp; 7 <hi>Verſes,</hi> and are not cleanſed from their ſins by the Blood or Jeſus Chriſt; and for ſuch to ſay they have no ſin, do but deceive themſelves, and the Truth is not in them, or ſay, they have not ſinned, they make him a lyar, and his Word is not in them; for they being in a ſtate of Darkneſs, it is

            <p>Another place of Scripture which they wreſt, to uphold a continuance in ſin, or at leaſt to confirm it to be a truth, that none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
