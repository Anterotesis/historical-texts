            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>You may remember, that when we were here laſt Fall, I aſked you what was the Cauſe of the Breach between our Brethren the <hi>Delawares</hi> and us; whether we, the People of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> had done you any Injury; and deſired you would open your Hearts, and tell me your Mind freely. In anſwer to this you told me, that your fooliſh and ignorant young Men, when they ſaw the Proceedings of our Enemy, the <hi>French</hi> King, and believed the Things that were told them, were perſuaded by this falſe hearted King to ſtrike your Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and that the Cauſe why the Blow came the harder on us was, that the Proprietaries had defrauded you of ſome of your Land, and that you had been treated in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Jerſeys</hi>; but that this was not the principal Cauſe of your ſtriking us. I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enquire into the Truth of this Charge at that Time, but you declined it, becauſe few of the <hi>Indians</hi> then preſent originally owned thoſe Lands; but ſaid, that you would endeavour to bring as many of them down as you could find to the next Meeting.</p>

               <p>Brethren,</p>
               <p>I will let you know in a few Words what my Deſire is. I kindly receive your Words this Day: They are true, and make my Heart glad. By this Belt (holding up a Belt) I let you 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007921_0005_102E019A8C238F28"/>
know I will ſpeak To-morrow. I think it proper to ſpeak my Mind with Openneſs. I think it my Duty to remember the Conduct of my fooliſh young Men. I ſee a great deal of Miſchief done. I will firſt begin with cleaning up the Blood that has been ſhed, and removing the dead Bodies out of the Way: After that, I will make known my Grievances. I remember what Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> ſaid to me by the Meſſengers he ſent to me: I ſent back to him, by the ſame Meſſengers, and deſired him, as he was a wiſer Man than I, and of greater Abilities, that he would be ſtrong, and lend his Aſſiſtance to cure this Wound.</p>

                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſpoke to the Governor and myſelf, deſiring us to give Attention; then directing his Speech to the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and all His Subjects, ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>YOU remember that you ſent to me to come down to you, and invited me to bring down with me as many of the <hi>Ten Nations</hi> as I could, by Reaſon of the Difficulty of the Times. You then ſaid to me, Brother, you are weak, I am ſtrong: If you come down, I will put away all the Difference and Uneaſineſs that has happened, and will make a laſting Peace. Now, as I have brought ſome from each of the <hi>Ten Nations</hi> with me, I would have you remember your Promiſe, and exert your Power. Alſo, remember our Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that it may be well hereafter. Alſo, as you muſt remember the Blood that has been ſhed, and the dead Bodies that lie ſcattered up and down, I would have you join with me to remove theſe out of the Way, that we may ſee one another Face to Face, and after this we will proceed to other Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>As you are a great deal ſtronger than I, you muſt exert your Power. When Differences ariſe between two Brothers, when one comes and makes Propoſals of Peace, if the other does not accept them, nothing can be done. Now, as much Blood is ſpilt, I deſire you will join with me to clear this away, and when that is done, we will proceed to other Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>According to the Promiſe I made you, that I would invite as many of the <hi>Ten Nations</hi> as I could, I have now brought with me as many as I could, who are here preſent to witneſs what ſhall be tranſacted; but, in order to make a laſting and durable Peace, we muſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert our Abilities.

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you remember you invited me to bring down ſome of the <hi>Ten Nations,</hi> ſo now ſome from each of them are here preſent, particularly ſome from my Uncles the <hi>Five Nations.</hi> When we had endeavoured, as much as in our Power, to remove the dead Bodies, and the Miſchief paſt, you alſo invited me to come and take hold of your Hand. We accordingly now come, and take hold of one of your Hands, and the <hi>Five Nations</hi> alſo come and take hold of the other Hand, that we may all ſtand together as one Man with one Heart. This now being done, when we look up, and ſee the clear Light, we ſhall enjoy it; we ſhall alſo enjoy, in Peace and Quietneſs, what the Land produces; and we ſhall enjoy the Comforts of the Day, and the Comforts of the Night; we ſhall lie down in Peace, and riſe in Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of twelve Rows, ſtrung on Cords.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this great Cloud of Miſchief that has been paſt is, that our old Standers, or Forefathers, never took regular Methods to have a laſting Peace: They never looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their Children: They only had a View of this that decays, and what lies round about upon the Earth. When they came into Council, they only talked about the Things on the Earth, that are ſoon gone. They ought to have looked forward, and to have made ſuch Agreements on both Sides, that their Children after might never diſagree. And as we ſee their Miſmanagement, let us do better, that we, as long as we live, may be faithful, and that by this our Meeting together our Children hereafter may enjoy a laſting Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of eleven Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You remember, according to your Orders, that Meſſengers have been ſent to carry your Meſſages to diſtant Parts among us, in order to promote this good, this important Work of Peace, on which our Lives depend. One of theſe Meſſengers is now in a dangerons Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being ſhot by one of your young Men. Do not be too much grieved; but as I deſire to be uſed with Juſtice, according to your Laws, I inſiſt, if this young Man die, that the Man who ſhot him may be tried by your Laws, and die alſo, in the Preſence of ſome of our People, who may witneſs it to all the Nations, that their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have done them Juſtice. And if any Thing of the like Kind ſhould happen on our Parts, we will do you the ſame Juſtice; that is, if any of our People ſhall murder any of yours, we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Murderer, to be tried by your Laws. And as the Relations of the young Man muſt be grieved, I deſire, as you have it in your Power, that you would remove the Grief and Sorrow from their Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor then acquainted <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that we would take into Conſideration what he had now ſaid; and when we were ready to give an Anſwer, we would let him know.</p>
               <p>As we were riſing the King, by his Interpreter, told me, that what he had now ſaid was of great Importance; he deſired therefore we would take Time to confider it well; that he would wait with Patience till we were ready to give him an Anſwer.</p>

We pray he may caſt a Veil over all that has happened in theſe unhappy Times, that it may be no longer remembered. We ſupplicate his Almighty Goodneſs to pardon all that is paſt. We pray him to diſpoſe all the People of this, and the ſucceeding Generations, to the lateſt Poſterity, to live in Love together.

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> DESIRE in a few Words to recollect what you told me the other Day, that the Great King, beyond the Water, had appointed a Man to overſee the Affairs of the <hi>Indians,</hi> viz. Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> who has nominated Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> his Deputy. I am glad to hear this News, and to ſee the Man that is appointed. I hope, Brother, that it will be well accepted by both of us. It is our Duty to reſpect the Perſon that the King has appointed, and with Sincerity of Heart to join together, that as the preſent Buſineſs is well begun, it may end ſo. I hope he will execute his Commiſſion with Juſtice. According to your Deſire, what you mentioned in the laſt Treaty, and what you have ſaid now, I will anſwer in a few Words; and we hope Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> will be faithful to ſee Juſtice done on both Sides in the Name of the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After I have opened the Paſſage from your Heart and Mind, that you may ſee and underſtand, by this Belt I deſire you may fully underſtand what I now ſay. It is plain the Proceedings of our Anceſtors were ſhorter than they ought to have been, in Reſpect and Behalf of their Children; and alſo their own everlaſting Peace in the World to come. You may eaſily ſee the Reaſon of the gloomy and dark Days; they have proceeded from the Earth. Our Miſunderſtanding or Miſmanagement has proceeded from the Earth, as well as our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Grievances that have paſſed and repaſſed. Though it was not the principal Cauſe that made us ſtrike our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet it has cauſed the Stroke to come harder than it otherwiſe would have come. Now it lies much in your Power to look ſtrictly into your Hearts, as we always prefer and acknowledge you above us in Abilities, Strength and Knowledge. And as it lies a great deal in your Power to know whether what I have ſaid be true or not, it depends much on you, Brother, that it may be openly and publickly declared and publiſhed to the Province or Provinces under the Government of the Great King, both to his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to the Satisfaction of thoſe appointed to manage this Affair.—Brother, now as we have met together Face to Face to ſpeak with great Sincerity, I will endeavour to lay every Thing plain before you, not to cover one Part, but to lay every Thing before you, that you may ſee plainly, in order that we may have true Satisfaction from one another, and that what may be proved to be our Right and Due, may be eſtabliſhed for ever in a durable and laſting Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>I would deſire alſo that you would look with all Diligence, and ſee from whence our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences have ſprung. You may eaſily ſee they have ſprung from the Land or Earth, which was mentioned before, though it was not the principal Thing. If regular Methods had been formerly taken for an Habitation or Reſidence for the poor <hi>Indians</hi> in this Land, this would not have come to paſs. Now as it lies much in your Power to ſearch particularly into what was mentioned before, with reſpect to the Land, which was the Cauſe of our Differences, <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007921_0009_102E01A5B1C472B0"/>if I now can prevail with you, as I hope I ſhall, honeſtly to do what may be conſiſtent with Juſtice, then I will, with a loud Voice, ſpeak, and the Nations ſhall hear me. Then it depends on you, Brother, as I ſhall ſpeak with a loud Voice, and as you are of great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Abilities than I, to aſſiſt me, that what I ſpeak to the Nations may be true, and that when I have made Proclamation with a loud Voice, by your Aſſiſtance, the Nations may hear and receive it with great Joy.</p>
               <p>Gave a Belt.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Pumpſhire,</hi> being aſked to explain what was meant by the firſt Part of this Speech, he ſaid, the Meaning was this: The Land is the Cauſe of our Differences; that is, our being unhappily turned out of the Land, is the Cauſe: And though the firſt Settlers might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Land fairly, yet they did not act well, nor do the <hi>Indians</hi> Juſtice; for they ought to have reſerved ſome Place for the <hi>Indians.</hi> Had that been done, theſe Differences would not have happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now in a few Words to let you know what my Inclination and Deſire is, agreeable to what I have ſaid. I now put it into your Power to make a laſting Peace, and that I may have my reaſonable Enjoyment from this Land; as we are ſenſible that this Land was made by that Almighty Power that has made all Things, and has given this Land to us. I was the firſt to whom he gave it; and as it pleaſed him to convey you to us, and unite us in Friendſhip in the Manner already mentioned, which was well known by our Anceſtors, it is now in your Power, and depends entirely on your Care and faithful Diligence, that it may not be broken as it has been; and if it be broken, it will be owing to you. I think it is my Duty to mention to you in publick, that I will comply with all Submiſſion. This I aſk, that I may have ſome Place for a Settlement, and for other good Purpoſes, in which we may both agree; but as I am a free Agent as well as you, I muſt not be bound up, but have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſettle where I pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> informed the Governor, that he had done for this Time, and left it to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's Pleaſure to appoint a Time to anſwer him.</p>
               <p>As the Governor had by Letter informed me, that <hi>Teedyuſcung's</hi> Speech appeared to him dark and confuſed, and deſired me to call a Meeting in private with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and know what they meant; I accordingly, on the 30th of <hi>July,</hi> at Five a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſent for the King, and ſome of his Counſellors, and deſired them to call a Council and confider well the Speeches the King had made, and afterwards to explain them to me. At Half after Nine o'Clock, King <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> with <hi>Jepiſcauhunb, Epoweyowallund, Penawagh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wottind, Lepaghpetund, Kuhtanamaku, Jangepapawey, Weneywalika,</hi> his Counſellors, and <hi>John Pumpſhire,</hi> Interpreter, met at my Houſe, and explained his Speeches as follows.</p>
               <p>The Complaints I made laſt Fall, I yet continue. I think ſome Lands have been bought by the Proprietary, or his Agents, from <hi>Indians</hi> who had not a Right to ſell, and to whom the Lands did not belong. I think alſo, when ſome Lands have been ſold to the Proprietary by <hi>Indians</hi> who had a Right to ſell to a certain Place, whether that Purchaſe was to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by Miles or Hours Walk, that the Proprietaries have, contrary to Agreement or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, taken in more Lands than they ought to have done, and Lands that belonged to others. I therefore now deſire that you will produce the Writings and Deeds by which you hold the Land, and let them be read in publick, and examined, that it may be fully known from what <hi>Indians</hi> you have bought the Lands you hold, and how far your Purchaſes extend, that Copies of the Whole may be laid before King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> and publiſhed to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces under his Government. What is fairly bought and paid for I make no further Demands about: But if any Lands have been bought of <hi>Indians</hi> to whom theſe Lands did not belong, and who had no Right to ſell them, I expect a Satisfaction for theſe Lands. And if the Proprietaries have taken in more Lands than they bought of true Owners, I expect likewiſe to be paid for that. But as the Perſons to whom the Proprietaries may have ſold theſe Lands, which of Right belonged to me, have made ſome Settlements, I do not want to diſturb them, or to force them to leave them, but I expect a full Satisfaction ſhall be made to the true Owners for theſe Lands, though the Proprietaries, as I ſaid before, might have bought them from Perſons that had no Right to ſell them.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to our Settlement, we intend to ſettle at <hi>Wyoming,</hi> and we want to have certain Boundaries fixed between you and us; and a certain Tract of Land fixed, which it ſhall not be lawful for us or our Children ever to ſell, nor for you, or any of your Children, ever to buy. We would have the Boundaries fixed all round, agreeable to the Draught we 
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007921_0010_102E01A7E6265F68"/>
give you that we may not be preſſed on any Side, but have a certain Country fixed for our own Uſe, and the Uſe of our Children for ever.</p>
               <p>And as we intend to make a Settlement at <hi>Wyoming,</hi> and to build different Houſes from what we have done heretofore, ſuch as may laſt not only for a little Time, but for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after us; we deſire you will aſſiſt us in making our Settlements, and ſend us Perſons to inſtruct us in building Houſes, and in making ſuch Neceſſaries as ſhall be needful; and that Perſons be ſent to inſtruct us in the Chriſtian Religion, which may be for our future Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and to inſtruct our Children in Reading and Writing; and that a fair Trade be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between us, and ſuch Perſons appointed to conduct and manage theſe Affairs as ſhall be agreeable to us.</p>
               <p>I then aſked him, as Fort <hi>Auguſta</hi> was within the Lands he deſired to be aſſigned to them, whether he would acknowledge that Fortreſs to belong to the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for the Uſe of His Subjects in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and all His other Subjects; and whether he would not be willing it ſhould continue as a Trading-Houſe, not only for the Good of us the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Nations he repreſents, but of all the Nations that now are, or may be hereafter, in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with us; and whether he will not engage, in Conjunction with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to defend it againſt any of His Majeſty's Enemies that may come againſt it?</p>
               <p>To which the King, in Behalf of the Nations he repreſents, replied, That he agrees that that Fort ſhall belong to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; that it ſhall continue as a Trading-Houſe; and he and his People, in Conjunction with their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> engage to defend it againſt any of His <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's Enemies that ſhall come to attack it.</p>

                  <hi>Brother</hi> Teedyuſcung, <hi>and Brethren Sachems and Warriors of the</hi> Ten Nations,</p>
               <p>IT gives me Pleaſure to hear you declare your Satisfaction at the Appointment our Great King has been pleaſed to make of Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> to be the Superintendent of the Affairs of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and that Sir <hi>William</hi> had appointed Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> to be his Deputy; and further, to hear you ſo fully and openly acknowledge it to be the Duty of both of us to reſpect the Perſon whom the King has thought fit to entruſt with ſo important a Commiſſion. I thank you for theſe dutiful Expreſſions, and do not in the leaſt doubt but they come from the Bottom of your Hearts.—I aſſure you, Brethren, I ſhall heartily join my Endeavours to yours, that the good Work of Peace, ſo well begun, may be happily finiſhed to our mutual Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay that the Proceedings of our Anceſtors were ſhorter than they ought to have been, in Reſpect and Behalf of their Children; and alſo of their own everlaſting Peace. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our Anceſtors of this Province have been always eſteemed a good, honeſt and wiſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and have always been diſtinguiſhed for their brotherly Love and kind Treatment of the <pb n="11" facs="unknown:007921_0011_102E01AA35C2C1A0"/>
                  <hi>Indians,</hi> and their upright Dealing with them in their Publick Tranſactions. You ſay that the Cauſe of our Differences proceeded from the Land, and adviſe us to look ſtrictly into our Hearts for the Truth of this. Brother, we have, according to your Deſire, looked into our Hearts, and are not ſenſible that any of our Tranſactions with the <hi>Indians,</hi> either with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Land, or otherwiſe, could have given Reaſon for the unhappy Breach betwen us. You have been ſo honeſt as to declare on all Occaſions, that the Land was not the principal Cauſe why you ſtruck us, but was only a Reaſon why the Stroke came the harder on us. As then, it was not the Cauſe of our firſt Differences, it ought not to be any Obſtacle to an immediate Concluſion of the Peace, which we are now met together with ſuch good Intentions to eſtabliſh. However we may differ in Opinion about Matters of Property, theſe are trifling Conſiderations, compared to the important Affair of uniting together in the firm Bands of Friendſhip. Let us therefore for the preſent ſuſpend them, and all Matters of leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and apply ourſelves in the firſt Place heartily to the Great Work of Peace, ſo much wiſhed for by both of us, and put Things on ſuch a Footing, that the Great King over the Waters, and His Subjects, and all the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſhall be pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay, that if you can prevail with us to do you Juſtice in your Complaint about Land, you will then with a loud Voice ſpeak, and the Nations ſhall hear you. Brother, I muſt now inform you, that immediately after our laſt Treaty, I ſent to the Proprietaries a Copy of the Complaints you then made of their defrauding you of your Lands, and received their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it ſome Days before I ſet out to meet you here, wherein they expreſs the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that you, who they conceive have been ſo well treated both by their Father, <hi>William Penn,</hi> and themſelves, ſhould charge them with Crimes of ſo heinous a Nature as Fraud and Forgery, by which their Reputation (which to them and every honeſt Man is dearer than Life itſelf) is ſo deeply wounded. Your Complaint has likewiſe been laid before the King's Miniſters, who, looking upon it as a Matter of great Importance, determined that it ſhould be carefully enquired into, and examined, before ſome Perſon no ways concerned in Intereſt, on whoſe Honeſty and Judgment they could depend; and therefore appointed Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> to hear the Particulars of your Charge, and the Proprietary's Defence, and lay the whole Matter before His Majeſty for his Royal Determination, in order that he may do you Juſtice himſelf, if you are injured. Our great King looks on you as His Children; and therefore His Miniſters have directed the ſame Method to be taken in hearing the Merits of your Complaint, as is uſed among His own Subjects, with this Difference only, that their Diſputes are finally ſettled by Judges appointed for that Purpoſe; whereas, in your Caſe, His Majeſty will determine it himſelf.</p>
               <p>Before I received the Orders of His Majeſty's Miniſters, that your Complaints ſhould be heard before Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> I fully intended, at this Meeting, to call on the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Agents to anſwer the Charge you made againſt them, and to have the Matter ſtrictly enquired into; but as I am the King's Servant, and bound by Duty as well as Inclination to obey His Orders, and His Majeſty's Deputy Agent, Mr. <hi>Croghan,</hi> who is now preſent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me he has no Power to ſuffer any Altercations on this Complaint, and that he does not think it would be for the Good of His Majeſty's Service, I muſt refer you on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> to whom I ſhall ſend proper Perſons to repreſent the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, with Records, Deeds and Evidences, to ſhew the Juſtice of their Title at any Time he ſhall appoint, of which he will give Notice to you, and all Perſons concerned. As that Gentleman is known to be a good Friend to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and a Man of Honour and Integrity, it gives me great Pleaſure to find he is well approved of by you, and I do not doubt but you will moſt chearfully agree to leave the Examination of your Claims to him, and concur in the Method His Majeſty has directed for ſettling our Differences, in which you will be certain of having ſtrict Juſtice done you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could give you many Inſtances of the great Affection and Regard the Proprietaries have for you, and all the <hi>Indians</hi>; and that they ſet a far greater Value on your Friendſhip, than on any private Intereſt or Advantage to themſelves; they have lately given to you and the World a moſt convincing Proof of this. You no Doubt have heard, that the Proprietaries, about three Years ago, at a general Meeting of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> held at <hi>Albany,</hi> fairly and openly purchaſed of them a great Country, lying on the Weſt Side of the River <hi>Saſquehannah;</hi> but upon its being repreſented, that ſome of the <hi>Indian</hi> Tribes were diſſatisfied with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of that Grant beyond the <hi>Allegheny</hi> Hills, the Proprietaries chearfully agreed to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and give up again to the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Lands Weſtward of thoſe Hills, and have given their Agents Orders to releaſe it to them at the propoſed Meeting before Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> and to ſettle Boundaries with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I have conſidered what you ſaid about a Settlement for yourſelves and your Poſterity, and am informed by Mr. <hi>Croghan,</hi> that <hi>Wyoming</hi> is the Place you would chuſe to ſettle at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proprietaries have never granted away any Lands, though within the Limits of this Province, without firſt purchaſing them of the <hi>Indians</hi>; and having never bought of them the Lands between <hi>Shamokin</hi> and <hi>Wyoming,</hi> they have therefore never laid Claim to them under any <hi>Indian</hi> Purchaſe, and expreſly deſire this may be told to the <hi>Indians,</hi> leſt evil-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Perſons ſhould have ſuggeſted any Thing to the contrary; and, in the Name of the Proprietaries, I now diſclaim all ſuch Right, of which I would have you take Notice. I am pleaſed you have made Choice of that Place; it is perfectly agreeable to me, and I aſſure you I will heartily concur with you in uſing all the Means in my Power to have theſe Lands ſettled upon you and your Poſterity, agreeable to your Requeſt. As to the other Purpoſes for which you deſire this Settlement of Lands, they are ſo reaſonable, that I make no Doubt but, on my Recommendation of them to the Aſſembly, they will chearfully enable me to comply with them.</p>

I now aſſure you that I am heartily diſpoſed and ready, with the King's Deputy Agent, to confirm the Peace which you and I have been for ſome Time tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pains to eſtabliſh.</p>

               <p>Teedyuſcung <hi>addreſſing himſelf to the Governor, ſpoke as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, the Governor,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY this Belt (holding up a Belt) I remember what you ſaid Yeſterday in the Evening. All was well accepted, and very good, only one Word, or one material Thing. When the ſeveral different Nations of us, that call ourſelves the <hi>Ten Nations</hi> that are preſent, I mean the Counſellors, had conſidered what you ſaid, we approved all except one Thing. Alſo this Morning early, when we came to ſit down by ourſelves, and our Secretary with us, when we had done, and had fully underſtood one another, and agreed on every Word, we then ordered our Secretary to write it down.—[<hi>John Pumpſhire</hi> ſaid, I will juſt mention this in Addition; we ordered him to read it over three or four Times, and approved it.]—Having done that, we have the Words already written down, and if it pleaſe the Governor to hear it read, this that is written down is what was concluded on.</p>
               <p>The Governor, in Anſwer, told him, Brother, you know that this is quite a new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and was never practiſed before.</p>
               <p>Brother, it is true, replied <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> you are right; this was not formerly practiſed; it never uſed to be ſo. Don't you ſee that I aim, by having a Clerk of my own, to exceed my Anceſtors, by having every Thing for the beſt. I endeavour, according to my Ideas, to look to thoſe that have the Authority; as for Inſtance, if they take up a Handful of Corn or 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007921_0013_102E01AEEB4BB998"/>
Pebbles, if they drop any, even one Grain, I will take Notice, and will ſpeak of it, that they may take it up.</p>
               <p>The Governor then applied to Mr. <hi>Croghan,</hi> to know whether this had ever been practiſed in any Treaty; Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> ſaid it never was, and turning to the King, ſaid, Brother, this is quite a new Method, and what was never before practiſed. I well know the <hi>Indians</hi> have good memories, and can remember what was tranſacted twenty Years ago, as if Yeſterday, I ſhould therefore be glad the King would repeat himſelf what he has to ſay, as we are only treating with him. Then <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> replied, Well, Brother the Governor, what we have conſulted and concluded on this Morning is this; I remember you told me laſt Night, that what was tranſacted laſt Fall, was laid before the King's Miniſters; and we took parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Notice that you told us, that ſome Time before you came from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> you fully intended to make all Satisfaction to me at this Treaty about Lands and Deeds; but that you received a Letter, or Letters, from the King or Proprietaries, I am not certain which, you know beſt; in Conſequence of which, you told us that you could not act in this Affair, but that Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> was appointed to tranſact <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, and Mr. <hi>George Crog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> was appointed to act in his Name. We remember very well, when we had a private Conference with you at your Dwelling, that you and Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> roſe up, ſhock Hands with me, and you told us, this was the very Man that was appointed to act between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> Now, in Conſideration of theſe Things, why ſhould we be obliged to go to Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> to have the Proof of Lands and D eds examined by him, when there is nothing in the Way, the Land Affair not being to be compared with the great Work of Peace, and ſhould not be any Hindrance to our making a League of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Now I will give you my Reaſons for not going.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, I do not know Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi>; he may be an honeſt and ſincere Man. We do underſtand he treats his <hi>Indians</hi> very well; but we are ſenſible that ſome of the Nations are there that have been inſtrumental to this Miſunderſtanding, in ſelling Lands in this Province, having in former Years uſurped that Authority, and called us Women, and threatened to take us by the Foretop, and throw us aſide as Women. But, after a long Space, I believe it is evident, nay, there are Witneſſes preſent, who can prove that it is otherwiſe. Alſo, when I have conſidered theſe ſeveral Particulars, as you told us there was nothing in the Way to hinder us from confirming a durable and laſting Peace, I at preſent deſire nothing at all of my Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for my Lands, I only want, for the Satisfaction of the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Ten Nations</hi> preſent, and alſo of all other <hi>Indians,</hi> that the Deeds may be produced, and well looked into; and as you have told me that Mr. <hi>George Croghan</hi> was the Man that would ſettle Affairs for our Peace, here he is; I want nothing but to ſee the Deeds fairly looked into, and true Copies of them taken and put with theſe Minutes now taken. And, after they have been fairly taken down, if you agree to this, then I ſhall, by two Belts tied together, take you by the Hand, and, with my Uncles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a laſting Peace with you; and if it pleaſe the Governor, and Mr. <hi>Croghan,</hi> let the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the Deeds be ſent to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> and to the King, and let him judge. I want nothing of the Land till the King hath ſent Letters back; then if any of the Lands be found to belong to me, I expect to be paid for it, and not before. Brother, another Reaſon for not going is, if we cannot agree to ſettle this Affair here, I am afraid the Nations that are watching and looking into what is done here, will have Reaſon to think we have not acted an honeſt Part, as they expect a real, true and laſting Peace will be ſettled here. I am alſo concerned on Account of our Women and Children back, and of our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the Frontiers. For theſe now preſent, who it was expected would go Home with great Joy, will go Home with their Finger in their Mouth, as every Body expected this would be the Time of confirming a real and laſting Peace. I told you I would proclaim with a loud Voice, and thoſe preſent are Witneſſes to what I ſaid, and will not be eaſy if this is not done. I think nothing hinders us at all.</p>
               <p>As you told us you had Letters from the King, or Proprietaries, I deſire they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and read, and put down with the Minutes. Now this is the Concluſion, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what I have ſaid, I give you this Belt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King further ſaid, I deſire alſo that a Copy of what paſſed in private between you and me, may be given to be entered with theſe Minutes, and that it may be read in publick at our next Meeting.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Meeting was over, I told the Governor, the Good of His Majeſty's Service required, that <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi>'s Requeſt of having the Deeds and private Conferences read, and Copies of them given him, with a Copy of ſo much of the Proprietaries Letters as relates to having the Enquiry made by Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> ſhould be granted.</p>

                  <hi>TEEDYUSCUNG,</hi> with three <hi>Nanticokes,</hi> who arrived Yeſterday, and three of his Council, came to me at my Lodgings, and deſired I would bear what thoſe <hi>Nanticokes</hi> had to ſay. Upon which the <hi>Nanticoke</hi> Chief made the following Speeches.</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>THE chief Man of the <hi>Nanticokes</hi> has ſent me here, to ſee the Governor and you; and deſired me in his Name to wipe the Tears from your Eyes, which thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Times may have occaſioned; and I do it with this String of Wampum.</p>

               <p>You may have ſwallowed, ſince theſe Troubles aroſe, ſomething bitter, which has given your Heart ſome Uneaſineſs: I, with this String of Wampum, remove all Grief from your Hearts, that your Minds may be as eaſy as they were in Times of Peace.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt conſider, and think it was not the good Spirit that has occaſioned this Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; no, it was the evil Spirit that ſurely occaſioned all this Miſchief, and I hope God will direct us to do every Thing in our Power to aſſiſt in the Good Work of Peace, that we may be once more united together, and live in Friendſhip, as the good Spirit has ordered us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am come here to this Council Fire with our Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi> and you, to give all the Aſſiſtance I can to the good Work of Peace, and to join my Couſin <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to gather up the dead Bodies and ſcattered Bones together, and will join in Prayer to the good Spirit to hide them; and when the Peace is confirmed, I will put both my Hands into the Chain of Friendſhip with you, and our Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi> and the <hi>Six Nations</hi>; to confirm my Words, I give this String of Wampum.</p>

               <p>The Governor told <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that Five o'Clock Yeſterday was appointed for the Time of Meeting; but underſtanding that the King was then particularly engaged with ſome Friends lately come in, be had deferred meeting them till this Morning.</p>
               <p>The Governor ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I HAVE well weighed and conſidered what you ſaid to me at our laſt Meeting, and am ſorry you do not incline to go to Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> to have your Complaints ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and examined by him. It is true Sir <hi>William</hi> has, for ſome Time paſt, had a 
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007921_0015_102E01B2CA3F42B0"/>
general Commiſſion from the King to ſuperintend <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, and that he has given Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> a Power to Act as his Deputy, under which he might have been juſtified in going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Examination as well of your Complaints as the Proprietaries Defence, had not the King's Miniſters lately been pleaſed to direct the Hearing to be before Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> himſelf. Though you may think yourſelves at Liberty, and may reſuſe to comply with theſe Directions, yet, as I told you before, I am the King's Servant, and obliged to obey, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take upon me to go into a Defence of the Proprietaries Title at this Time. But as you ſo earneſtly deſire to ſee the Deeds for the Lands mentioned in your laſt Treaty, that you may be ſatisfied whether they are genuine, or whether the <hi>Indians</hi> who ſigned them had a Right to ſell thoſe Lands, I have brought them with me, and am willing to ſhew them to you now, or at any other Time you will appoint, and give you Copies of them, agreeable to your Requeſt.</p>
               <p>Here the Deeds were laid down on the Table.</p>
               <p>And now let all further Debates and Altercations concerning Lands reſt here, till they ſhall be fully examined and looked into by Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> in order to be tranſmitted to the King for His Royal Determination.</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>After having now gratified you in every reaſonable Requeſt, and being ſincerely deſirous to re-eſtabliſh that Friendſhip and brotherly Love which ſo happily ſubſiſted between your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and ours, I am ready, with the King's Deputy Agent, to take hold of the two Belts you mentioned with both my Hands, and confirm a laſting Peace, and exchange them with one prepared for that Purpoſe, in the Name of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and all His Subjects, as ſoon as we can agree upon the Terms.</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>The Orders of His Majeſty's Miniſters, on this Occaſion, have been ſignified to me by the Proprietaries, which is the proper Channel through which they ſhould come. That you may the better underſtand this, it will be neceſſary to inform you, that the Proprietaries are Governors in Chief over this Province, and I am appointed their Deputy, with the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Crown. When, therefore, the laſt Treaty was laid before the King's Miniſters, they gave the Proprietaries Notice of their Reſolution, that the Matter ſhould be heard before Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> only, to whom they would ſend ſpecial Directions for that Purpoſe. The Proprietaries, for whom I act in this Caſe, have made me acquainted with the Miniſters Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and deſired me to regulate my Conduct by them. It would have been irregular and improper to have ſent the Order itſelf to me, but I do not doubt the King's Miniſters have tranſmitted it to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> as an Authority for him to hear and examine our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and that he has received it before this Time. As I could not ſuſpect that you would have required a Copy of ſuch of the Proprietaries Letters as relate to this Matter, I did not bring them with me here; wherefore, it is not in my Power to comply with your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to furniſh you with Copies of them; and to confirm the Truth of this, I give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>
               <p>When the Governor had ended his Speech, he aſked the King whether he would have the Deeds read now, and Copies taken. Before the King returned an Anſwer, he took up the Belt which the Governor had juſt delivered, and riſing up, ſpoke firſt to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and then to the <hi>Five Nations</hi>; then turning to the Governor, ſaid,</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>I underſtand the Words you have ſaid here, but they are not agreeable to your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor a full Anſwer to what I ſaid. There are two Things not agreeable.</p>
               <p>The Governor ſaid, Will the King pleaſe to tell what theſe two Things are. No, replied the King, let the Governor find them out. The Governor ſaid, he did not know what the King meant; he wiſhed he knew what Anſwer to make.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then ſaid, If it pleaſe the Governor, in a few Words, what has been ſpoken on that Belt is as a Rumbling over the Earth, or Confuſion about Lands. I did not want you to make Mention of them, when I expected an Anſwer in a loving Manner. I wanted you ſhould come to the main Point, without having ſo many Words with it.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeemed very much at a Loſs about the Governor's Speech, I ſpoke to the King, and told him, that the firſt Part of the Governor's Speech was only to inform the King that the Deeds are now produced, and Copies will be given to him, agreeable to his own Requeſt, that they may be ſent to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> to be by him tranſmitted to the King 
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007921_0016_102E01B4660D4988"/>
for His Determination. This done, we in the next Place now offer to take hold of the two Belts you mentioned at the laſt Meeting: That what was ſaid about agreeing upon Terms, only referred to the Exchange of Priſoners, and other Things uſual on making Peace; which <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid he would do after the Peace was confirmed: That in the Concluſion of his Speech, the Governor only told the King, that the Proprietaries Letters, for a Copy of which the King aſked, were at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for which Reaſon the Governor could not comply with what the King requeſted, but that an Extract of as much of them as referred to this Affair, will be delivered to me ſome Time hence: In Confirmation of which the Governor gave the Belt.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the King heard this, he roſe up, and taking up the two Belts tied together, he ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>I deſire you would with Attention hear me. By theſe two Belts I will let you know what was the ancient regular Method of confirming a laſting Peace. This you ought to have conſidered, and to have done; but I will put you in Mind. You may remember, when you took hold of my Hand, and led me down, and invited my Uncles, ſeveral of whom are preſent, with ſome from each of the <hi>Ten Nations,</hi> when we had agreed we came down to take hold of one of your Hands, and my Uncles came to take hold of the other Hand. Now, as this Day and this Time is appointed to meet and confirm a laſting Peace, we, that is, I and my Uncles, as we ſtand, and you, as you ſtand in the Name of the Great King, three of us ſtanding, we will all look up, and by continuing to obſerve the Agreements by which we ſhall oblige ourſelves one to another, we ſhall ſee the clear Light, and Friendſhip ſhall laſt to us, and our Poſterity after us, for ever. Now, as I have two Belts, and Witneſſes are preſent who will ſpeak the ſame, by theſe Belts, Brothers, in the Preſence of the <hi>Ten Nations,</hi> who are Witneſſes, I lay hold of your Hand (taking the Governor by the Hand) and brighten the Chain of Friendſhip that ſhall be laſting; and whatever Conditions ſhall be proper for us to agree to, may be mentioned afterwards: This is the Time to declare our mutual Friendſhip. Now, Brother the Governor, to confirm what I have ſaid, I have given you my Hand, which you were pleaſed to riſe and take hold of; I leave it with you. When you pleaſe, I am ready. Brother, if you have any Thing to ſay as a Token of confirming the Peace, I ſhall be ready to hear; and as you aroſe, I will riſe up, and lay hold of your Hand. To confirm what I have ſaid, I give you theſe Belts. <hi>Gave two Belts tied together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor ſaid, that he and I would be ready to give an Anſwer preſently.</p>
               <p>Then the King taking out another Belt, ſaid, If the Governor pleaſe, I have a Word or two more to ſay to you. In remembering the old ancient Rules of making Friendſhip, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I was formerly repreſented as a Woman by my Uncles, the <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Five Nations</hi>; but they gave me a Pipe, and good Tobacco; thoſe preſent know it to be true; and what I ſay is in Behalf of all thoſe preſent, and thoſe afar off. That Pipe and good Tobacco of Friendſhip, I now deliver to you. Brother, when you ſhall ſmoke that good Tobacco, it will give you ſuch a Reliſh, that you ſhall feel it as long as the Sun ſhines. That very good Tobacco and Pipe that I ſhall deliver into your Hand, repreſents among us a perpetual Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Now I deliver you an equal Part of it, and I deſire it may be a laſting Comfort in this World, and the World to come. <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had confirmed the Peace in Behalf of the <hi>Ten Nations</hi> he repreſents, his Honour the Governor, and myſelf, confirmed it in Behalf of the King, and all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and exchanged the Belts in the following Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Teedyuſcung, <hi>and all our Brethren of the</hi> Ten Nations,</p>
               <p>We your Brethren, all His Majeſty's Subjects now preſent, have heard with Satisfaction what you have ſaid, and with great Pleaſure receive the two Belts you have given us, which will confirm a laſting Peace to us and our Poſterity, and we embrace this Meeting to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with you a Belt of Friendſhip, and take hold of you with one Hand, and of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> with the other, and confirm, in the Name of the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and all His Subjects, a laſting Peace, that may continue as long as the Sun and Moon give Light; and we hope this Day may be always held in Remembrance by our Poſterity; and we will be ready to conſult with you at any Time about ſettling other Matters, as you yourſelf have ſaid. We now riſe and take you into our Arms, and embrace you with the greateſt Pleaſure as our Friends and Brethren, and heartily deſire we may ever hereaſter look on one another as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Children of the ſame Parents: As a Confirmation of this we give you this Belt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a very large white Belt, with the Figures of three Men in it, repreſenting His Majeſty King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> taking hold of the <hi>Five Nation</hi> King with one Hand, and <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung,</hi> the <hi>Delaware</hi> King, with the other, and marked with the following Letters and Figure, <hi>G. R. 5 N. D. K.</hi> for King <hi>GEORGE, Five Nations, Delaware</hi> King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:007921_0017_102E01B6D1152F28"/>
This done, the King again aſked the Governor for a Copy of the Conferences that had been held in private, that they might be read in Publick, and entered with the Minutes. The Governor ſaid it was ready, and ſhould be delivered immediately, and one was ſent for it. The Governor then aſked the King when it would be agreeable to him to have the Deeds read. The King ſaid, To-morrow Morning, between Seven and Eight a Clock; which Time was accordingly agreed on; and the Reading of the Private Conferences was deferred till that Time.</p>
               <p>I think it neceſſary to inſert here the following Speech of <hi>Laboughpeton,</hi> a <hi>Delaware</hi> Chief, made to <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> at the Time he ſeemed at a Loſs about the Governor's Speech to him, which is as follows.</p>
               <p>"What, has not our Brother deſired you to bring us down by the Hand to make Peace? why don't you do it? We have been here theſe twenty Days, and have heard nothing but ſcolding and diſputing about Lands: Settle the Peace, and let all theſe Diſputes ſtand till after."</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Meeting was over, I let the Governor know I could not help taking Notice, that there was one Deed relative to thoſe Lands wanting, which is mentioned in a Treaty held by this Government with the <hi>Indians</hi> in 1728, ſaid there to be dated in 1718, and that I expected to ſee that Deed, and have a Copy of it; and likewiſe Extracts of ſo much of the Proprietaries Letter to him as relates to the Deſire of His Majeſty's Miniſters, ſignifying to them, that they ordered the Differences ſubſiſting between them and the <hi>Indians</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by Sir <hi>William Johnſon.</hi> And that as <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> in Anſwer to a Meſſage his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had ſent by Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> to him Yeſterday Morning (which will appear as follows) ſaid, that he would be contented, ſo he ſee all the Deeds relative to theſe Back Lands now in Diſpute, and have Copies of them, and of the Proprietaries Letter; and further ſaid, as ſoon as that was done, he would not ſay one Word more about the Diſputes about Lands; I then let his Honour know, as <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had now confirmed the Peace, I expected his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would now furniſh me with a Copy of that Deed, and the Proprietaries Letter to him.</p>

                  <hi>Eaſton, Auguſt</hi> 2, 1757.</head>
               <p>THIS Morning <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſent <hi>Samuel Evans</hi> for me to come to him at Colonel <hi>Weiſer's</hi> Lodging: I went there, and found him with five of his Counſellors, and Mr. <hi>Weiſer.</hi> Upon my coming in, Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> told <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> that he wanted to have ſome Converſation with him. <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> aſked him if it was by Order of the Governor. Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> replied, it was by Conſent of the Governor and Council.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> then aſked <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> whether he wanted to ſee all the Deeds of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince from the firſt Purchaſes, or only thoſe relating to the Back Lands where we are. Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> ſaid, the Reaſon for his aſking was, that he believed the whole of the Deeds were not brought up, but ſuch only as were thought neceſſary, and relating to his Complaint, and the late Purchaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> anſwered, I ſhould be well pleaſed to have ſeen all the Deeds, as the Country to the Sea Shore was firſt ours; but if there be the Deeds for theſe Back Lands, which is the main Point, I will be contented, ſo that I ſee them, and have Copies of them, and of the Letters from the King's Miniſters or Proprietaries; as ſoon as that is done, I will not ſay one Word more about the Differences or Lands, but confirm the Peace as ſoon as that is done.</p>
               <p>This Evening the Governor wrote me, that his Letter from the Proprietaries was in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> Extracts of which he would give me as ſoon as I went to Town. And he aſſured me, that he would give me a Copy of the Deed mentioned in the Treaty of 1728.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE Conferences held in Council between the Governor and King <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> were produced, and read; and to them was added, by Order of the King, and approved by the Governor, a Paragraph relating to the King's inſiſting a ſecond Time on having a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and the Governor's Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Deeds ſhewn Yeſterday were again produced, and <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was told, that Mr. <hi>Charles Thompſon,</hi> his Secretary, had got Copies of them, and compared them with the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and was aſked if he choſe to ſee the Originals. The King ſaid, I am ſatisfied, as my Secretary has ſeen the Copies compared. If he is ſatisfied that they are true Copies, I am ſatisfied that they ſhould be ſent to the King for His Determination; then aſked Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> if he had ſeen them compared. Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſaid, he had ſeen and compared all the Deeds that were delivered Yeſterday. The King then deſired an Account of what Deeds were produced, which was accordingly taken, and is as follows. 1. A Paper Copy of the laſt <hi>Indian</hi> Purchaſe, 28th of <hi>Sixth Month,</hi> 1686. 2. A Releaſe from the <hi>Delaware Indians, Auguſt</hi> 25, 1737. 3. A Releaſe of the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> of the Lands on <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehannab</hi> River, <hi>October</hi> 11, 1736. 4. A Releaſe from the <hi>Six Nations</hi> of Lands Eaſtward to <hi>Delaware</hi> River, dated <hi>October</hi> 25, 1736, with another indorſed on it, dated the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> 1754. 5. A Deed of Releaſe for <hi>Indian</hi> Purchaſe, dated the 22d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1749.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The above Deeds were ſhewn in open Council, and Copies of them delivered to <hi>Teedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcung,</hi> which his Secretary acknowledged he had compared with the Originals, and that they were true Copies.</p>
               <p>When this was done, the Governor ſpoke to <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Teedyuſcung, <hi>and all our Brethren of the</hi> Ten Nations.</p>
               <p>As you and all His Majeſty's Subjects are now united again in the firm Bands of Peace, it is our Duty to do every Thing in our Power to make each other happy; and it was ſtipulated at the Conferences held at this Place laſt Sommer, that all Priſoners you had taken ſhould be delivered up.</p>
               <p>The Relations of thoſe who yet remain Priſoners amongſt you, have their Eyes fixed on me, expecting at my Return to ſee their Friends reſtored to them; but as few of them are brought down, and this will be a Bar to our Happineſs, it is neceſſary for you to do every Thing in your Power to reſtore to us, as ſoon as poſſible, all our People that remain Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners amongſt any of your Nations; and to procure thoſe who are among any other Tribes in Amity with you, to be ſent to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Rule among Nations, upon confirming a Peace, to deliver up all Priſoners on both Sides. It is the only Method we can take to convince each other of our Sincerity; and we do inſiſt on this being done. You will be ſo good, immediately on your Return, to convey them down by ſome of your young Men, who ſhall be well rewarded for their Trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Governor had delivered his Speech, and gave the Belt, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid, I will take no other Belt but the very ſame I have. Why have you done this now? Why did you 
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007921_0019_102DC827CE82BCA8"/>
not do it before? After we had finiſhed, why do you make any Words about ſuch Things? This was your Duty; you ought to have done it before. If you really believed I would be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt, you might be ſure I would do it without your delivering a Belt. Now, as you have mentioned theſe Things, I alſo will mention, that you muſt deliver me my juſt Due about Lands. As you mention that your People look to you, expecting to ſee their Relations ſent back at this Treaty, ſo the Nations that lay Claim to theſe Lands look to me for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Returned the Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor told <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that he did not do this, as if he had diſtruſted his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the King having already given a full Proof of that, by delivering up ſome Priſoners. for which he thanked him; that he only meant to put the King in Mind of his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>I then told <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that before the Peace was concluded, when I was explaining to him the Governor's Speech, that Part of it where the Governor ſays, "as ſoon as we can agree upon the Terms," related intirely to the Exchange of Priſoners, and <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid, that ſhould be ſettled afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then applied to his Secretary, to know if any ſuch Thing had been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and being informed by his Secretary, that it was entered in the Minutes, he (<hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung</hi>) then roſe up, and, having firſt conſulted with his own People, and the <hi>Five Nations</hi> ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, the Governor,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pleaſe to hear me in few Words. What you told me I have told to my Uncles the <hi>Six Nations</hi> preſent, and alſo to all the <hi>Ten Nations.</hi> We have conſulted on theſe Words that you have now ſpoken: We now think they were very proper, and are very agreeable: We look on it as our Duty: Why ſhould we keep your Fleſh and Blood, or any of your People, when we have agreed as one, and look on one another as one, and treat one another as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? After we have all conſidered, and all preſent have heard, we beg your Pardon, that we forgot to give you an Anſwer immediately. As it was written down by our Clerk in the Minutes Yeſterday, it muſt be ſo; and as we are now ſenſible this Matter was mentioned Yeſterday, we accept your Words, and look on it as our Duty to anſwer you, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; whatever ſhall be in our Power, we ſhall endeavour to do. In Confirmation of which I give you my Hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave the Governor his Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Speech the Governor again delivered back the Belt to the King, who readily accepted it.</p>
               <p>The Governor then told the <hi>Indians,</hi> that a Preſent was prepared, and would be delivered to them To-morrow, as a Token of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>I told <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that as the Buſineſs was now nearly finiſhed with <hi>Onas,</hi> I had ſomething to ſay to him, in the Name of the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that I would let him know when I was to ſpeak to him.</p>
               <p>After the Council broke up, the Governor ſent for <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and ſome of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, to his Lodgings, from whence we went to Mr. <hi>Vernon</hi>'s, where an handſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was provided, at which were preſent, the Governor, his Council, the Speaker, and Members of Aſſembly, the Commiſſioners and Gentlemen in Town; the <hi>Delaware</hi> King, his Counſellors, Warriors, and all the <hi>Indians,</hi> Men, Women and Children, in Number about Three Hundred. After Dinner Peace was proclaimed in Form, and the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion interpreted to the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Six Nations</hi>; at the Cloſe of which, the Governor, by his Secretary, expreſſed his Satisfaction at being one of the happy Inſtruments of bringing about this Peace. His Honour recommended it to all Ranks and Profeſſions of Men, to cultivate, to the utmoſt of their Power, a good Underſtanding with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to treat them kindly, that they may daily ſee the Advantage of preſerving our Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Having given this in Charge to the Freeholders preſent, be deſired <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> to do the ſame to his People, that we might on both Sides forget what was paſt, and live affectionately together for the Time to come. A Detachment of the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Troops was drawn up in the Front of the Company, and fired three Vollies.</p>
               <p>The Governor afterwards continued his Entertainment, at which there was a great Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. At Night was a large Bonfire, and a Variety of <hi>Indian</hi> Dances.</p>

                  <hi>The Governor then addreſſed the</hi> Indians <hi>as follows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Peace, ſo happily concluded, gives an univerſal Joy. I ſhall proclaim it far and wide, that all may hear and know it. The People of this Province are diſpoſed to obſerve it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and will do the <hi>Indians</hi> every good Office in their Power.</p>
               <p>Altho' we have now ſo ſolemnly entered into this Peace with each other, yet you are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there are ſtill many Enemy <hi>Indians,</hi> who are daily doing Miſchief on our Frontiers. Yeſterday I received an Account of one Woman's being killed, and four Perſons taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, between <hi>Tolbao</hi> and <hi>Monaidy.</hi> As it will therefore be very difficult to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Friends and our Enemies, I ſhould be glad you would favour me with your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice how to act in ſuch a Manner, as not to hurt our Friends, or ſuffer our Enemies to eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor, and People of this Province, obſerve, with a brotherly Compaſſion, the many Difficulties to which the <hi>Indians</hi> are expoſed in theſe troubleſome Times, and have therefore provided a Quantity of Goods to ſupply them in their Diſtreſs. You will, on your Return Home, proclaim the Peace, Union and Friendſhip, which is now eſtabliſhed between us, and let every one know, as you have Opportunity, how well diſpoſed you have ſound us. Accept theſe Preſents, as a Teſtimony of the ſincere Affection of us your Brethren towards you.</p>
               <p>To <hi>this</hi> Teedyuſcung <hi>replied,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am obliged to you for putting me in Remembrance of theſe Things. I will take them into Conſideration, and To-morrow, when I am ready to give you an Anſwer, I will let you know. He further added,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſomething which we intended to ſay before, but forgot, as we have not the Uſe of Writing. But better late than never; we will therefore mention it now. The Copy of the Deeds, and the Tranſactions of this Treaty, we entruſt to our Clerk. We believe him to be an honeſt Man. Every Thing is done to Perfection. We hope you will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his making out a Copy, and giving it to Mr. <hi>Iſaac Norris,</hi> whom we alſo appoint for us, to tranſmit to the King a Copy of the Deeds and Minutes of the Treaty, that, if one ſhould miſearry, the other may go ſafe.</p>
               <p>On which I acquainted <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that the Governor and myſelf had no Objection to Mr. <hi>Norris</hi>'s having true Copies of the Minutes of theſe Conferences and Deeds, to ſend to the King, as he requeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:007921_0021_102E01BF9455A870"/>
Then, by Order of the Governor, Proclamation was made, that no One ſhould cheat, defraud or purchaſe any of the Goods now ready to be given to the <hi>Indians,</hi> upon the Pain and Penalties that may fall thereon.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid, he had yet one Thing more to mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſome Complaints to make about Lands in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> in Behalf of myſelf, <hi>John Pumpſhire, Moſes Tetamy,</hi> and others; which Complaints are contained in theſe two Papers: And as you repreſent Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> the King's Agent here, I deſire you may take them under your Conſideration, and ſee that Juſtice is done us on that Account, as it is the King's Orders to you, to ſee Juſtice done to all the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then ordered Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> to read the Papers, and give me true Copies of them, which he did immediately in publick Council.</p>
               <p>The Papers delivered me are, a Copy of an old <hi>Indian</hi> Deed; and a Letter of Complaint about Lands in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> ſigned by <hi>John Pumpſhire</hi>; I then acquainted him, that I would take the Papers under my Conſideration, and give him an Anſwer.</p>

               <p>THIS Morning I expected to have had a Meeting with the <hi>Indians,</hi> but as the friendly Aſſociation of <hi>Quakers</hi> had called the <hi>Indians</hi> together, to deliver them a Preſent, the <hi>Indians</hi> thought proper to put off the Meeting for this Time.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I will, in Anſwer to what you tell me, let you know what I intend to do. I ſhall, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I promiſed to ſpeak with a loud Voice to the Nations, perform my Promiſe, and ſpeak to the different Nations. I will faithfully let them know what you have promiſed, and, as we are Witneſſes that you are wealthy and powerful, and well diſpoſed to aſſiſt ſuch as ſhall come in as Brothers, I will let them know it. And alſo, as I think it is very proper that I ſhould do ſo, and as I think it my Duty, whatever Nation I ſee coming againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whenever I ſee them, I will make ready, and do every Thing in my Power to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Cauſe of myſelf, and of my Brethren. If I am able, I will let them go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than where I tell them to ſtop. If they will not, by reaſonable Terms, turn about, and join with me, I will then either make an End of them, or they of me. And if there is a great Number, ſo that I may not be able to withſtand them, I will take all prudent Steps to let my Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> know. And alſo, if I perceive that there is ſo great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is not ſafe for my Women and Children, I will acquaint my Brethren the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> that they may aſſiſt me in defending my Women and Children, and I will leave my Country, and bring them down to you.</p>
               <p>Now, you may remember I was ſtiled by my Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> a Woman in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Years, and had no Hatchet in my Hand, but a Peſtle or Hominy Pounder, but now, Brethren, here are ſome of my Uncles, who are preſent, to witneſs the Truth of this; as I had no Tomahawk, and my Uncles were always ſtiled Men, and had Tomahawks in their Hands, they gave me a Tomahawk. And as my Uncles have given me the Tomahawk, and appointed and authorized me to make Peace with a Tomahawk in my Hand, I take that Tomahawk, and turn the Edge of it againſt your Enemies the <hi>French.</hi> In Confirmation of what I now ſay, I give you this String.</p>

               <p>I have juſt a Word or two more. I remember what you have ſpoken, in order that we may prevent any Miſchief, by having a Signal: I ſhould be glad that the <hi>French</hi> may not deceive us, that not one but ſeveral Signs and Methods may be fixed on by you. And whatever you ſhall think proper, I will agree to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then returned <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> Thanks for his kind Speech, and let him know that I would conſult with the Governor about ſettling the Signals, and would give him an Anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then taking up four Belts, and a String, ſpoke to his Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> telling them, that as they had empowered him, he had, in the Preſence of theſe Witneſſes they had ſent, made a firm Peace with their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; he, therefore, by theſe Belts deſired, that they would perform their Part; and as they ſaid they would take hold of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by one Hand, and he by the other, he had now done it. And as the Chain of Friendſhip was now brightened, he deſired they would be ſtrong, and if they ſee any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies coming againſt us, they would look on it, that whoever ſtrikes any one of us ſtrikes all. Theſe Belts he gave to <hi>Anaquateeka,</hi> and deſired he would carry them to the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>

               <p>I heartily thank you for being ſo kind as to wipe the Sweat from our Faces, picking out the Briars, and taking away all bad Thoughts from our Minds, and cleaning the Paſſage from the Heart to the Throat, that we may ſee our Brethren, and be well from all our Wounds. By theſe Strings we return you Thanks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then the young Warrior, <hi>Anaquateeka,</hi> aroſe, and, directing his Speech to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and his Couſins, ſaid,</p>

               </p>
               <p>My Couſins have entruſted me with all that was here tranſacted, reſpecting the great Work of Peace here confirmed, to lay it before the <hi>Six Nations.</hi> I aſſure you I will execute the Truſt repoſed in me with Faithfulneſs, and lay it before the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> particularly before the <hi>Senecas,</hi> to whom I belong.

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With Pleaſure I acquaint you, that Peace is now concluded, and it will add much to the Joy all feel on this ſucceſsful Iſſue of our Conferences; and I am glad to ſee you and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> here to take hold of the Peace Belt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were in Hopes to have ſeen you with <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> when he came here. We heard you was not come, but would follow: I have ſtaid ſome Time in Expectation of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. I ſhould have been glad to have ſpent more Time with you, but the Buſineſs of the Government obliges me to return to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> this Afternoon, ſo that you will pleaſe to uſe Diſpatch in letting me know any Thing you may have to ſay to us.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed this Speech, the Governor told <hi>Packſinoſa,</hi> that ſome Preſents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him and his Friends, which ſhould be delivered preſently.</p>
               <p>Teedyuſcung <hi>then addreſſing himſelf to the Governor, ſpoke as follows</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have a Word or two more to ſay. You know when you employ your Soldiers, they are paid for their Services. As I am joined with you, you being rich, and I poor, as I am going againſt your Enemies, and carrying my Fleſh againſt them, I think it would be proper, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of my young Men, to appoint ſome Reward for Scalps, and Priſoners, and that ſome Place may be fixed, where the Scalps and Priſoners may be brought in, and the Reward received, that my Men may return quickly from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007921_0024_102E01C7B8B9DDA8"/>
Then the Governor ſaid, he would take into Conſideration what he, <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> had ſaid, and in Half an Hour would return an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> further added; You may remember, when I mentioned <hi>Iſaac Norris,</hi> the Speaker, I mentioned him alone; but I did not intend to mention him alone, but that he, with the Aſſembly, ſhould look into it, and ſend Copies Home.—I then told <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung,</hi> that I had no Objection to Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> with the Aſſembly, ſending authentick Copies of the Minutes of this Treaty, and Deeds, Home.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE have now finiſhed. The Treaty is over. Peace is confirmed. I told you I thought of going to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> but upon conſidering the Matter with more At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, I think it will be more for the publick Service if I proceed immediately to <hi>Diahogo:</hi> Many Nations will be uneaſy to know what has been done at this Council-Fire, and will take their Meaſures accordingly; I ſhall therefore make the beſt of my Way to <hi>Diahogo,</hi> and proclaim there, and to Nations ſtill more diſtant, the Confirmation of the Peace with our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This will take up three or four Months; after which I may perhaps come and ſee you at <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> I wiſh the Governor a good Journey, and that we may both live to enjoy the Fruits of this happy Peace, which gives my People great Joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which the Governor returned the following Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother</hi> Teedyuſcung,</p>
               <p>It gives me great Pleaſure that we have brought the important Buſineſs we met about to ſo happy an Iſſue. You have very agreeably prevented my mentioning to you the Neceſſity of your returning Home, in order to publiſh to the <hi>Indians</hi> what has been tranſacted here. I thank you for the Change of your Purpoſe: It is a further Sign of your Zeal for Peace, and I make no Doubt but you will uſe your utmoſt Diſpatch.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to what you requeſted this Morning, I aſſure you that your Warriors will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find this Government ready to reward them for any Services they ſhall do againſt the Enemy. I cannot at preſent give you a more particular Anſwer, but ſhall lay your Propoſals before the Aſſembly, who meet To-morrow, and conſult with them thereupon.</p>
               <p>Teedyuſcung <hi>replied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, the Governor,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have not ſo much as given us a ruſty Iron to defend ourſelves. If we meet an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on the Road, what are we to do? We cannot defend ourſelves againſt him. We have nothing to do it with. Our young Warriors think as much of themſelves, and their Lives are as dear to them as white People's. But you have not given them any Encouragement to go againſt the Enemy. Can this be right? You know you have not. Conſider this well Brother.</p>
               <p>Further, Brother, I think it proper to tell you, if <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> ſhall go to War to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, my young Men will not be ſubject to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain; and if any of your People will go to War with me, I expect they will be ſubject to my Directions: We underſtand our own Way of Fighting better than you.</p>
               <p>The Governor then ſaid he had given Directions to Colonel <hi>Weiſer</hi> to agree with him on proper Signals for the <hi>Indians,</hi> when they were coming towards the inhabited Parts of this Province, as this was a Matter that ought not to be ſpoke of in Publick.</p>
               <p>They then took a kind Leave of each other, and the Governor ſet out for <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
