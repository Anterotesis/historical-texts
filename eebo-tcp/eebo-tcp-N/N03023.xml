            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ONE Reaſon which moved me to write and Print this little Book, was, Becauſe, tho' there are many excellent Heart-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes in the World, that tend to convert the Sinner: yet I had a Deſire to my this ſimple Method of mine; Wherefore I make bold thus to invite and incourage the Worſt to come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Life.</p>
            <p>I have been Vile myſelf, but have obtained Mercy, and I would have my Companions in Sin partake of Mercy too, &amp; therefore I have writ this BOOK.</p>
            <p>The Nation doth ſwarm with vile Ones now, as ever it did ſince it was a Nation. My Book in ſome places can ſcarce go from Houſe to Houſe, but twill find a ſuitable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſpread it ſelf upon. Now ſince <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is willing to ſave the vileſt, why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A great Sinner, when converted ſeems a Booty to Jeſus Chriſt, he gets by ſaving

ſuch an one; why then ſhould both Jeſus loſe his Glory and the Sinner loſe his Soul at once, &amp; that for want of an Invitation?</p>
            <p>I have found, thro' God's Grace, good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in preaching upon this Subject, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo I may, by my writing upon it too: I have, as you ſee, let down this Net for a Draught, the Lord catch ſome great Fiſhes by it, for the magnifying of his Truth. There are ſome moſt vile in all Mens Eyes, and ſome are ſo in their own Eyes too; but ſome have the Paintings to ſhroud Vileneſs under, yet they are naked and open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do: And for all theſe, God hath ſent a Saviour Jeſus; &amp; to all theſe the Door is opene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to her Preference or Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhe was the place of God's Worſhip, and that which had in and with her the ſpecial Tokens and Signs of God's Favour and Preſence, above any other People in the World. Hence the Tribes went up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to worſhip, there was God's Houſe; God's High Prieſt, God's Sacrifices accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and God's Eye, and God's Heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1 Kings 9.3.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to conſider <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in her Decays; for as ſhe is ſo conſidered, ſhe is the proper Object of our Text, as will be further ſhewed by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as I told you, was the place and ſeat of God's Worſhip, but now decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, degenerated, and apoſtatized. The Word, the Rule of Worſhip, was rejected of them, and in its place they had ſet up their own Traditions, they had rejected alſo the moſt weighty Ordinances, &amp; put in the room thereof their own little things (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.) <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was therefore now greatly back ſlidden, and become the place where Truth and true Religion was much defaced.</p>
            <p>It was alſo now become the very ſink of Sin, the ſeat of Hypocriſie, &amp; the Gulf where true Religion was drowned: Here alſo now reigned Preſumption and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003637_0005_10023A39A5CC3560"/>
Confidence in GOD, which is the bane of Souls. Amongſt its Rulers, Doctors and Leaders, Envy, Malice, &amp; Blaſphemy vented it ſelf againſt the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all places where it was eſpied: As alſo againſt the Promoters of it; yea their Lord and Maker could not eſcape them.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was now become the Shambles, the very Slaughter-ſhop for Saints. This was the place wherein the Prophets, Chriſt, and his People, were moſt horribly perſecuted and murdered. Yea, ſo hardned at this time was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in her Sins, that ſhe feared not to commit the biggeſt, and to bind her ſelf by Wiſh, under the Guilt and damning Evil of it; ſaying, when ſhe had murdered the Son of God, <hi>His blood be upon us and our Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did both by Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Miracles, and Holineſs of Life, ſeek to put a ſtop to their Villanies; yet they ſhut their Eyes, ſtop their Ears, and reſted not, till (as was hinted before) they had driven him out of the World. Yea that they might, if poſſible, have extinguiſhed his Name, and exploded his Doctrine out of the World; they againſt all Arguments, and in deſpite of heaven, its mighty Hand, and undeniable Proof of his Reſurrection; did hire Souldiers to invent a lye, ſaying, <hi>his Diſciples ſtole him away from the Grave</hi>; on purpoſe that Men might not count him

the Saviour of the World, nor truſt in him for the Remiſſion of Sins.</p>
            <p>They were, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> contrary to all Men: For they did not only ſhut up the Door of Life againſt themſelves; but forbid that it ſhould be opened to any elſe. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to preach to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they might be ſaved, to fill up their Sin always, Mat.</hi> 23.35. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15 7, 8, 9. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>to</hi> 9. <hi>John</hi> 8.33, 41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.30. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.65. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.33, 34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27, 25. <hi>Ch.</hi> 20.11, <hi>to the</hi> 15.1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 14 15 16.</p>
            <p>This is the City, and theſe are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this is their Character, and theſe are their Sins. Nor can there be produced their parallel in all this World. Nay, what World, what People, what Nation, for Sin and Tranſgreſſion, could, or can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>! Eſpecially if you ioyn to the matter of Fact, the Light they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt, and the Patience which they abuſed. Infinite was the Wickedneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account which they committed.</p>
            <p>After all their Abuſings of wiſe Men, &amp; Prophets, God ſent unto them <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> to reduce them, and then his Son to redeem them; but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed, but perſecuted both to the Death.

            <p>And now to come to this <hi>Clauſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Jeruſalem</hi>: That is, that Chriſt would have <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> have the firſt offer of the Goſpel.</p>

            <p n="3">3. It muſt therefore follow that the <hi>clauſe begun at Jeruſalem</hi> was put into this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

of meer Grace and Compaſſion: Even from the overflowing of the Bowels of Mercy: For indeed they were the worſt, and ſo in the moſt deplorable Condition of any People under the Heaven.</p>
            <p>Whatever therefore their Relation was to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> however they formerly had been the People among whom God had placed his Name and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; they were now degenerated from God more than the Nations were from their Idols, and were become Guilty of the higheſt Sins which the People of the World were capable of committing. Nay none can be capable of committing of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Sins they committed againſt their God, when they ſlew his Son, and perſecuted his Name and Word.</p>
            <p>From theſe Words therefore, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, we gain this Obſervation,</p>
            <p>That Jeſus Chriſt would have Mercy offer'd in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners.</p>
            <p>That theſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Sinners were the biggeſt that ever were in the World, I think none will deny, that believes that Chriſt was the beſt Man that ever was in the World, and alſo was their Lord God. And that they were to have the firſt offer of his Grace, the Text is as clear as the Sun; for it ſaith, <hi>Begin at Jeruſalem. Preach,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Repentance &amp; Remiſſion of Sins, in the firſt place to the Jeruſalem Sinners.</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003637_0007_10023A42CB37FE78"/>One would have thought, ſince the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem Sinners</hi> were the worſt, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sinners, Chriſt's greateſt Enemies, and thoſe that not only deſpiſed his Perſon, Doctrine, &amp; Miracles, but that a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had had their Hands up to their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows in his Hearts Blood. That he ſhould rather have ſaid, Go into all the World, &amp; preach Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins among all Nations, and after that, the ſame to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: Yea, it had been infinite Grace if he had ſaid ſo: But what Grace is this? Or what Name ſhall we give it, when he Commands that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Remiſſion of Sins which is deſigned to be preached in all Nations, ſhould firſt be offered to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the worſt of Sinners?</p>
            <p>Nor was this the firſt time that the Grace which was in the Heart of Chriſt, thus ſhewed it ſelf to the World.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe therefore muſt have the <hi>Cream</hi> of the Goſpel, namely, the firſt <hi>offer</hi> thereof in his Life-time: Yea, when he departed out of the World, he left this as part of his laſt Will with his Preachers, that they alſo ſhould offer it <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> He had a mind, as it ſeems, to priviledge the worſt of Sinners with the firſt offer of Mercy; and to take from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>them,</hi> a People to be the firſt Fruits unto GOD and to the LAMB. The 15th of <hi>Luke</hi> alſo is famous for this, Where the Lord Jeſus takes more Care, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears here by three Parables, for the loſt Sheep, loſt Groat, and the Prodigal Son, than for the other Sheep, the other Pence, or for the Son that ſaid he had never tranſgreſſed. Yea, he ſhews that there is Joy in Heaven, among the Angels of GOD, at the Repentance of one Sinner, more than over Ninety and Nine Juſt Perſons, which need no Repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003637_0008_10023A7DC8F54DF0"/>After this manner therefore the Mind of CHRIST was ſet on the Salvation of the biggeſt Sinners in his Life-time. But join to this, <hi>this</hi> Clauſe, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put into the Apoſtles Commiſſion to preach, when he departed hence to the Father, and then you ſhall ſee that his, Heart was vehemently ſet upon it; for theſe were part of his laſt Words with them, <hi>Preach the Goſpel to all Nations, but ſee that you do begin at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did the Apoſtles overlook this Clauſe, when their Lord was gone into Heaven: They went firſt to them of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> &amp; Preached Chriſt's Goſpel to them. They abode alſo there for a Seaſon, and preached it to no body elſe, for they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Commandments of their Lord.</p>
            <p>And it is to be obſerved, namely, that the firſt Sermon which they preached, was to the very worſt of theſe <hi>Jeruſalem Sinners</hi>; even to thoſe that were the Murderers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 2.23. For theſe are part of the Sermon: <hi>Ye took him and by wicked Hands have Crucified and ſlain him.</hi> Yea, the three next Sermons was preached to the ſelf-ſame Murderers, to the end they might be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.14.</p>
            <p>But we will return to the firſt Sermon that was preached to thoſe <hi>Jeruſalem Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> by which will be manifeſt more than great Grace, if it be duly conſidered.</p>

            <p>This he ſaid to them all, tho' he knew that they were ſuch Sinners: Yea, he ſaid it without the leaſt Stick, or Stop or Pauſe of Spirit, as to whether he had beſt to ſay ſo, or no.

            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But I Railed on him, I Reviled him, I hated him, I rejoyced to ſee him mocked at by others: Can there be any hopes for me</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter.</hi> There is for every one of you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of Sins. And ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> O! what a Bleſſed <hi>every one of you,</hi> is here! How willing was <hi>Peter</hi> and his Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> by his Miniſtry, to catch theſe Murderers with the Word of the Goſpel, that they might be made <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Grace of GOD! How unwilling, I ſay was he, that any of theſe ſhould eſcape the Hand of Mercy! Yea, what an amazing Wonder is it, to think that above all the World, and above every body in it, Theſe ſhould have the firſt offer of Mercy, <hi>begining at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003637_0010_10023A6F3055B010"/>But was there not ſomething of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Clauſe of the Commiſſion? Did not <hi>Peter</hi> think you ſee a great deal in it, that he ſhould thus begin with theſe Men, and thus offer, ſo particular, this Grace to each particular Man of them?</p>
            <p>But, as I told you, This is not all, theſe <hi>Jeruſalem Sinners</hi> muſt have this offer again and again? <hi>Every one of them</hi> muſt be offered it over and over. CHRIST would not take the firſt Rejection for a Denial; nor their ſecond Repulſe for a Denial: But he will have Grace offered once, and twice, and thrice to theſe <hi>Jeruſalem Sinners.</hi> Is not this amazing Grace, CHRIST will not be put off? Theſe are the Sinners that are Sinners indeed. They are Sinners of the biggeſt ſort, conſequently ſuch as CHRIST can, if they Convert and be ſaved, beſt ſerve his Ends and Deſigns upon, of which more anon.</p>
            <p>But what a pitch of Grace is this? CHRIST is minded to amaze the World, and to ſhow that he acted not like the Children of Men. This is that which he ſaid of Old, <q>I will not execute the Fierceneſs of my Wrath, I will not return to deſtroy <hi>Ephraim,</hi> for I am GOD and not Man, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.9.</q> This is not the manner of Men, Men are ſhorter winded, Men are ſoon moved to take Vengence
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003637_0011_10023A65692D4A50"/>
and to right themſelves in a way of Wroth and Indignation; but GOD is full of Grace full of Patience, ready to forgive and one that delights in Mercy: All this, is ſeen in our Text, the biggeſt Sinners muſt firſt be offered Mercy; they muſt I ſay, have the Cream of the Goſpel offered unto them.</p>
            <p>But we will proceed. In the Third Chapter we find, that they who eſcaped converting by the firſt Sermon, are called upon again to except of Grace and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for their Murder committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Son of God. You have killed; yea, <hi>you have denied the Holy On<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the Juſt, an I deſired the Murderer to be granted unto you. And killed the Prince of Life. Mark,</hi> he falls again upon the very Men, that actually were, as you have it in the Chapters following, his very <hi>Betrayers and Murderers.</hi> Acts 2.14.15. as being loth that they ſhould eſcape the Mercy of Forgiveneſs. And Exhorts them again to repent, <hi>that their Sins may be blotted out,</hi> Verſe 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Again in the fourth Chapter, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them afreſh with this Murder. Verſe 10. But withall tells them, <hi>Salvation is in no other</hi> than like a heavenly Decoy, He puts himſelf alſo among them, to draw them the better under the Net of the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>There is none other Name under He even given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Verſe 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:003637_0011_10023A65692D4A50"/>In the fifth Chapter you find them Railing at him, becauſe he continued Preaching among them Salvation in the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; but he tells them, that that very <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom they had ſlain and hanged on a Tree, him GOD had raiſed up and exalted to be Prince, and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to give Repentance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Forgiveneſs of Sins, ver. 29, 30, 31. Still inſinuating, that tho' they had killed him and to this Day rejected him, yet his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was to beſtow upon them Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Forgiveneſs of Sins.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, after they had began to kill again, &amp; when nothing but killing would ſerve their turn then they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word. Yet even ſome of them ſo hankered after the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they preached the Goſpel on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them. Alſo the Apoſtles ſtill made their Abode at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in hopes that they might let down their Net for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Draught of theſe <hi>Jeruſalem Sinners.</hi> Neither did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were the Miniſters of GOD to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> but offer the Goſpel in the firſt place to thoſe of them that for their Wickedneſs were ſcattered like Vagabonds among the Nations: Yea, and when they rendred Rebellion and Blaſphemy for their Service and Love; they Replied, <hi>It was Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

that the Word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to them,</hi> Acts 1.8. Ch. 13.46, 47.</p>
            <p>Nor was this their preaching Unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful among theſe People: But the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſo wrought with the Word <hi>thus</hi> ſpoken, that Thouſands of them came flocking to him for Mercy. Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them cloſed with him at the firſt and afterwards Two Thouſand more; for now they were in Number about Five Thouſand; whereas before theſe Sermons were preached to theſe Murderers; the Number of the Deſciples were <hi>not above an Hundred and Twenty,</hi> Acts 1.15. Ch. 2.41 Ch. 4.4.</p>
            <p>Alſo among theſe People that thus flocked to him for Mercy, there was a <hi>great Company of the Prieſts</hi> Chap. 6.7. Now the Prieſts were they that were the greateſt of theſe biggeſt Sinners; they were the Ring-leaders, they were the Inventors &amp; Ring-leaders in the Miſchief. 'Twas they ſet the People againſt the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that was the cauſe why the Uproar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, until <hi>Pilate</hi> had given Sentance upon him. <hi>The chief Prieſts and Elders,</hi> ſays the Text perſwaded (the People) the Multitude, that they ſhould ask <hi>Barabas,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>Jeſus, Matth.</hi> 27 20. And yet behold the Prieſts, yea, a great Company of the Prieſts, became obedient to the Faith.</p>

of it: <hi>Begin at Jeruſalem:</hi> This is the Reaſon which the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, why in his Life time he left the beſt, and turned him to the worſt; why he ſat ſo looſe from the Righteous and ſtuck ſo cloſe to the Wicked, <hi>The whole</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have no need of the Phyſician, but the ſick, I came not to call the Righteous, but ſinners to repentance,</hi> Mark 2.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Above you read, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid to his Diſciples: <hi>How is it, that he eateth and drinketh with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans &amp; Sinners</hi>? Alas they did not know the Reaſon. But the Lord renders them one, and ſuch an one, as is both natural and cogent; ſaying, <hi>Theſe</hi> have <hi>need moſt need.</hi> Their great Neceſſity requires that I ſhould be moſt friendly and ſhew my Grace firſt to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not that the other were Sinleſs, and ſo had no need of a Saviour: But the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and their Companions, were the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Sinners, they were, as to View, worſe than the</hi> Scribes, <hi>and therefore in Reaſon ſhould be helped firſt, becauſe they had moſt need of a Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men that are at the Point to die, have more need of the Phyſician, than they that are but now and then troubled with an Heart fainting qualm. The Publicans and Sinners, were, as it were, in the mouth of Death, Death was ſwallowing of them

down; and therefore the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceives them firſt, offers them Mercy firſt <hi>The whole have no need of the Phyſician, but the Sick. I came not to call the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> The Sick, as I ſaid, is the biggeſt Sinner, whether he ſees his Diſeaſes or not. He is ſtained from Head to Foot, from Heart to Life and Converſation: This Man in every Man's Judgment, has the moſt need of Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is nothing attends him from Bed to Board, and from Board to Bed again, but the viſible Characters, and obvious Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of eternal Damnation. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Man that has need, moſt need, and therefore in Reaſon ſhould be helped in the firſt place. Thus 'twas with the People concerned in the Text, they were <hi>the worſt of Sinners, Jeruſalem Sinners,</hi> Sinners of the biggeſt ſize. And therefore ſuch as had the greateſt need, wherefore they muſt have Mercy offered to them, before it be offered any where in the World, <hi>Begin at Jeruſalem.</hi> Offer Mercy firſt to a <hi>Jeruſalem Sinner</hi>: This man has moſt need, he is fartheſt from God, neareſt to Hell, and ſo one that has <hi>moſt need.</hi> This Mans Sins are in <hi>number</hi> the <hi>moſt,</hi> in <hi>cry</hi> the <hi>loudeſt,</hi> in <hi>weight</hi> the <hi>heavieſt,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently will ſink him ſooneſt wherefore he has moſt need of Mercy: This Man is ſhut up in Satans hand, faſteſt bound in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003637_0014_10023A8B4DF447E8"/>
the cords of his ſins; One that Juſtice is whetting his Sword to cut off, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has moſt need, not only of Mercy, but that it ſhould be extended to him in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>But a little further, to ſhew you the true nature of this Reaſon, to wit, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt would have Mercy offer'd in the firſt place to the biggeſt ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mercy ariſeth from Bowels and Compaſſion, from Pity, and from a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Condition of thoſe in miſery. <hi>In his Love and in his Pity, he ſaveth us.</hi> And again, <hi>The Lord is pitiful, very piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp; of tender Mercy,</hi> Iſa. 63 9. Jam. 5.11.</p>
            <p>Now where Pity and Compaſſion is, there is yearning of Bowels, and where there is that, there is a Readineſs to help. And, I ſay again, the more Deplorable and Dreadful the Condition is, the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly doth Bowels and Compaſſion turn themſelves to ſuch: And offer Help and Deliverance. All this flows from our firſt Scripture Proof, <hi>I came to call them that have Need,</hi> to call them firſt, while the reſt look on, and Murmur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> was a Revolter from God, a Man that had given himſelf up to Deviliſm: a Company of Men, the Ten Tribes that Worſhipped Devils, while <hi>Judah</hi> kept with his God. But <hi>how ſhould I give thee

            <p>But where do you find that ever the Lord did thus rowl in his Bowels for, and after any Self righteous Man? No, no, they are the Publicans and Harlots, Idolaters and <hi>Jeruſalem Sinners,</hi> for whom his Bowels thus yearn and tumble about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, For, alas poor Worms, they have moſt Need of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Had not that good <hi>Samaritan</hi> more Compaſſion for that Man that fell among Thieves, (tho' that Fall was occaſioned by his going from the place where they worſhiped God, to <hi>Jericho,</hi> the curſed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) than we read he had for any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides? His <hi>Wine</hi> was for him, his <hi>Oyl</hi> was for him, his <hi>Beaſt</hi> for him, his <hi>Penny,</hi> his <hi>Care,</hi> and his <hi>Swadling hands</hi> for him; for alas, poor Wretch, he had moſt Need, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.30 <hi>to</hi> 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publican, the chief of the Publicans, one that had made himſelf the richer by wronging of others; the Lord at that time ſingleth him out from all the reſt of his Brother Publicans, and that in the Face of many Phariſees, proclaimed in

the Audience of them all, That that Day Salvation was come to his Houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 1 <hi>to</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>The Woman alſo that had been bowed down by Satan for Eighteen Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Compaſſion putting him upon it, he looſed her tho' thoſe that ſtood by ſnarled at him for ſo doing, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>And why the Woman of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and why <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Widows and Lepers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Conditions were more deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (for that) they were moſt forlorn, and fartheſt from Help? <hi>Luke</hi> 4.25.27.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, why all theſe thus named? Why have we not a Catalogue of ſome holy Men that were ſo in their own Eyes, and in the Judgment of the World? Alas if at any time any of them are mentioned, how ſeemingly coldly doth the Record of Scripture preſent them to us. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Night Profeſſor, and <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee with his Fifty Pence, and their great Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Methods of Grace, we have now and then touched upon.</p>
            <p>Mercy ſeems to be out of its proper Channel when it deals with Self righteous Men; but then it runs with a full Stream, when it extends it ſelf to the biggeſt Sinners. As God's Mercy is not regulated by Man's Goodneſs, nor obtained by Man's Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003637_0016_10023A58D98664B0"/>
ſo not much ſet out by ſaving of any ſuch; but more of this anon.</p>
            <p>And here let me ask my <hi>Reader</hi> a Queſtion: Suppoſe, that as thou art walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſome Pond-ſide; thou ſhouldeſt eſpy in it, four or five Children all in danger of drowning, and one in more Danger than all the reſt; judge which has moſt Need to be helped out firſt? I know thou wilt ſay, he that is neareſt drowning; Why this is the Caſe: the bigger Sinner, the nearer drowning; therefore the bigger Sinner, the more need of Mercy: Yea, of help by Mercy in the firſt Place. And to this our Text agrees, when it ſaith, <hi>Beginning at Jeruſalem:</hi> Let the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſinner,</hi> ſays Chriſt, have the firſt Offer, the firſt Invitation, the firſt tender of my Grace and Mercy, for he is the biggeſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo has moſt Need thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus would have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners, becauſe when they or any of them receive it, it redounds moſt to the Fame of his Name.</p>
            <p>Chriſt Jeſus, as you may perceive, has put himſelf under the term of a Phyſician, a Doctor for curing of Diſeaſes: And you know that Applauſe and a Fame, is a thing that Phyſicians much deſire. That is it that helps them to Patients, and that alſo that will help their Patients to commit
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003637_0016_10023A58D98664B0"/>
themſelves to their Skill for Cure, with the more confidence and repoſe of Spirit; and the way for a Doctor or Phyſician to get themſelves a Name, is in the firſt place to take in hand, and cure ſome ſuch as all others have given off for loſt and dead: Phyſicians get neither Name nor Fame, by picking of <hi>Weeds</hi> or picking out <hi>Thiſties,</hi> or by laying of Plaiſters to the <hi>ſcratch</hi> of a <hi>Pin</hi>: Every old Woman can do this: But if they will have a Name and a Fame, if they will have it quickly they muſt, as I ſaid, do ſome great and deſperate Cures: Let them fetch one to Life that was dead, let them recover one to his Wits that was Mad, let them make one that was born Blind to ſee, or let them give ripe Wits to a Fool; theſe are nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cures, and he that can do thus, and if he doth thus firſt, he ſhall have the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Fame</hi> he deſires, he may lie a Bed till Noon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why</hi> Chriſt Jeſus <hi>forgiveth Sins for a Name, and ſo begets of himſelf a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the Hearts of the Children of Men: And therefore in Reaſon muſt be willing, as alſo he did command that his Mercy ſhould be offered firſt to the biggeſt ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will forgive their Sins, Iniquities, and Tranſgreſſions, <hi>ſays he,</hi> and it ſhall turn to me for a Name of Joy, and a Praiſe, and an Honour, before all the Nations of the Earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:003637_0017_10023A7418775610"/>
               <hi>And hence it is that at his firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he took upon him to do ſuch mighty Works; He got a Fame thereby</hi> Mat 4 23.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Chriſt</hi> had caſt the Legion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils out of the Man of whom you read, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. He bid him go home to his Friends and tell it; <hi>Go home,</hi> ſaith he, to <hi>thy Friends, and tell them how great things God has done for thee; and has had Compaſſion on thee,</hi> Mark 5.19. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſeeks a Name, and deſireth a Fame in the World, and, therefore, the better to obtain that, he commands that Mercy ſhould firſt be proffered to the biggeſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; becauſe by the ſaving of one of them he makes all Men marvel. As 'tis ſaid of the Man laſt mentioned, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red toward the beginning of his Miniſtry: <hi>And he departed,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to publiſh in</hi> Decapolis <hi>how great things Jeſus had done for him, and all Men did mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to this end, has not only commanded that the biggeſt Sinners ſhould have the firſt offer of his Mercy; but has, as Phyſicians do, put out his Bills, and publiſhed his Doings, that things may be read and talked of: Yea, he has moreover in theſe his bleſſed Bills, the holy Scriptures, I mean, inſerted in the very Names of Perſons the places of their Abode, and the great Cures, that by the Means of his Salvation he has wrought upon them to this very end. Here is <hi>Item,</hi> ſuch a one by my Grace and redeeming Blood, was made a Monument of everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Life; and ſuch a one by my perfect Obedience, became an Heir of Glory: And then he produceth their Names.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I ſaved <hi>David</hi> from the Vengeance that belonged to him for committing of Adultery and Murder.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo <hi>Soloman, Manaſſeh, Peter, Magdalen,</hi> and many others made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of in this Book. Yea, here are their Names, their Sins, and their Salvations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded

together, that you may read and know what a Saviour he is; and do him Honour in the World: For why are theſe things thus recorded, but to ſhew to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners what he can do, to the Praiſe and Glory of his Grace.</p>
            <p>And it is obſervable, as I ſaid before, we have but very little of the Salvation of little Sinners mentioned in God's Book, becauſe that would not have anſwered the Deſign, to wit, to bring Glory and Fame to the Name of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>What ſhould be the Reaſon think you, why Chriſt ſhould ſo eaſily take a denial of the great ones, that were the Grandeur of the World, and ſtruggle ſo hard for Hedge-creepers and High Way Men, (as the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 14 ſeems to import he doth) but to ſhew forth the riches of the Glory of his Grace, to his Praiſe? This I ſay, is one Reaſon to be ſure,</p>
            <p>They that had their Grounds, their yoke of Oxen, and their Marriage Joys were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come; but they made their Excuſe, and that ſerved the turn, But when he comes to deal with the worſt, he ſaith to his Servant, Go ye <hi>out</hi> and <hi>bring</hi> them in hither, <hi>Go out quickly and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the halt and the blind: And they did ſo.</hi> And he ſaid again, <hi>Go out into the high ways &amp; hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and compel them to come in, that my

Houſe may be filled,</hi> Luke 14.19, 23. Theſe poor, lame, maimed, blind hedge-creepers, and high-way Men, muſt come in, muſt be forced in: Theſe if ſaved, will make his Merits ſhine.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified and hanged up between the Earth and Heavens, there were two Thieves crucified with him; and behold, he lays hold of one of them, and will have him away with him to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Was not this a ſtrange act, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of unthought of Grace? Were there none but Thieves there, or were the reſt of that Company out of his reach? Could he not think you, have ſtooped from the Croſs to the Ground, and have laid hold on ſome honeſter Man if he would? Yes doubtleſs: Oh, but then he would not have diſplayed his Grace, nor ſo have purſued his own deſigns; namely to get himſelf a praiſe, and a Name: But how he has done it to purpoſe. For, who that ſhall read this Story, but muſt confeſs that the Son of God is full of Grace? For a proof of the riches thereof he left behind him when upon the Croſs; he took the Thief away with him to Glory. <hi>Nor can this one act of his be buried</hi>: It will be talked of to the end of the World to his Praiſe, <hi>Men ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy terrible Acts, and will declare thy Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: They ſhall abundantly utter the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o why Chriſt will have Mercy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners. They have moſt need thereof; and this is the moſt ready way to extol his Name that rideth upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, to our Help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus would have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners, becauſe by their Forgiveneſs and Salvation, others hearing of it, will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the more to come to him for Life.</p>
            <p>For the Phyſician, by curing of the moſt deſperate at the firſt, doth not only get himſelf a Name; but begets Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the minds of other diſeaſed Folk, to come to him for Help: Hence you read of our Lord, that after thro' his tender Mercy, he had cured many of great Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his Fame was ſpread abroad: <hi>They brought unto him all ſick People that were taken with divers Diſeaſes and Torments; and thoſe that were poſſeſſed with Devils, and thoſe that had the Palſy, and he healed them; and there followed him a great multitude of People from</hi> Galilee <hi>and</hi> Decapolis <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and</hi> Judea, <hi>and from beyond</hi> Jordan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4 24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:003637_0020_10023A869504C878"/>See here, He firſt by working gets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Fame, a Name, and Renown; and now Men take Encouragement, and bring from all quarters their Diſeaſed to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helped by what they had heard, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that their Diſeaſes ſhould be healed.</p>
            <p>Now, as he did with thoſe outward Cures, ſo he does in the proffers of his Grace and Mercy; he proffers that in the firſt Place to the biggeſt Sinners, that others may take Heart to come to be ſaved. I will give you a Scripture or two, I mean to ſhew you that Chriſt by commanding that his Mercy ſhould in the firſt place be offered to the biggeſt of Sinners, has a Deſign thereby to encourage and provoke others to come alſo to him for Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in our Sins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt (by Grace ye are ſaved) and hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But why did he do all this? <hi>That in the Ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kindneſs towards us, thro' Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 2 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>See here a Deſign, God lets out his Mercy to <hi>Epheſus</hi> on Deſign, even to ſhew to the Ages to come, the exceeding Riches of his Grave in his Kindneſs to them thro'
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003637_0020_10023A869504C878"/>
Chriſt Jeſus; and why to ſhew by theſe the exceeding Riches of his Grace to the Ages to come thro' Chriſt Jeſus? But to allure them and their Children alſo to come to him, and to partake of the ſame Grace thro' Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>But what was <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Epheſian-ſinners</hi>? (of <hi>Paul</hi> we will ſpeak anon.) Theſe <hi>Epheſian ſinners,</hi> They were Men dead in Sins, Men that walked according to the Dictates and Motions of the Devil, Worſhippers of <hi>Diana,</hi> that effeminate Goddeſs; Men far off from God, Aliens and Stranger to all good Things, ſuch as were far off from that as I ſaid, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in a moſt deplorable Condition; as the <hi>Jeruſalem ſinners,</hi> &amp;c Condition; as the <hi>Jeruſalem ſinners</hi> were of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sort among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo theſe <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian ſinners</hi> were of the higheſt ſort among the <hi>Epheſians, Gentiles (Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.35.2.11.31.)</p>
            <p>Wherefore as by the <hi>Jeruſalem ſinners,</hi> in ſaving them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, he had a deſign to provoke others to come to him for Mercy; ſo the ſame Deſign is here ſet on foot again, in his calling and converting the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-ſinners,</hi> that in the Ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace! Says he, <hi>in his Kindneſs towards us thro' Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> There is yet one hint behind. 'Tis ſaid that God ſaved
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003637_0021_10023A82992D09B0"/>
theſe for <hi>his Love:</hi> That is, as I think for the ſetting forth the Commendations of his Love; for the advance of his Love in the Hearts and Minds of them that ſhould come after. As who ſhould ſay, God has had Mercy and been Gracious to you, that he might ſhew to others for their Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that they have ground to come to him to be ſaved. <hi>When God ſaves one great Sinner, 'tis to encourage another great sinner to come to him for Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaved the <hi>Thief,</hi> to encourage <hi>Thieves</hi> to come to him for Mercy. He ſaved <hi>Magdalen,</hi> to encourage other <hi>Magdalens</hi> to come to him for Mercy. He ſaved <hi>Saul,</hi> to encourage <hi>Sauls</hi> to come to him for Mercy; and this <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf doth ſay, <hi>For this cauſe</hi> ſaith he <hi>I obtained Mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long Suffering, for a Pattern to them which ſhould hereafter believe on him to Life everlaſting,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16.</p>
            <p>How plain are the Words? Chriſt in ſaving of me, has given to the World a Pattern of his Grace, that they might ſee and believe, and come and be ſaved: That they that are to be born hereafter, might believe on Jeſus Chriſt to Life everlaſting.</p>
            <p>But what was <hi>Paul</hi>? why he tells you himſelf, <hi>I am</hi> ſays he, <hi>the chief of Sinners; I was</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, an injurious Perſon: Bat I obtained
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003637_0021_10023A82992D09B0"/>
Mercy:</hi> 1 Tim. 1.14, 15. Ay, that's well for you <hi>Paul,</hi> but what Advantage have we thereby? Oh very much ſaith he; <hi>For for this cauſe I obtained Mercy</hi> that in me <hi>Firſt,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew all long ſuffering for a pattern to them which ſhall believe on him to Life everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Thus there you ſee this third Reaſon is of Strength, namely, That Jeſus Chriſt would have Mercy offered in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to the biggeſt Sinners, <hi>becauſe, by their Forgiveneſs and Salvation, others hearing of it, will be encouraged the more to come to him for Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may well therefore be ſaid to God, Thou delighteſt in Mercy, and Mercy pleaſes thee, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18.</p>
            <p>But who believes that this was God's Deſign in ſhewing Mercy of old? Namely, That we that come after, might take Courage to come to him for Mercy; or that Jeſus Chriſt would have Mercy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinner, to ſtir up others to come to him for Life. This is not the manner of Men! O God. But <hi>David</hi> ſaw this betimes, therefore he makes this one Argument with God, That he would blot out his Trangreſſions, that he would forgive his Adultery, his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and horrible Hypocriſy. <hi>Do it, O Lord,</hi> ſaith he do it, And <hi>then will I teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, and Sinners ſhall
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003637_0022_10023A78D7C651A8"/>
be converted unto thee</hi> Pſal. 15.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>He knew that the Converſion of Sinners would be a work highly pleaſing to God, as being that which he had deſigned before he made Mountains or Hills: Wherefore he comes, and he ſaith Save me, O Lord; if thou wilt ſave me I will fall in with thy Deſign, I will help to bring what Sinners to thee I can And Lord, I am willing to be made a Preacher my ſelf, for that I have been a horrible Sinner, wherefore if thou wilt forgive My great Trangreſſions, I ſhall be a fit Man to tell of thy wondrous Grace, to others: Yea, Lord, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that if thou wilt have Mercy upon me, it ſhall tend to the Glory of thy Grace, and alſo to the encreaſe of thy Kingdom, for I will tell it; and Sinners will heat on't. And there is nothing ſo ſuiteth with the hearing, Sinner, as Mercy, and to be inform'd that God is willing to beſtow it upon him. I <hi>will teach Tranſgreſſors thy way, &amp; Sinners ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will Chriſt Jeſus miſs of his Deſign it profering of Mercy in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to the biggeſt Sinners. You know what work the Lord by laying hold of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> made among the People there: They knew that ſhe was a Town-Sinner, an Adultereſs, Yea, one that after the moſt audacious manner lived in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003637_0022_10023A78D7C651A8"/>
with a Man that was not her Husband. But when ſhe from a turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Heart, went into the City and ſaid to her Neighbours, Come: Oh how, how they came, how they flocked out of the City to Jeſus Chriſt! <hi>Then they went out of the City, and came to him, and many of the Samaritans,</hi> (People per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as bad as her ſelf) <hi>believed on him, for the ſaying of the Woman, which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſaying, He told we all that ever I did,</hi> (John 4.39.)</p>
            <p>That word, <hi>He told me all that ever I did,</hi> was a great Argument with them; for by that they gathered, That that tho' he knew her to be vile, yet he did not Deſpiſe her, nor refuſe to ſhew how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he was to communicate his Grace unto her: And this fetched over, firſt her, then them:</p>
            <p>This Woman, as I ſaid, was a <hi>Samaritan-ſinner,</hi> a Sinner of the worſt Complexion: For the <hi>Jews</hi> abhorred to have ought to do with them <hi>(verſe</hi> 9.) wherefore none more fit than ſhe to be made one of the <hi>Decoys</hi> of Heaven, to bring others of theſe <hi>Samaritan Wild-fowls</hi> under the Net of the Grace of Chriſt; and ſhe did the work to purpoſe, and many more of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> believed on him, <hi>Verſe</hi> 40, 41, 42. The Heart of Man, tho' ſet on Sin, when it comes to a Perſwaſion that

Hoſ. 14.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Mercy and the revelation thereof is the only Antidote againſt Sin. 'Tis of a thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature, twill looſe the Heart that is frozen up in Sin, yea, 'twill make the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come to Jeſus Chriſt for Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore do you think was it that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt told the Adulterous Woman, and that before ſo many Sinners,</hi> that he had not condemned her, <hi>but to allure her with them there preſent, to hope to find Favour at his Hand? (As he alſo ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place:</hi> I came not to judges, but to ſave the World) <hi>for might they not thence moſt rationally conclude that if Jeſus Chriſt had rather, ſave then damn an Harlot, there was encouragement for them to come to him for Mercy.</hi>

               <hi>I heard once a Story from a Souldier, who with his Company had laid Siege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Fort, that ſo long as the Beſieged were perſwaded their Foes would ſhew them no Favour, they fought like Mad men; but
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003637_0023_10023A8CDBFE4A50"/>
when they ſaw one of their Fellows taken, and received to Favour, they all came tumbling down from their Fortreſs: And delivered themſelves into their Enemies Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, did Men believe that there is that Grace &amp; Willingneſs in the Heart of Chriſt to ſave Sinners, as the Word imports there is, they would come tumbling into his Arms: But Satan has blinded their Minds, they cannot ſee this thing, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord Jeſus has, as I ſaid, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take Heart and come to him, given out a Commandment that Mercy ſhould in the firſt place be offered to the biggeſt Sinners. <hi>Begin</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at Jeruſalem.</hi> And thus I end the third Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt would have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to the biggeſt Sinners, <hi>Becauſe that is the way if they receive it, moſt to weaken the Kingdom of Satan, and to keep it loweſt in every Age of the World</hi>: The biggeſt Sinners they are Satan's <hi>Colonels,</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> the Leaders of his People, and they that moſt ſtoutly make head againſt the Son of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let theſe firſt be conquered, and his Kingdom will be weak. When <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> had loſt his <hi>Abner,</hi> his Kingdom was made weak, nor did he ſit but <hi>tottering then upon his Throne</hi>; So when Satan loſeth his ſtrong Men, them that are mighty
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003637_0024_10023A76730E5BB8"/>
to work Iniquity, and <hi>dexterous</hi> to manage others in the ſame, then is his Kingdom weak. (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.) Therefore I ſay, Chriſt doth offer Mercy, in the firſt place to ſuch, the more to weaken his Kingdom. Chriſt Jeſus was glad to ſee Satan fall like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven, that is, ſuddenly or headlong; and it was ſurely, by caſting of him out of ſtrong Poſſeſſions, and by reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſome notorious Sinners out of his Clutches, <hi>(Luke</hi> 1.17, 18, 19.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when he would pull down the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> Temple, took hold of the two main Pillars of it, and breaking them, down came the Houſe. Chriſt came to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and to deſtroy by converting Grace, as well as by redeeming Blood. Now Sin ſwarms, and lieth by Legions and whole Armies, in the Souls of the biggeſt Sinners, as in Garriſons: Wherefore the way, the moſt direct way to deſtroy it is firſt to deal with ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by the Word of his Goſpel, and by the Merits of his Paſſion.</p>
            <p>For Example, tho' I ſhall give you but a homely one, Suppoſe a Family to be very Louſie, and one or two of the Family to be in chief the Breeders, the way, the quickeſt way to clear that Family, or at leaſt to weaken the ſo ſwarming of thoſe Vermin, is in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to ſweeten the Skin, Head, and Cloathes of <hi>chief Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:003637_0024_10023A76730E5BB8"/>
And then, tho' all the Family ſhould be apt to breed them, the Number of them and ſo the greatneſs of that Plague there will be the more impaired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why there are ſome People that are in chief the</hi> Devils Sin-breeders <hi>in the Towns and places where they live; the Place Town or Family where they live muſt needs be horrible Louſie, and as it were eaten up with</hi> Vermin; <hi>now let the Lord Jeſus in the firſt place cleanſe theſe great Breeders, and there will be given a Nip to thoſe ſwarms of Sins that uſe to be committed in ſuch places thro' out the Town, Houſe, or Family where ſuch</hi> Sin-breeding <hi>Perſons uſe to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeak by Experience, I was one of thoſe Louſy ones; one of theſe great <hi>Sin-breeders</hi>; I infected all the Youth of the Town, where I was born with all manner of youthful Vanities. The Neighbours counted me ſo, my practiſe proved me ſo; Wherefore Chriſt Jeſus took me firſt, and taking me firſt, the Contagion was much allayed all the Town over When God made one ſigh, they would hearken, and inquiringly ſay, <hi>What's the matter with</hi> John? They alſo gave their various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of me, but as I ſaid, Sin cooled and failed, as, to its full Carreer; and when I went out to ſeek the Bread of Life, ſome of them would follow, and the reſt be put
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003637_0025_10023A3F351A48B8"/>
into a muſe at home. Yea, almoſt the Town. At firſt, at times I would go out to hear at the place where I found good: Yea, young and old for a while had ſome Reformation on them; alſo ſome of them perceiving that God had Mercy upon me, came crying to him for Mercy too.</p>
            <p>But what need I give you an Inſtance of poor I? I will come to <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> the King: So long as he was a ring leading Sinner, the great Idolater, aad chief for Deviliſm, the whole Land flowed with Wickedneſs; <hi>for he made them to ſin,</hi> and do worſe than the Heathen that dwelt round about them, or that was caſt out from before them. But when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him, the whole Land was reformed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Down went the Groves, the Idols and Alters of <hi>Baal,</hi> and up went true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in much of the Power and Purity of it. You'll ſay, The King reformed by Power. I anſwer doubtleſs, and by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample too; For People obſerve their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as their Fathers did, ſo did they, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 33. 2 Kings 12.41.</p>
            <p>This therefore is another Reaſon, why <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have Mercy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners, becauſe that is the beſt way, if they receive it, moſt to weaken the Kingdom of Satan and to keep it poor and low.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:003637_0025_10023A3F351A48B8"/>And do you not think now, that if God would but take hold of the Hearts of ſome of the moſt notorious in your Town, in your Family, or Country, that this thing would be verified before your Faces? It would, it would, to the Joy of you that are godly, to the making of Hell to ſigh, to the great ſuppreſſing of Sin, the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Joy of the Angels of God. And Miniſters ſhould therefore, that this work might go on, take Advantages to perſwade with the biggeſt Sinners to come unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to my Text, and their Commiſſions: <hi>Beginning at Jeruſalem</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt would have Mercy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners. Becauſe ſuch when converted, are uſually the beſt Helps in the Church againſt Temptations, and fitteſt for the Support of the feeble minded there. Hence uſually you have ſome ſuch in the firſt Plantation of Churches; or quickly upon it. Churches would do but ſorrily if Chriſt Jeſus did not put ſuch Converts among them, they are the Monuments and Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Mercy. The very ſight of ſuch a Sinner in God's Houſe, yea, the very thought of him, where the ſight of him cannot be had, is oft-times greatly for the help of the Faith of the Feeble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:003637_0026_10023A2CB6201058"/>
               <hi>When the Churches</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>that were in Judea, heard this concerning me, that he which perſecuted them in time paſt now preached the Faith which once he deſtroyed, They glorified God in me,</hi> Gal. 1.20 <hi>to</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Glorified God</hi>) How is that? Why they praiſed him, and took Courage to believe the more in the Mercy of God, for that he had Mercy on ſuch a great Sinner as he, they glorified God (in me) They wondered that Grace ſhould be ſo rich, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to take hold of ſuch a Wretch as I was; and for my ſake believed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the more.</p>
            <p>There are two things that great Sinners are acquainted with, when they come to divulge to the Saints, that are a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to their Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Conteſts that they uſually have with the Devil at their parting with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Knowledge of his Secrets in his Workings.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> the biggeſt Sinners have uſually great conteſt with the Devil at their parting; and this is an help to Satan: For ordinary Saints find afterwards what the vile ones find at firſt; but when at the opening of Hearts, the one finds himſelf to be as the other the one is a Comfort to the other. The leſſer fort of Sinners find but little of this, till after they have been
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003637_0026_10023A2CB6201058"/>
ſome time in profeſſion; but the vile Man meets with his at the Beginning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he, when the other is down, is ready to tell that he has met with the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For I ſay he has had it before. Satan is loath to part with a great Sinner: What my true Servant (quoth he) my old Servant wilt thou forſake me now? Having ſo often ſold thy ſelf to me to work Wickedneſs, wilt thou forſake me now? Thou horrible Wretch doth not know, that thou haſt ſinned thy ſelf beyond the reach of Grace, and doſt think to find Mercy now? Art not thou a Murderer, a Thief, a Harlot, a Witch, a Sinner of the greateſt ſize, and doſt thou look for Mercy now? Doſt thou think that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will foul his Fingers with thee?</p>
            <p>'Tis enough to make Angels bluſh, <hi>ſaith Satan,</hi> to ſee ſo vile a one knock at Heavens Gates for Mercy, and wilt thou be ſo abominably bold to do it? Thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan dealt with me, ſays the great Sinner? when at firſt I came to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. And what did you reply ſaith the Tempted?</hi> Why I granted the whole Charge to be true, ſays the other. <hi>And what did you diſpair? or how</hi>? No (ſaith he) I ſaid, I am <hi>Magdalen,</hi> I am <hi>Zacheus,</hi> I am the <hi>Thief,</hi> I am the <hi>Harlot,</hi> I am the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> I am the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> and one of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Murderers, yea, worſe than any
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003637_0027_10023A91A0D84F58"/>
of theſe: And yet God was ſo far off from rejecting of me (as I found afterwards) that there was muſick and dancing in his Houſe for me, for Joy that I was come home unto him. <hi>Oh bleſſed be God for grace,</hi> (ſays the other) <hi>for then I hope there is ſavour for me.</hi> Yea, as I told you, ſuch a one is a continual Spectacle in the Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or every one by to behold God's Grace, and Wonder!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as for the ſecrets of Satan, ſuch as Suggeſtions to queſtion the Being of God, the Truth of his Word, and to be annoyed with deviliſh Blaſphemies: None more acquainted with theſe than the biggeſt Sinners at their Converſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus alſo they are prepared to be helps in the Church, to relieve and comfort the other.</p>
            <p>I might alſo here tell you of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts and Battles that ſuch are engaged in, wherein they find the Buffetings of Satan, above any other of the Saints. At which time Satan Aſſaults the Soul with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fears, frightful Thoughts of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions; now they ſweat, pant, cry out, and ſtruggle for Life.</p>
            <p>The Angels now come down to behold the ſight, and rejoice to ſee a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of Duſt and Aſhes to overcome Principalities and Powers, and Dominions. But as I ſaid, when theſe come a little to be ſettled,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003637_0027_10023A91A0D84F58"/>
they are prepared for Help for others, and are great Comforts unto them. Their great Sins give encouragement to the Devil to aſſault them, and by theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes Advantage to make them the more helpful to the Churches.</p>
            <p>The biggeſt Sinner, when he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and come into the Church, ſays to them all, by his very coming in, <hi>Behold me, all you that are Men and Women of a low and timerous Spirit; you whoſe hearts are narrow, for that you never had the advantage to know (becauſe your Sins are few) the largeneſs of God. Behold I ſay, in me the exceeding Riches of his Grace; I am a pattern ſet forth before your Faces, on whom you may look and take Heart.</hi> This I ſay, the great Sinner can ſay, to the exceeding Comfort of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as I have hinted before, when God intends to ſtock a place with Saints, and to make that Place excellently to flouriſh with the Riches of his Grace, he uſually begins with the Converſition of ſome of the moſt notorious thereabouts, and lays them as an Example to allure others, and to build them up when they are converted.</p>
            <p>'Twas <hi>Paul</hi> that muſt go to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was the moſt outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all the Apoſtles in the time of his

            <p>Some muſt be Pillars in Gods Houſe; and if they be Pillars of Cedar, they muſt ſtand whilſt they are ſtout and ſturdy Sticks in the Forreſt, before they are cut down, and planted or placed there.</p>
            <p>No Man when he buildeth his Houſe, makes the principal parts thereof, of weak and feeble Timber: (For how could ſuch bear up the reſt?) but of great and able Wood. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> alſo goeth this way to work, he makes of the biggeſt Sinners, Bearers and Supporters to the Reſt. This then may ſerve for another Reaſon, why <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> gives out in Commandment, that Mercy ſhould in the firſt place be offered to the biggeſt ſinners, becauſe ſuch when converted, are uſually the beſt help in Churches againſt Temptation, and fitteſt for the ſupport of the feeble minded there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Another Reaſon, why <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would have Mercy offered in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to the biggeſt Sinners is, Becauſe they when converted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are apt to love him moſt.</p>
            <p>This agrees both with the Scripture and Reaſon. Scripture ſays ſo. <hi>To whom
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003637_0028_10023A30B638C878"/>
much is forgiven, the ſame loveth much; to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little,</hi> Luke 7.47. Reaſon ſays ſo. For as it would be the Unreaſonableſt thing in the World, to render Hatred for Love, and Contempt for Forgiveneſs; ſo it would be Ridiculous to think that reception of a little kindneſs, ſhould lay the ſame obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations upon the Heart to love, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a great deal. I would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; I know the leaſt dram of it, when it reaches to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi> is great above all the World; but comparatively, there is greater extentions of the Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to one, than to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He that has moſt Sin, if forgiven, is partaker of the greateſt Love, of the greateſt Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>I know alſo that there is ſome, that from this very Doctrine, ſay, <hi>Let us do Evil that Good may come,</hi> and that turn the Grace of our God into Laciviouſneſs. But! ſpeak not to theſe: Theſe will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ruled by Grace nor Reaſon; Grace would Teach them, if they knew it, to deny Ungodly Courſes; and ſo would Reaſon to; if it could truly ſenſe the Love of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Rom</hi> 11.2.</p>
            <p>Doth it look like what hath any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with Reaſon or Mercy, for a Man to abuſe his Friend? Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for Men I ſhall therefore ſpit in his Face?
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003637_0029_10023A842E7B8D28"/>
The Bread and Water that was given by <hi>Eilſha</hi> to his Enemies, that came into the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to take him, had ſo much influence upon their minds, tho <hi>Heathens</hi> that they return'd to their homes without hurting him: Yea, it kept them from coming again, for a long time into the Coaſts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 2 Kings 6.19 <hi>to</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>But to forbear to Illuſtrate till anon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One Reaſon why <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhews Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Sinners is, that he might obtain thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This raving Bedlam, that once was ſo, is he that now ſays. <hi>I laboured more than them all; more for</hi> Chriſt <hi>than them all.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Paul, <hi>what moved thee thus to do</hi>? The Love of Chriſt, ſays he. It was not I
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003637_0029_10023A842E7B8D28"/>
but the Grace of God that was with me. As who ſhould ſay; <hi>O Grace</hi>! 'Twas ſuch Grace to ſave me! 'Twas ſuch Marvelous Grace for God to look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon me, and that ſecured me from the wrath to come, that I am captivated with the ſenſe of the Riches of it. Hence I act, hence I labour; for how can I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe do, ſince God not only ſeparated me from my Sins and Companions, but ſeparated all the Powers of my Soul &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to his Service? I am therefore prompted on by this exceeding Love to labour as I have done; <hi>yet not I, but the Grace of God with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! I ſhall never forget his Love, not the Circumſtance under which I was, when his Love laid hold upon me, I was going to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> with Letters from the High Prieſt to make Havock of God's People there, as I had made Havock of them in other places. Theſe bloody Letters were not impoſed upon me. I went to the High Prieſt and deſired them of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.1, 2. And yet he ſaved me! I was one of the chief Men, that had a hand in the Blood of his Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> yet he had Mercy on me; When I was at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> I ſtunk ſo horribly like a Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucker, that I became a Terror to all thereabout.

yet he would have Mercy upon me? Yea, joyned Mercy to Mercy, until he had made me a Monument of Grace. He made a Saint of me, and perſwaded me that my Tranſgreſſions were forgiven me.</p>
            <p>When I began to Preach thoſe that heard me were amazed; and ſaid, <hi>Is not this he that deſtroyed them that called on this Name in Jeruſalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the High Prie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I wonder how far a Man might go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Converted Sinners of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſize, before he could find one that ſo much as looks any thing this way ward.

               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> therefore knows what he doth, when he lays hold on the Hearts of ſinners of the biggeſt ſize. He knows that ſuch an one will love more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that have not ſinned half their ſins.</p>
            <p>I will tell you a ſtory that I have read of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; the name of the Book I have forgot, I mean of the book in which I found the Relation; but the Thing was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha</hi> ſaith my Author was a very holy Woman, like <hi>Lazarus</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but <hi>Mary</hi> was a looſe &amp; wanton Creature. <hi>Martha</hi> did ſeldom miſs good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Company of the Vileſt of Men for luſt. And tho' <hi>Martha</hi> had often deſired that her Siſter would go with her to hear her Preachers; yea, had often entreated her with Tears to do it, yet could ſhe never prevail; for ſtill <hi>Mary</hi> would make her excuſe, or reject her with diſdain, for her Zeal and Preciſeneſs in Religion.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Martha</hi> had waited long, tried many ways to bring her Siſter to good, and all proved ineffectual: At laſt, ſhe comes upon her thus; <hi>Siſter</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>I pray thee to go with me to the Temple to day, to hear one Preach a Sermon.</hi> What kind of Preacher is he, ſaid ſhe? <hi>Martha</hi> repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>It is one</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>He is the Handſomeſt Man that ever you ſaw with your Eyes; Oh! he ſhines in Beauty, and is a moſt excellent Preacher.</hi>

Acts 4 32 <hi>to</hi> 35. Now ſhow me ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pattern if you can. But why did theſe do thus? Oh they were <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinners.</hi> Theſe were the Men that but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had killed the Prince of Life; and thoſe to whom he did, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent the firſt offer of Grace and Mercy, and the ſenſe of this took them up betwixt Earth and the Heaven, and, carried them
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003637_0034_10023A5374C17288"/>
on in ſuch Methods as could never be troden by any ſince. They talk of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſet her in her Primitive State as a Pattern, and Mother of Churches; when the Truth is, they were the <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem-Sinners,</hi> when Converts, that out-did all Churches that ever was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus would have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners, becauſe Grace when it is received by ſuch, finds matter to kindle upon more freely ſuch, it finds in other Sinners. Great Sinners are like great Candles, which burns beſt, and ſhines with biggeſt Light? I lay not this down, as I did thoſe Reaſons before, to ſhew that when great Sinners are converted, they will be Encouragement to others, tho' that is true; but to ſhew that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has a delight to ſee the Grace we receive, to ſhine. We love to ſee things that bear a Gloſs, yea we chuſe to buy ſuch kind of Matter to work upon, as will if wrought up to what we intend, caſt that Luſtre that we deſire. Candles that burn not bright, we like not; Wood that is green will rather ſmother and ſputter, and flounce, then caſt a brave light and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Heat. Wherefore great Folks care not much, not ſo much for ſuch kind of things, as for them that will better anſwer their ends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:003637_0034_10023A5374C17288"/>Hence <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſires the biggeſt Sinners, in them there is Matter to work by, to wit, a great deal of Sin; for as by the Tallow of the Candle, the Fire takes occaſion to burn the brighter; ſo by the Sin of the Soul, Grace takes occaſion to ſhine the clearer. Little Candles ſhine but little, for there wanteth matter for the Fire to work upon; but in the great Sinner, here is more matter for Grace to work by. Faith ſhines, when it worketh towards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thro' the ſides of many and great Tranſgreſſors; and ſo does Love, for that much is forgiven and what matter can be found in the Soul for Humility to work by, ſo well as by a ſight, that I have been and am an abominable Sinner? And the ſame is to be ſaid of Patience, Meekneſs, Gentleneſs and ſelf-denial, or of any other Grace. Grace takes Occaſion by the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Man to ſhine the more; even as by the ruggedneſs of a very ſtrong Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, or Diſeaſe, the vertue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is the beſt made manifeſt. <hi>Where Sin abounds, Grace much more abounds,</hi> Rom. 5 20. A black ſtring makes the Neck look whiter; great Sins make Grace burn clear. Some ſay when Grace and good Nature meet together, they do make ſhining Chriſtians; but I ſay, when Grace and a great Sinner meets, and when Grace ſubdue that great Sinner to it ſelf, and ſhall

            <p>I have often marvelled at your Youth, and ſaid in my Heart what ſhould be the Reaſon that they ſhould be ſo generally at this Day debauched as they are! For they are now prophane to Amazement, and ſometimes I have thought one thing and ſometimes another: That is, why God ſhould ſuffer it to be ſo. And at laſt I have thought of this: How if the God whoſe ways are paſt finding out, ſhould ſuffer it to be ſo now, that he might make ſome of them the more glorious Saints hereafter. I know Sin is of the Devil, but it cannot work in the World without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: And if it happens to be as I have thought, it will not be the firſt time that God the Lord has caught Satan in his own Deſign. For my part I believe that the time is at Hand, that we ſhall ſee better Saints in the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For out of them, or from among them, when God ſets to his Hand as of old, you ſhall ſee what penitent ones, what trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ones, and what Admirers of Grace will be found to profeſs the Goſpel to the Glory of God by Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:003637_0043_10023A4F4423A1A0"/>
not offer beyond the Virtue of his Merits; becauſe as Grace is the cauſe of his Merits, ſo his Merits are the Bias and Bounds, upon and by which his Grace ſtands good, and is let out to Sinners. Doth he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that his Mercy ſhould be offered in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to the biggeſt <hi>Sinners</hi>? It declares that there is a ſufficiency in his Blood to ſave the biggeſt Sinners. The Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> cleanſeth from all Sin. And again, <hi>Be it known unto you Men and Brethren, that through this Man</hi> (this Mans Merits) <hi>is preached to you the Forgiveneſs of Sins; and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts 13.38.</p>
               <p>Obſerve then thy Rule, to make Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſufficiency of the bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thy Saviour; if he had not been able to have reconciled the biggeſt Sinners to his Father by his Blood, he would not have ſent to them: Have ſent to them in the <hi>firſt place</hi> the Doctrine of Remiſſion of Sins: for Remiſſion of Sins is thro Faith in his Blood: We are juſtified freely by the Grace of God, thro the Redemption that is in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Upon the ſquare as I may call it, of the worthineſs of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Grace acts and offers Forgiveneſs of Sin to Men, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>chap</hi> 2 13.14. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22.</p>

Now the biggeſt Sinner cannot be ſaved but by an abundance of Grace; tis not a little that will ſave great Sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17.

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:003637_0044_10023A2EE61CF540"/>
it follows that either he has unſearchable Riches of Grace and worth in himſelf, or elſe he muſt ſtraighten his Hand; or his Grace and Merits will be ſpent before the World's at an end.

and heinouſneſs, as thou art not capable of committing beyond them; unleſs now after thou haſt received Conviction that the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the only Saviour of the World, thou ſhouldſt wickedly and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pightfully turn thy ſelf from him, and conclude he is not to be truſted to for life, and ſo crucifie him for a Cheat afreſh. This I muſt confeſs will bring a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> and ſet him in danger of eternal Damnation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.29. This is trampling under Foot the Son of God, and counting his Blood an unholy thing. <hi>This did they of Jeruſalem,</hi> but they did it ignorantly in Unbelief, and ſo were yet capable of Mercy: But to do this againſt profeſſed Light, and to ſtand to do it, puts a Man beyond the Text indeed, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.14, <hi>to</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>But I ſay what is this to him that would fain be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt</hi>? His Sins did as to Greatneſs, never yet reach to the Nature of the Sins, that the Sinners intended by the Text had made themſelves guilty of: He that would be ſaved by Chriſt, has an honourable eſteem of him? but they of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> preferred a murderer before him; but as for him they cried, away, away with him, 'tis not fit that he ſhould live. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou wilt object, <hi>That thy ſelf haſt a Thouſand times preferred a ſtinking Luſt before him:</hi> anſwer be it ſo, it is but what
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:003637_0046_10023A478E60B1D0"/>
is common to Men to do, nor doth the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> make ſuch a fooliſh Life a <hi>Barr</hi> to thee, to forbid thy coming to him, or a Bound to his Grace, that it might be kept from thee; but admits of thy Repentance, and offereth himſelf unto thee freely, as thou ſtandeſt among the <hi>Jeruſalem ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take therefore Incouragement, Man, Mercy is by the Text held forth to the biggeſt Sinners. Yea, put thy ſelf into the Number of the firſt, by reckoning that thou mayſt be one of the firſt, and mayſt not be put off till the biggeſt Sinners are ſerved: For the biggeſt Sinners are firſt invited; conſequently, if they come they are like to be the firſt that ſhall be ſerved: 'Twas ſo with <hi>Jeruſalem: Jeruſalem ſinners</hi> were they that were firſt invited; and thoſe of them that came firſt, (and there came three thouſand of them, the firſt Day they were invited, how many came afterwards none can tell) <hi>they were firſt ſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put in thy Name, Man among the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, leſt thou art made to wait till they are ſerved; you have ſome Men that think themſelves very cunning, becauſe they put up their Names in their Prayers among them that feign it, ſaying <hi>God I thank thee, I am not ſo bad as the worſt</hi>; but believe it, if they be ſaved at all, they ſhall be ſaved in the laſt place: The firſt in their own Eyes ſhall be ſerved laſt, and the laſt or
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:003637_0047_10023A2946C6B208"/>
worſt ſhall be firſt: The Text inſinuates it, <hi>Begin at Jeruſalem,</hi> and Reaſon backs it, for they have moſt need. Behold ye therefore, how God's ways are above ours; we are for ſerving the worſt laſt, God is for ſerving the worſt firſt. The Man at the Pool that to my thinking was longeſt in his Diſeaſe, and moſt Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as to his Cure, was firſt healed, yea, he only was healed; for we read that <hi>Chriſt</hi> healed him; but we read not then that he healed one more there, <hi>John</hi> 5.1, <hi>to</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou wouldſt ſooneſt be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, put in thy Name among the very worſt of Sinners, ſay, when thou art upon thy Knees, Lord! <hi>Here is a Jeruſalem ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; a Sinner of the biggeſt ſize, one whoſe Burden is of the greateſt Bulk and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Weight, one that cannot ſtand long without thy ſupporting Hand, <hi>Be not thou far from me, O Lord; O my ſtrength, haſt thou to help me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, put in thy name with <hi>Magdalen,</hi> with <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> thou may'ſt fare as the <hi>Magdalen</hi> and the <hi>Mannaſſeh-ſinners</hi> do. The Man in the Goſpel, made the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition of his Child, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Chriſt</hi> to haſten his cure: <hi>Sir come down ſaith he ere my Child die,</hi> Joh. 4.49.

               </p>
               <p>This Text therefore will ſave thee, or ſink thee; there is no ſhifting of it: If it ſaves thee; it will ſet thee high; if it ſinks thee, will ſet thee low,</p>
               <p>But I ſay, why ſo unconcern'd? Haſt no Soul? Or doſt think thou mayſt looſe thy Soul, and ſave thy ſelf? Is it not pity, had it otherwiſe been the Will of God that

ever thou waſt made a Man, for that thou ſetteſt ſo little by thy Soul?</p>
               <p>Sinner, take the Invitation; thou art call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to come to Chriſt: Nor art thou called upon, but by order from the Son of God, tho' thou ſhould'ſt happen to be one of the biggeſt Sinners: For he has bid us offer Mercy, as to all the World in general, ſo in the firſt place, to the Sinners of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; or to the biggeſt Sinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Would Jeſus Chriſt have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the <hi>firſt place</hi> to the biggeſt Sinners? Then this ſhews how unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a thing it is, for Men to deſpair of Mercy. For thoſe that preſume, I ſhall ſay ſomething to them afterwards.</p>
               <p>I now ſpeak to them that Deſpair.</p>
               <p>There are four ſorts of Deſpair, there is the Deſpair of Devils; There is the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of Souls in Hell. There is the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that is grounded upon Mens Deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; And there is the Deſpair that they are perplexed with that are willing to be ſaved, but are too ſtrongly born down with the Burthen of their Sins.</p>
               <p>The Deſpair of Devils, the Damned's Deſpair, and that Deſpair that a Man has of attaining of Life, becauſe of his own Deficiency, are all reaſonable. Why ſhould not Devils &amp; damned Souls Deſpair? Yea, why ſhould not Man Deſpair of getting to Heaven by his own Abilities? I therefore
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003637_0051_10023A9D1BB10510"/>
am concerned only with the Fourth ſort of Diſpair, to wit, with the Diſpair of thoſe that would be ſaved, but are too ſtrongly born down with the Burden of their Sins.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore to thee that art thus, and why Diſpair? Thy Diſpair if it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſhould flow from thee, becauſe found in the Land that is beyond the Grave, or becauſe thou certainly knoweſt that Chriſt will not or cannot ſave thee.</p>

What ground to diſpair? Verily none at all Thy Deſpair, then is a thing unreaſonable and without footing in the Word.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003637_0055_10023AAF3A7564A0"/>
and all may be well: For this Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is a very heinous thing in the Eyes of God: The Soul ſaith he, that ſhall do ought preſumptuouſly (whether born in the Land, or a Stranger) the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth the Lord. <hi>And that Soul ſhall be cut off from among his People,</hi> Numb. 15.20.</p>
               <p>The thoughts of this made <hi>David</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pray that God would hold him back from Preſumptuous Sins, and not ſuffer them to have Dominion over him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.31.</p>
               <p>Now this Preſumption, then puts it ſelf in the place of Faith when it tampereth with the Promiſe of Life, while the Soul is a ſtranger to Repentance: Wherefore you have in the Text, to prevent doing thus, both Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins to be offered to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not Remiſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance; for all that repent not ſhall periſh, let them preſume on Grace, and the Promiſe while they will, <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Preſumption then is that which ſevereth <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> concluding that the Soul ſhall be ſaved by Grace, tho' the Man was never made ſorry for his Sins, nor the love of the Heart turned there from This is to be ſelf willed, as <hi>Peter</hi> has it, And this is a deſpiſing the Word of the Lord, for that has put Repentance and Faith
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003637_0055_10023AAF3A7564A0"/>
together, Mark 1.15. <hi>And becauſe he hath deſpiſed the Word of the Lord and hath broken the Commandment, that Soul ſhall utterly be cut off, his Iniquities ſhall be upon him,</hi> Numb. 15.13.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch therefore look to it, who yet are and abide in their Sins; for ſuch if they hope, they are to be ſaved, preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Grace of God. Wherefore Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not Hearkning to God's word, are put together, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12.</p>
               <p>Again, then Men preſume when they are reſolved to abide in their Sins, and yet expect to be ſaved by God's Grace thro' <hi>Chriſt</hi>: This is as much as to ſay God lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Sin as well as I do, and careth not how Men live, if ſo be they lean upon his Son. Of this Sort are they that build up <hi>Zion</hi> with Blood, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; that judge for reward, and teach for hire, and divine for Money, and lean upon the Lord, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.10, 11. This is doing things with an high hand againſt the Lord our God, and a taking him as it were, at the Catch! This is, as we may ſay among Men, to ſeek to put a trick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, as if he had not ſufficiently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his Propoſals of Grace by his Holy Word, againſt all ſuch kind of Fools as theſe. But look to it,</p>
               <p>Such will be found at the Day of God, not among that great Company of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem-ſinners,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:003637_0056_10023AB1A14F6B88"/>
that ſhall be ſaved by Grace, but among thoſe that have been the great abuſers of the Grace of God, in the World. Thoſe that ſay, <hi>Let us ſin that Grace may abound, and let us do Evil that Good may come,</hi> their Damnation is juſt; and if ſo, they are a great way off of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is by Jeſus Chriſt preſented to the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have therefore theſe things to propound to that <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinner,</hi> that would know if he may be ſo bold to venture himſelf upon this Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Doſt thou ſee thy Sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Art thou weary of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wouldſt thou with all thy Heart be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt? I dare ſay no leſs, I dare ſay no more. But if it be truly thus with thee, how great ſoever thy Sins have been, how far ſoever thou art from thinking that God has Mercy for thee; thou art the Man, the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinner,</hi> that the Word of God has conquer'd, and to whom it offereth free Remiſſion of Sins, by the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When the Jaylor cried out, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved</hi>? The anſwer was, <hi>Believe on the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> He that ſees his Sins aright, is brought to his Wits end by them; and he that is ſo is willing to part from them &amp; to be ſaved by the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:003637_0056_10023AB1A14F6B88"/>If this be the Caſe, fear not, give no way to Diſpair, thou preſumeſt not, if thou believeſt to Life everlaſting in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Yea, Chriſt is prepared for ſuch as thou art.</p>
               <p>Therefore take good courage and believe. The deſign of Satan is to tell the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous that their preſuming on Mercy is good; but to perſwade the Believer, that his believing is impudent bold dealing with God. I never heard a preſumptuous Man in my Life, ſay that he was afraid that he preſumed; but I have heard many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt humble Soul ſay, that they have been afraid that their Faith has been Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why ſhould Satan moleſt thoſe, whoſe ways he knows will bring them to him? And who can think that he ſhould be quiet, when Men take the right courſe to eſcape his helliſh ſnares? This therefore is the Reaſon why the truly humbled is oppoſed, while the Preſumptuous goes on by <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Tide.</hi> The truly humble, Satan hates; but he laughs to ſee the Foolery of the other.</p>
               <p>Does thy Hand and Heart tremble? Upon thee the Promiſe ſmiles, <hi>To this Man will I look,</hi> ſays God, <hi>even 'to him that is poor and of a contrite Spirit, and trembles at my Word,</hi> Iſa. 66.2.</p>
               <p>What therefore I have ſaid of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerns not the humble in Spirit at
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:003637_0057_10023AB417F0C4D8"/>
all: I therefore am for gathering up the Stones, and for taking the ſtumbling Blocks out of the way of God's People; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of them that they lay the ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Block of their Iniquity before their Faces, and that are for preſuming upon God's Mercy; and let them look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Alſo our Text ſtands firm as ever it did, and our obſervation is ſtill of force, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would have Mercy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners. So then let none Diſpair, let none Preſume: Let none Diſpair that are ſorry for their Sins, and would be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt. Let none reſume that abide in the liking of their Sins; tho' they ſeem to know the exceeding Grace of Chriſt; for tho' the Door ſtand wide open for the reception of the Penitent, yet 'tis faſt enough barred and bolted againſt the preſumptuous Sinner. Be not deceived, God is not mocked; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Man ſows, that he ſhall reap. It cannot be that God ſhould be wheadled out of his Mercy, or prevailed upon by Lips of Diſſimulation; He knows them that truſt in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſincerely come to him by Chriſt for Mercy, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>It is then, not the abundance of Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but the not coming heartily to God by Chriſt for Mercy, that ſhuts Men
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:003637_0057_10023AB417F0C4D8"/>
out of Doors: And tho' their not coming heartily may be ſaid to be but a Sin; yet 'tis ſuch a Sin, as cauſeth that all the other Sins abide upon the unforgiven.</p>
               <p>God complains of this, <hi>they have not cried unto me with their Heart; they turned, but not to the moſt High. They turned feignedly,</hi> Jer 3, 10. Hoſ. 7.14.16.</p>
               <p>Thus doing, his Souls hates; but the penitent, humble, broken-hearted Sinner, be his Tranſgreſſions red as Scarlet, red like Crimſon, in number as the ſand, tho' his Tranſgreſſions cry to Heaven againſt him for Vengeance, and ſeem there to cry louder than do his Prayers, or Tears, or Groans, for Mercy; yet he is ſafe. To this Man God will look, Iſa. 1.18 <hi>ch.</hi> 66.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Would Jeſus Chriſt have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners? Then here is ground for thoſe that as to practice have not been ſuch, to come to him for Mercy.</p>
               <p>Altho' there is no Sin little of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Contradiction to the Nature and Majeſty of God; yet we muſt admit of divers Numbers, and alſo of Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, two Sins are not ſo many as three; nor are three that are done in Ignorance ſo big as one that is done againſt light, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Knowlege, and Conſcience. Alſo there is the Child in Sin, and a Man in Sin; that has his Skin wrinkled for very
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:003637_0058_10023AB66C331810"/>
Age. And we muſt put a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe Sinners al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o: For can it be, that a Child of Seven, or ten, or ſixteen Years old, ſhould be ſuch a Sinner; a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo vile in Eye of the Law, as he is who has walked according to the courſe of this World, forty, fifty, ſixty or ſeventy Years? Now the Youth, this ſtripling, tho' he is a Sinner, is but a little Sinner, when compared with ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, if there be room for the firſt ſort, for thoſe of the biggeſt ſize; If there be a Door wide enough for a Giant to go in at, there is certainly room for a Dwarf. If Chriſt Jeſus has Grace enough to ſave great Sinners, he has ſurely Grace enough to ſave little ones. If he can forgive, five hundred Pence, for certain he can forgive fifty, Luke 7.41, 42.</p>
               <p>But you ſaid before that the little Sinners muſt ſtand by, until the great ones have received their Grace, and that's diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging!</p>
               <p>I anſwer, There are two ſorts of little Sinners, ſuch as are ſo, and ſuch as feign themſelves ſo; they are thoſe that feign themſelves ſo, that I intended there, and not thoſe that are indeed comparatively ſo. Such as feign themſelves ſo, may wait long enough before they obtain Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>But again, a Sinner may be comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little Sinner, and ſenſibly a great one.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:003637_0058_10023AB66C331810"/>
There is then two ſorts of greatneſs in Sin; greatneſs by reaſon of Number, greatneſs by reaſon of throughneſs of Conviction of the horrible Nature of Sin. In this laſt Senſe, he that has but one Sin, if ſuch a one could be found, may in his own Eyes find himſelf the biggeſt Sinner in the World. Let this Man, or this Child therefore put himſelf among the great Sinners, and plead with God as great Sinners do, and expect to be ſaved with the great Sinners; as ſoon and as heartily as they.</p>
               <p>Yea, a little Sinner, that comparatively is truly ſo, if he ſhall graciouſly give way to Conviction, and ſhall in God's light, dilligently weigh the horrible Nature of his own Sins may yet ſooner obtain For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for them at the hands of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, than he that has ten times his Sins, and ſo cauſe to cry ten times harder to God for his Mercy.</p>
               <p>For the grievouſneſs of the Cry is a great thing with God; for if he will hear the Widow if ſhe cries at all, how much if ſhe cries moſt grievouſly? <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.22, 23.</p>
               <p>It is not the number, but the true ſenſe of the abominable Nature of Sin, that makes the cry for Pardon Lamentable. He, as I ſaid, that has many Sins may not cry ſo loud in the Ears of God as he that has far fewer; he in our preſent ſenſe, that is in his own Eyes the biggeſt Sinner, is he that ſooneſt findeth Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:003637_0059_10023A98F714A5A0"/>The offer then is to the biggeſt Sinner to the biggeſt Sinner firſt, and the Mercy is firſt obtained, by him that firſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to be ſuch an one.</p>
               <p>There are Men that ſtrive at the Throne of Grace for Mercy by pleading the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Neceſſity. Now their Plea, as to the prevalency of it, lieth not in their counting up of the number, but in their ſenſe of the greatneſs of their Sins, and in the Vehemency of their Cry for Pardon. And it is obſervable, that tho' the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right was <hi>Reubens,</hi> and for his Fooliſhneſs, given to the Sons of <hi>Joſeph</hi>; yet <hi>Judah</hi> prevailed before his Brethren, and of him came the <hi>Meſſias</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.1, 3.</p>
               <p>There is a heavenly Subtilty to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged in this matter, <hi>Thy Brother came with Subtilty and hath taken thy Bleſſing</hi> The Bleſſing belonged to <hi>Eſau,</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> by his Diligence made it his own, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.35. The offer is to the biggeſt Sinner; to the biggeſt Sinner firſt, but if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to cry, the Sinner that is a Sinner leſs by far than he, both as to the Number and the Nature of Tranſgreſſion, may get the Bleſſing firſt, if he ſhould have Grace to beſtir himſelf well, for the loudeſt cry is heard furtheſt; and the moſt lamentable, pierces ſooneſt.</p>
               <p>I therefore urge this Head, not becauſe I would have little Sinners go and tell God
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003637_0059_10023A98F714A5A0"/>
that they are little Sinners, thereby to think to obtain his Mercy; for verily, ſo they are never like to have it: For ſuch words declare, that ſuch a one hath no true ſenſe at all of the nature of his Sins.</p>
               <p>Sin, as I ſaid, in the Nature of it, is horrible; tho' it be but one ſingle ſin as to act; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, tho' it be but a ſinful thought, and ſo worthily calls for the Damnation of the Soul.</p>
               <p>The Compariſon then, of little &amp; great ſinners, is to go for good ſenſe among Men: But to plead the fewneſs of thy ſins, or the comparative harmleſsneſs of their quality before God, argueth no ſound Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature of thy ſin, and ſo no true ſenſe of the Nature or Need of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Little ſinner, when therefore thou goeſt to God, tho' thou knoweſt in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that thou as to acts are no Thief, no Murderer, no Whore, no Liar, no falſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alſo labour not to leſſen thy own, but magnifie and greaten them by all juſt Circumſtances, and be as if there was never a ſinner in the World but thy ſelf. Alſo cry out as if thou waſt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undone Man, and that is the way to obtain God's Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:003637_0060_10023AA6878E76A8"/>It was one of the comlieſt Lights in the World, to ſee a little ſinner commenting upon the greatneſs of his ſins; and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to himſelf; till he makes them in his own Eyes bigger and bigger than he ſeeth any other Mans ſins to be in the World; and as baſe a thing it is to ſee a Man do otherwiſe, and as baſely will come on't <hi>Luke</hi> 18.10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>As therefore I ſaid to the great ſinner before, let him take heed leſt he preſumes, I ſay now to the little ſinner, let him take heed that he don't diſſemble: For there is as great an Aptneſs in the little ſinner to diſſemble, as there is in the great one. <hi>He that hideth his ſins ſhall not Proſper,</hi> be he a little ſinner or great, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18 13.</p>

               <p>This is Satans Maſter-Argument, Thou art a horrible Sinner, a Hypocrite, one that has a prophane Heart, and one that is an utter ſtranger to a work of Grace. I ſay, this is his Maul, his Club, his Maſter-piece:

               </p>
               <p>Was therefore the Tempted but aware he might ſay, Ay Satan, for I am, I am a Sinner of the biggeſt ſize, and therefore have moſt need of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſuch a wretch? therefore <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> calls me; yea, he calls me firſt: The firſt proffer of the Goſpel is to be made to the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinner</hi>: I am he, wherefore ſtand back Satan, make a <hi>Lane,</hi> my right is firſt to come to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Nor can we have better Encouragement to do this, than is by the Text ſet before us, even an open Heart for a <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinner,</hi> and if for a <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinner</hi> to come, then for ſuch an one when come, if ſuch an one to be ſaved, than for ſuch an one that is ſaved.

nothing was ever ſpoken truer of him by the World. Now why ſhould we lay Hands croſs on this Text, that is, chooſe good Victuals and love the ſweet Wine better than the Salvation of the poor Publican? Why not familiar with Sinners, provided we hate their Spots and Blemiſhes, and ſeek that they may be healed of them.</p>

               <p>Practical Love which ſtands in ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in Charity to my Neighbour, and a Patient enduring of Affliction for his Name. This is counted Love.</p>
               <p>Right Love to Chriſt, is that which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it a provoking Argument to others of the Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.</p>
               <p>Should a Man ask me how he ſhould know that he loved the Chiidren of God? The beſt anſwer I could give him, would be in the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>John; By this</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we know we love the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, when we love God and keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.2.</p>
               <p>Love to God and Chriſt is then ſhewn, when we are tender of his Name, and then we ſhew our ſelves tender of his Name, when we are afraid to break any, the leaſt of his Commandments. And when we are here, then do we ſhew our Love to our Brother alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:003637_0068_10023AA25ABF0008"/>Now we have Obligation ſufficient thus to do, for that our Lord loved us, and gave himſelf for us, to deliver us from Death, that we might live thro' him.</p>
               <p>The World, when they hear the doctrine that I have aſſerted and handled in this little Book, to wit, That Jeſus Chriſt would have Mercy offered in the firſt place to the biggeſt Sinners; will be apt, becauſe themſelves are Unbelievers, to think that this is a Doctrine that leads to Looſneſs, and that gives Liberty to the Fleſh; but if you that believe love your Brethren, and your Neighbours truly, and as you ſhould, you will put to Silence the Ignorance of ſuch fooliſh Men, and ſtop their Mouths from ſpeaking Evil of you.</p>
               <p>And I ſay, Let the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain to this: Who deſerveth our Heart, our Mouth, our Life, our Goods ſo much as Jeſus Chriſt who has bought us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his Blood, to this very end, that we ſhould be a peculiar People Zealous of good Works?</p>
               <p>There is nothing more ſeemly in the World, then to ſee a Chriſtian walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Goſpel; nor any thing more unbecoming a reaſonable Creature, than to hear a Man ſay, I believe in Chriſt, and yet ſee in his Life Debauchery and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Such Men ſhould be counted the baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Men: Such Men ſhould be counted

               <p>For ſo it is written, we ſhould carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: Whoſo has a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and denys the Power thereof, from ſuch we muſt turn away.</p>
               <p>It has oft-times come into my Mind to ask by what Means it is, that the Goſpel Profeſſion ſhould be ſo haunted with looſe and carnal Goſpelers? And I could never arrive to better Satisfaction in the matter than this: Such Men are made Profeſſors by the Devil, and ſo by him put among the reſt of the Godly. A certain Man had a fruitleſs Fig-tree planted in his Vineyard; but by whom was it planted there? Even him that ſowed the Tares, his own Children among the Wheat, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.37, <hi>to</hi> 40. And that was the Devil. But why doth the Devil do thus: Not of love to them, but to make of them Offences and ſtumbling-blocks to others. For he knows that a looſe profeſſor in the Church, does more miſchief to Religion than ten can do to it that are in the World.</p>
               <p>Was it not, think you, the Devil that ſtirred up the Damſel that you read of in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. to cry out, <hi>Theſe are the Servants of the moſt high God that ſhew unto us the way of Salvation</hi>; Yes, it was as is evident,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:003637_0069_10023AC039D7C8F8"/>
for <hi>Paul</hi> was grieved to hear it. But why did the Devil ſtir up her to cry ſo? But becauſe that was the way to blemiſh the Goſpel, to make the World think that it came from the ſame hand as did her Sooth-ſaying and Witchery, v. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs O Lord, becomes thy Houſe for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let therefore, whoever they be that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Name of Chriſt, take heed that that ſcandal not profeſſion which they make of him, ſince he has ſo graciouſly offered us, as we are Sinners of the biggeſt ſize, in the firſt place his Grace to ſave us.</p>
               <p>Having thus far ſpoken of the Riches of the Grace of Chriſt, and of the the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Heart to embrace the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſinners,</hi> it may not be amiſs to give you yet as a Caution, an Intimation of one thing, namely, <hi>That this Grace and Freeneſs of the Heart is limited to Time and Day, the which whoſo</hi> overſtandeth, <hi>ſhall Periſh notwithſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as a King who of Grace, ſendeth out to his rebellious People, an Offer of Pardon, if they accept thereof by ſuch a Day, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headeth or hangeth, thoſe that come not in for Mercy until the Day or Time be paſt. So Chriſt Jeſus has ſet the Sinner a Day of Salvation, and acceptable times; but he who ſtandeth out, or goeth on in Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond that time, is like to come off with the loſs of his Soul. 2 Cor. 6.2. Heb.
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:003637_0069_10023AC039D7C8F8"/>
3.13, 16 <hi>to</hi> 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4 7. Luk. 19.31.42.</p>
               <p>Since therefore things are thus, it may. be convenient here to touch a little upon theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this day or time thus limited when it is conſidered with Reference to this or that Man, is oft-times undiſcerned by the Perſon concerned therein; and always is kept ſecret as to the ſhutting up thereof.</p>
               <p>And this in the Wiſdom of God is thus to the end, no Man when called upon, ſhould put off turning to God to another time: Now and to Day, is that, and only that which is revealed in Holy Writ, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13, 16.</p>
               <p>And this ſhews us the deſperate hazards which thoſe Men run, who when Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Conviction attends them, put off turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God to be ſaved till another, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they think a more fit Seaſon and time; for many by ſo doing defer this to Day, till the Day of God's Patience and long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ended: and then, for their Prayers and Crys after Mercy, they receive nothing but Mocks, and are laughed at by the God of Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20 <hi>to</hi> 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.65.12 <hi>to</hi> 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 66.4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11, 12.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is this, namely, that the Day of God's Grace with ſome Men begins ſooner, and alſo ſooner ends, than it doth with others. Thoſe at the firſt Hour of the Day, had
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:003637_0070_1002022BA35B54A0"/>
their Call ſooner than they who were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to turn to God, at the <hi>Sixth</hi> Hour of the Day; yea, and they who were hired at the <hi>Third</hi> Hour, had their Call ſooner than they who were called at the <hi>Eleventh, Matth.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Day of God's Patience began with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and alſo ended before he was twenty Years old. At thirteen Years of Age he was Circumciſed; and the next Year after <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born, and then <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was fourteen Years old: Now that Day that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was weaned, that Day was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> rejected; and ſuppoſe that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was three Years old before he was weaned; that Day was but the ſeventeenth Year of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> wherefore then the Day of God's Grace was ended with him betimes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.24.25. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.2. <hi>to</hi> 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Cain's</hi> Days ended with him betimes, for after God had rejected him, he lived to beget many Children, and built a City, and to do many other things.</p>
               <p>But alas, all that while he was a Fugative and a Vagabond. Nor carried he any thing with him after the Day of his Rejection was come, but this doleful Language in his Conſcience, <hi>from God's Face ſhall I be hid.</hi> Gen. 4.10 <hi>to</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Eſau</hi> thro' his Extravigancies, would needs go ſell his Birth right, not fearing (as other confident Fools) but that yet

the Bleſſing would ſtill be his, after which he liv'd many Years, but all of them under the Wrath of God, as was when time came, made appear to his Deſtruction; for <hi>when be would have inherited the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many Inſtances might be given as to ſuch Tokens of the Diſpleaſure of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as fool away, as the Wiſe Man has it, the Prize put into his Hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16.</p>
               <p>Let theſe things therefore be a further Caution to thoſe that fit under the glorious Sound of the Goſpel, and hear of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Grace of God in Chriſt to poor Sinners.</p>
               <p>To ſlight Grace, to deſpiſe Mercy, and to ſtop the Ear when God ſpeaks, when he ſpeaks ſuch great th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>gs ſo much to our Profit, is a great Provocation.</p>
               <p>He offereth, he calls, he wooes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, he prays, he beſeeches us, in this Day of his Grace to be reconciled to him; yea, and has provided for us the Means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation himſelf: Now this deſpiſed muſt needs be provoking, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</p>
               <p>But ſome Men may ſay unto me, Fain I would be ſaved, fain I would be ſaved by Chriſt; But I fear this Day of Grace is
