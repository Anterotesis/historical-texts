            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF our government has purſued the courſe dictated by the ſpirit of our revolution; if good government requires the ſubjugation of one half of the community; if repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans have deſerved the laſhes and contempt which have been moſt liberally dealt to them in this State for eleven years; or if the ſpirit of perſecution has ſubſided:— Then the writer of theſe pages has been extremely unfortunate in the choice of his ſubject.</p>
            <p>But Intolerance, with its hydra heads, ſtill roams about the State and no mercy is ſhewn to thoſe who doubt the wiſdom of the preſent adminiſtration. The efforts of an individual are ſeeble when oppoſed to the phalanx which ſtand prepared to cruſh, in its infancy, freedom of enquiry and diſcuſſion. If theſe ſentiments, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no high parentage, ſhould ſail of gaining the patronage of <hi>numbers</hi> in the State, they will be unable to endure even through the ſhort period which generally bounds the exiſtence of ſuch ephemeral productions.</p>

            <p>Are ſuch ſuggeſtions to be lightly regarded when it is now known that a number of men, who have been our political leaders, were holding their meetings in the year 1787 to contrive ways and means for the eſtabliſhment of what they termed, <hi>A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated Monarchy?</hi> When we read the ſpeech of General Hamilton in the Federal Convention, and now find him at the head of our army?

            <p>Our ſouthern brethren wonder that Connecticut, once the garden of liberty, ſhould now appear to be the hot-bed of ariſtocracy—that Connecticut, internally the moſt democratic State in the union or in the world—a State where the opinions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have governed for more than a century; where government is leſs expenſive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic than in any other State; and were diſtinction of rank is hardly known, ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to expenſive, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If atheiſm and modern philoſophy prevailed in the State, there might be ſome fear of the final prevalence of ariſtocracy; but <hi>there is not an athe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It has been ſuſpected that ſome of the leading clergy wiſh to combine Church and State; but the body of the clergy, though they have preached Robiſon and circulated Barruel rather freely, have good intentions, and as faſt as they ſhall diſcover <hi>the tendency of our meaſures to be againſt religion,</hi> they will become good repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans.

            <p>For eleven years freedom of the preſs and of opinion have been reſtrained; federal meaſures have been preſented to the people <hi>highly coloured and embelliſhed with cuts;</hi>— an habitual confidence in the ſtate-repreſentation has been extended to the federal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; after the exertions of the revolutionary war, the people habitually induſtrions, retired to their farms and occupations, and the calm, which naturally ſucceeds the turbulence of war, ſuperindured by federal opiates, has hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them in a ſtate of peaceful ſubmiſſion to the conſtituted authorities.</p>
            <p>But a ſeaſon has now arrived when "a little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber, a little more ſolding of the hands to ſleep," and they aſſuredly wake to a ſtate of <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ruin,</hi> more dreadful to freemen than the ruins of empires. Our people are now rapidly declaring themſelves on the republican ſide; The tendency of meaſures has rouſed them, and we ſhall finally prove to the world, that as Connecticut was among the <hi>firſt to aſſert,</hi> ſhe will be among the <hi>laſt to reſign,</hi> the bleſſings of equal government and the ineſtimable rights of man.</p>

            <head>POLITICAL DELUSION.</head>
            <p>ON the eve of a day ſet apart for a literary feaſt of fat things, I have adjudged that a plain diſh would be moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. Indeed, had it been aſſigned to me to ſpeak to you of Greece and Rome; of the inexhauſtible treaſures of Hebrew, Greek and Arabic, or to have diſcuſſed the height and diameter of the antediluvians, or to have explained the cauſe why a black man is not a white man, or why an elm tree does not bear apricots: you muſt have ſat here in ſilence, and the ſpirit would never have moved me to addreſs you. Avoiding literary diſcuſſion, I have ſelected as the theme of this occaſion, THE EXTENT AND POWER OF POLITICAL DELUSION.</p>
            <p>The <hi>character</hi> of deluſion is moſt ſtrongly marked at its firſt appearance in our world, when Satan (<hi>cidevant</hi> that old ſerpent, now called "the arch jacobin"<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Lee's Sermon, preached at Colebrook, July 4,1800.</note>) practiſed his deceit on our federal mother, ſaying to her, "For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then ſhall your eyes be opened and ye ſhall be as gods knowing good and evil." In the work of deceit, Satan has in all ages been uniform; he begins by quoting the knowledge of God in proof of that which is falſe; he wiſhes to perſuade men to do that which they ought to avoid; he promiſes them good, and they ſuffer evil; thoſe, who follow his advice, find the earth curſed for their ſakes; thorns and thiſtles ſpring up in place of fruits and flowers; by the ſweat of their faces they eat their bread, till they return to the ground: and as for Satan, ſooner or later he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to thoſe, whom he has deceived, literally curſed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036980_0005_100B7420A8EA26D0"/>above all cattle. I ſhall now leave Satan to that claſs of men, whoſe profeſſional buſineſs is to detect his deluſions, with this remark, that I doubt much whether they have rightly underſtood his <hi>political</hi> character.</p>
            <p>The <hi>agents</hi> of deluſion are, the great, the wiſe, rich and mighty men of the world. Theſe, acting with powers of ſubſtitution, are very ſagacious in chooſing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſecuring, fit inſtruments for their purpoſes. Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prepares his prime agents with charming outſides, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging manners, powerful addreſs, and inexhauſtible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. He furniſhes them with an accurate knowledge of the heart, and opens all the avenues to the paſſions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>means</hi> of deluſion are, uniformly the walking in a vain ſhow, hypocriſy aſſuming the garb of religion, pride of meekneſs, knavery of honeſty, ambition of patriotiſm. As a full aſſumption of character is neceſſary to ſucceſs, and as deluſion naturally over-acts, you find the greateſt impoſtors in our world to have appeared more holy, meek, honeſt and patriotic than other men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>object</hi> of deluſion is, to gain the wealth, honors and favors of men by cheap, falſe and inſidious means.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſubjects</hi> of deluſion are, the laboring and ſubordinate people throughout the world. Their toil goes to ſupport the ſplendor, luxury and vices of the deluders, or their blood flows to ſatiate lawleſs ambition. Nearly the whole of Africa, and a conſiderable part of Aſia, are ſubject to the deluſions of Europe: ſlaves in immenſe troops muſt ſweat under a ſcorching ſun to bear or follow the palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin of a lordly maſter: ſlaves by ſhip-loads muſt be dragged from their homes to ſerve imperious tyrants: immenſe multitudes muſt be bowing to ſtocks and ſtones, or kneeling before images and lighted tapers, to gratify the zeal of impoſtors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>end</hi> of deluſion is, the elevation of the deluders to a condition of power, ſplendor and infallibility, and the reduction of the deluded from knowledge to ignorance, from freedom to ſlavery, from wealth to want, from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyment to a deſtitution of all things, and from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes to ceaſeleſs doubt.</p>
            <p>Having defined my ſubject, I ſhall exclude from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion all ancient deluſions, from a perſuaſion that to us
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036980_0006_100B74232F208788"/>the preſent moment, the preſent character of man, the preſent form and preſſure of the times are infinitely more intereſting than all the paſt.</p>
            <p>I might here entertain you with ſome of the light ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of deluſion in the ordinary walks of life; but have preferred to lead you at once into the political field, where he brings into general action all his forces, and diſplays all his character.</p>
            <p>Having no leiſure to make long porches, or to take by houſe-row the meaſures of our government, I ſhall lead you at once into the <hi>commercial ſyſtem</hi>—which, like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>all, gives you acceſs to all the rooms of the federal building.</p>
            <p>When republicans<note n="*" place="bottom">The terms "republican and democrat," are uſed ſynonomouſly throughout: becauſe the men who maintain the principles of 1776, are characteriſed by one or the other of theſe names in different parts of the country.</note> complain of a Navy, of diplomatic corps, of Algerine tribute, or Britiſh treaty, the uniform reply of the agents of deluſion is, "all theſe things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to commerce, and commerce is the hand maid of induſtry; abridge our political arrangements, ſay they, and all your well-earned produce would periſh; your ſhip-timber and ſhips would be of no value; your ſeamen would become towns-poor; your rope walks go to decay, and your merchants become bankrupt!"</p>
            <p>Now every well informed merchant knows that there is not one word of truth in all this; yet, as Deluſion has forged the ſtory for his benefit, he is diſpoſed not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit it, and when ſuch a plauſible kind of things get a currency, they will paſs like a well counterfeited bill, till by accident the deceit is diſcovered, by which time the counterfeiter has gained all his ends. Every reflecting man knows that if the moſt worthleſs produce in the world will attract our veſſels to the moſt diſtant ports, laden with the ſtaples of this country, then theſe ſtaples would, from their intrinſic and unfailing value, together with the profits of the carrying trade, invite the merchants of thoſe ports to come and purchaſe of us. At our own doors we can make better bargains than abroad; we loſe nothing by dangers of ſea, waſtage, caſualties or bankruptcy; we receive every thing at full weight and gauge, and our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036980_0007_100B7426B20EF8D0"/>are put off in the beſt poſſible order without any diminution.</p>
            <p>Now, if with free ports and commerce thus conducted, our merchants could not live, then they live now merely by virtue of certain advantages tendered to them by the government, every one of which takes a million of dollars out of your pockets in order to enable you to gain half a million in another way. If the carrying trade is valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we retaining this trade by political arrangements ſecure it to our merchants, and yet Spain, Holland and Great-Britain are willing to exchange their manufactures in their own ports for our produce, then ſurely our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce would be in high demand, and an object of ſupreme competition, if government would ſuffer the carrying trade to operate as a premium in favor of our market.</p>
            <p>The fundamental propoſition, viz. that ſeparate from the preſent ſyſtem, our articles would not be in market is pointedly denied, and if this is falſe, the whole ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure falls.</p>
            <p>The real object is diametrically oppoſite to the oſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one. The agricultural intereſt, inſtead of being help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is vitally attacked. This charming commercial ſyſtem, ſo ſedulouſly and artfully addreſſed to the yeomanry of our country, is a ſyſtem of indebtedneſs and eventual bankruptcy. Confining the carrying trade to ourſelves, opens an infinite field of credit to the merchant. Millions of property, belonging to the farmers, muſt conſtantly be in the hands of the merchants; for if the avails of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure are to come from all quarters of the globe, there muſt be an average credit given by the farmers till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns can be made. This draws on to the water an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe quantity of property, and intereſts the farmers ſtrongly in the ſucceſs of the merchants whom they have truſted. This property on the water is within fiſcal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and controul. Government has purpoſes to anſwer. The merchant is indirectly the collector of a great portion of the revenue. The merchant can lend ſhips and cargoes to government. The merchant can plan long, circuitous and hazardous voyages, apparently at his own riſque; but really at the riſque of the farmer; for all loſſes muſt eventfully fall on thoſe who truſt. Theſe arrangement
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036980_0008_100B74290B56EC70"/>leading great capitals in trade, great bankruptcies and great fortunes. They fill the ſea with veſſels and ſailors, valuable auxiliaries and reverberators to a naval ſyſtem. This laſt being calculated to protect the merchants, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures their perpetual attachment, and they freely advocate the extraordinary expenſes of an armament. Their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is thrown directly in the ſcale oppoſed to the farmer, and government has thereby ſecured a number of capitaliſts to whom reſort may be had in the day when grinding runs low at the treaſury.</p>
            <p>Before the adoption of this ſyſtem, ſilver and gold mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the laws of induſtry; but now banks are introduced, giving to paper a forced and unnatural circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, taking the command of the medium of all buſineſs from the agricultural intereſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">Money ought to repreſent induſtry: the farmer's dollars earned by labor do repreſent it: bank bills do not. It is hard on the farmer, that the man who earns nothing through the year, ſhould be able with an indorſed note to raiſe in an hour, double the annual avails of his farm, and to glut the market with money at the very moment when the farmer is ready to bring his dollars to market. Directors of banks can make money ſcarce or plenty as they pleaſe: but though banks are ruinous to the farmers, they are neceſſary to a forced commerce.</note> and yielding it wholly to the commercial.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder that in the complexity of this policy, the farmer is loſt in the midſt of paper bills, boundleſs credit, crouded harbours, princely eſtates, and made to cry out? O! the depth of the wiſdom of adminiſtration! little dreaming that he has in fact paid and is paying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the whole profits of the carrying trade, the whole of the Algerine tribute, the expence of all commercial treaties—of all the conſuls abroad—the amount of all the loſſes by ſea—of all bad markets, and of all navy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences —that the money, which he pays ſuffers many ſweatings before it gets to the treaſury, and that what he does not pay is placed on intereſt, and that the land from which he raiſes this produce, which excites ſuch a fatherly care of government, is pledged for the payment of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt, and that his children may always ſee the date and amount of the mortgage by calling on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors of the revenue. Little ſhort of miracle can redeem men from ſuch maſterly ſtrokes of deluſion.</p>
            <p>This mercantile ſyſtem leads up an appearance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036980_0009_100B742A8D0C2620"/>proſperity, the reality of which is craftily aſcribed to government; but individuals appear to the world moſt thrifty, when they are thriftily expending the price of their mortgaged eſtates: nations appear moſt buſy and thriving in ſeaſons of the greateſt expence and public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation: for ſuch occaſions draw all the money into view and give it a rapid circulation. When a dollar changed owners once in a week it counted only for a dollar; but when by the magic power of a forced commerce it changes owners an hundred times in a week it counts for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars. If all the property of a town like this were to be tranſported every day through all the ſtreets, there would be great commotion and a great ſhow of buſineſs and wealth, and the gaping world might admire the thrift of the place, and might lend money on the credit of it. Juſt like ſuch a farce is that of the great public proſperity now enjoyed. The people are not more induſtrious than they were before the revolution: they are certainly more extravagant, mortages abound more on the records—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding public and private indebtedneſs, there never was a ſeaſon before this when the people were ſo deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved. Burn all your paper-bills, and your paper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of debt, public and private, worlds full of which would not add one cent to the real worth of any country, or collect the debts evidenced by theſe papers, and which now lie as a heavy weight on the houſes, lands and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the people, and this deluſive viſion of proſperity would vaniſh: but this deluſion anſwers the political pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of unſettling the public mind, of deſtroying frigid ideas of oeconomy and of making tolerable many public projections, which otherwiſe would be deteſted.</p>
            <p>This commercial ſyſtem preſents to the world an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe tonnage, which not only fortifies the appearance of proſperity; but affords employment to a numerous claſs of men on land, who muſt feel grateful for a ſyſtem which yields them wealth; and it employs a number of maſters and mates, who muſt kiſs the hand which feeds them; and ſailors, who are moſt valuable aſtringents in the ingredient of power, and may anſwer for lining to wooden walls; and deluſion whiſpers that by theſe things all the money is ſaved among ourſelves. Though this is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036980_0010_100B742CE93024C8"/>among Deluſion's weak tricks, yet it is too often ſucceſsful. It has been well ſaid that it will coſt two ducats to keep one in priſon. To the man who is able to pay for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it matters not whether that which is to fill his coffers be now in his own town, or in Madrid or Canton: his induſtry will draw it from the ends of the earth. If we lived on an iſthmus or an iſland, the ſuggeſtion of ſaving the money might be more plauſible; but living in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of immenſe extent, capable of employing more than ten times its number of inhabitants, capable of infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal defence, and of keeping tributary to us all nations ſo long as natural or artificial wants ſhall be known in the world, it is an idle ſuggeſtion—and the time will come, when it will be hard to make the readers of hiſtory believe that Americans in the infancy of ſociety, of ſettlement and agriculture, did ſeriouſly undertake to fight their way through nations, whom they could not buy nor bribe, to carry the neceſſaries of life to the men of thoſe nations who were periſhing for the want of them, and then with a return-cargo of far leſs uſeful produce to fight their way home again—and that all this was done with the full and free conſent of the men who raiſed the exports, and who could have ſold them without hazard for a better price at their own doors.</p>
            <p>Commerce, aided by banks, draws property into the hands of men without the medium of induſtry. Such men not knowing the earning of money are adventurous and extravagant. They become embarraſſed—and nearly one half of the people in our populous cities are running after the other half in conſequence of this embarraſſment. The debtor walks quick when he is avoiding his credtior. The creditor moves quick after him—The bankrupt ſells rapidly his ſtock on hand—The vendue-rooms receive the refuſe. Theſe are domeſtic ſcenes of proſperity! On the water we are loſing ſhips and cargoes, and lives, and to foreign courts are dancing attendance or paying tribute for theſe privileges.</p>
            <p>On this commercial ſubject deluſion is ſtrong; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents imaginary advantages, demonſtrable on paper, but falſe in fact, and theſe can be preſented in every variety and ſucceſſion, Impreſſions are eaſily made: loſs or gain
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036980_0011_100B742FA08DF048"/>equally ſtimulate the ſpirit of adventure. Commerce draws into its vortex one claſs of men after another, and when the farming intereſt yields decidedly to this faſcinating ſyſtem but a few years elapſe before commerce commands all the wealth of the country. A navy becomes neceſſary, and the ſame neceſſity which laſt year led up ſloops of war, this year leads up frigates and the next ſhips of the line: ſloops can only beat off gun-boats; frigates and ſhips can only meet equal guns; the principle of power demands that we be the moſt powerful; increaſed debt and taxes are inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the enormous expenſe of ſupporting a navy<note n="*" place="bottom">There never was any want of pretences for ſubjugating a people.

When a national debt is beyond redemption, the addition of a few millions is of little moment; it lightens the burden of the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; they and their taſk-maſters will ſoon be out of the region of murmuring. The next generation will open their eyes on a bright ſun—fertile country—ſplendid ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties —national debt—and though they may wonder for a time at the artificial evils of ſociety; yet they will ſurely have philoſophy enough to compoſe themſelves under ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which they cannot avoid, and to conſider it as the lot of man that the evil ſhall be ſet over againſt the good, that man may literally find nothing after him. In that day the principles of our revolution will be either forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or conſidered as the ravings of viſionaries; the ſyſtems of great nations will be adopted in their extent. In that day will be no murmuring democrats, no deadly diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizers: government will move ſtrong, as did the Church of Rome. when the tortures of the Inquiſition could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of convincing argument, and the thunders of heaven be hurled at pleaſure on the devoted heads of heretics.</p>
            <p>Aſk the merchants, can you ſupport commerce and pay the expences of its protection? They will readily anſwer, no. Then it is clear that commerce is not paying for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the people are paying for it more than it is worth; but the ſyſtem of naval defence ſecures the mercantile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036980_0012_100B74320858E6E0"/>the clergy are gained by the confidence repoſed in them, and the ſmiles which they get for their influence; the army and government printers, and collectors, and officers of all deſcriptions are ſecured by the treaſury; and to ſupport all theſe eſtabliſhments, you the people of the United States, have been paying more than 20,000 dollars a day ever ſince the new government has been in operation; that is, in eleven years you have paid more than eighty three millions of dollars, and in the preſent year it is coſting you more than 1,700 dollars an hour to ſupport the public burdens. It goes from you in cents and ſmall change, and the return of expenditures is in groſs millions. The Preſident's ſalary and the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to members of congreſs, ſo often complained of, form but a very ſmall part of the bill. The intereſt of the national debt is a ſtanding diſh. The federal city, begun on a ſyſtem rivalling in expenſe and magnificence ancient Babylon, has been a fink for your money. The military eſtabliſhment and navy are immenſely expenſive.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix.</note> Your great men abroad need ſome pocket money. The Dey of Algiers can account for 24.000 dollars a year, beſide the frigate Creſcent and ſome extras. Should you get involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in war, imperious neceſſity would demand new loans. Your houſes and lands are apprized; you have paid one ground-rent for them, and they will be good ſecurity for any additional debt. The preſent ſyſtem of meaſures will lead to war. You cannot keep a navy long afloat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving inſults, or provoking hoſtilities. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mix with foreign courts and avoid foreign policy. When cauſes of diſcontent increaſe, miniſters have found it their intereſt to engage directly in war. During the ſeaſon of war the miniſter has an army and navy at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand —war requires expenſe, huſhes clamor, and veils in myſtery all cabinet meaſures. I ſhall now open to you the appropriate deluſions of the WAR SYSTEM.</p>
            <p>War preſents to all the country a commiſſion to ſeize and carry to legal adjudication the commercial property of an adverſe nation. War opens all the flood-gates of the human paſſions. War calls into the employment of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036980_0013_100B743536218B40"/>an immenſe multitude. Contractors through all the mechanical arts pronounce a bleſſing on war.— The grazier adores the adminiſtration. The legions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to admiralty courts, inſurers, dealers in ſtock, bankrupts, and to all men to whom change of times muſt be for the better, bleſs the government. The capitaliſt who has long kept his money for the public, bleſſes the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and over them all the chaplain pronounces an hearty amen. In the midſt of all, the ſtraggling patriots, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be outdone by their brethren, bring their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of rags to the treaſury, and from the midſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and national diſſipation forth comes the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immenſely rich in all the magnificence of paper.</p>
            <p>Though deluſion has played this farce a thouſand times over and has always ſucceſsfully compaſſed the <hi>means,</hi> it has never concealed the <hi>end.</hi> That end is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly the degrading of morals and religion—derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of buſineſs—increaſe of national debt, leading to a long train of public burdens—decreaſe of private and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial happineſs, and a certain ſinking of the people beneath the civil, military and naval functionaries of this mighty farce.</p>
            <p>The tribes of Africa fight, becauſe Europeans will buy their priſoners. Cabinets wage wars, becauſe by them they are ſure of their object, which is to exalt themſelves and to humble thoſe who are beneath them. This has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the caſe and always will be, ſo long as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple give the reins out of their own hands, ſo long as they beſtow more power on government than is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſo long as they ſuffer themſelves and their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions to be deſpiſed. Wars have been the means by which theſe cabinets have effected their purpoſes. The great, wiſe and rich men well underſtand the art of inflaming the public mind and generally preſent at the outſet <hi>the deluſive bubble of national glory,</hi> a thing in which nine tenths of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety have no kind of intereſt; but which well managed turns into crowns and diamonds in the hands of the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Courtiers tell <hi>ſlaves</hi> that liberty is in danger, or that infidels abound and the church is in hazard, or of plots at home or invaſions and inſults abroad. Courtier's waiters echo the alarm. Court-telegraphs ſpread the ſound.—
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036980_0014_100B7437B1967540"/>Court-caſuiſts find it typiſied in the pentateuch. War is decided on; armies are raiſed; the legions, who depend on war for ſupport, are all in motion; the papers are full of news; public curioſity is on the ſtretch. The cabinet, which in time of peace was occupied only in the means of internal order, has now to conſult the balances of foreign governments—to receive letters weighing five ounces in ſhips of 500 tons ſailing in ballaſt—is thronged with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes; great ſcenes are opening; the naval armament, which but for this had been laid up in dry docks, and the army, which in time of peace was in no eſtimation, riſe into importance; prize maſters arrive with the ill-gotten wealth of honeſt adventurers. The country abounds with proof prints of admirals and generals and naval engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, forts ſtormed and all the dignified array of carnage and deſolation.</p>
            <p>Here deluſion opens batteries, which are never ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced till liberty and public happineſs are gone forever; for a war ſyſtem is fatal to them both.</p>
            <p>When courtiers tell you that ſuch a ſyſtem can alone preſerve peace, fly or ſight the deluſion. Mark you that the man who learns the art of fencing in his youth is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom contented with having received his leſſons, you will hear of him in a duel. An army or a navy well officered and manned is always reſtleſs in a ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of peace; war muſt and will be had at ſome rate. After a few years of war and a few bullet-holes through admirals' hats and ſome fleſh-wounds and broken limbs, the bill for ſervices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes greater than can be paid with money; honors, ſtars and ribbons or penſions muſt go towards an inſtalment. A nation which makes <hi>greatneſs</hi> its poleſtar can never be free; beneath national greatneſs ſink individual greatneſs, honor, wealth and freedom. But though hiſtory, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reaſoning confirm theſe ideas; yet all-powerful deluſion has been able to make the people of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lend a helping hand in putting on their own ſetters and rivetting their own chains, and in this ſervice delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion always employs men too great to ſpeak the truth, and yet too powerful to be doubted. Their ſtatements are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved —their projects adopted—their ends anſwered and the deluded ſubjects of all this artifice are left to paſſive
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036980_0015_100B743935199508"/>obedience through life, and to entail a condition of une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified non-reſiſtance to a ruined poſterity.</p>
            <p>To this deluſive war-ſyſtem are we indebted at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time for the redundance of national gaſconade. When the pompous ſtateſman ſafe in the cabinet, inſults the brave men of all nations and cries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But admiral Harvey has ſaid that our 44 gun frigates were 74's in diſguiſe! well, perhaps, he had heard that they coſt as much as 74's, or that under the guiſe of theſe frigates was concealed a plan of an immenſe navy, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of which would eternize our national debt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a perpetuity of energetic government. But our ſhips are not only ſtrong as mountains, they are ſwift as eagles, captain Tryon ſays ſo himſelf: and not only ſtrong and ſwift, but ſo full of courage "that men are run through the body for looking pale," ſays lieutenant Sterret.— Surely all theſe things might have been omened from the ſucceſs attending their launching.</p>
            <p>The ſun riſes with unuſual ſplendor, and ſtrange to tell, <hi>it riſes in the eaſt!</hi> The birds chaunt their matin ſongs. Out bounces from his bed that wonder of all wonders— once a boat-builder, afterwards a ſhip-wright, now a fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral navy architect. Formerly a ſhip-wright might have built a ſhip merely by virtue of his ſkill; but now if it be not conſtructed by <hi>federal</hi> axes, adzes and mallets, wielded by <hi>federal</hi> hands, it will certainly ſink. Straight collect from all quarters the ingenious men, who by force of iron bolts and cramps have been able to keep wood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all thoſe labourers who conveyed the timber and plank from where it grew to where it did not grow. Soon all the country is collected; the adjacent houſes and ſences are lined with beauty and ſtrength; old Neptune with his trident walks forty miles up a river to ſee the ſhow; every heart palpitates in uniſon, and prayers are ſent up for ſucceſs. With admirable ſkill every thing has been prepared, and with an eaſy graceful motion the ſhip glides on to the boſom of the waters, which receive the preſent from the earth with humble gratitude. At this moment the fiſh throughout the ocean thrill with rapture, and the ſhips of hoſtile nations feel a ſhock evincive of their danger; the attending throng fill the an with ſhouts; the little hills on every ſide rejoice, and the mountains echo the ſcene.<note n="*" place="bottom">If any ſhould doubt the accuracy of this picture of a launch, let them compare it with the Boſton original.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Surely after ſuch a launch, a ſhip ought to be ſtronger, and ſwifter, and fuller of brave men than all the other
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036980_0017_100B743DE7D88FC0"/>ſhips on the ocean. A few more ſuch delightful launches will launch this country from liberty to ſlavery, from a republican to a monarchical government. The great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, enormous expenſes, and cruel wars, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies lead up, are all calculated to deſtroy a condition of equal rights, and to ſacrifice private competence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial happineſs on the altar of national greatneſs. Now, if all this ſcenery of gaſconade was a mere ſport, no harm might follow from it. There might be ſome expenſe about it, and nations might conſider us cowardly, juſt as we conſider an individual cowardly who is always boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own courage; but even in this <hi>miſerable</hi> work, deluſion is playing a deep game. All this boaſting actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amuſes the people, and by degrees they get habituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an idea that a powerful navy is a very reſpectable thing, as well as a good defence to commerce.

            <p>I am aware that the frigate John Adams, and the brig Pickering, may like the Royal George, and the Pitt-Eaſt-India-man, make certain names immortal as plank and ſpikes—and the Merrimack, the Connecticut and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia gun-boats may attach the people of certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts to the ſucceſs of the navy; yet, though theſe are very pleaſant things, a republican will hardly be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them while he regards even the naming of the ſhips as among the hair-ſtrokes of deluſion.</p>
            <p>The army has not been favored with occaſions capable of exciting any very pompous encomiums—but it is in proof before the public, that the inſpector-general, while a clerk in a compting houſe, accepted a challenge which was ſent to his maſter, and behaved bravely, though he did not fight. This proves concluſively that he is the <hi>braveſt</hi> man in the world, and that Buonaparte, Moreau,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036980_0018_100B744120750948"/>and Maſſena ought to hide their diminiſhed heads; but if government did not know of this compting-houſe ſtory at the time of appointing him, I am unable to aſſign the reaſon of his being placed over the heads of experienced patriot generals born in our own country. But the army, though they did not fight, ſtood their ground boldly in their cantonments—Buonaparte and his army, whom they were raiſed to cruſh, being leſs than 8000 miles diſtant from them through the diameter of the earth. To demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic eye there was no proſpect of his viſiting us, except he perforated the earth with his army, and like Baron Trenck watched an occaſion to <hi>unearth</hi> himſelf: yet had he arrived, they would doubtleſs have given him a warm reception: but for a ſhort time only were they kept in the field: the French did not arrive: the army was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded. I have thus turned my periods much as they did theirs. Some have ſaid that this army was raiſed to enſure the ſucceſs of certain meaſures, or to influence elections, or to keep the democrats in awe, or to enable general Hamilton to exemplify his declaration, that <hi>our conſtitution was a mere temporary expedient, and that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could never be governed without an hereditary monarch:</hi> theſe ſpeculations I wave in order to remark to you,</p>
            <p>That however plauſible may be the arguments of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the ſubject of an army, a country can never be free unleſs they depend for protection on the body of the people, whoſe ruſty gun-barrels can ſend certain death from a diſtance to every bird or beaſt fleeting through the air or on the earth. Theſe are the men who will always fight bravely for their altars and their homes; but how abſurd is it to rely for defence on men, who care not for altars, and who have no homes! The only earthly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to reliance on the body of the people is, that with arms in their hands they might repel <hi>domeſtic</hi> aggreſſions.</p>
            <p>If the preſent ſtate of things ſhall continue, you will ſoon be told that bright gun-barrels are more reſpectable than ruſty ones, and that our own guns made by federa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts at 13 dollars, are ſurer of their aim than foreign guns of equal quality bought at 6, and that thus all the money is ſaved.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here deluſion generally conceals one argument, viz. "that domeſtic contracts ſtrengthen the men in place."</note> Soon it will be polite to level your piece at
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036980_0019_100B7442A2780D08"/>your enemy only breaſt high, and not to take aim, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the exmaple of the Britiſh ſoldiery; for if you take aim, ſay they, it is murder; but if you fire away at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom 30 rounds of his majeſty's powder, and one of them takes full effect, why the man is dead! but he had a fair chance for his life. Soon it will be deemed ſcandalous for a man to be fighting in his country's defence behind a tree or a ſtone wall. No! he muſt join the ſtandard, be dreſſed in uniform, and if mortally wounded, muſt languiſh ſweetly into eternity under the notes of drums and trumpets. Thundering noiſes muſt drown the cries of your brethren and children in the agonies of death.— No father to watch the ſymptoms of decaying life! No mother to drop a tear over a dying ſon! No ſiſter to ſtretch out the hand of faithful affection, and to ſoften the pillow in the moment of diſſolving nature!</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſcenes of ſtanding armies. Should our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever advance ſo far, as after having preſented a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wholly variant in detail from that which was contemplated by the people; ſhould one party violently hold to itſelf all power, and oppreſs the other party; ſhould they diſcover a want of confidence in the people, and even that they deſpiſe their opinions; ſhould they take the people's money to buy guns, and bayonets, and ſlaves to keep them under, reſt aſſured that the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent among the oppreſſed will rouſe, they will remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate loudly, they will continue to remonſtrate till they are impriſoned: then it power ſhould be extended to the taking of life, they will employ the precious remnant of days between ſentence and execution to prepare leſſons which poſterity ſhall read with admiration, when their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors ſhall be laid in inglorious duſt.</p>
            <p>Every attempt to place the defence of the country on other ground than on that of the bravery and integrity of the people: every attempt to create great diſtinctions of rank; all acts of intolerance in the ruling party; all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of contempt on public opinion, are ſo many approaches to that dreadful order of things. In this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try you can never make a hoſt of great men without a hoſt of little ones: theſe laſt cannot be produced without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. The people may bear oppreſſions gradually and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036980_0020_100B74450F4D9A40"/>to a certain point; but if the impetuoſity of the lordlings ſhall puſh it beyond that point, the people whom they now call federal, and who have been ſuch merely by an honeſt miſplaced confidence, will find themſelves betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and though not among the <hi>firſt,</hi> will be found among the <hi>firmeſt</hi> avengers of their wrongs.</p>
            <p>In the deluſions of the commercial and army ſyſtems, I have preſented two very powerful ariſtocracies; both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving ſtrength, emolument and excluſive privileges from the government; both operating with immenſe force in favour of national greatneſs, and againſt the intereſts of the body of the people.</p>
            <p>Of the funding ſyſtem I can only ſay as of the great fire in London, <hi>'tis paſt without recal;</hi> it is an awful calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; it has ruined thouſands, but this ſyſtem has alſo led up an ariſtocracy more numerous than the farmers-general in France, more powerful than all others, becauſe it combines the men of wealth, and give efficiency to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe ariſtocracies ſink the people. They can ſtand alone againſt kings or preſidents and courts; but when the great rich, wiſe and mighty among their brethren can be drawn, through an extended ſyſtem of favor, to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt them, they are in imminent danger—and to crown this danger, deluſion aſſociates with principalities and powers, thoſe who profeſs to be officers of a kingdom not of this world; they pray and preach for meaſures; they, in their moſt ſacred ſervices, offer incenſe to the great talents, tried patriotiſm, and celeſtial virtues of the mighty men in place; they baptize your children, and follow the remains of your friends to the grave, and they take your weak moments to perſuade you that the preſident and his party are as a munition of rocks to the church.</p>
            <p>We have heard that the national religion of England has been held in requiſition to ſupport the government, and that the Romiſh religion has been employed to the ſame effect in all Catholic countries. Their teſt acts, oaths and inquiſitions have been ſo many ſtate-engines to ſubordinate mankind to the great and little tyrants, who for centuries have held ſociety in bondage; but ſurely the good ſenſe of Americans is ready to repel the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts

            <p>How much, think you, has religion been benefited by ſermons, intended to ſhow that Satan and Cain were jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins? How much by ſermons in which every deiſtical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument has been preſented with its greateſt force as being a part of the republican creed? Is this, men of God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the precept, "feed my ſheep, feed my lambs?"— The people, inſtead of being alarmed leſt religion ſhould ſuffer under a new adminiſtration, ought to be infinitely ſolicitous to wreſt the protection of it from thoſe who are uſing it as a ſtate engine. The kingdom of heaven now ſuffereth political violence. Think you that the biſhop of Epheſus, if now with us, would have left the care of ſouls to aſcertain the number of votes which his favorites could get for a ſeat in Congreſs? Would Paul of Tarſus have preached to an anxious liſtening audience on the propriety of ſending envoys? I aſk theſe queſtions ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe on this ſubject the people feel ſeriouſly, and becauſe here deluſion is playing a moſt cruel game.</p>
            <p>Have you not read that the head of the church will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own cauſe, and that this cauſe will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, till wars and rumours of wars ſhall ceaſe from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole heaven? The Captain of ſalvation is not ſo weak as to need an army and navy and a majority in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to ſupport his cauſe. The ſyſtems of enmity, pride, vice and abandonment, which characteriſe all modern governments are hoſtile to religion.<note n="†" place="bottom">The precept of the Prince of Peace to his followers is, "Put up thy ſword into the ſheath."</note> The Savior would be ill received in levees, in fields of battle, or on board of hoſtile ſhips. He takes no delight in the flowing robes and maſquerade dreſs of the lords ſpiritual. The morals of courts and camps never riſe up before his throne as ſweet incenſe. Courts and camps have in all modern ages been the hot-beds of immorality, the nurſeries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. That religion, which you ſo highly value, is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036980_0022_100B744BC1DBAD70"/>ſuffering a gradual, certain and painful extermination by the very means which affect to ſupport it. While every nerve is ſtretched to obtain wealth and greatneſs, that cauſe, which began in poverty and thrives beſt in the ſhades and retirements of life muſt mourn. Our great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical arrangements are like ſo many armaments againſt religion;<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtianity has ſuffered more by attempts to unite Church and State, than by all the deiſtical writings.</note> yet the men who oppoſe them are denounced as atheiſts, and no proof of their atheiſm is required but their oppoſition to federal meaſures.</p>

            <p>In the profeſſion of the law deluſion has ſecured to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment an ariſtocracy highly intelligent and operative; and to theſe is entruſted the ladder of promotion, which they hold with as much power and claim of preſcription as the Pope holds the keys of St. Peter; and in theſe northern ſtates you find lawyers on every round of it, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending and deſcending as were the angels of God in the viſion of Jacob: though the two claſſes of characters are upon very different buſineſs. Though in this profeſſion the habits of acquiring property and the indiſcriminate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of right and wrong might ſeem to diſqualify for the buſineſs of legiſlation; yet deluſion has impreſſed it upon the people, that thoſe who talk fluently muſt be knowing —and that through much debating cometh truth: hence theſe men are the firſt in market for congreſs and the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of government—and excellent ſtuff for tranſportation to foreign courts; and it has been lately diſcovered that a thorough knowledge of the law will qualify a man<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. Dexter.</note> to be ſecretary of the war department.</p>
            <p>All theſe ariſtocracies and meaſures which I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed correſpond exactly with the ſyſtems of monarchical government. At the end of eleven years, the American nation (formerly called the United States) have with great
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036980_0023_100B744D44C56F80"/>induſtry got into a good ſtate of preparation for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary monarch. Mr. Lyman tells us that 'the ruling party is united in their <hi>object</hi> though divided as to the <hi>means</hi>—the firſt is for bold ſtrokes, the laſt for addreſs and reaſoning.' We will not run in debt to this defunct fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eraliſt for a definition of this object. It cannot be a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government; <hi>that</hi> the people have long prayed for in vain. It cannot be to get more money out of the people; for you, federaliſts, are now ſunk up to your necks in their pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. It cannot be to ſend more ambaſſadors and conſuls ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road; for they have already glutted every market. It is not to fund more debt; all claims have been de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uged with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of government. Why the object is to cruſh oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: theſe two ſegments of federaliſm, after having made arrangements obnoxious to one half of the country, are to cruſh that half, and then the firſt chapter is completed; but they are united in another object, viz. an energetic, ariſtocratic, monarchic government, which can move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul; both parts are united to ſubjugate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans, and now call for a few years more to complete the work.<note n="*" place="bottom">If it be true, as ſome ſay, that a new adminiſtration could not change the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſyſtem, then I agree with the advocates of preſent meaſures, that we ought to have an hereditary monarch. Our ariſtocracies need a monarch to keep them in check, and our plans need a monarch to direct them and ſlaves to pay for them.—Theſe plans and republicaniſm cannot live together.</note>
            </p>
            <p>My evidence of the exiſtence of ſuch an intention on the one part, (which muſt be the intention of the other if they are united) might reſult from the declaration of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Hamilton already quoted, or from a declaration of Preſident Adams to the ſame effect;<note n="†" place="bottom">That the people will not be happy till their chief magiſtrate is hereditary.</note> for theſe men know preciſely what the leaders are ſeeking: but I chooſe to rely for proof on the complexion of federal meaſures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſubmitted. We have a ſure key to the <hi>feelings</hi> of the federal party in their joy at the ſuppoſed capture of Moreau's army; their triumphs on the ſucceſs of Nelſon; their exultation at the infamous and perjured ſtory of Barbaczy, that the Directory had cauſed the murder of their own envoys at Raſtadt; their ſtrong affection for Suwarrow; their zeal for the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms and for the humiliation of republicans in France, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036980_0024_100B7450AEA1FD00"/>and Ireland. Everything abroad which looked like the downfal of freedom was publiſhed and echoed here with triumph.</p>
            <p>If perſonal declarations, public acts, and federal papers can be relied on, we have a ſtrong party in this country, who wiſh for a ſeaſon when congreſs ſhall be opened with a ſpeech from the throne to my lords and gentlemen: they wiſh to have the papers announce that the princeſs royal was at the theatre—that the young prince had fallen from his horſe, and received a ſlight contuſion in the joint of one of his fingers, which had been declared by one of his majeſty's ſurgeons not to be mortal—that the carriage of the gentleman unſher of the black rod had been broken down, but without accident; or they wiſh to hear of brilliant levees and ſplendid drawing-rooms, and if any inſane man ſhould happen to ſhoot at the precious royal pageant, they would have all the bulbous marquiſſes and bedizened earls, with the whole bevy of dukes, viſcounts and lords run to ſee who ſhould firſt gain the ſenate-houſe, and announce in faint and almoſt breathleſs accents to the lords temporal and ſpiritual, the knights of the woolſack, <hi>"my lords, the king has been ſhot at!"</hi>

            <p>Greatneſs and littleneſs are only ideas of compariſon: the baſe of the mountain is in the depth of the valley; the baſe of great men is in the lowneſs, poverty, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and humility of the people. Pride ſtimulates the knowing to be great: power furniſhes the means. When they would enſlave the people, they preſent to them pictures of liberty; when they would impoveriſh them, they preſent pictures of wealth; when they would lead them to war, they preſent pictures of peace and ſecurity. Deluſion can never ſucceed by exhibiting unadorned fact. Even the powers of reaſon and eloquence, which may be turned to infinite good, are often devoted to the production of infinite evil. When the Britiſh treaty was in diſcuſſion, had the cool reaſon of the country been addreſſed, that inſtrument had never been ratified; but when an eloquent ſtateſman.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Ames.</note> puſhing beyond this cold region, addreſſed the paſſions of the country, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the farmer with fears of danger, and rouſed the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant by hopes of indemnity, <hi>he gained attention;</hi> when

When every meaſure fatal to liberty can be made to appear conducive to it, there is need of infinite vigilance. Our great men are ready enough to preach to us peace and ſafety, even while they are leading us into ſyſtems, which will enſure to the earth a drenching of human blood through all generations, and will waft us to the ſound of the war-whoop from all the military nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>Theſe great men, who are to gain by every ſyſtem inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to freedom and equal government, are the <hi>beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> men in ſociety. They are well verſed in languages and hiſtory, and political ſcience, and are able to ſay <hi>more</hi> and argue <hi>better</hi> on the wrong ſide of the queſtion than the people are on either ſide of it. In all governments they are retained in favor of meaſures, if not by offices and bribes, yet by hopes of office, of emolument, of honors and influence. All their hopes are pledged on a perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of every part of the ſubject. Their paſſions combine with their intereſts to make them eagle-eyed and diligent to know what the people will bear—to watch the fit moment—to attack the weak ſide and to make entry wherever they find a looſe clap-board. Such men har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angued the country at the opening of our government, by telling them "that the people would be ſovereign—that the poor would be favored—that the agricultural intereſts would be held ſacred and eſpecially <hi>that taxes would be light."</hi> But when a heavy debt was created, oftenſibly from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of juſtice to the ſoldiers, though few had any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in it, the air was filled with proteſtations of gratitude and honeſty. The people were indignant; but theſe art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men ſilenced the riſing murmurs. Deluſion fat aloſt and ſmiled at the ſubtility of her ſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe men can prove concluſively that a national debt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036980_0028_100B74595E11B548"/>is a bleſſing or a curſe; that an army deſtroys or cheriſhes freedom; that the friends of government are the guardian angels of liberty, and that the oppoſers are a part of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's choſen legion. They can prove that the people virtually chooſe electors, when the men, choſen to <hi>deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the manner</hi> of the people's chooſing, ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">The conſtitution of the U.

            <p>Subtle arguments, well directed and eloquently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, ſometimes lead men aſtray on queſtions of mere right and wrong. Shall we then wonder that men ſhould be deluded on ſubjects far more complicated?</p>
            <p>The end to be anſwered by theſe arguments is immenſe; it compaſſes all the objects at which deluſion has been aiming ever ſince it appeared in Eden. Do you ſee any worldly motives in theſe eloquent patriots? Have you never known that a director of a bank wiſhes for a large capital ſubject to his arbitrament? that a judge is pleaſed with an extenſion of his juriſdiction? that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is anxious for an encreaſe of the army eſtabliſhment? and that a ſea-captain likes an addition of tonnage and guns to the ſhip which he is to command? Theſe men, who talk thus perſuaſively to you either are, or expect to be, ſharers of the power which they wiſh you to delegate, or truſtees of the confidence which they wiſh you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or managers of the money which they wiſh you to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036980_0029_100B745BDA5DC180"/>pay. Hence their zeal: hence their perſuaſive eloquence! If you ſeem to doubt them, they will aſk, are not we of you? are not our intereſts the ſame as yours? <hi>They are indeed of you:</hi> ſo is the oak, which ſhades all the ſmaller trees and draws its nouriſhment from their roots, a part of the grove. <hi>They are of you:</hi> they tread the earth which you cultivate; they feed on the luxuries which your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſupplies, and if an earthquake ſhould ſwallow the country, they muſt condeſcend to ſink with you; but by circumſtances of fortune, birth, or ſuperior beſtowments of mind, or better education, they have ceaſed to be <hi>as you;</hi> their political condition is immenſely variant from yours: they are to govern, you are to be governed. <hi>They are well-born, you are baſe-horn!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who are the men conſtantly praiſing the meaſures of government? Thoſe great, well-born! all intereſted in the ſubject of their praiſes; all craftſmen, who live by making images for the worſhippers of the great goddeſs, or thoſe really <hi>baſe-born</hi> men, who have been in the habit of following theſe great men faithfully as hounds do the horn. Theſe wiſe, pious leaders are crafty enough to ſpeak to their followers truly and rationally on common ſubjects, and by this they gain their confidence; like the retailer, who wiſhing to get cent. per cent. profit on arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles not well underſtood, will ſell his pins and needles for leſs than prime coſt. Multitudes of men, whoſe rights are daily abridging, follow on in admiration of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They are made to believe that religion is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, or that the French are coming upon us, or that the democrats are raiſing an army, or that the rays of preſidential favor, after melting down all the great men above them, may finally honor them with a ſcorching. A great temptation with the baſe-born is, that by thus doing, they keep the track of the great, dignified and wealthy; exactly the company which deſpiſes them, and which they ought to avoid. If among theſe baſe-born ſhould be any abſtract philoſophers, who ſeeing that great beaſts devour little ones, and great fiſh the ſmaller, and are willing to devote themſelves by hecatombs to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and gluttony of theſe great men, I wiſh them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſolations as they are experiencing the work of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tication

            <p>The uniform language of theſe great men, is, "a little more patience, a little more money, in a ſhort time <hi>ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams</hi> will be in abundance." yet never was ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe realiſed.

            <p>But ſay theſe great men, "It is impoſſible for the men in power to uſurp: our government is well ſurrounded by a conſtitutional fence."

The men, whoſe intereſt it is to ſtretch it to the extent, are, or have made themſelves judges of it.

They have moſtly been practitioners in this work and underſtand it as the engineer does the force of his ordnance.</p>
            <p>That conſtitution delegated powers calculated for the contingencies of centuries; but it is a ſingular fact that all thoſe contingencies have occurred in the courſe of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years of peace, and that theſe great men actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, under the power of raiſing armies expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Congreſs, to provide that an army of 80,000 men

            <p>Well, ſay theſe great men, the conſtitution is not yet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated: and let me ſay, on your vague principles, it never can be violated: but the conſtitution is <hi>in fact</hi> violated, whenever an act is paſſed without the motives or cauſes, which that conſtitution contemplated as the baſis of ſuch act: for example, the conſtitution ſays, you may borrow money on the credit of the United States; may coin money; raiſe and ſupport armies; provide and maintain a navy; appoint ambaſſadors;" now if money is unneceſſarily bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, or coined at great expence and without occaſion; war declared; armies raiſed &amp; navies provided without juſt

            <p>Deluſion is ready to whiſper, theſe are all idle vagaries; but they are not the vagaries of modern philoſophy, all the ſubjugated people of the earth have found them to be ſolemn, humbling, dreadful realities.

            <p>Having preſented a courſe of deluſions under the head of theſe great men; you may be ready to aſk, if theſe men are dangerous, how ſhall we get rid of them? I anſwer, that theſe great and dangerous men, whoſe feelings and intereſts are always oppoſed to equal rights generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe about <hi>one tenth</hi> of ſociety. You have no other means to extricate yourſelves; but by paſſing over that part of the <hi>nine tenths</hi> whom they have ſecured by favors or delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their enchantments, and to chooſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder the firmeſt and moſt intelligent. What cries one and another, will you leave our men of abilities and put in the <hi>baſe-born</hi> to govern us? Be compoſed gentlemen, the <hi>baſe-born</hi> ſupport the government and ſuppoſe you ſhould juſt let them have a peep through the key-hole of the treaſury door; they may ſee what will amuſe them.— But you may be comforted, theſe great men are made of very flexible materials, and as ſoon as they find power to be decidedly on the other ſide of the equation, they will be after it; and perhaps ſome of theſe <hi>baſe born</hi> may prove themſelves to be better than they appear; you will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that the citizens of this country are like trees all ſet out together: but through the influence of a ſyſtem of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor one part of them have been nurſed and watered and the earth about them enriched. They have had all the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the ground, the others have been neglected: not only ſo, but the language to them has been "be ye accurſed, let no fruit grow on ye forever." Are we to

            <p>'Tis a real mistortune to the nine-tenths of ſociety, that the other tenth ſhould be oppoſed to them; but never let it be forgotten, that the argument drawn from the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of great and wiſe and holy politicians in public meaſures, is of all others the moſt alarming. Theſe are the only men whom you have to fear. If ſome are apparently more holy than their neighbors, then if they meddle with your politics they are moſt capable of deceiving you; their holineſs may recommend them to heaven; but is no guarantee for their political rectitude. This claſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are generally ſet on by other great men: not by thoſe who are great becauſe they are rich; for theſe are the tools of another ſet who are the knowing ones. In Athens thoſe who became too great and influential ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oſtraciſm; but in this country we ought to have pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to prevent any man or claſs of men from deſerving ſuch an honorable baniſhment.</p>
            <p>For my own part I am willing to be governed by men greater, wiſer and richer than myſelf: but have no opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of having men ſo great that their altitude muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a quadrant and their width by a four-rod chain. Through exceſſive indulgence we have already a number of men too great for a republic. How arrives it that theſe great men are ſo very fit to govern? Internal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is deſigned to control inordinate paſſions; great men are moſt proud, avaricious and tyrannical? Will you then ſelect theſe to curb pride, avarice and tyranny? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican ſociety is to protect the weak againſt the ſtrong; but if the ſtrong are to have all the power, the weak will be oppreſſed. But ſays one and another, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of our great men? My anſwer is, that they always had addreſs enough to work their own paſſages. The great hoſt of mankind the nine-tenths are thoſe, which a republican government ought to concern itſelf about, and if this is faithfully attended to, the other tenth will ſtill gain ſuch a portion of power and money as will make them uſeful inſtead of dangerous. They are the very men
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036980_0036_100B746B8F228AD0"/>for your purpoſes whenever you have reduced them to the ſtandard, weight and meaſure of the people.</p>
            <p>I am well aware of the great convenience which many of you find in keeping cloſe to theſe knowing men, in gathering the crumbs which fall from the tables of the rich; and in ſailing under the lee of the eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy ſhips; but you are taking a bad road; it is a broad road; it is <hi>the</hi> broad road: thouſands have paid turnpike toll on it before you were born—and if you follow it, it may lead you to wealth and honors; it may ruin your country, but will certainly land you where it has landed all your predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Having little confidence in addreſſing placemen, court ſycophants, and thoſe who expect the wages of hirelings, I turn to the laſt general head of political deluſion, which is the ſubject of ELECTIONS TO OFFICE.</p>
            <p>If the career of deluſion could be ſtopped at the end of every two or four years, and the people could be left to exerciſe free and unbiaſſed elections, all the evils propoſed to you might be remedied; but deluſion reſerves his greateſt ſtrength and ſubtlety for theſe occaſions, which in their turn demand from me an accumulated force of diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>Let me firſt preſent to you the deluſions which have attended paſt elections. Formerly the people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had ſenſe enough to originate and organize govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by their intelligence and energies to keep it in operation; now, by force of <hi>federal opiates,</hi> they have juſt ſenſe enough to chooſe the wiſeſt and greateſt men; but as ſoon as the choice is over, they ſink into a torpid ſtate, and thus remain for two years, till the trump of a new election wakes them to new life and energy; but even then they have been ſo long dormant that ſometimes the crew of a ſhip muſt be murdered; this murder muſt be regiſtered in ſermons for the edification of political ſaints: the men muſt continue bona ſide dead, till the, election is cloſed—miracles muſt be wrought at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of meal tubs—the Indian tribes muſt be all in motion to in vade the frontiers—mighty ſhips, with mighty men in them muſt be traverſing the ocean on mighty, porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and unaccountable errands—the whole political ſtage
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036980_0037_100B746DEE7DBFA8"/>muſt be veiled in darkneſs and myſtery; clouds, tempeſts and coruſcations muſt maſk the ſky: and in the midſt of all this ſcenery, Satan, with his infernal hoſt, muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to take his long leaſe of the earth, and to make princes and nobles of thoſe infernal oppoſers of religion and good government, whom all friends of <hi>order</hi> are called on to keep out of place. All this, in modern days, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to wake the people to a recollection that the men, whom they choſe laſt are the fitteſt candidates for another election. But mark how ineffectual are all theſe cauſes to produce the wiſhed effect, till joining the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working hoſt, <hi>the clergy</hi> (and as Cowper, to aid his verſe, ſo I, my proſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The cannibal's progreſs and bloody buoy, have deſtroyed each other; the political prayers ſent up on former occaſions have never reached the tops of the ſteeples, nor have they brought one bleſſing down: the pantomimical ſermons which have graced political ſabbaths are laughed at: the ſuggeſtions about Jefferſon's atheiſm are deſpiſed, ſince many who make them are found to be men, who would ſell all the temples and altars in the country for twelve frigates: the monſtrous noiſe about ancient wickedneſs and infidelity is abated, ſince mankind have reflected that the ſins of the antideluvians are not particularly chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on democrats.

            <p>In this confuſed ſtate of the leading party, it is difficult to calculate in what form deluſion is to attack you.

See the hoſt of your brethren, who depend on that treaſury. Tens of thouſands of men in our country live on the people: but independent of them and their weight and influence is found moſtly in the governing ſcale. If the firſt officers loſe their election, the ſubordinate ones may loſe their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and emoluments: therefore every new election has exactly all their influence, and generally that of all their connections to balance againſt an impartial iſſue, and by all that influence which is incalculably, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They then proceed to muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up all the infernal actions of all the bad men in the world, and ſet them up as the admiration of theſe infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.

Multitudes of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al men are for deſtroying that kind of religion, which is made a foot-ball or ſtalking horſe and which operates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſhonor God and ruin man; but the world at large are well diſpoſed to have due homage paid to the ſource of being, though they may differ about the forms, in which that can be moſt acceptably rendered.</p>
            <p>But let us try another traverſe. From the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of reputed federaliſts deduct thoſe, who depend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly on government for ſupport—deduct the expectants of federal office: <hi>theſe</hi> ſurely are not impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judge, then deduct the great hoſt of men who are marked like a box of glaſs, with a <hi>keep this ſide up,</hi> who would be pleaſed with any government under a dey, bey, monarch, grand duke, grand ſeignior, or viceroy, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they could ſhare the power of it: men who praiſe all preachers, ſerve all great men, and are lacquies to every thing but truth and honeſly—then deduct the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men who are wholly uninformed on the ſubject of government and who are federal merely becauſe they are hauled about by a federal windlaſs—then deduct the men in advanced life, who have ſeen many changes and have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036980_0044_100B747E99514320"/>been deluded in them all and who calculate that in any government things will be as bad as the men in power can make them.</p>
            <p>After theſe deductions you may look round for federal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, you will not ſee <hi>men as trees walking.</hi> Separate thoſe who follow for the loaves and fiſhes, with thoſe who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually follow the multitude, from the ſincere admirers of preſent men and meaſures, and the reſult would preſent the concluſions which your minds ought to admit.</p>
            <p>But ſay theſe deluders, ſuppoſe there are a few demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats, ſee who they are, a poor ragged, noiſy company! but to theſe rags you owe your robes: theſe men have been taxed ſeverely to ſupport a government which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in depriving them of the means. When a federal tax-gatherer appeared, they could not, as you could, reſort to federal purſes; but caſt your eyes ſouthward and you will ſee ſome men with whole clothes, correct morals and unqueſtionable intelligence, daring to oppoſe ſtrength of argument and thunder of eloquence to your motley gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſyſtem of European politics.</p>
            <p>We poor ragged democrats in theſe truly federal north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates, who read the lying Bee, Aurora and Mercury, and dare not touch the Spectator, the Centinel nor the Connecticut Courant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We conſeſs that for our ſins we deſerve to have an everlaſting debt fixed upon us, due to men who deſpiſe the ſervices for which the debt was contracted. We deſerve to be kept under by an army and navy. We deſerve to be made the victim of conſtructive treaſon, and have no claim to be afterwards treated as the monuments of preſidential mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Jails, fines, and gallowſes ought to be our portion. We deſerve even in the midſt of ſuffering, to be jeered and laughed at by our tormentors; to be traduced in the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers of federal truth, and to be ranked in faſt and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion-ſermons among infernal ſpirits. We deſerve to be wholly cut off from all hope of Preſidential favor and the bleſſings of ſociety. Though ſome of us fought and bled for the revolution, yet we have fallen from our firſt eſtate
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036980_0045_100B7480F63749A8"/>into all the guilt and pollution of democracy, and had it not been for the ſparing mercy of our true liege lords, we ſhould long ſince have been cut off from our homes, and had our portions appointed among the democrats of a wretched world. Have mercy upon us! Have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us! ye well-ſed, well-dreſſed, chariot-rolling, caucus-keeping, levee-revelling federaliſts; for we are poor, and wretched, and ignorant, and miſerable.</p>
            <p>I ſhould hope that ſuch a humble confeſſion might ſave the poor handful of northern democrats from the mighty power of the northern federaliſts, and that theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would turn their attention to the banks of the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Delaware and Potomac, where they may find as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you are ignorant of this, you ought to read.— Well have you any power of attorney from theſe men to abuſe them? have you a patent for the excluſive uſe of all the opprobrious terms in the language? or do you claim to be key-keepers to that world, whither you have ſo often ſent the democrats? how comes it that every ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor on ſuch occaſions is able to call before him all the great, and brave, and wiſe men of ancient and modern days, of this and all other countries, and to catechiſe and curſe

It is to be wiſhed that theſe gentlemen would keep their curſes for domeſtic conſumption. Here it may be intereſting to notice for a moment ſome of the ſtrange ſtimulating logic diſhed up on ſuch occaſions—ſuch as, that Voltaire was an atheiſt—that Voltaire was a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man —that all democrats are attached to the French, therefore, that all Frenchmen and democrats are atheiſts. Now this is good reaſoning, but it renders no reaſon why I ſhould pay an extra tax. But Rouſſeau, D'Alembert, and Diderot were infidels, and the maſons in Europe have become faithleſs. This ſtrengthens the argument; ſtill the connection between all this and my money is wholly inviſible: but perfidious France is murdering the honeſt Germans and Ruſſians, and the Dutch have treated ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Duke of York, and the Egyptians are in danger of a revolution; all this is very important. <hi>It proves that the meaſures of our government are perfectly right, and that there is no occaſion for looking at home.</hi> But the Indians have ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a horſe! <hi>By all means raiſe an additional regiment.</hi> But Truxton has taken the Inſurgent and we are now maſters of the ocean! <hi>Make the foreſts ring with your axes, fill the ſea with ſhips; put your liberties afloat, ſailing will ſeaſon them as it does liquors.</hi> But a foreigner infeſts your national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. <hi>Amend your conſtitution.</hi> But a foreigner is at the head of your armies! <hi>Deluſion commands ſilence.</hi> But a howling atheiſt who has crept into the third ſtory of the federal building, is proclaiming that my neighbors opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions will not pick my pocket nor break my leg!<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix.</note>

            <p>I have introduced this little ſpecimen of toaſts to ſwell the liſt of deluſive arts which are practiſed to render pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atable the meaſures of adminiſtaation, and to give force to a remark, that on the ſide of government have been pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſermons, orations, toaſts, offices, influence and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and againſt the republicans, alien and ſedition laws excluſion from office, abuſe in and out of congreſs, revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in newſpapers, and yet with all this, at the end of 11 years, if the officers of government could be choſen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new cenſus, there is a moral certainty of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in favor of the democratic candidatos.

This concentration, even for years, is condenſed into a cannibal's progreſs, and the picture becomes mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous indeed. Suppoſe that all the true accounts of murders, robberies, extraordinary reptiles, duels, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of courts and executions in America for one year, were to be republiſhed with only the common exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſecond impreſſion: then to theſe ſhould be added, by thoſe who are fond of the marvellous, many wonderful prodigies of fraud and cruelty, monſtrous beaſt and reptiles, calculated to impreſs the reader with horror; then to theſe ſhould be added all the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, which in the courſe of that year had been made on theſe publications, by the decided and rancorous enemies of the people, government, climate, and manners of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; then that the whole ſhould be publiſhed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a pocket volume by an editor keenly determined
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036980_0049_100B748A602128A0"/>to ruin our character; then that this ſhould be read by a man reſolved to believe the worſt of us; pray what would be his impreſſions? Why he would conſider America as the off-ſcouring of the earth, as a den of cruelty, and as a refuge for wild beaſts and hideous reptiles. Juſt as good have been your means of intelligence about France. Not one perſon, who had any reputation of friendſhip for that nation has addreſſed you on the ſubject. Hence it has been thought regular for every royaliſt to deal out his curſes on France, and to conjure up Satan to make up his dificiency of language to abuſe them, and having ſent them on a journey to the infernal world, the next taſk was to ſend after them all who retained a belief, that tho' many of their meaſures were indefenſible on cool rational principles; that though in their mighty convulſions and tremendous wars they had ſometimes been exceſſive, yet that their cauſe was good, and that the lord reigned and guided the ſtorm.</p>

            <p>When you ſee, my brethren, the moſt deſpotic and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical adminiſtrations in the world defended by the ableſt pens, braveſt armies, and moſt ſhining abilities, you ſurely will not believe that a combination of all theſe in our own, is a concluſive argument of its goodneſs.

            <p>I have pointed to you the line which diſtinguiſhes you,

            <p>Newly initiated politicians, and anniverſary orators, having juſt learnt the delightful machinery of energetic government, are apt to wonder how a people, who enjoy the ſun and moon and tides according to Straffords alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack, and whoſe lands produce in plenty, can wiſh for another ſyſtem of meaſures; but 'tis not by authority of the United States that the heavenly bodies revolve; not by reaſon of the intereſt of our court in the court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that we have ſpring and autumn, heat and light, fine crops and abundant markets. The praiſes of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been ſung from one end of the continent to the other.

Tis true you have as yet no titles of nobility; but who cares for titles of nobility, provided you do not give with it wealth and influence? What would be a duke in England, if he had no property, nor credit, nor a ſeat in the houſe of lords? Fill a man with wealth and power, and he is <hi>in fact</hi> a peer of the realm.

He ſees the ſoldier and ſailor taken from the <hi>nine tenths</hi> of ſociety, ſubmitting to humiliations abhorrent to the cauſe, for which he profeſſed to enliſt, and hence concludes that the claſs of men from whom they were taken, deſerve nothing but laſhes and contempt.</p>
            <p>The luxuriant courtier, who muſt have his peaſe and ſalmon before the froſt has left the earth, or the ice the rivers, and who loaths the fight of vegetable or animal food in the ſeaſon of it; who rides in a gig with half a dozen lacqueys behind him; who curſes every taverner, excommunicates every cook, and kicks over the table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his eggs were not brought to him in a pre-exiſtent ſtate, can never have any opinion of the <hi>plebians,</hi> who are toiling to furniſh the means of his ſplendor.</p>
            <p>The man who, raiſed by the people from twenty-five and fifty cent habits to a ſucrative eſtabliſhment; from a plain to a ſumptuous table: from a laborious profeſſion to the brilliant region of levees and courts; from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of farmers to the ſociety of foreign miniſters: and from obſcure life to the top ridge of the federal moutain, muſt look down on the people. No ſhade-wilted belle ever looked with more ſcorn on the ruddy milk-maid, than does ſuch an elevated Proteus on his fog benighted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.

Feeling that more power would be welcome to himſelf, he endeavors to fill all his ſuperiors with as much power as poſſible.

            <p>As all this appears to come from one of our own fleſh and blood, it appears highly plauſible, and is readily ſwallowed; but it never occurs, till all is over, that this ſame man, though once of us, is now tranſlated into another ſtate of being, that he has new hopes, new objects, more enlarged conceptions: that inſtead of being our repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, he has become a repreſentative of the United States. It never occurs that this man's greatneſs is mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced, if he can be a maſter-workman in the ſhop, where all theſe generals, and admirals, and envoys, and officers, commiſſions, and taxes are turned out.

Now if the contempt of theſe great men for the nine-tenths of ſociety were all, it might be borne; but immenſe ſums muſt be levied by them in order to ſupport their ſplendor, and their ſchemes of greatneſs. I have avoided to ſpeak to you of unaccounted for millions; but HAVE PRESENTED SYSTEMS BY WHICH THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD IS TO BE WASTED, AND THE BLOOD OF MILLIONS IS TO FLOW; yet it may be well for you to know that the ſupport of your government now amounts to 42,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars a day<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix.</note>—that this expence has been, and is encreaſing, and that in the laſt ſeſſion it was found impoſſible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ways and means to raiſe the 15 millions of dollars for the expenſes of the preſent year. The ſecretary propoſed a ſtamp duty on transfers of real eſtate. The committee of ways and means propoſed a national lottery, which might annually raiſe from 100 to 150 thouſand dollars, and the ſame committee reported the expediency of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the preſident to borrow 3,500,000 dollars for the ſervice of the preſent year. Large loans are convenient ſops for a greedy ſinking fund—when public reſources fail, and public good requires ſome object to be compaſſed too abandoned to juſtify a tax or a ſubſcription—a Jottery is often propoſed, and in the ſcheme immenſe advantages are offered to the purchaſer: no leſs than one chance in 25,000 to draw the higheſt prize. And old ſoldier would be ſhot at for one cent, if his chance of being killed was no greater than one in 25,000; but worſe than bad chances, the ſinews of induſtry muſt be cut in the purchaſer: relying on dame fortune he muſt quit dame induſtry; for they keep their lodgers at different hotels. Scarcely two and a half blanks to a prize! and why ſhould not fortune deluge a man for this once when before ſhe had never dropt on him a particle of her dew? But the fortunate adventurer muſt reſign 15 per cent. in order to entitle him to a draw-back of 15 per cent in his chance for ruin; and the woe-worn diſappointed blank-holders are taught to wait for another ſcheme and better ſtars.</p>
            <p>All this bears in front the marks of deluſion, and it is far better to be thus deluded than to have money raiſed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036980_0057_100B749D7841FE28"/>upon us by indirect means. When my tax-maſter fears to preſent me his bill, leſt I ſhould aſk the whys and wherefores, he contrives in ſome artful way to pick my pockets. He knows that I have paſſions, propenſities and wants. Theſe he taxes in the articles which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to my ſupply or indulgence. He ſees that ſtreams of wealth are flowing into the Treaſury through the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of ſugar-hogſheads and tea-cheſts. I feel that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources are expending: he cheers me up with "fear not, the hairs of your head are all numbered," to which I might well reply, "yes, and all the pence in my pocket." But lotteries draw money from the credulous; indirect taxes from the voluptuary: imperious neceſſity demands a ſtamp and valuation tax: all will not ward off the dreaded cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: though in an individual the lending of money at 8 per cent. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Moſt of the deluſions which I have named to you will be practiſed on you at the approaching Preſidential election, and then deluſion ever buſy and inventive, will aſſume new and potent forms proportioned to the immenſe import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that occaſion. Some candidates will be propoſed to you whoſe whole ſyſtem conſiſts of the deluſions which I have explained: but was our revolution archieved? did the great God guide the ſtorm in order to land as in the harbor of peace and freedom, and yet is the whole ſcene to be clouded with the burſting of crakers and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſky-rockets? Republicans be awake—the day is more important than any day of your revolution. Now republicaniſm dies or lives forever. Your candidate is a tried patriot and ſtateſman. It is not the atheiſt Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; not the infamous diſcoverer of a ſtaddard of weights and meaſures by the vibrations of a pendulum; not the baſe author of the letter to Mazzei. Federaliſts need not apprehend that ſuch a man is to be held up; but your candidate is Jefferſon, preſident of the philoſophical ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, who in all his communications to them has ſpoken reverently of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix</note> the man who in his writings has ſpoken reverently of chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and has for years ſupported at his own expence, a preacher of the goſpel; a man of unqueſtionable morality both in theory and practice—amiable in private life—holding the ſecond office in your government by the free ſuffrages of the people—the ingenious diſcoverer of a perfect ſtandard of weights and meaſures, and the man who in public as well as private has dared to ſpeak truths galling to federal ears—has dared to ſay that we had men who preferred the calm of deſpotiſm to the tempeſtuous
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036980_0059_100B74A249FDDC80"/>ſea of liberty—that we had an ariſtocratic, monarchic, Britannic faction in this country. Knowing accurately the power of deluſion, he ventured to predict, that after the war there would be a relapſe of ſpirit in the people; that abuſes would creep in and would continue till a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, when by the energy of the people our rights would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive or till they ſhould expire in a convulſion, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he predicted this very day. Our ſpirit has declined; groſs abuſes have crept in; we have a powerful ariſtocrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic monarchic Britannic faction; but by a due exertion of your conſtitutional right of election, your rights may yet revive, and the man who predicted this, lives to receive the teſtimony of your reſpect and confidence, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of which may lead you to the ſad cataſtrophe of ſeeing your dearly earned rights literally expire in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion. However you may be agitated on the ſubject of religion, reſt aſſured that you are not to depend on any adminiſtration of government for the proſperity of Zion. You will not, like the people of England, expect that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of piety, iſſues of grace and ſtreams of ſalvation are to flow from his moſt ſacred majeſty and the titled ſlaves which compoſe a luxurious court. The chariot wheels of ſalvation are far different from the chariot wheels which are to be rolling round the ſtreets of the federal city with loads of domeſtic and imported infidelity.</p>
            <p>Finally, republicans, be ſtrong: though they, who are oppoſed to you may ſay, "we are called legion; for we are many, fear not their numbers." Though they may offer you all the kingdoms of the world in conſideration of your ſubmiſſion; though they may ſay, "follow us and ye ſhall be as gods," heed them not; their buſineſs is to delude you. Singular as it may ſeem, though you have been called infidels, yet you have to combat ſyſtems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to religion; though you have been called jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, yet you have to contend for that equal rational free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which no jacobin ever ſought.

If you have firmneſs to meet the criſis and faithfully to act your parts in it you may ſhout, for your redemption is at the doors.</p>
            <p>But if in any of you preſent, deluſion has wrought its perfect work, if you have bowed the knee to the political Baal: if you are ſlaviſhly devoted to the <hi>ſelf-ſtiled</hi> friends of order and good government, then bid an eternal adieu to the freedom, which you never merited; prepare your necks for the yoke, hail Iſſachar as your venerated anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſay to deluſion <hi>"thou art our father,"</hi> and to funding ſyſtem, federal city, foreign intercourſe, army, navy, <hi>"ye are our brethren and ſiſters."</hi>

               <p>In Connecticut theſe officers are choſen by the ſtate at large, not by diſtricts. In both claſſes nominations are firſt made, and the men nominated are generally unknown to the freemen: So true is this that if the name of George Penroſe or Henry H. Childs were ſet in the liſt, they would ſtand a good chance of being within the firſt 18 for Congreſs or the firſt 20 for Council, though theſe men do not live in the ſtate. But for the ſake of giving perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to theſe offices, the names of thoſe who have been in office are generally at the head of the liſt, and have a far greater chance of gaining the nomination than thoſe near the foot of it. When the votes for counſellors are counted, if the ſenior counſellor of the laſt year ſhould be found to have the <hi>leaſt</hi> number within the firſt 20, yet he will be returned to the freemen as <hi>firſt</hi> in nomination: whereas he ought to be the <hi>laſt.</hi> Place him <hi>laſt</hi> and it would be next to a miracle if he ſhould be appointed. Place him <hi>firſt</hi> and he will ſurely be re-elected. If the houſe of repreſentatives attempt to alter this they are always negatived by the council.—The council thus permanently fixed, are aſſociated with the corporation of Yale college, which is generally compoſed of intelligent miniſters of the goſpel. This combination of Church and State furniſhes a column of influence which has been hitherto uſed in favor of the men in place. The right of the people to chooſe electors has been taken from them. Their right to have the man returned as firſt in nomination whom they placed firſt has been taken from them; Multitudes of freemen have ceaſed to attend free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meetings, from a perſuaſion that with their beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, they will be unable to effect any thing; and it really is not important for them to re-aſſert their rights of election, till they have reſolved to break the enchantments and baniſh the deluſions which encompaſs them.</p>

                  <p>"The error ſeems not ſufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are ſubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over ſuch natural rights only as we have ſubmitted to them. The rights of conſcience we never ſubmitted, we could not ſubmit. We are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them to our God. The legitimate powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment extend to ſuch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to ſay there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be ſaid his teſtimony in a court of juſtice, cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the ſtigma on him. Conſtraint may make him worſe, by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him obſtinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Reaſon and free enquiry are the only effectual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents againſt error. Give a looſe to them, they will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the true religion by bringing every falſe one to their tribunal, to the teſt of their inveſtigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, <hi>chriſtianity</hi> could never have been introduced. Had not free enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry been indulged, at the era of the reformation, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of <hi>chriſtianity</hi> could not have been purged away. If it be reſtrained now, the preſent corruptions will be protected and new ones encouraged. Was the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to preſcribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in ſuch keeping as our ſouls are now.—Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and the potatoe as an article of food. Government is juſt as infallible too when it fixes ſyſtems in phyſics.—
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036980_0068_100B74B81E48F9B8"/>Galileo was ſent to the inquiſition for affirming that the earth was a ſphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error, however, at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and Deſcartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wiſe enough to ſee that this was no queſtion of civil juriſdiction, or we ſhould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact, the vortices have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly eſtabliſhed on the baſis of reaſon, than it would be were the government to ſtep in and made it an article of neceſſary faith. Reaſon and experiment have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the ſupport of government. Truth can ſtand by itſelf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inquiſitors? Fallible men: men governed by bad paſſions, by private as well as public reaſons. And why ſubject it to coercion? To produce uniformity. But is uniformity of opinion deſirable? No more than of face and ſtature. Introduce the bed of Procruſtes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the ſmall, make us all of a ſize, by lopping the former and ſtretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The ſeveral ſects perform the office of a Cenſor morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of innocent men, women and children, ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of chriſtianity, have been burnt, cortured, fined, impriſoned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity, What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. To ſupport roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thouſand millions of people. That theſe profeſs, probably, a thouſand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſyſtems of religion. That ours is but one of that thouſand. That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we ſhould wiſh to ſee the 999 wandering, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No two, ſay I, have eſtabliſhed the ſame. Is this a proof of the infallibility of eſtabliſhments? Our ſiſter States of Pennſylvania and New-York, however, have long ſubſiſted without any eſtabliſhment at all. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has anſwered beyond conception. They flouriſh infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Religion is well ſupported; of various kinds indeed, but all good enough; all ſufficient to preſerve peace and order: or if a ſect ariſes whoſe tenets would ſubvert mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, good ſenſe has fair play, and reaſons and laughs it out of doors, without ſuffering the State to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more diſturbed with religious diſſentions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be aſcribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other circumſtance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy diſcovery that the way to ſilence religious diſputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of thoſe tyrannical laws. It is true we are as yet ſecured againſt them by the ſpirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of this country would ſuffer an execution for hereſy, or a three years impriſonment for not comprehending the myſteries of the trinity. But is the ſpirit of the people an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Beſides, the ſpirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careleſs. A ſingle zealot may commence perſecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every eſſential right on a legal baſis is while our rulers are honeſt, and ourſelves united. From the concluſion of this war we ſhall be going down hill. It will not then be neceſſary to reſort every moment to the people for ſupport. They will be forgotten therefore, and their rights diſregarded. They will forget themſelves, but in the ſole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due reſpect for their rights.
