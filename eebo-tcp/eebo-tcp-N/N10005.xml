            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>AS I was on a Journey I lit on a Book intituled, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s <hi>Sermon on Chriſtian Unity.</hi> As this was a ſubject I take great Satisfaction in, I read it, when I came toward the Cloſe of the Sermon, I found he told there were ſome great Things going forward in the Town where he delivered his Sermon, as though it threatened the whole Chriſtian <hi>Order</hi> and Conſtitution; this made me curious to know, where thoſe Terrible Things were going forward; which he intimated were ſo threatening. By turning to the Title Page, I found he ſaid, it was preached in BOLTON in NEW-ENGLAND: but this did not determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was BOLTON in CONNECTICUT, or in the MAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SACHUSETTS: However, by Report it appeared that it was <hi>Bolton</hi> in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts.</hi> Whereupon I enquired into the State of that Town, and what the <hi>Controverſy</hi> was, which Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſaid was <hi>riſen to ſo great height;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt information I could get, it was in brief as follows.—There had for ſome Time prevailed a Report,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012714_0003_0F8B8DA27A73F958"/>it. Town and out, that the Miniſter of that Town, had in ſundry Inſtances appeared as if he were overcome with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquor; and ſome appearances in Time of public Worſhip were ſuch, as gave a general Suſpicion to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that this was the Caſe; and particularly in the Afternoon, Sacrament-Day. Upon which the Church tho't they could no longer neglect treating with him upon it, which when they did, he declared that he never had drank to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſo as in any Way to affect or hurt his Reaſon, Speech or Limbs. The Church being diſpoſed to put the moſt charaitable and favourable Conſtruction poſſible upon his Conduct, voted to accept of this Declaration for a Settlement of the Affair, upon Condition he would read it off publickly to the Congregation the next Lord's Day; and lodge a Copy of it with the eldeſt Deacon. But inſtead of reading it diſtinctly, as was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he read it intermixed with his Sermon, ſo that many of the Congregation, did not underſtand that he had read it at all; and enquired why he had not done as he had promiſed. Hence the Difficulty continued and revived, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Intemperance complained of, beſide that on Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Day, till they called in a Council; before whom he for a while, continued his Declaration of Innocency, till at length on a ſudden, out comes a full Confeſſion, of having been guilty of Intemperance in ſundry Inſtances. When this was propoſed to the Church for their Acceptance, they ſaid they could not put this and his former Declaration together; and therefore could not accept of it as ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>However, after ſome Diſcourſe it obtained a Vote of the Majority of the Brethren. But how it obtained I never could conceive, only as the People were very candid, tender of him, and diſpoſed to take up with any thing rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Difficulty; for the main Thing, that I underſtand was urged to reconcile thoſe two Things, was that this Confeſſion, was no more than he had done before, the Brethren not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid old Declaration at that time to compare.</p>
               <p>However, ſome remaining diſſatisfied: ſaid old Declaration was afterward had and compared. Whereupon the diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was continued and increaſed; for now, not only did it appear that they were far from agreeing: but it was complained, that ſaid old Declaration as it was left with the Deacon was a falſe Copy. And Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> ſaid he knew it was a falſe one, when he left it, that he told the Deacon ſo. The Deacon denied that he did tell him ſo; or that he in the leaſt miſtruſted it, from any thing he ſaid. The Deacon was an old Man, and not miſtruſting any thing, never read it. Theſe Difficulties were agreed to be referred to a Committee
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012714_0004_0F8B8DA699490D90"/>mutually choſen of the Brethren of the Church. After the Aggrieved had finiſhed their Evidence and Pleas, Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> ſays he has ſome Allegations to lay in againſt the Complainants, viz. That they were guilty of Blaſphemy, or Things bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon it. He was aſked whether he had taken the previous Chriſtian ſteps with them? He ſaid he had. He was then aſked why he had not brought it forward before? He anſwered, becauſe he knew not of them till to-Day, and chiefly this Afternoon.</p>
               <p>This broke up the propoſed Settlement by ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. Hence another Council was called, and ſaid Matter of Grievance ſaid before them. At which alſo new Matters of Grievance appeared, viz. a Charge againſt Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> of ſhewing a Paper to the former Council, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would not, and that ſaid Paper as he had ſhewn it was erroneous. This Complaint, the preſent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil utterly refuſed to take under Conſideration, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated Importunity. Hence the Reſult of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was not accepted by the Church. It was motioned and urged by ſome of the Brethren to endeavour an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church. Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> for ſome time neglected to call a Church-Meeting for that Purpoſe. At length he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Meeting to ſee if they would accept the Reſult of the laſt Council; at which the Affair of ſaid Paper was called in Queſtion. The Complainant ſaid it was not ſettled; nor was he prepared for a Hearing, viz. becauſe Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> had promiſed him a Copy of ſaid Paper; but had not yet done it. Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> was aſked why he had not fulfilled ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? He denied that he had ſo promiſed. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant immediately in the preſence of the Church proved that Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> had ſo promiſed. Then Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> ſaid he had altered his Purpoſe. He was aſked if he had a <hi>diſpenſing Power with his Promiſes?</hi> He anſwered he had. Some diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe intervened to this Puropoſe, that a good man though he had promiſed to his Hurt would perform. And then the Queſtion was again put, <hi>Let me underſtand you Mr.</hi> Goſs, <hi>is that really your Principle, that you have a Right to diſpenſe with your Promiſes ſo made to a Brother?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>it was.</hi> Upon ſome very great diſſatisfaction at this, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one eſpecially that had always ſtood for him, and ſome further Diſcourſe, Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> ſaid he did not mean, practice, nor teach ſo, <hi>it was Inadvertance,</hi> and renewedly promiſed to give ſaid Copy, and agreed to be tried by the Church as to the Matters of Grievance againſt him. The Meeting was adjourned, ſaid Copy was given. At the Adjournment a number of Aggrievances were brought in againſt Mr. <hi>Goſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012714_0005_0F8B8DA761F7D0E8"/>as appears by an atteſted Copy under Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi>'s Hand. He tried <hi>firſt</hi> whether they would conſider the firſt Complaint? Paſs'd affirmatively, but objected againſt by the Paſtor. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Church judged the firſt Article pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Anſwered affirmatively, but objected againſt by the Paſtor. Here it is worthy to be obſerved, That he had at a former Meeting agreed, that theſe Aggrievances ſhould be tried by the Church. Now he negatives them upon the ſame Head, and goes on directly to trying that which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatived, and according to his own Notion had made void. At ſeveral Adjournments ſome of ſaid Articles were acted upon by the Church. At length, before they had gone through the Buſineſs, Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> diſſolved the Church Meeting <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> contrary to the Mind of the Church. Soon after a Number of the Brethren apply to him to call a Church Meeting in order to ſend out for a Council. Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> refuſes, unleſs they would be bound to abide by the Reſult. Upon which they ſend to three Neighbouring Churches to come and aſſiſt them. Two of which came by their Delegates. They adviſed Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> to join in calling in a Council in common Form. But he refuſed. And then brought out that he had negatived all the Votes of the Church, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to that Affair. Upon which ſome of the Brethren apply to him for a Copy of the Votes of ſaid Meetings. When they came to have ſaid Copy, they find ſundry Votes there atteſted to be paſſed and negatived by the Paſtor, which never were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church; as appeared, not only by the Memory of the Church; but by Minutes kept-by ſeveral in the Time of the Meetings.</p>
               <p>They then ſent out for a Council of <hi>five</hi> Churches, who came; by whoſe Perſwaſion, Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> agreed to ſend out for a mutual Council according to common Form. Who were accordingly ſent for, and come <hi>June</hi> 11, 1771. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult is very lengthy: but there ſeems to be no Light held forth in it. And indeed it ſeems the Council had no Light in themſelves; for in near or quite every Article, they ſay it don't <hi>appear,</hi> or is not <hi>ſupported,</hi> notwithſtanding it is affirmed, that to many or moſt of thoſe Articles there were ſundry ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Witneſſes teſtified to them before the Council. And in ſome Articles it is aſſerted that the Council openly and abſolutely refuſed to admit Evidence preſented to them by Members of the Church and Inhabitants of the Town, under a Notion of their being Parties in the Caſe. The moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Conſtruction I can think of, to put upon ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, is to compare it with Children, whom I have ſeen ſome Times at their Play, ſhut their Eyes faſt, and ſay they can't
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012714_0006_0F8B8DA7C49775F8"/>ſee each other, when they are plain before them in Day Light. But I ſhall in the third Part of this Work ſhew that it is ſomething worſe than Children's Play. The Church ſay <hi>they cannot act like rational Creatures: much leſs like Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to accept of it.</hi> The Church having for ſome time conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> as having abdicated his Office, viz. ever ſince he diſſolved the Church Meeting, and refuſed to call one again upon the Requeſt of a number of the Brethren. They deſired two of the Brethren to warn every Brother of the Church to meet at the Meeting-Houſe 22d of July, 1771. Which they, the ſaid Brethren accordingly did, and the Meeting was attended; when they choſe a Moderator and Clerk, and made the following Propoſal to Mr. <hi>Goſs,</hi> viz. Conſidering the Difficulties ſubſiſting, notwithſtanding all the Endeavors they had uſed for an Accomodation; they propoſed, that if he would take a Diſmiſſion, they would (with the Concurrance of the Town) leave the Matter of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, reſpecting his Support, to the General Seſſions of the Peace, to determine whether any Part or the Whole of ſaid Contract ſhould be paid him; all to be done without any Coſt to him. But he refuſed to comply with ſaid Propoſal. Then they deſired him to make ſome Propoſal to them. And then the Meeting was adjourned to the 5th Day of Auguſt then next enſuing. But he made no Propoſal to them. When they met again they propoſed to proceed to conſider and act upon his Diſmiſſion; or conſider what was beſt to be done on the next Thurſday, to which Time they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, and informed him that if he ſee ſit, he might attend. At which Time they again met, and after a Preamble ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the State of Affairs among them, they by Vote declare, that he is diſcharged from his Offices as Paſtor and Teacher in that Church, and all the Power by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him entirely reverſed. The ſame was alſo concurred by the Town in a legal Town-Meeting aſſembled for that Purpoſe. Since which the neighbouring Miniſters have ſtood aloof from ſaid People, endeavoured to prevent their having the Goſpel preached to them; or enjoying common Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Privileges Abroad; and refuſe to take any Chriſtian or Conſtitutional Meaſures to convince them of any error. And Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Sermon appeared to be deſigned to carry on the ſame Scheme; to which therefore I now proceed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <p>I come now to make ſome Remarks on Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; which indeed by the general run of it, one would be led to ſuppoſe, was delivered to the Body of the People in the Town; or at leaſt, if it was to a Minor Part of the People, to perſuade them to re-unite with the Body; for every one
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012714_0007_0F8B8DA886058CB8"/>knows, that for Minor Parties to ſet up by themſelves, in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body, is the direct Way to crumble Bodies to Pieces, which certainly is directly contrary not only to <hi>Chriſtian Unity;</hi> but to all ſocial Exiſtence. But it ſeems, not only by common Report: but by his own Words, that it was to a ſmall Party of the Town, vid. Page 42. "Your Numbers not very large." And the drift of it is, to have them continue and perſiſt in their Separation. I ſhall not make all the Remarks upon his Sermon, which appear to me might be made; leſt I ſhould tire the Reader with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity. I ſhall therefore omit making any particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks till I come to the 30th Page; where he tells about <hi>Conſtituted Judges</hi> between Miniſters and People. <hi>The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not ſuitable,</hi> he ſays, <hi>becauſe they are a Party concerned.</hi> This to me founds very much of the Prudence and ingenuity of his <hi>Holineſs;</hi> who as I have underſtood, roſe to his preſent Pitch of Infalibility; by firſt very ſpeciouſly propoſing that the People were not fit to be Judges; who were proper for Biſhops; that it would be more ſafe to be in the Hands of the Clergy, &amp;c. But it ſeems he had wholly loſt Sight of our Conſtitution; which according to Scripture, Platform, and many other Writers, makes the Church the ſole Judicature in all Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes; which I ſhall take occaſion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſider in the laſt Part of this Work. But it ſeems he had not only loſt Sight of the Conſtitution; but even of common Senſe. The Church in trying and judging ſuch Cauſes, as are properly Eccleſiaſtical; are not judging their own Cauſe: but the Cauſe of Chriſt. If any Brother in the Church ſhould be drunk every Day, commit Fornication, Swear, profane the Sabbath, or any other ſuch Immoralities that may be enumerated; it does not affect my Perſon or Property; i. e. it does not wound my Fleſh, or good Name, nor take one Farthing from my Eſtate: neither in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him in the Church; and condemning him as guilty; and giving my Voice or Vote in his Cenſure; put one Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into my own Pocket. If the Church were to lay a Fine upon an offending Brother for his Faults, and that Fine were to go into the Church Treaſury, to defray neceſſary Charges; then they would be intereſted Perſons, in their Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes: Hence common Senſe ſhews, that what conſtitutes intereſted Perſons, in any Cauſe, is their winning or looſing ſomething in their Perſons or Property, by the iſſue of the Cauſe. But a Church cannot be ſuppoſed to ſave one Penny by finding any Brother, and eſpecially a Miniſter, guilty; for though by their finding him ſo groſsly guilty, as that they can no longer retain him, as their Paſtor; yet this does not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012714_0008_0F8B8DAAA8E07658"/>ſave them the Coſt of ſupporting the Goſpel: but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes their Charge, on that Account; ſo that really, if any Way, they are intereſted to judge in the Miniſter's Favour. But it ſeems Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> not only loſt Sight of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and common Senſe, but by turning over a Leaf, forgot <hi>himſelf.</hi> For after he had in the 30th and 31ſt Pages, been very abundant, in ſaying that the People were unfit to be Judges; that there muſt be ſome conſtituted; and that theſe muſt be an Eccleſiaſtical Council, to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>determine.</hi> Turn over to the 32d Page, and there he ſays that <q>Eccleſiaſtical Councils are only adviſory; and that they can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.</q> But he ſays <q>it does not hence follow as ſome would have it,—that we are at liberty to admit or diſcard them, according as they agree or diſagree with our own corrupt Wills and Tempers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Who it is (as he tells of) that <hi>would have it,</hi> that they are at liberty, to act according to their own corrupt Wills and Tempers, againſt Advice or according to Advice, or even if they had no Advice in the Caſe, I muſt confeſs my ſelf at a Loſs; unleſs he ſpake for himſelf, what he <hi>would have.</hi> The People he would be thought to aim at, I am perſwaded would not one of them, pretend or allow, that they <hi>would have</hi> any ſuch thing, as that they had any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to act according to their own corrupt Wills and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in any Caſe, or under any Circumſtances whatever. The ſame might be obſerved, on what he ſays in the next, viz. 33d Page, about the beſt Advice, and the moſt conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous to Reaſon and Scripture, and the Reſult of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ever ſo Rational, being diſregarded and rejected; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume none of thoſe he aimed at, will allow <q>that they hold to any ſuch Thing.</q> And therefore he muſt take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſince he has ventured to affirm there are ſuch Opinions held to. In the beginning of the next, viz. 34th Page, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> undetakes to quote ſomething out of the Platform, but he had the unhappineſs, to miſs an eſſential Part of the Sect. he pretended to tranſcribe, viz. Chap. XVI. Sect. 5. I need not tranſcribe the whole Sect.; every one ought to have the Platform, to turn to; I ſhall obſerve, that the ſenſe of that Sect. as it ſtands in the Platform is, that the <hi>principal Ground of the Reverence and Submiſſion, due to the Reſults of Councils, is their agreeing with the Word of God; without which they bind not at all.</hi> Now this of their <hi>not binding at all,</hi> without that Agreement, is omitted in Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Sermon; hence then according to the Section Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf, has pretended to quote; if a Reſult of a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012714_0009_0F8B8DAACD5E5530"/>Council, don't appear to agree with the Word of God, there is no binding Force in it at all, and therefore, the People he is endeavoring to fling ſo much Blame upon, are entirely exculpated, for their not going according to the Reſult of the Council, whoſe <hi>Conduct</hi> in their Reaſons for not accepting the Reſult, they declare to be <hi>above their Comprehenſion;</hi> and that they <hi>have Reaſon to believe the Council falible.</hi> Hence the Reſult did not appear to be according to the Word of God, and therefore had no bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Force at all in it. I need not ſay any more upon this Page, having ſhewn that his Premiſes are Falſe; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is no doubt Falſe too. In the beginning of the next, viz. 35th Page; he has another clauſe out of the Platform which he takes from Chap. X. Sect. 6. In this quotation, though he has tranſcribed the Words right; yet I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend he has wreſted the meaning of them, in what he ſays upon them; for where the Platform ſpeaks of the Church having Power, according to <hi>Order,</hi> to remove an offending Elder from Office: This Word <hi>Order</hi> he improves, as if it were to mean, a Mandate from the Council; as ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Superior to the Church; for he ſays, <hi>this Order muſt be the Council of other Churches where it may be had directing thereto.</hi> But as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf anon ſays, in all Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, one Paſſage muſt be explained by another; and the latter muſt always controul, interpret and determine, the meaning of the former: So this muſt be determined by that Section, we have above conſidered; which is ſeveral Chapters after this, viz. the XVIth, and this but the Xth; &amp; eſpecially, that ought to controul the meaning of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, as to what is ſaid about Councils; ſince that Chapter is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon the Head of Councils or Synods: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> whole Scheme of the Platform appears to be very contrary to the ſetting up Councils, as having any mandatory Authority over Churches; yea, and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf as before hinted; ſays that Councils are, and can be nothing elſe only adviſory; hence then according to the Platform, and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s own declared Opinion, he has made a wrong Conſtruction upon this Paſſage in the Xth Chap. And I rather think that what was meant, by the Church having Power according to Order, to diſmiſs from Office, was to keep up the ſame Idea or Notion, that is expreſſed in Chap. VIII. Sect. 7; ſaying, that <q>if the Church have Power to chooſe their Officers and Miniſters; then in caſe of manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs and delinquency, they have Power alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; for to open and ſhut, to chooſe and refuſe &amp;c. are Acts belonging to the ſame Power,</q> which ſhews
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012714_0010_0F8B8DAB83B5BCD0"/>that their Notion of <hi>Order</hi> was a Fitneſs, Propriety, and Conſiſtency in any thing to be done. So when they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their Senſe or Notion of <hi>Order</hi> or Fitneſs, as in the above quoted Sect. VIIIth Chapter, and again to the ſame Effect in this Xth Chapter, ſaying, that <q>it being natural to all Bodies, and ſo unto a Church Body, to be furniſhed with ſufficient Power for its own Preſervation:</q> And as they had ſaid in the Vth Chapter, <hi>that even the Power of Office is in the Church, in that they deſign the Perſons unto Office.</hi>— When they had expreſſed all theſe Things of <hi>Order,</hi> or the Nature of a Church; when they come to mention the Affair of removing an Officer from his Office; they ſay, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Order,</hi> they that had Power to call to Office, have Power to remove him from his Office; and this <hi>Order</hi> or Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they had repeatedly and abundantly expreſſed in theſe foregoing Paſſages I have mentioned; and inſtead of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe Principles over again in this Place, they ſum them up in this one general Term <hi>Order;</hi> and ſay accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that the Church has ſuch a Power; as is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with ſome now a days, to ſay according to the <hi>Nature of Things;</hi> meaning do doubt, the ſame Things as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the Platform did by ſaying <hi>according to Order,</hi> as they do in this Place. And it appears to me as great a Violence to Words, to conſtrue them as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> does in this Place; as if one ſhould ſay, that every Creature has a Power of Self-Preſervation, and that a Man according to this Principle has Power, when he is informed of an Enemy, to uſe Means to ſecure himſelf: And Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſhould argue thus upon it, that the Man's Power ſo to preſerve himſelf, conſiſted in his being informed or directed to take Care of himſelf. But if I ſee an Enemy and nobody elſe ſees; muſt I therefore ſtand ſtill and be killed, and not exerciſe this Power of Self-Preſervation? Why no ſays Mr. <hi>Adams;</hi> if you do run at all, it muſt be according to <hi>Order:</hi> You muſt have <hi>Orders</hi> from ſome of your Neighbours to run, before you ſtir, or it will be no Eſcape at all. Indeed if there be no body to tell me to Eſcape, then he allows that I have a Power to Eſcape without this <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Mandate,</hi> as he ſeems to conſider it. The Queſtion is, Where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in the Caſe before us, where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>; as abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what has been ſaid; and what might farther be ſaid if there was need of it; and eſpecially if we only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Platform holds forth, that the Power of Office is in the Church; that the Power of Self-Preſervation is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012714_0011_0F8B8DACB21BD1E0"/>or eſſential to the Being of Churches: And in another Place, that Councils or Synods are not abſolutely neceſſary to the Being of Churches. This ſhews that the Platform has no Notion of the Reſults of Councils putting a validity upon the Acts of the Church: but on the contrary, that the Platform ſhews that the Acts of the Church may put a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity upon the Reſults of Councils; as is very plain to be ſeen in ſundry Places; and indeed ſeems to be the whole drift of the Platform, wherever Councils or Synods are mentioned.— As to what Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſays in the remainder of this 35th Page about a People diſmiſſing a Miniſter contrary to the repeated Advice of Councils, where it cannot be pretended that he offends incorrigibly, enquiring what we ſhall think of a People that do ſo, &amp;c.? I am content he ſhould think of it as he pleaſes, ſince it is well known, it is nothing to the Caſe of <hi>Bolton,</hi> which he ſet himſelf to animadvert upon; for it is very manifeſt, that they abundantly pretend, that their Elder offended incorrigibly, as appears by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative.—In the next, viz. 36th Page, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> undertakes farther to illuſtrate and confirm what he has ſaid againſt the Power of People to diſmiſs their Miniſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Advice of Council, by referring to the laſt Section of the Xth Chapter, where the Platform ſpeaks of <hi>an organic Church and right Adminiſtration, that no Church Act can be conſummated or perfected without the Conſent of both.</hi> Now how this can prove or argue any thing for what he has ſaid about Councils, appears to me myſterious; for according to his Conſtruction of this Paſſage, if they had ever ſo many Councils, and adviſed to the diſmiſſion of the Miniſter; yet if he ſhould pleaſe not to conſent to it, it would all be to no Purpoſe. But his Conſtruction of this Section appears to be a very great Violence to the general Senſe of the Platform: for every one that has at all acquainted himſelf with that Book, muſt know, that the Notion of an organic Church, according to that, is one that has ruling Elders, diſtinct from the Miniſter; and all along in this ſame Chapter ſpeaks of the Church as having a plurality of Elders. But Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſays this <hi>Both</hi> ſpoken of in the Platform, is Miniſters and People; when it is plain to any one that will read it, that the Platform means Elders and Brotherhood. For fear of being too lengthy, I ſhall omit ſaying all upon this Place, that I think it might deſerve; yet I can't paſs it over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remarking one Thing more. In this Place Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſays, with a wonderful Air of Aſſurance, <q>How abſurd is it to pretend that the Compilers of this Book meant to give the People a Power to diſiniſs their Paſtors, when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012714_0012_0F8B8DAD2F4B0A58"/>ſays, that no Church Act can be valid or perfect without the Conſent of both, that is, Miniſter and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q> And in the preceeding Page he had ſaid, that if a Church was troubled with an incorrigibly offending Elder, and they could procure no Council to judge upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whether by his refuſing to join with them, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Platform and common Senſe will juſtify them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing him: but now unleſs he joins with them the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form can't juſtify them in any Act they ſhall pretend to do. How abſurd then, has he in this Page called what he ſaid in the preceeding Page! This is the ſecond Time we have found Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> forgetting himſelf, or looſing Sight of his own Words by turning over a Leaf. I proceed to make ſome Remarks upon what he ſays in the 37th Page, where he ſpeaks of the Churches pretending to diſmiſs their Elders, contrary to what he had been holding forth, as a <hi>new and upſtart Practice,</hi> which he ſays is ſuch an one, <hi>as juſtly</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms, <hi>eſpecially as the Authors of it endeavor to make other Churches put a Sanction on their Conduct,</hi> &amp;c. How other Churches voting Charity with a certain Church, is a putting a Sanction upon what they have done; is not perhaps very eaſy for every one to ſee; neither do I ſee any need that one Church has to put a Sanction upon the Acts of another, I know there is need of Churches putting a Sanction upon the Reſults of Councils, to make them of any avail, viz. Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Chapter XV. Section 2; and no doubt the Meſſengers of Churches whenever they have been to any Council, ought to make return of what they have done to their Churches that ſent them, in Order for their Approbation; and it ought not to be conſidered as the Advice of thoſe. Siſter Churches, till the reſpective Churches have approved of it; and if the reſpective Churches do not approve of the Reſult, the Church which it moſt eſpecially concerns, cannot with any Propriety be conſidered as going contrary to her Siſter Churches, or breaking Fellowſhip with them in any Senſe or Degree, till thoſe Siſter Churches have approved of what that particular Church has rejected; and this, viz. the keeping up and maintaing the Communion and Fellowſhip of Churches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be one great and ſpecial Thing in view, in the having the Advice of Siſter Churches, viz. Platform Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter VIII. Section 8. But more of the End, Deſign, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Councils in the laſt Part of this Work. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to what I was upon, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſeems in this Place greatly to blame <hi>Bolton,</hi> for applying to Siſter Churches to know whether they were in Charity with them, and this appears the ſame, as to blame them for not turning abſolute
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012714_0013_0F8B8DAF635C8550"/>
                  <hi>Independents.</hi> I ſuppoſe that <hi>Bolton</hi> Church never would have had it come into their Thoughts, to have gone to try the Vote of neighbour Churches in that Affair, if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had not ſet up an <hi>Independency</hi> with that Church, and had entered into a written Combination to that Purpoſe, as was generally reported: and ſome of <hi>Bolton</hi> Church upon Application to them for the common Privilege of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Churches were abſolutely refuſed, which confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scheme of <hi>Independency</hi> among the Miniſters. <hi>Bolton</hi> People that were ſo rejected by the neighbouring Miniſters, defired them to deal with them in the 3d Way of Communion, but they would not do that. What ſhould <hi>Bolton</hi> Church do, the Miniſters round had become abſolute <hi>Independents,</hi> they would neither admit <hi>Bolton</hi> Church to Privileges; nor uſe any Chriſtian or Conſtitutional Meaſures to endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or reclaim them, as an offending Church: It appears it was high Time for <hi>Bolton</hi> Church to find out whether the neighbouring Churches were as much at odds with them, or as determinate <hi>Independents,</hi> as their Miniſters. It certainly could not be to any good Purpoſe, for <hi>Bolton</hi> People to try to mend or alter any thing among themſelves, in order to be in fellowſhip with their Siſter Churches; when they knew nothing but they ſtill continued in Fellowſhip with them; and by altering, they might fling themſelves out of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and eſpecially ſo long as they were not conſcious them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of being in an Error. If they had done any thing that was offenſive, or grevious to their Siſter Churches they ought to know it; and what Way ſhould they come at this knowledge, but by trying whether the other Churches were in Charity with them, ſo long as no one undertook to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of any thing bad? But only the Miniſters ſtood aloof from them, and treated them as if thy were not only not Chriſtians; but even in ſome Senſe not human Creatures, viz. by endeavouring all they could to prevent their having the Goſpel preached to them. So that what ſo greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> is, that <hi>Bolton</hi> People don't turn <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> but uſe Meaſures contrary to ſuch a Scheme. But let it be that <hi>Bolton</hi> Church have endeavoured to get other Churches to put a <hi>Sanction</hi>

                  </gap> ſhould be on equal Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Miniſters. I knew a Miniſter once, who after he had been ſettled a few Years, began a Diſpute or Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with his People, for more Salary, and as I was told,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012714_0014_0F8B8DB000E3A170"/>without a Council, or aſking a Diſmiſſion of his People, at once preached a farewell Sermon to them, ſo diſmiſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or rather abdicated his Office: and then got other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to put a <hi>Sanction</hi> upon his Conduct, by putting a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of him into the public Prints. And why ſhould a Church be thought ſo bad, for endeavouring to have their Neighbours put a <hi>Sanction</hi> upon their conduct; when to to be ſure they no more than imitated that Miniſter in his Conduct; which Conduct, the Miniſters themſelves put a Sanction upon; and eſpecially, when I preſume Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> can't find in all the Platform any Thing to countenance the Conduct of that Miniſter; ſo much as he acknowledges in his 34th Page, he finds in the Platform to countenance or juſtify the People in diſmiſſing their Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> proceeds to ſay in the 37th Page,—<q>If Things thus go on, what will become of the Conſtitution of the Congregational Churches?</q> He anſwers, <q>It will ſoon be wholly ſubverted, &amp;c. and Miniſters will have nothing to depend upon but the fickle and inconſtant Breath of Mankind!</q> And pray what have they now; or what did they uſe to have? Why truly Councils! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Adams:</hi> He has all along been inſiſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this; for nothing is more plain and notorious, than that it is this new and <hi>upſtart Practice,</hi> which don't pay ſo much Deference to Councils as he would have; is what he ſays will bring it to that, that Miniſters will have nothing to depend upon but the inconſtant Breath of Mankind. What does he make of Councils! Are not they Mankind? This is out-doing his <hi>Holineſs</hi> himſelf; he never, as I know of, pretended that he was not of Mankind; though he pretends to be infallible. But it ſeems by what Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> has advanced, he would have it be thought, that Councils are ſomething ſuperior to Mankind! or elſe why is this mighty exclamation, of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to depend upon but Mankind, by Councils being neglected, unleſs Councils are ſomething ſuperior to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> plainly makes a God of Councils, and he cries very much in the Language of Micah,—<hi>Yca have taken away my Gods, and what have I more?</hi> So Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi>—Ye have ſet at naught Councils, and now I have nothing to depend upon but the fickle Breath of Mankind. I can't depend upon that God who has the Hearts of all Men in his Hand, and turneth them whitherſoever he pleaſeth.—<q>Who (ſays Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>) that has common Senſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence, will ever go into the Miniſtry on theſe Terms? To have but a pitiful Subſiſtence while the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation continues, and be diſſolved at the Pleaſure of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012714_0015_0F8B8DB2383BA528"/>People?</q> Perhaps it may reflect Light upon this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if we turn Tables and ſay, What People that have common Senſe and common Prudence, will ever ſettle a Miniſter upon theſe Terms? To have but pitiful preaching while the Relation continues; and to have the Miniſters ſoon after they have got their Settlement, go to contending about their Contract, or run into ſome ſcandalous Conduct, and however, go off when they pleaſe; for in Ballance to the one Inſtance Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> is ſo alarmed at, I can bring a Cloud of Inſtances on the other Side, where People have loſt the whole Settlement they have given, for a very few Years (likely) pitiful preaching; either by the arbitrary, covetous, or corrupt <hi>Wills and Tempers</hi> of the Miniſters.— The Inſtance I have mentioned above, where the Miniſter went off ſo abruptly, was no doubt at leaſt Arbitrary.— Hear another Inſtance, where the Miniſter having a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Settlement, and after he had been ſettled three or four Years, the People had been very generous to him, and he had got in a handſome Way to live; he began to contend with them about giving of him more, and ſaid they had not fulfilled their original Contract, withal threatning to leave them. The People, as I underſtand, offered to leave it to Men with him; having the Arbitration conſiſt of half Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. But no; he would have a Council to put a <hi>Sanction</hi> upon his Conduct, which he obtained, that anſwered his deſires as I underſtand, and the Pariſh are in great danger of being ruined by it. Hear another Inſtance ſomething ſimilar to the former, the Miniſter indeed had been ſettled ſome longer, he complained that they had not fulfilled their Contract, they joined with him (as I underſtand) in calling a Council, who judged they had fulfilled their Contract: But ſtill he was uneaſy, and left his People in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the Reſult of Council, as you may ſee, which is one Thing that Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> complains of in the People as being ſo heinous and alarming. But the Miniſters don't ſcruple to put a <hi>Sanction upon his Conduct,</hi> by ſetting him to preaching, and that people alſo, as I underſtand are almoſt ruined by it. But hear another Inſtance. A Miniſter was ſettled with a handſome Settlement, &amp; he was a very popular Preacher, but he traded and traſlicked in Horſes and Land, making conſiderable Adventures in new Towns, and the like, by which he loſt conſiderable, till by the Time he had been ſettled about ſix or ſeven Years, he was ſo involved that he was caſt into Priſon for Debt; where he continued ſome Months; till he took the Benefit of the Bankrupt Act then in Being. The People to help him to live, and continue as their Miniſter, tropoſed to purchaſe a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012714_0016_0F8B8DB467888F48"/>ſmall Farm near the Meeting-Houſe, and let him live on it as a Parſonage; together with ſome very handſome Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to help ſet him up again: But no, he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Farm they propoſed as a Parſonage unleſs they would give it him as his own. It was thought he had a Notion that he could get a new Settlement in ſome other Place if he was diſmiſſed from them: but the People moved nothing about his Diſmiſſion, till he preached a very odd Sermon, as was thought on Purpoſe to ſtart the People; the Subject and Scheme of his Sermon (as I underſtand) was to ſet forth that <hi>the Godly are hereafter to dwell with devouring Fire, and everlaſting Burnings.</hi> Upon which the People were very ready to diſmiſs him. And he obtained a Council <hi>to put a Sanction upon his Conduct,</hi> ſo that he ſtood well recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſtill for the Miniſtry. And I verily think Councils are too apt <hi>to put a Sanction</hi> on the Conduct of Miniſters. One I knew who was complained of for Things very much bordering upon <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and ſo much proved, that he was diſmiſſed; and yet the Council did not ſcruple ſo far <hi>to put a Sanction on his Conduct,</hi> that he ſtill preaches as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And if things go on ſo, what ſhall we think of Councils? Will any People of common Senſe, Prudence or Chriſtianity, ever pretend to ſend for any? And what will become of the Apoſtle's Direction, 1 Tim. III.? <hi>A Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop muſt be blameleſs, ſober, of good Behaviour,</hi> &amp;c. In ſhort, he <hi>muſt have a good Report of them which are without,</hi> &amp;c. Almoſt numberleſs are the Inſtances, too many to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, wherein Miniſters by groſs Immorality, ſuch as Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adultry, lacivious Carriage, Intemperance, Falſhood, and ſuch like, evidently proved, within the Compaſs of ten or twelve Years after their ſettling, whereby the People have loſt all the Coſt of ſettling. Some Towns or Pariſhes, near or quite ruined, diſcouraged, ſcattered, divided, torn and left (as we may ſay) half dead, or if not thus brought to the brink of Ruin; yet have all the Coſt and Trouble of ſettling over again. And are not all theſe Things as alarming as the one Inſtance Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> tells of? if that was as really unconſtitutional as he would have it be thought. And ſhall we therefore, as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> on the Miniſter's Part, concludes that no one of common Senſe or common Prudence, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Miniſtry: Shall we (I ſay) on the People's Part, conclude we will have no more Miniſters? becauſe Things go on ſo. By no means; this never will do to neglect a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty becauſe bad Men make a had uſe of good Things. This World is a World of Tryal; and we muſt guard againſt the

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>Evils of it as well as we can; and wherein we ſee, that we ourſelves or others have miſſed, endeavor to mend in the beſt Manner we can. Let Miniſters and People underſtand one another, how they ſettle, and how they muſt part, if ever it ſhould come to that extremity. Let Miniſters have a fair Chance for living in the World, according to the Place they are in; and let the People have a fair Chance in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract as well as the Miniſter; let them know before they ſettle, how they are to underſtand the Conſtitution; and let not the People be affrighted for fear they ſhall not be able to find Miniſters to ſettle according to the Conſtitution. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s exclamations, there is not half the riſque on the Miniſter's Side, that there is on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Side; as Miniſters generally ſettle in this Country. People are not apt to be fond of advancing a Thouſand or Ffteen Hundred Pounds, O. T. to ſettle a Miniſter any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than they can't help; they will bear with a great deal before they will turn away a Miniſter, and bring the Coſt and Trouble of ſettling another upon themſelves; and when they have been at all that Coſt, they no doubt ought to enjoy the Benefit of it ſo long as they can enjoy it; and when they can no longer enjoy it, what Reaſon can there be aſſigned, why they ſhould be ſaddled with a Burden by a Council or any ſet of Men whatever? Not that I would be underſtood to ſuggeſt, that when a Miniſter is paſt his Labour, through Infirmity or Old Age, that the People ſhould then ſet him at nought; but ſtill to eſteem him highly in Love for his Work Sake, that he has done among them; and to continue him ſome handſome Allowance, as they ſhall agree. But when his Conduct has been ſuch toward them, that they can no longer have confidence in him as their Paſtor; and ſo they can no longor enjoy him as ſuch; I ſee no Reaſon why they ſhould ſtill be incumbered with him. <hi>To ſerve one another in Love,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> has it in his Title Page, is the whole Eſſence of all Society, Civil and Religious; and when this Service ceaſes through Default, the Nerves of the ſocial Body are cut, and the Diſſolution begins; and if theſe Nerves can't be healed, a Diſſolution muſt neceſſarily enſue. And I am perſuaded Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> can't with all his Ingenuity, make out that in the Affair he has ſaid ſo much about, that the Miniſter ſerved the People in Love, when he negatived their Acts as he did, diſſolved the Church Meeting, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his own Promiſes, and many other Things as we have it in the Narrative. And it avails nothing for him to alledge that theſe Things were not made out to the Council; they were ſo to the People, who by Nature and by Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012714_0018_0F8B8DB5957C9C40"/>are the judges of theſe Things, notwithſtanding all he has ſaid. There ſeem to be ſeveral Things more that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Remark: but perhaps they may be ſufficiently expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the few Hints already made, with ſome Hints refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Piece, which will neceſſarily fall in, in the remaining Part of the Work. I ſhall therefore dwell no longer on this Part of the Work.</p>
               <p>JUST as I had finiſhed the above Remarks; before I had entered upon the remaining Part; I lie on a very pompous Account in the <hi>Boſton Evening Poſt,</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 28, 1772, of the Diſmiſſion of a Miniſter at <hi>Grafton.</hi> As to the vain ſhew there appeared in it, I could freely have let all paſs with Neglect, if it had not carried with it, ſuch a glaring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon the Town; as if he was diſmiſſed by a Council, and a ſmall Part of the Church; in Oppoſition to the Mind of the Town. I ſhould have offered ſomething to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic through the ſame Channel; but as it would have been ſo long after, that it would ſeem to have been out of Date; and as it appeared to be ſo exactly of the Nature of what I am here oppoſing; I thought it would not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, to take ſome Notice of it here, and might well ſtand, for one among the Inſtances, where Miniſters have gone off with their Settlement, to the Damage of the Town. How long indeed, that Gentleman had been ſettled I can't ſay: be that as it will, it is notorious by what is publiſhed, that he is an Expectant of further employ in the Service; for the Piece is plainly an Advertiſement of him, for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Acceptance and Employ, conſidering he had ſuch an <hi>Honourable Diſmiſſion.</hi> However I cannot look upon ſuch a Diſmiſſion very honourable. It does not appear, that it was done by a Major Vote, even of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Advertiſer ſays it was <q>by a Major Vote of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Church preſent.</q> Not that there was any Church Meeting notified for that Purpoſe; or indeed any Church Meeting at all. And whether a Quarter of the Church were <hi>preſent</hi> does not appear; and by the Town's not concurring, it is moſt probable the generality of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not like what was going forward; and therefore would not <hi>honour</hi> them with their Preſence; and ſo perhaps there might, for Inſtance 7 of the Church come out of Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, to ſee the Proceedings of the Council; and 4 of them Vote this <hi>Honourable Diſmiſſion,</hi> which <hi>with ſtrong Reaſons preſſed, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> he Council might put a <hi>Sanction</hi> upon it; at leaſt it is ſpoken,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012714_0019_0F8B8DB6096AB4A0"/>of with that Air, as though their Preſence put a <hi>Sanction</hi> that would abide, maugre the Diſſent of the Town. This is of the ſame Scheme, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> is ſo ſtrenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or diſſolve Contracts for them. Here is a plain Pretence of a Council's diſſolving the Contract of <hi>Grafton</hi> Innabitants, even againſt their Wills. Which can be upon no other Principle, than that the Town are <hi>Non Compos Mentis,</hi> and the Council forſooth are their Guardians.</p>
               <p>This is a more glaring Inſult upon the Common Rights of Mankind, than the <hi>Stamp Act</hi> it ſelf, or all the <hi>Duty Acts,</hi> ſo much complained of; for any ſet of Men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſſolve a Contract, between Man and Man, without the Conſent of the Parties; and thus to bring on the Town a Bill of Coſt, ſo great as the Settlement of another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. It appears to me that ſuch a Diſmiſſion can no Way be reconciled, to the common Rights of Mankind; nor the Miniſter ſaid to be ſo diſmiſſed, look upon himſelf, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from his Contract with that Town; unleſs he lend to the Town Money for a ſufficient Settlement of another, to remain with them for that Uſe, ſo long as he is able to diſcharge the Work of the Miniſtry; or the Town is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to releaſe him of his Contract. And I ſhould think the Town had a good Right in Law for an Action of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages againſt him for that Purpoſe. But here, leſt my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts ſhould ſay that if a Miniſter can't diſmiſs himſelf, when he pleaſes, without violating the Rights of Mankind, unleſs the other Party of the Contract agree to diſſolve it; then how can the Church and Town diſſolve it, unleſs the Miniſter agree to it? To this it may be anſwered. It is eaſy to ſee, that the Caſe is widely different between the Town and the Miniſter, in this Affair. For the Miniſter in going off, while he is able to carry on the Work, puts Money into his own Pocket. But the Town by diſmiſſing of him, bring on themſelves a Bill of Coſt, in the ſettling of another. So that the Caſe is altogether different, the one judging Money into one's own Pocket, the other judging of it out.</p>
               <p>Hence the Conſtitution, by the Plat. as we have conſidered, very wiſely fixed the Diſmiſſion of a Miniſter with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who not only were to enjoy their Service: but with whom there was ſo great a Ballance, againſt judging raſhly for a diſſolution of the Relation. Yea if there were no <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement</hi> to pay, as is the Caſe in Places where there is an adequate Parſonage; yet the Riſque. Trouble and Diviſion,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012714_0020_0F8B8DB6C4DCF6F0"/>which it generally expoſes a Town or Pariſh to, to ſettle a new Miniſter, is a very great Ballance againſt their raſhly or ſuddenly diſſolving the Relation.</p>
               <p>But the Conſtitution fixing it in the Power and Rights of the People, to diſmiſs upon Delinquency; makes it that they are not to be conſidered, as one Side diſſolving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, ſince he who ſettles upon the Conſtitution, ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is implied in the Contract, and this makes an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Side, that the Contract ſhall ſo be diſſolved. But then, here is to be obſerved a diſtinction between diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing for Delinquency, and for Infirmity; for if a Miniſter by Infirmity, Old Age, or otherwiſe, ſhould become unable to fulfill his Office; and the People ſhould be ſo unreaſonable, as to diſmiſs him in order to get rid of a Burthen; this would by no means be reaſonable or conſtitutional, for this would be expreſsly judging Money into their own Pocket; and there might juſtly be a doubt, whether ſuch Diſmiſſion were valid, the Conſtitution making no Proviſion for diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon Infirmity: But if they conclude it to be a valid Diſmiſſion; yet by the Circumſtances, they ſo judging Money into their own Purſe; they ought in Juſtice to leave it to indifferent Men, what Allowance they ſhould ſtill make him; for it would be unjuſt, when a Miniſter had ſpent all his Strength, with a People in their Service, to ſet him at nought when he was paſt Labour, and afford him no Help when he moſt needed it. But it appears moſt according to Reaſon and the Conſtitution in ſuch a Caſe, not to pretend to diſmiſs him: but for them to come to an amicable Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to allow him ſome handſome Conſideration during Life. And this I think has been the Practice ſo far as I have been acquainted. But in all theſe Things, all Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be avoided, and Miniſters and People both, ſhould treat each other with Candour and Moderation. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould not diſmiſs their Miniſters ſuddenly, whether it be with or without a Council; nor Miniſters think to run off, when they pleaſe; or even if they have the Advice of a Council. For if Councils (where the leading Part are generally Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters) may diſmiſs a Miniſter when they pleaſe; and all be looked upon well or honourable, as it is in the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they have the greateſt Temptation of ſecular Intereſt to do ſuch an honourable Jobb one for another. And this leads into all Manner of Confuſion and Injuſtice: from which may appear, how far Councils (as they are generally managed) are from being proper Judges; as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> tells of. Not that I am for throwing them away: But
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012714_0021_0F8B8DB8F1769518"/>would have them keep within their own Sphere. Which I ſhall now proceed to conſider what it is.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſpeak ſomething eſpecially as to COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CILS; their <hi>Buſineſs, Authority</hi> and <hi>Uſe,</hi> as they ſtand in Relation to CHURCHES and the Power of Churches, in all Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. COUNCILS, as Things are got to in this Country among Congregational Churches, may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three Sorts. viz. Party-Councils, Mutual-Councils, and Eccleſiaſtical-Councils. I know they all affect the Name of Eccleſiaſtical; but I conceive, it is only to take away their Reproach; for after all, they reckon their Right or Authority according as they are either <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Mutual.</hi> But I am ready to gueſs, that theſe Notions of <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Mutual Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> are <hi>new and upſtart Practices</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Bolton</hi> Affair, P. 37) which our forefathers he ſpeaks of, had no Idea or Notion of. I have read ſeveral ancient Books upon theſe Things, and I don't now recollect reading of any ſuch thing in any ancient Writer; to be ſure I think there is no mention made of them in the Scripture or Platform, on which in Conjunction, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf, ſays <hi>we have founded the Order and Diſcipline of the Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> I ſhall therefore take it for granted, that <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Councils</hi> are <hi>upſtart</hi> Things, which our Conſtitution knows nothing about; and therefore we are not to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Authority or Buſineſs; and indeed if we were to enquire into what they generally aſſume (according to what Opportunity I have had) we ſhould find it as much unknown to thoſe two Fundamental Books as their Names. <hi>Eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Councils</hi> then are the only Sort we have to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Which to define or deſcribe, is when a Church ſends out to Siſter Churches for their Advice or Aſſiſtance in any Weighty or Important Affair. I ſuppoſe the certaineſt Way to find what a proper Eccleſiaſtical Council is, is to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures and to examine the original Pattern which we find in the XVth of Acts; there it appears, the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent to the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalam</hi> about the Queſtion of circumciſing the Gentiles; and by their ſending to the Apoſtles and Elders, it was communicated to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> who had a Voice in the Council, vid. 22d 23d Verſes, ſo that an Eccleſiaſtical Council, is a Collection of Churches met together, to conſult about religious Affairs, and to adviſe any particular Church or Churches in general, what they ought to do in in certain Caſes. But it is not ſo material how theſe Churches come together, if they do but keep within their own proper Sphere; and do the Buſineſs
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012714_0022_0F8B8DB917D24FF8"/>of an Eccleſiaſtical Council, when they are met; only this general Rule, that all things ſhould be done decently and in in order. The ſpecial Thing to enquire after is, what is their Buſineſs, Uſe and extent. The Buſineſs of a Council is in my Apprehenſion, very juſtly delineated in Platform, Chapter XVI, Section 4, which I need not repeat: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſhort to clear from the Word of God, Points of Faith, Conſcience, Worſhip and Diſcipline, and to bear Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Male-Adminiſtration and Corruption in Doctrine or Manners in any Church, and to point out the Way to reform them: thus far the poſitive Part of that Section: which to me appears very agreable to the original Pattern in Acts. The Buſineſs of Councils, namely, is to clear up and ſet Light before the Churches, and then Councils have no further that they ought to do: hence the negative Part of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Section. They are not to exerciſe Church Cenſures in any Way of Diſcipline, nor any other act of Church Authority or Juriſdiction. Here it is eaſy to ſee, how repugnant to the Platform Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Notion of judiciary Authority in Councils is, and alſo how repugnant to the Platform it is, for Councils to ſet up, as though they were ſome ſuperior Court of Judicature; that they won't receive Teſtimonies from the Church, becauſe forſooth they ſay the Church are Witneſſes in their own Caſe. The Church are the Judges, according to the Conſtitution; and Councils only Adviſers according to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf. And I could produce a Cloud of Authorities for this, if there were any need of it: but this will appear quite needleſs ſince the Champion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has aſſerted it. Hence this is not the Buſineſs of the Council, to have Facts proved to them as a Court. The Council in Acts, did not ſtand rumaging Evidence, about the certainty of their having been judaizing Teachers at <hi>Antioch;</hi> nor frump <hi>Paul, Barnabas,</hi> and the others, that they were Witneſſes in their own Caſe; and ſo draw up their Reſult, that it was not proved, that any had been teaching of them, that they muſt be circumcized, &amp;c. and ſo with a mighty ſolemn Air tell what Pleaſure they had to find, that there was no Diviſion or Diſſention of Opinion in the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſo adviſe <hi>Paul, Barnabas</hi> and the others, to go and be quiet, and be careful not to take up ſuch Surmizes and Jealouſies. If the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had done ſo; in my Opinion the Reſult at <hi>Bolton,</hi> 11th of <hi>June,</hi> 1771, would have had an ample Pattern. But far from this. The Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took the Account as they had it of the Meſſengers, that came from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> and adviſed what to do in ſuch a Caſe, as was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012714_0023_0F8B8DB9BA420448"/>them. What was it to them, whether the Facts were proved againſt the Parties: they were not about to lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cenſure either Part; but to adviſe what was right to be done in the Caſe, as the Church had ſent it to them. The Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor any other Church, ever wanted to aſk a Council as to Facts, whether there are ſuch and ſuch Facts, as the Church themſelves are perſonally knowing to. Thus the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> did not want to aſk the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whether there had been judaizing Teachers at <hi>Antioch;</hi> neither did the Church at <hi>Bolton</hi> want to aſk the Council, whether Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> had done certain Things, which the Church themſelves were Eye and Ear Witneſſes to. It would be a moſt ſhocking Affront to common Senſe; to ſet about any ſuch Thing. To make this Matter familiar. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have a Piece of Ground, that has been tilled a long Time, and is become very weedy, and dog Graſs has got in, that won't die, do almoſt what you will to it; and I ſhould have a mind to aſk the Advice of my Neighbours, what I had beſt to do with it; whether I had not better throw it down. And my Neighbours ſhould tell me, you are a Witneſs in your own Caſe, and therefore it don't appear, or is not proved that you have ſuch a Piece of Ground, and ſo we adviſe you to go, and improve your Ground as uſual, and ſeek Profit from it, &amp;c. with all that Gravity and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity which we find in the <hi>June</hi> Reſult. Would it not be worſe than ridiculous? I did not want to have my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to come, to tell whether I had ſuch a Piece of Ground, but to adviſe what was beſt to do, with ſuch kind of Ground. And ſo a Church don't want a Council to tell them whether they ſee one of their Brethren drunk, or hear him uſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Language, or tell Things that be not true; tell one Story one Time, a contrary one another Time, promiſes Things and never fulfills his Promiſe. When they ſee or hear theſe Things, they know them better than a Council can tell them: but if they muſt have a Council to tell them theſe Facts, before they can properly know them to act upon; then they muſt have another Council, to certify them that the firſt Council told them ſo; and a third for the ſecond; and ſo on, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> And indeed this is very much the Way that Things are managed now a Days; one Council leads on to another; anothor to a third; a third to a fourth; and there is no End, till the People are either deſtroyed, or ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or worried out, and give up to let every Thing go as it will; or reſolutely take up their Rights and a done with Councils. By what is laid down, of the neceſſary Lead and Conſequence, of Councils pretending to enter into the Tryal
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012714_0024_0F8B8DBAC5422548"/>of Matters of Fact, and act as Judicatories upon Facts, and by what appears in Fact, as Councils are generally managed, every one muſt ſee, what an endleſs and fruitleſs Labyrinth it leads into. From all which appears, that the Pattern laid down in Acts, is exactly conſiſtent with Reaſon; that the Councils Buſineſs, is to adviſe the Church what they had beſt to do upon the Caſe; as the Church ſtates the Facts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Hence another Thing to be obſerved, which is not ſo well attended to now a Days as it ought; and that is, that all Matters ſhould have a Hearing in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be proper to be laid before a Council; or the Church cannot ſtate the Facts to be adviſed upon; as the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> diſputed the Matters at Home, before they ſent them to the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having conſidered what the Buſineſs of Councils is, and what is not, I now come to conſider what their Authority is, or wherein it conſiſts: For which again we may ſee the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid XVIth Chapter of the Platform, Section 5; which ſhews that it conſiſts, in their Reſults being agreeable to the <hi>Word of God; without which they bind not at all.</hi> Here we have the Authority or binding Force ſet forth negatively and pofitively: From which, it is plain to ſee that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or binding Force, does not conſiſt in their being a Council, or in their being <hi>Mutual</hi> as it is called. Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and many others, lay great ſtreſs upon what they call <hi>Mutual</hi> Councils, as though there were ſome ſpecial Authority at leaſt in them; let them reſult almoſt what they will. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things might be ſaid, to ſhew the abſurdity and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of ſuch a Notion: but for fear I ſhall be too lengthy, and conſidering the Scripture and Platform place the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and binding Force of Councils, in another Quarter, I ſhall take that as ſufficient to ſtand in Oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Notion; and proceed to conſider wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or binding Force of Councils conſiſts according to Scripture. For which Purpoſe, we muſt confider what they did, and eſpecially their <hi>Reſult,</hi> which the Platform ſays muſt be agreable to the Word of God, or it binds not at all. Hence ſee the Reſult of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Council, Acts XV, which begins thus, Verſe 28. IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, <hi>and to us;</hi> i. e. according to the Word of God, and human Reaſon; for the <hi>Word of God</hi> is indited by the Holy Ghoſt. Hence ſuch Reſults as are evidently conſonant with the Word of God, SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST. All Reſults that don't ſtand with that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012714_0025_0F8B8DBB39487590"/>at their Head, are of no Authority or Obligation to be regarded; even as any Civil Inſtrument that is not <hi>in his Majeſty's Name,</hi> is of no Force. Councils have no more Right to go according to their corrupt Wills and Tempers, than the People. Hence it won't mend the Matter, for Councils to preſume to preface their Reſults ſo, unleſs they clear up, and make it appear, that what they ſay is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Word of God, and to human Reaſon. Thus the <hi>Jeruſalem Council</hi> ſhew how it appeared, that IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, to lay no ſuch Burden as Circumciſion upon the Gentiles. For firſt, in the 8th Ver. <hi>Peter</hi> declares how God bare Witneſs to the Gentiles, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> even as he did to the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then in the 12th Verſe, All the Multitude attended to the Relation of like Facts, by <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what Miracles God had wrought among the Gentiles, that they were knowing to. After they had related theſe Things, then <hi>James</hi> in the 14th Ver. and onward, begins to argue upon theſe Accounts, and compares them with the Scriptures of the Prophets; ſhewing that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> thus attending the Gentiles, was agreeable to what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had long before promiſed, by the Mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Then the Argument ſtood thus. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> having formerly promiſed to attend the Gentiles or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, and having now, as appears in ſeveral Inſtances in Fact attended them, or fallen upon them: Therefore the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> requires no ſuch Burden as Circumciſion upon them; for if <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt</hi> to light upon, or attend them in Uncircumciſion; then <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt</hi> not to lay that Burden upon them. Hence comes out the Authority of the Reſult, IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, which all <hi>Reſults</hi> muſt have (i. e. appear exactly conſonant with the Word of God, which is the ſame Thing as to <hi>ſeem good to the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) or they bind not at all. For as Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf ſays, they are <hi>only Adviſory:</hi> every one knows that <hi>Advice</hi> has no binding Force any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or in any other Senſe than it is enlightning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to the Underſtanding; and in religious Affairs, (which we are upon) ſhewing what is the Mind and Will of God, opening of it to the Underſtanding, from his Word and Works; as the <hi>Jeruſalem Council</hi> did, till it appears what SEEMS GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, and when a Council are influenced by the Spirit the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Council were, when they have found what <hi>ſeems good to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the ſame will alſo <hi>pleaſe and ſeem good</hi> to them, perfectly conſiſtent with Reaſon. And when it is thus enlightning
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012714_0026_0F8B8DBF2388F450"/>and convincing to the Underſtanding, that it is agreeable to the Mind of God, and to human Reaſon; it will have all binding Force in it that could be wiſhed.</p>

               <head>The USE of COUNCILS.</head>
               <p>From what has been ſaid above; it appears that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal USE of them, is to inveſtigate, find out, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate what is the Mind and Will of God; and to convince ſuch Churches as may be at a Loſs, what their Duty is.— This appears not only by the Pattern we have in the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem Council:</hi> but alſo according to the Platform, Chapter XV. Sect. 2, alſo XVI. Sect. 2 and 4.</p>
               <p>Another thing wherein we may reckon the USE of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, is to keep up and maintain Correſpondence, Fellowſhip, Communion and good Underſtanding between Churches. Thus the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſending their Meſſengers to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and then the Council ſending ſome of their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to <hi>Antioch,</hi> made a Correſpond and Fellowſhip between them; as well as afforded Help and Light to them. And this argues to the Senſe of the Platform, Chap. VIII. Sect. 8; alſo Chap. X. Sect. 6. Hence in all important Affairs, eſpecially ſuch as the ſettling in Office, and removing from Office; even though there ſhould be no great doubt, if any, what is right, or agreeable to the Mind of God in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; yet it ſerves to keep up a Correſpond and Fellowſhip between Churches, to call in Siſter Churches, to aſſiſt and own them, in thoſe important Tranſactions; and eſpecially in the ſettling a Miniſter, who by his Office to that particu-Church, becomes an Officer in general, in ſome ſpecial Senſe among all the Churches. And Reaſon teaches that a Man ſhould in general go out at the ſame Door he comes in at. But in either of theſe Caſes, if a Church can get no Help or Light from Siſter Churches; and eſpecially in diſmiſſing, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf ſays, <hi>the Platform and common Senſe will juſtify the People in diſmiſſing of him.</hi> Therefore, when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have made repeated Trials to obtain Light and Aſſiſtance from their Siſter Churches, and can obtain none; as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly the Caſe at <hi>Bolton,</hi> as appears by their Remarks on the Reſult; then according to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s own Doctrine, they had a good right to diſmiſs him. And indeed, though in general for the keeping up Fellowſhip and Correſpond of Churches; it is convenient to have a Council at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a Miniſter; yet the Inſtances are frequent where they have been diſmiſſed entirely without a Council. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012714_0027_0F8B8DC14BBF7628"/>when Siſter Churches have been repeatedly conſulted with, it ſerves the Purpoſe of Correſpondence of Churches; even though they can't obtain any Light from them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Way is abundantly clear for a Church to proceed to diſmiſs him. Thus conſider the Nature and Uſe of Councils every Way, <hi>Bolton</hi> People had come to the whole Nature and Deſign of them, according to Scripture, Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and Mr. <hi>Adams.</hi> Therefore he has no Cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of them, or to inveigh againſt them.</p>
               <p>But even upon the Suppoſition that Councils were to be conſidered as Judicatories of Matters of Fact; yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to exclude the Church, or any Members of it from being Witneſſes; or to ſet at naught their Teſtimony, as it is ſaid the <hi>Bolton June</hi> Council did, under a Notion of their being Witneſſes in their own Caſe; is turning all Law human and Divine, and all common Senſe and Reaſon out of Doors. It may be plain to every one, that will give himſelf the Trouble to think of it, that in all ſuch Caſes as are purely Eccleſiaſtical, they are <hi>King's Caſes;</hi> Chriſt is King and Head of the Church; and no farther than a Crime is againſt him as King, have Churches or Councils any Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to try them. And it is plain, Chriſt himſelf ſo conſiders them, in his Direction, Mat. 18, where he ſays, <hi>if thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treſpaſs ought againſt thee;—take with thee one or two, that in the Mouth of two or three,</hi> &amp;c. It is plain that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Complainant is conſidered by Chriſt as a Witneſs. The Reaſon is plain, that in ſuch Cauſes as belong to the Church to try, the Complainant don't get one Farthing to himſelf by its going againſt the Perſon complained of. <hi>Who made me a Judge and a Divider,</hi> ſaid Chriſt himſelf, and if he would not be Judge about ſecular Intereſt or Property, he never ſet his Body here to be Judge about them Things. But the Cauſes to be tried by the Church are the King Chriſt Jeſus's Cauſes; and every one (I ſhould think) knows that in King's Caſes, the Perſon or Perſons immediately injured are good Evidences.</p>
               <p>But again, ſuppoſing it were allowed, that Councils were a Court of Judicature; and to try Actions of Right and Wrong, as to Civil Intereſt or Property; yet the Conduct of that Council in rejecting the Church, as it is ſaid they did, can no Way be reconciled to human Law, nor the Word of God. I ſuppoſe a general Rule in Law, for admitting Witneſſes, is when the Deponent don't win or looſe by the iſſue of the Action. And I ſuppoſe it to be as general a Rule, that when one who is Party, or conſidered as Party in the Caſe, depoſes any Thing, or freely gives in any Thing, which in the iſſue of the Cauſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> him to Leſs; that his own
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012714_0028_0F8B8DC21F098A98"/>Confeſſion ſhall be taken in the ſtricteſt Senſe againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and it is plain enough, that in the Diſmiſſion of a Miniſter; that for the Cauſe to iſſue in his Diſmiſſion, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the People to a Loſs of their Property; Since they muſt be at the Coſt and Trouble of ſettling another. Hence their Teſtimony in ſuch Caſe is the ſtrongeſt poſſible.</p>
               <p>But then again, ſuppoſing it were ſo that they were Gainers by his Diſmiſſion; yet neither by the Law of God, Civil Proceedings, or common Senſe, could their Evidence be ſo rejected. For I take it, that where the Nature of the Caſe is ſuch, that no other Evidence ordinarily can be had, that of the Parties is to be admitted, as in Book Debts, Actions of Treſpaſs, &amp;c. where both the Plaintiff and Defendant (if I miſtake not) are admitted as Witneſſes in their own Caſe, in the ſtricteſt Senſe; ſo as directly to ſwear Money into their own Pockets: and this agrees to the Law of God. Exod. XXII. 11. <hi>Then ſhall an Oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not put his Hand to his Neighbours Goods: and the Owner of it ſhall accept thereof, and he ſhall not make it good.</hi> There we ſee the Man was to give Evidence in his own Caſe, in the ſtricteſt Senſe; ſwearing Money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Pocket, or at leaſt which is the ſame thing, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; it being where other Evidence could not be had. So alſo in Wills, the Law is that no one to whom a Legacy is made may be a Witneſs; and yet where a Legacy is made to a Town or Church, it has (if I miſtake not) very lately been reſolved by the principal Men in this Government, Gentlemen of the Law, that in ſuch Caſe, Members of the Church or Inhabitants of the Town, where the Legacy is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, muſt be allowed as Witneſſes to the Will; becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſſes ordinarily cannot be had. Now Church Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſuch, as ordinarily other Evidence than thoſe of the Church are not to be expected; ſo that they properly come under this Rule. Therefore take it every Way; and the rejecting the Church, as it is ſaid that Council did, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Law of God, common Senſe, and human Laws. And then it is no Wonder the People ſaid if was above their Comprehenſion, as in their Remarks on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſay ſomething of the Miniſter having a right to NEGATIVE THE VOTES OF THE CHURCH. This Notion held to by the Miniſters, has cauſed much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in many Churches. Indeed where a Miniſter has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſumed it in his Practice, and the People have never
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012714_0029_0F8B8DC2BB50F3A8"/>felt the inconveniency of it, the People will even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves argue in favour of it. And truly where a Man holds to any thing that is not right, ſo long as he don't Practice upon it to do any hurt with it, it is I ſuppoſe not worth while to begin a Contention with him for his Notions or Opinions. But in as much as it has been the Bone of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in many Places, and is what has been of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed in wounding of <hi>Bolton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> has bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhed it in his Sermon like a Warrior his Sword; it ſeems highly neceſſary in this neighbourly undertaking I am upon, to pour in ſome healing Oyl into the Wounds that have been made by that deadly Inſtrument. Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and others who hold to this <hi>Negative Power</hi> in the Miniſter, all pretend to take it from that Clauſe in the Platform. Chap. X. Section 11. I don't find as Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> nor did I ever know of any one elſe, the moſt ſtrenuous Advocate for it, ever produce one ſingle Liſp of Scripture for it; or pretend to go to that ſacred Book for it's Vindication: hence then take it juſt as they would have it, it is an <hi>upſtart</hi> Practice which the Scripture knows nothing about. And it is well worthy to be obſerved, that this is almoſt the only Section in the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that has no Quotation from Scripture to ſupport it; ſo that it appears, the Compilers of the Platform themſelves, did not pretend to any Scripture, to ſupport the Notion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in advanced. However we may obſerve 2dly, That it muſt be notorious to every one that reads the Platform, that it all goes upon the Notion or Suppoſition of a plurality of Elders in each Church. There they find a whole long Chap. upon Ruling Elders, and every where interſperſed about El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church; and eſpecially and abundantly ſo in this Xth Chapter, the 3d Section ſpeaks of the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> of the Church, and of the Government of the Church in reſpect to them, reſembling an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> both which Terms every one knows (who has had tolerable underſtanding of Words) carry in them the Notion of Elders or Rulers to one Body, for if it were but only one Elder, he might properly be called a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> but not a <hi>Preſbytery.</hi> And ſo as to the other Term, if the Government were carried on only by one Ruler, it could not be called an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> but a <hi>Monarchy:</hi> it is ſo repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abundant and notorious that the Platform, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Chapter is built upon this Notion, viz. of a plurality of Elders, or ruling Officers to each Church, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to ſay any thing more to make it moſt certain to every one that reads the Platform. Hence the ſaying in this 11 Sect. That <hi>in an organick Church and right Adminiſtration it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012714_0030_0F8B8DC385928380"/>the Conſent of both to conſummate or perfect a Church-Act,</hi> can't give the leaſt ſhadow or Colour of Right to what is pretended, about a ſingle Preſbyter's negativing the Vote of the Church, for this would make the Government of the Church, in reſpect to its Miniſter a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is a <hi>new and upſtart Practice</hi> unknown to the Platform, which owns no <hi>Monarchal</hi> Power or Ruler in the Church, but Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. So that all we have in the Platform which gives the leaſt Colour for what is pretended about negativing; is where there is a Preſbytery, who at firſt Glance, would be thought to have a Negative upon the Church by the Plat. But I rather think that there is a Miſtake even in this, and that no ſuch negativing Power, as is generally ſuppoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Preſbytery by the Platform. But before I proceed it may be proper a little to explain what we are to underſtand by the Miniſter or <hi>Preſbytery</hi> negativing the Vote of the Church. It ſeems to be conſider'd as reſembling the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body of the Nation or Province, where there are three Branches; any one of which not concurring with the other two, makes void whatever the other two may have voted; and ſo it becomes no Act of Parliament or Aſſembly. And ſo in the Church, eſpecially when it has a <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſiſt of two Branches; either of which not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, makes void the Vote of the other Branch, ſo as that it becomes no Act of the Church. But this is evidently a falſe Notion, and contrary to both Scripture and Platform, to conſider or compare the Church to a Legiſlative Body; for the Platform owns no Legiſlative Power belonging to the Church, but what is in Jeſus Chriſt the Head. vid. this Xth Chapter, Section 1 and 4, with other Places to the ſame Purpoſe. Hence the Church are not by Scripture or Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form conſidered as a Legiſlative, but an Executive Body; as in the 18th of Matthew, and many other Places; and ſo in the Platform in numberleſs Places, and abundantly in this Xth Chapter, and eſpecially in this ſo much boaſted Section, Church Acts are called <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> not <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> and it is plain to ſee, that to ſuppoſe or allow any ſuch Thing as <hi>Legiſlation</hi> in the Church, and eſpecially to have the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with a Negative Power at the Head of it, leads directly up to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> himſelf. So that according to Scripture, Platform and Experience; the Church cannot be conſidered, as a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Body: but an Executive one. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that it is inconſiſtent and impracticable, to conſider the Church in two Branches, one Branch having a Negative upon the other. In a Legiſlative Body one Branch may
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012714_0031_0F8B8DC45059EDA8"/>propoſe a Thing, and Vote it, and if the other Branch or Branches do not concur with it, the Thing may ceaſe there, and no ſpecial Inconveniences accrue, and perhaps may be better than if the Law had paſſed. But it is far different in an Executive Court, when any Cauſe is before them there muſt be an Iſſue to the Cauſe, it muſt be acted upon, it won't do to have two Branches in ſuch a Senſe having a Negative one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other, as that they can never come together, and ſo the Caſe dropped out of Court becauſe the Court can't agree. This would make horrid Work, Perſons could never have the the Benefit of Law and juſtice. So in our Executive Courts, though there ſeems in ſome Senſe two Branches, viz. the Judges and the Jury, the Caſe I take it, muſt iſſue finally as the Jury bring in, and the Judges muſt give Sentence and Execution accordingly; however it may be different from their Minds, though they have indeed right to ſend out a Jury once and again; yet it muſt finally iſſue as the Jury give Verdict. So in the Church, it is abſolutely impracticable to pretend to conſider them as two Branches, but as they are an Executive Body: If we compare them with our Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Courts, it will very well agree with the Platform. There the Church are plainly made the Jury as in this ſame Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Power of Judgment in Matters of Cenſure.</hi> And the Preſbytery reſemble the Bench of Judges in the ſame Section, <hi>The ordinary Power of Government belonging to the Elders:</hi> as in a Civil Court, the Rule, Government and Preſidency of the Court belongs to the Bench. And if the Elders or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſingle Elder when he thought the Church made a wrong Judgment ſhould propoſe to ſuſpend the Affairs for farther Light and Conſideration ſome reaſonable Time, in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Civil Courts ſending out the Jury; it is not likely any Church would be againſt it. But then after all, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt paſs as the Church finally bring in; for Power of judgment lies with them, as in this boaſted negativing Section it ſelf; and the Officers in pronouncing Sentence, they muſt do it with the Conſent of the Church, as in the 9th Section. So it is the judgment of the Church or Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Sentence of the Officers, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Brotherhood, and ſo it comes out to that, that in the conſummating and perfecting the Cauſe, each one muſt do his Part, the Brotherhood theirs, and the Officers theirs; and ſo it is in a Court of Civil Juſtice, each one muſt do his Part, the Jury theirs, and the Bench theirs, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate, iſſue or finiſh the Cauſe: what then? no body as I know of, ever thought the Bench had therefore a Negative
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012714_0032_0F8B8DC501D0A150"/>Verdicts of the Jury. It has been before ſhewn, that ſuch a Notion of Negative Branches in Executive Courts, or the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Law, is repugnant and impracticable. So alſo it requires the Office-Act of the Miniſter, or ſome Juſtice of the Peace to <hi>conſummate</hi> or perfect a Marriage; do the Rev. Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy therefore conclude, that they have a Negative upon all the Matches that are made in their Towns or Pariſhes? They may eaſily ſee that this would Negative the Fees out of their Pockets. So alſo it requires the Office-Act of a Juſtice of the Peace to <hi>conſummate</hi> or <hi>perfect</hi> a Deed, for the Conveyance of Land. Have the Juſtices therefore a Negative upon all the Sale of Land within their Counties? So alſo it requires the Office-Act of the Judge of Probate to <hi>conſummate</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Wills. Has the Judge of Probate therefore a Negative on all the Wills in the County? Muſt not the Miniſters in Marriages, the Juſtices in Deeds, the Probate in Wills <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to all thoſe Tranſactions that they act their Office-Part in? The Miniſter may think, that a Couple preſented to him for Marriage, had better not Marry. A Juſtice may think that Men have made a fooliſh Bargain in a Deed brought to him to acknowledge. A Judge may think that a Man has made a very fooliſh unjuſt Will brought to him for Probating. What then? That is not their Buſineſs. Their acting their Office-Part, and thus <hi>conſenting, allowing of, yielding to,</hi> or <hi>ratifying</hi> theſe ſuppoſed fooliſh or unjuſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Bargains or Wills; don't make thoſe Officers fooliſh or unjuſt. They don't make the Marriages, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains or Wills. They only Act their Office-Part in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating</hi> or <hi>perfecting</hi> thoſe Marriages, &amp;c. The Folly or Injuſtice, if there is any, lies at the Door of thoſe that made the Matches, &amp;c. So in the Church: it belonging to the Brotherhood to judge, &amp;c. If they ſhould chance to make an erroneous Judgment; the Miniſter or Preſbytery in doing their Office-Part, in <hi>conſummating</hi> or <hi>perfecting</hi> thoſe Votes, don't make themſelves erroneous. It being the Right and Buſineſs of the Brotherhood to judge both by Scripture and Platform, makes it that it is no more neceſſarily the Act or Judgment of the Miniſter or Preſbytery in their acting their Office-Part, in <hi>conſummating</hi> or <hi>perfecting</hi> the Votes of the Brotherhood; than the Verdict, &amp;c. ſpoken of above, are the Verdict, &amp;c. of the Judges, &amp;c. by their acting their Office Part, in <hi>conſummating</hi> or <hi>perfecting</hi> what is done in thoſe reſpective Caſes. But it is entirely different in Legiſlative Bodies conſiſting of ſeveral Branches, where, by every Branch concurring, it becomes the Special Act of Law of every

But ſhould Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> here ſay, that by <hi>Conſent</hi> is ſome times meant, <hi>Accord</hi> or <hi>Agreement</hi> in any Thing: So that <hi>Conſent</hi> in this Place muſt mean the Agreement of the ſeveral Branches in Legiſlature. Yet he himſelf has ſaid, ſpeaking of the Platform, that <q>in all Writings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wills, Charters, or any Thing elſe of the like Kind, looſe and general Paſſages are to be explained by thoſe that are more definite.</q> So that if there ſhould happen to be dropped a looſe ambiguous Word; yet it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and controuled, by thoſe more definite and certain. And the Platform is full and abundant enough, that no ſuch Thing as <hi>Legiſlation</hi> belongs to the Church; as has been before hinted. The Laws belonging to that, being all made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But much is ſaid about Conſcience in Church Affairs; and that a Miniſter can't Act contrary to his Conſcience, and therefore muſt have a <hi>Negative.</hi> Then let it be conſidered, that the Miniſter no more neceſſarily goes contrary to his Conſcience, in acting his Office-Part in <hi>conſummating</hi> or <hi>perfecting</hi> the Votes of the Church which are contrary to his Judgment; than the Minor Part of the Church neceſſarily go contrary to their Conſcience, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning with the Major Part, who have made a Judgment contrary to theirs. If thus ſtanding in their Lot, acting their Part with the Body, as they ſtand in Relation to it, either in the Miniſter or Minor Part, is going contrary to their Conſcience, what ſhall they do? Shall they therefore leave the Body? Or ſhall the Major Part give up their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Minor? would not that in deed be going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Conſcience? Shall the Major Part leave the Body? or rather ſhall they give up their Exiſtence? For they are the Body. I ſhould think every one by this Time muſt ſee, that the Doctrine or Notion that a Miniſter can't act his Office-Part in <hi>perfecting</hi> or <hi>conſummating</hi> the Votes or Judgment of the Church, when contrary to his Judgment; is a Notion which in its very Nature and Conſequences is abſolutely inconſiſtent with the very Being of Society, and muſt neceſſarily root up and deſtroy all Church State; it generally does prove ſo in Fact, wherever Miniſters pretend to aſſume or uſurp it. And will People perſuade themſelves that the Body of Chriſt of all others neceſſarily and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently has that mortal BANE in it ſelf, which muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably iſſue in its own deſtruction! No doubt the Body of Chriſt is moſt free of any from ſuch a <hi>Bane.</hi> The Laws are all made belonging to it. And therefore there is no need, nor poſſibility of admitting any Negative Branches in the Acts proper to his Body, which is his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:012714_0034_0F8B8DC88A72A308"/>
And that the Right or Power of receiving in judging, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, caſting out, and reſtoring called the KEYS of the Church, ſo much contended about; that theſe by the Laws of Chriſt, are committed to the Church or Brotherhood might be made abundantly manifeſt from a multitude of Places of Scripture; as well as the Platform. A few of which may be hinted. <hi>Firſt,</hi> what Chriſt ſays in the XVIIIth of Matthew, <hi>Tell it to the Church: If he neglect to hear the Church.</hi> And in the next Verſe ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall hind on Earth,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Ye</hi> meant the ſame Thing as if he had ſaid whatſoever the <hi>Church ſhall bind on Earth;</hi> for they were the <hi>Church</hi> that were then gathered. So that here we ſee, Chriſt plainly fixes the Right and Authority of judging and cenſuring, in the Church; <hi>for if he neglect to hear the Church</hi> expreſsly determines that it is their Mind which is to be ſpoken and heard; and his putting a Sanction upon their Binding and Looſing is expreſsly giving them the KEYS. The ſame might alſo be fairly argued from what Chriſt ſays of the KEYS in XVIth of Matthew. For altho' perhaps it may not appear ſo plain at the firſt Glance, that the KEYS were in that Place given to the Church; yet many Things might be ſaid ſhewing that, that this is the meaning of it: But what may be ſufficient to my preſent Purpoſe, may be to obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> himſelf ſays, that <hi>two</hi> Paſſages relating to the ſame Thing; <hi>the latter muſt always controul, interpret and determine the former: that this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Way of ſettling real or apparent Contradictions: that we are bound in all Reaſon to interpret the former in Conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the latter,</hi> vid. p. 36. So that according to him we are certainly bound in all Reaſon, to interpret that in the XVIth of Matthew, in conſiſtency with this in the XVIIIth.</p>
               <p>Accordingly we find the Apoſtles, in all their Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, always treating the Matter thus: Eſpecially in their Epiſtles. So we find Paul to the Romans, Chap. I. Ver. 7. <hi>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called Saints.</hi> So then whatever he ſays in all the Epiſtle directing about Church Diſcipline, it is to thoſe he had thus addreſſed, which was certainly all the Brotherhood, profeſſing Believers. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he ſays, Chap. XVI. Ver. 17. <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, mark them which cauſe Diviſions,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame might alſo be obſerved of what he ſays to the Corinthians in both Epiſtles to them. The IId and IIId Chapters of the Revelations are alſo upon the Plan of the KEYS, Right and Authority of judging, cenſuring, &amp;c. being in the Church. And we read of but one (that I remember) in all
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012714_0035_0F8B8DC901528810"/>the New-Teſtament that pretended to aſſume the Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and to uſe the KEYS, refuſing to take into the Church and caſting out of the Church; whoſe Deeds John ſpeaks of as evil and malicious, IIId Epiſtle, 9th and 10th Verſes. John ſays, he himſelf wrote to the Church: but this <hi>Diotrephes</hi> treated Things in a different Manner, and it is no uncommon Thing for <hi>Diotrephan</hi> Biſhops to <hi>prate maliciouſly</hi> againſt the true Apoſtles, Miniſters or Diſciples of Chriſt, who allow the Church their Rights: Even as that old <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did againſt <hi>John</hi> and the other Apoſtles who wrote to the Church. I hope by this Time it ſufficiently appears, that the KEYS were by Chriſt committed to the Church, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as his Body. And therefore for any Man or ſet of Men, Miniſter or Councils, to preſume to wreſt them out of their Hands; i. e. to pretend to impoſe Members upon any Church; or to take them away as if they could diſmiſs them; or remove their Relation; or to put on Cenſures, or to take them off; or to Negative the Church in theſe Acts; has all the Appearance of the worſt of <hi>ſacrilege.</hi> What can be worſe robbing than to wreſt the KEYS of a Treaſure from the right Owner? Or conſider the Church as his Body, it has all the Symptoms of worſe than crucifying Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh. To me the attempting or pretending to impoſe Members on any Church which they judge unworthy, very much reſembles the putting on Chriſt a Crown of Thorns; or of giving him Gaul and Vinegar to drink. The pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take away or remove, or Cenſure Members contrary to the Church; is diſlocating or breaking the Members of Chriſt's Body; which is worſe than the crucifiers of Chriſt did to him; for a Bone of him was not to be broken. And may the Lord forgive all ſuch as have any Hand in ſuch Things, not knowing what they do: But the Soul that doth ought preſumptuouſly, ſhall be cut off from among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Having thus far ſhewn that no ſuch <hi>negativing Power</hi> is or can belong to the Miniſter or Preſbytery, as is ſo much claimed or pretended: That the KEYS by Chriſt were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Church: That the Church cannot be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Legiſlative Body; I hope it may be ſeen, that there is no need of all the Noiſe and Plea that ſome make about Conſcience, and that the Miniſter can't go contrary to his Conſcience in acting his Office-Part, reſpecting the Votes of the Church. For when it is Matter of Judgment, it cannot be Matter of Conſcience. But if the Church are to make Laws
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012714_0036_0F8B8DCB3193BA08"/>and Statutes; they might make ſome contrary to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and he no doubt ought to have right to negative them; or ſome Way found out, for him to be freed from being ſubject to the Laws he in no Senſe conſented to. But as the Caſe now ſtands, and the Power and Buſineſs of the Church is no other than Executive, or to adminiſter upon Laws already made, there is no need nor poſſibility of his having a Negative upon the Judgments or Votes of the Church; nor any Controul or Embarraſments upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and it is no doubt with me, that it is the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this miſtaken Notion, of the Church being or acting as a Legiſlative Body, which is the Cauſe of many of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and much of the Confuſion there is in our Churches.</p>
               <p>I had many Things more in my Mind, which I thought to have wrote: But I muſt leave my Patient with the Hoſt, and paſs on my Journey; when I return, if I find any Thing more to pay, I determine to make Diſburſtments according to my Ability.</p>

            <p>HAVING peruſed the preceeding Narrative of the late Troubles and Tranſactions in <hi>Bolton,</hi> before it went to the Preſs, wrote by a Neighbour unknown; and being well acquainted with all the Circumſtances, I hope the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not take it amiſs, if I rectify one Miſtake in ſaid Narrative, and alſo add a few Lines to ſet ſome Things in a clearer Light.</p>
            <p>In ſaid Narrative it is ſaid, that the ſaid Miniſter declared that <q>he had never drank to that degree ſo as in any Way to affect or hurt his Reaſon, Speech or Limbs; and the Church voted to accept of ſaid Declaration as a Settlement of ſaid Affair,</q> (which Declaration was made and repeated at other Times) but the following Declaration was what the Church ſettled with him upon at that Time, viz.</p>
            <p>"WHEREAS many have manifeſted an uneaſineſs with me, reſpecting ſuppoſed Intemperance on the Lord's Day, on which was our laſt Communion; on which I ſay, I do not pretend there is no Foundation of Suſpicion; but rather think it was mainly and principally owing to ſome other Cauſe or Cauſes. But let it be from what it will I deſire to take a ſuitable Notice of it, and be duly humbled under the Frown of Providence, and engage by divine Help, to ſhun all reaſonable Grounds of Jealouſy for the Time to come."</p>
            <p>And when it was repeatedly urged that he ſhould make ſome further Confeſſion, he declared that he could not, nor would not, and that he ſhould do Violence to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience if he did: till at length, either by the Perſwaſion of the Council, or ſome other means, he acknowledges, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his own faultineſs, he freely and frankly confeſſes his Sin and Faults, in the exceſſive Uſe of Spirituous Liquors in ſeveral Inſtances: and humbly aſks forgivneſs of God and his People, &amp;c. Which laſt Confeſſion he always refuſed to read to the Congregation. The firſt Declaration and the laſt Confeſſion were ſo different, that the Church could never reconcile them together; but Mr. <hi>Goſs</hi> always inſiſted upon it, that the firſt was equal to the laſt.</p>
