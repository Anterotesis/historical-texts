            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Adverſaries have endeavoured moſt to expoſe us; which we hope may <hi>prove Satisfactory</hi> to thoſe who are not reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think ill of us: But to ſpeak fully to every Critical, Trifling Objection, were a tedious Task, as well as vaſtly beyond the Extent of our Deſign. We requeſt out <hi>Serious Neighbours</hi> to <hi>Hear</hi> and <hi>See</hi> for <hi>themſelves,</hi> and not take things upon <hi>Truſt</hi> from <hi>Others,</hi> and judging the things they know not, condemn us by hear ſay. Don't be impoſed upon by thoſe whoſe peeviſh Humours would have all do like themſelves; who either look not at all, or but very coyly, into the Books of thoſe they have taken a Pet againſt, whoſe Perſwaſion in ſome things differs from what they have pronounced Orthodox; as tho' Truth were their peculiar Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which yet argues either a great deal of Prejudice, or a feeble and fleeting Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that dares not truſt it ſelf. Were our Books ſtuft with ſuch palpable <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> as is ſuggeſted, ſurely twere not ſo dangerous reading them: Who fears to read the <hi>Alcoran?</hi> But on the contrary, 'tis a ſtrong Indication that they contain much Truth; for as 'tis the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Underſtanding, ſo where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with a clear Evidence, anſwering to

Peoples own Experience, 'tis very forcible and prevalent upon the minds of thoſe, who diligently ſeek it for Love of it, and willingly depoſit all pre-engagements of Mind in its diſquiſition. Be then ſo juſt to us and kind to your ſelves, as to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all Prejudice and Prepoſſeſſions, and impartially examine the Truth of theſe things; ſearch the Sacred Scriptures diligently, with an Inclination rather to find and embrace Truth than to ſupport a received Opinion; try whether it is ſo or not; comparing it with your own Experiences, and the Witneſs of God in your own Hearts. Tho' our Belief in ſome of theſe Particulars don't exactly quadrate to that of our Oppoſers, it don't therefore neceſſarily follow 'tis not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Truth and Scripture: nor can they give us any infallible aſſurance, that their Conceptions are a true Standard of Truth notwithſtanding they vend their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions as the only Orthodox; yes and are diſpleaſed too with thoſe that can't be determined by them.</p>

Would they themſelves be content to be thus Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted? We have no intent to decoy and trap an Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that we ſhould walk under a Diſguiſe; which Intreagues uſually have Intereſt at one end of them, which can't be our Caſe, who neither give nor take Money for Preaching; ſo that the Increaſe of our Numbers won't fill our Coffers. We have no other Intereſt to promote but the Advancement of True Piety and Chriſtianity: and having Love and good Will to all People, more eſpecially to thoſe whoſe Minds are awakned, and Hearts warmed, having true fervent Deſires, and living Breathings towards God, thirſting after a nearer and more ſatisfactory Knowledge of, and Acquaintance with him, than barely a profeſſion and hear ſay of him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what we have found advantageous, aſſiſtant and ſatisfactory to us, in our unwearied Purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Peace with him, that we recommend to others. We call People home to the Gift of God in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which only can do them good; that every one may know the good Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls for themſelves, and hear and know his Voice in them, from that of a Stranger, and learn of him and follow him, who is pure, and ever leads to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Holineſs; that ſo his offering up of himſelf for them may be of Benefit to them, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the great Salvation of God.

One may go a great way, and make a fair ſhew of Religion and Piety, and yet be turned to the left Hand; 'tis not having our Heads filled with curious ſublime Notions, tho' of never ſo fine and elevated a Speculation; let's trim and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our Lamps never ſo finely, 'twil not adminiſter an entrance without the Heavenly Oil, without that holy Divine Unction fills our Hearts, enlightens our Minds, and inflames our Affections to a due Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Obedience to its Teachings; which are the moſt aſſured Marks of our being really in Chriſt, in whom only our acceptance is.</p>
            <p>That you with us, and we with you, may ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly live up to our Light and Knowledge given by Chriſt, as that our Conſciences may not condemn us; but that having finiſhed our Days here with Comfort, we may lay down our Heads in Peace, with a well-grounded Hope of a Joyful Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have boldneſs in the Day of Judgment, is our Hearty Deſire.</p>

about that which is above Reaſon. We doubt not in the leaſt either the Reality or Excellency of it; but our great Care, and neceſſary Concern is <hi>That if by any Means we may attain to the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juſt; and then 'tis ſufficient that when our Lord appears we ſhall be like him: Which Hope and Expectation ought to incite in all moſt fervent Deſires,</hi>

            <p>If what we have writen for your Information, may find ſome place with Thoſe, who being Impartial and Inquiring, have Room to receive it and that it contributes to their Benefit and Satisfaction, we have our End: But for thoſe who are Full, or are Critical, and ready to Carp at every Word or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is not plac'd to their Mind, if not alſo pre-judge it, as tis not intended for them; ſo we don't ſuppoſe 'twill prove to their good Liking, nor meet with a Reception amongſt them.

            <p>However, having thus far declar'd our ſelves in the moſt neceſſary Points of the Chriſtian Religion, we don't think our ſelves further obliged to anſwer the Cavils and Critiſciſms of ſuch who may appear Contentious, and will never want ſomething to-object againſt thoſe that come not up in all things exactly to their Level.
