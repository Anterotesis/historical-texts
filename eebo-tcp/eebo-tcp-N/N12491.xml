            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN we turn our thoughts inward, and conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our bodies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the powers and faculties of our ſouls: When we extend our views to the various parts of creation, and contemplate the beauty and harmony, as well as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigns, which every where appear, of an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and righteous government; we ſay, for we cannot but ſay, there is one moſt wiſe and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent being, who governs the whole univerſe, and ſuperintends the actions of all his creatures. To deny this, would be to deny and contradict our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and diveſt ourſelves of the honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of intelligent creatures. The government of mankind, and the preſervation of the numerous and various parts of the world, have in all ages ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo arduous, and ſo much above the power, wiſdom, and fore-ſight of finite beings; that even the unenlightened heathens have repreſented to themſelves, one neceſſary and omnipotent being, ſeated upon the throne of the univerſe, giving laws to all his creatures, with infinitely more eaſe and ſucceſs, than ever the moſt wiſe and exalted earthly monarch could to the moſt obedient and ſubmiſſive nation. If this ſentiment is not enforced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience beyond contradiction; let us hear the majeſtic declaration of the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſay. "And I bleſſed the moſt high,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015791_0003_0F9A29D269FC98A0"/>
and I praiſed and honoured him that liveth for ever, whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth, are reputed as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doeſt thou? For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the Governor among the nations." The voice of nature and revelation, both aſſure us, that all things were created for the manifeſtation of God's glory. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge." But if the whole creation were left to itſelf, and all things ſhould run into that confuſion and diſorder, which muſt end in their total diſſolution; we are unable to ſee the glory of God promoted. Therefore the moſt natural concluſion is, that as God has created all things, he alſo governs all things: as he is our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, ſo he is our preſerver, and governor. "For in him we live, and move, and have our being. By him all things conſiſt, and he upholdeth them by the word of his power." It is infinitely eaſy for God to govern the world, which he has made, and to diſpoſe of all things, agreeable to the utmoſt wiſdom, juſtice and goodneſs. And however ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may ariſe, in the minds of ſome men, from a partial and ſhort ſighted view of the government of God; ſo that they may be ready either to ſay with the fool: "There is no God, or to doubt the certainty of his providence and ſay. "Doth God know, and is there knowledge in the moſt high?" Yet reaſon and revelation teach us, that "The Lord reigneth, who is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength; and that when clouds and darkneſs are round about him: righteouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of his throne." This doctrine of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015791_0004_0F9A29D3289E21E0"/>
God's providence is carried to the greateſt perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is moſt comfortably eſtabliſhed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt. "Are not (ſays he) two ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſold for a farthing? And one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered." Nothing but a prevailing conviction of the truth of this great doctrine, of God's preſerving care and governing power, could ever rationally juſtify and enforce the great and pleaſing duties of prayer, praiſe and thankſgiving. For if God were abſent, or diſregarded us, in vain ſhould we raiſe our hearts and our hands, in humble ſupplications for the removal of approaching danger; and we ſhould in vain joyfully exalt our voices, in united praiſes, for ſome remarkable deliverance and unmerited mercy. But why ſhould I any farther purſue this ſubject? The preſence of this aſſembly ſeems to confirm this truth more undeniably, than my voice is able.</p>
            <p>This day, agreeable to the reſolution of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Continental Congreſs, our moſt worthy General has called us together, to return moſt humble and hearty thanks, to almighty God, for the many inſtances of his unmerited goodneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in general, as a nation, and in particular, for the very ſignal and compleat victory obtained, over a potent army of Britons. And I imagine, in the order for the convention of this aſſembly, I hear the words of my text repeated, and pointed out to me. Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy, and for thy truth's ſake. And ſhould I forget theſe words, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our meeting, and ſpend your time in hearing military panegyrics on your wiſdom and valour, though you are truly entitled to more praiſe than my feeble tongue can expreſs: were I to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the rights of heaven, and arrogate to ourſelves all the praiſe of our late ſignal victory; I foreſee
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015791_0005_0F9A29D3E84449E0"/>
that I ſhall draw upon myſelf the juſt cenſure of every wiſe and virtuous man; diſappoint your hopes and expectations, and, as far as my influence will go, turn this day's meeting into a curſe. For the glory of all conqueſts and acquiſitions, ſhould be aſcribed to God, as due to him alone: therefore we read, that when the people gave a ſhout, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of Herod, "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man; immediately the angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghoſt."</p>
            <p>The words of David, in the hundred and fifteenth Pſalm, are therefore the words of my text, and a proper guide to lead us to give all praiſe and glory to God. They were pronounced immediately after a recollection of God's miraculous power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhewn unto the Iſraelites; and was intended to ſhew the dependence men have upon God, and that he is the principal director of all happy and ſucceſsful events. Time would fail me to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the reaſons which we perſonally have to praiſe and glorify God. In order that our praiſes might keep pace with our mercies, every moment of our lives ſhould be devoted to his ſervice, and all our actions directed to his glory.</p>
            <p>The words, which are the ground of what ſhall be ſaid at this time, were drawn from the grateful heart of the king of the Jews, by public mercies, and were of national concern. I ſhall therefore endeavour to follow the ſpirit and intention of them, in a view ſomewhat ſimilar, and ſpeak of thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which have been conferred upon us, and in which this great continent is intereſted. Let us aſcribe unto God all power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, and ſay, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry given, who haſt been pleaſed with unerring wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to direct, with unconquerable power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and with never failing goodneſs to bleſs the United States of America, in all their wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015791_0006_0F9A29D4A8AE90E8"/>
and ſucceſsful enterprizes, ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent war.</p>
            <p>I need not inform you, Gentlemen and Fellow Soldiers, that many years paſt the language of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain correſponded with the language of Pharoah and his cruel taſk-maſters, who ſaid, "come let us deal wiſely with them, leſt they multiply." But when by the bleſſing of Heaven, we were enabled to elude all the ſnares which were ſo thick planted, both in Britain and America, to deprive us of our freedom; and a corrupt and tyrannical court found that arms alone could promiſe them any ſucceſs in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and inhuman deſigns of ſubjugating a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: then we ſaw the arms of the king of England turned againſt us, and threatening the ruin and deſtruction of every thing, worthy the notice of a brave and wiſe man. Thus we beheld the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible navy, which claimed the ſole dominion of the ocean, invading our country, and diſtreſſing our cities. Thus came forth the veterans of Britain, who had been ſo accuſtomed to conquer, that vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſeemed bound to their arms: and then we ſaw the boors and mercenary, half-ſtarved Germans, lured, like hungry harpies, and ravenous wolves, by the hope of preying upon the lives and eſtates, of the innocent Americans. But were all theſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preparations neceſſary for the conqueſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, when unprepared for hoſtilities? Surely it might have been reaſonably ſuppoſed, that all this pomp and majeſty of war, was deſtined againſt ſome powerful nation or army, accuſtomed to mark their way with deſtruction, blood and carnage. How then muſt our thankful amazement be excited, when we reflect upon our happy ſituation as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and find ourſelves able to ſay, we are not ſlaves: tho' oppreſſion made ſuch near and dreadful approaches to us, when in our moſt defenceleſs ſtate.</p>
            <p>Who, that is a friend to virtue and liberty, will
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015791_0007_0F9A29EB97E13090"/>
a moment heſitate to give glory to God, for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential care and goodneſs, in preſerving us out of the hands of the enemy, who ſeemed ready to ſwallow us up, when we were without arms or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, without ſhips of war, and without the ſkill or love of war. For theſe and innumerable inſtances of public mercy, we deſire moſt heartily to praiſe God, and ſay, "Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto the wiſdom of our counſellors, that their counſels and wiſdom have ſurpaſſed our moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations. Not unto our commanders and armies tho' they have ſo often behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves valiantly, and conducted wiſely; yet, give glory, not unto them, but unto the name of God; for he it was who taught our ſenators wiſdom, and girded our ſoldiers with courage and ſtrength. It is the Lord our God who has fought for us, in every ſucceſsful battle, and has hitherto ſupported our righteous cauſe, againſt thoſe who hate us without any juſt reaſon. Truely we may ſay, oh ſing unto the Lord a new ſong, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him the victory. The Lord hath made known his ſalvation: his righteouſneſs hath he openly ſhewed in the ſight of our enemies. He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered his mercy towards us; all the ends of the earth ſhall ſee the ſalvation of our God. What ſhall we render unto the Lord for diſpoſing a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nation, to ſhew favour unto us, and ſupply us with ſuch a plentiful apparatus of war? How much have we acquired by ſea, where our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were the leaſt? But more particularly, let the voice of this day continue to aſcend, in moſt hearty thanks, to Almighty God, for his great goodneſs in qualifying, and raiſing up ſo many worthy and wiſe men, to form the grand council of the United States of America, and be the guardians of our rights and privileges. Oh give thanks unto the Lord our God, for a brave general, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015791_0008_0F9A29EC058EB6D8"/>
in chief of all our armies. A general poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſuch unparalleled fortitude and patience, and not more patient, than meek, virtuous and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. And if I am permitted to ſay any thing of a character, which ſo much outſhines the brighteſt encomiums the writer can offer: I will venture to ſay, that if you ſearch for faults, in the conduct of that true patriot, and moſt excellent hero, you will find none, unleſs you call it a fault to excerciſe compaſſion and lenity towards thoſe negligent and guilty offenders, who by their ſloth and inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the beſt orders, counteract the wiſeſt plans, and fruſtrate the beſt ſchemes of military diſcipline and policy. But this humane exceſs of goodneſs is found in the moſt noble and exalted ſouls. Not to enumerate the various and evident ſigns of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing providence, which enabled us to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ourſelves out of imminent danger, or to check the enemy's rage, even when our armies have been almoſt diſbanded.</p>
            <p>Methinks I ſee the illuſtrious Waſhington, with but two or three thouſand men, retreating indeed before 10 or 12000 of the enemy; but yet checking thir progreſs thro' the country, and when reinforced by the brave militia, turning upon the enemy, killing ſome, captivating many, and obliging ſo large an army to retire, and confine themſelves, during the whole winter, within narrow bounds. Oh America, give glory to God, for ſuch a faithful hero! Then you ſaw him greateſt when moſt without your aid. Collected in himſelf, he greatly reſolved, with his few faithful followers, to be the barrier of liberty, or fall in its defence. Oh ſons of America, let it not again be ſaid, that you ſeemed to deſert liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Waſhington: But God ſupported and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him and us all; ſo that inſtead of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, we gained ſtrength and knowledge, in the art and means of defence, during the two laſt cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns: And having now nearly concluded the third

campaign, although victory has not fully atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us in every enterprize, the proſpect is glorious, and far exceeds our former expectations or hopes, and calls us to praiſe God, and ſay, bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to our enemies.</p>
            <p>Had any one, three or four years paſt, ventured to predict, that we ſhould have been able to have lived thro' ſuch a tempeſt of war, and at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive within ſight of the haven of conqueſt and peace; we ſhould have called him an enthuſiaſtic prophet of madneſs and folly, and ſaid he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the ſwelling billows of Britiſh wrath; but having ſtemmed the torrent of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and tyranny, tho' many times with no other hope of ſucceſs, than that which aroſe from a view of the mercy and juſtice of God, and an humble expectation, that he would pity and vindicate a people, who were marked by their enemies for the ſlaughter of oppreſſion and tyranny, becauſe of their noble defence of the righteous cauſe of God and mankind. The Lord exerciſeth righteouſneſs and judgment, for all that are oppreſſed. We now look back with pleaſing amazement, and ſay, this is the work of the Lord, and marvellous in our eyes. Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto our wiſdom and fortitude, not unto our perſeverance, patience, and courage, tho' they have been much greater than we could have flattered ourſelves they would be; yet not unto us, but unto God give the glory. I have been unwilling to ſhew a narrowneſs of ſoul, by confining the praiſes of this day, to the ſubject of our glorious conqueſt and finiſhed campaign, in the northern department: When our ſouls are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with an overflowing ſenſe of the goodneſs and mercy of God; we know not where to begin or where to end our aſcriptions of praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Many have been the ſtreams of mercy, which have refreſhed our drooping ſpirits, ſince the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015791_0010_0F9A29ED682348A8"/>
beginning of the preſent war, and often has our good God put ſongs of praiſe in our mouths; but this day, in the view of our late ſignal victory, more than all the ſtreams, of paſt mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeem to be united, in conſtituting one copious river of goodneſs and love, and overflowing, and exceeding our higheſt praiſe and gratitude. Like the Iſraelites of old, we beheld the enemy ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in ſilent and inexpreſſible admiration, adored the Lord who wrought ſuch a wonderful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and with them we now ſay: Thy right hand, oh Lord! is become glorious in power; thy right hand, oh Lord! hath daſhed in pieces the enemy.</p>
            <p>But let us now turn our attention to what may be conſidered the more immediate ſubject of this day's praiſe, namely our conqueſt over the northern Britiſh army. Behold the enemy leave Canada, ten thouſand in number. Our ſtrong fortreſſes are evacuated. The enemy take poſſeſſion of them, and afterwards purſue our little divided army, tho' not without a ſpirited oppoſition. Our army being ſo much inferior to the enemy, were not able to protect the country, and ſtop the progreſs of the Britiſh army, now fluſhed with ſucceſs, and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe, that where ever they turned their arms, ſubmiſſion muſt meet them, or oppoſition be turned into flight. Nothing then ſeemed to hinder them from ſuddenly taking poſſeſſion of the ſtate of New York, from one end to the other. In this extremity of our public affairs, it was the ſeaſon of Jehovah's merciful appearance; and the God whom we this day adore, turned their counſels into fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, and ſet bounds to their rage. When the language of the enemy was, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil: my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them, I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them: God ſecretly ſaid unto
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015791_0011_0F9A29EEE8587208"/>
them, as he did to the waves of the ſea, hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no farther.</p>
            <p>That the hand of God, was in this, has been acknowledged by the moſt profane, in common with the wiſe and virtuous. For what but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God could diſpoſe a commander, of ſenſe and experience, to divide his army, and leave the grand object which he firſt had in view, when there appeared nothing to prevent him, from forming a junction with another army of Britain. Who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the inhabitants and militia of Bennington, with reſolution to oppoſe the enemy, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible bravery, and to kill and captivate ſo great a number of them? Who inſpired the garriſon and militia to the weſtward, to make ſo bold and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a defence, to defeat the enemy there, ſtop their incurſions, and ſave that part of the country from ſavage barbarity? Courage and reſolution are as much the gifts of God, as any qualifications whatever; for without him the greateſt natural courage may be turned in fear. At that time, when our army were few in number, why did not the enemy improve the opportunity they had, of marching thro' the country, before we had time to collect, and oppoſe their progreſs, as we have ſince done? Under the checks and influence of divine Providence, the opportunity, which was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, being paſt, they ſuffered our army to collect, under the command of the brave and honourable general Gates. And when we had ſo increaſed in numbers, as to be able to advance, and meet the enemy in the field of battle, did not the Lord teach our hands to war, and our fingers to fight, ſo that many of the enemy fell down ſlain and wounded. Nor was the bravery of officers or men leſs in the ſecond conflict, when the dead of the enemy were ſtrewed over the field, and the living chaſed to their ſtrong holds. There you ſaw the intrepid Arnold, like the thunder bolt of war, hurling <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

fear and death, among your terrified flying foes: and then fearleſs, and impatient of delay, you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your hero, and forced the ſtrong lines of the enemy. Oh noble ardour for victory! brave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of death, where American liberty was the prize contended for! In vain did the enemy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to eſcape, tho' they might have ſaid, as the Egyptians did, let us flee from the face of Iſrael; for the Lord ſighteth for them, againſt us. However not to enter into more particulars, ſave that by the wiſdom and perſeverance of the commander, and the vigilance and bravery of the officers and men, the enemy were neither able to flee from our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor yet dared to riſk a battle, nor able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt themſelves; thus the final grand reſult of all, was, that they were by the good providence of God, delivered into the hands of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that without the loſs of more precious American blood. And ſo manifeſt has been the hand of God, in all theſe tranſactions, that I have met with none, whoſe ſentiments do not very ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpond with the language of the text. Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's ſake. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am this day happy enough to remind you, of what hiſtory has ſcarcely a parallel. A potent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and five generals, either cut off, or totally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued in one campaign. How great the addition which is made to our ordnance, our arms and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſtores; all theſe are acquiſitions not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our moſt grateful acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have endeavoured to follow the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the text, and, as much as poſſible, imitate the pſalmiſt, in the enumeration of many inſtances of God's goodneſs, and in humbly acknowledging that his hand has been in all. As far as I have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this way, ſo far, I truſt, I have not done amiſs. David, who was as great a warrior, and as valiant a prince, and as eminent a ſaint, as ever
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015791_0013_0F9A29F128528668"/>
lived or filled a throne, aſcribed all his ſucceſs to the over-ruling providence of God. Never had a man more reaſon to boaſt of his wiſdom and ſucceſs in war. In all his wars, ſucceſs waited upon his courage, and victory paid homage to his ſword; yet he ſays, "I will not truſt in my bow, neither ſhall my ſword ſave me. Thou art my king, oh God! through thee will we puſh down our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; thro' thy name will we tread them under that riſe up againſt us. It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, and maketh my way perfect. Some truſt in chariots, and ſome in horſes; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God."</p>
            <p>For leſs ſucceſs than we have obtained, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Romans and Grecians ſaid, let us haſten to the temples of the gods, and thank them for all their goodneſs and favour. And happy am I this day, when I conſider, that the continental congreſs have ſo publicly ſhewn their wiſe, and humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the ſuperintendence of the king of kings, and lord of lords, and have invited every friend of virtue and liberty, throughout this vaſt continent, to adore the one living and true God, and praiſe him for every merciful interpoſition of his providence; to be ſubmiſſive to every ſtroke of his righteous hand, confeſſing that his judgments are lighter than our ſins have deſerved, and that in the midſt of deſerved wrath, he has been pleaſed to remember mercy.</p>
            <p>Happy am I alſo to find, that we are pleaſed to be ſeen uniting with our brethren, in praiſing God for that ſucceſs which you have been ſo inſtrumental in gaining. Oh happy victory which gives new life to the friends of liberty every where. This will raiſe the dignity and importance of our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors in Europe, and make us more and more reſpectable in the eyes of the world: and ſhall I not hope, that this is a happy prelude to victory over all our enemies in America. Among the many
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015791_0014_0F9A29F1EA066088"/>
bleſſings which God has beſtowed upon us, I muſt not forget to take notice of the happy union, which ſubſiſted in the army, between the troops of the different ſtates. All diſcord and animoſity depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made room for courage, friendſhip, and the united love of our country. Oh happy union, where all ſtrove to excel in bravery, and the ſervice of our common cauſe and intereſt. United we ſtand, divided we fall, is a truth, which reaſon and the ſacred ſcriptures both ſupport. A kingdom divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand. We are brethren, we have the ſame God to worſhip, and the ſame cauſe to defend. The happineſs of the one ſtate, is the happineſs of the other; and as we have ſeen the good effects of that perfect harmony which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among us; let us cultivate it more and more, and may that man, who attempts to ſow the ſeeds of diſcord and contention among us, be accounted our greateſt enemy, and be baniſhed from our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>For a moment reflect on the diviſions of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Britiſh troops. Nothing, under God, ſo much contributed to their defeat, as their internal animoſities and diſcord: but the hand of God was in this, and ſet them againſt one another, as he did the ſwords of the Midianites againſt their fellows, throughout their whole camp. Therefore let bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and friendſhip cement us together; let a wiſe and patriotic zeal fire us with true courage; May a nobleneſs of ſoul, and a love of true honour, run thro' all our actions, and may a generous emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation inſpire us to excel in all the duties of the brave ſoldier, and the accompliſhed gentleman.</p>
            <p>Hear how ſweetly the Pſalmiſt deſcribes the beauty and happineſs of union. Behold, how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity. As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that deſcended upon the mountains of Zion. And let me add, how good and how pleaſant was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015791_0015_0F9A29F2A8A6F798"/>
it, for the troops of the New-York and the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſtates to dwell together in unity. And let me go farther, and ſay, how neceſſary, uſeful, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is it, for the brethren of the united ſtates, to dwell together in unity. Surely for all theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, none will be backward to praiſe God.</p>
            <p>I now enter upon a leſs joyful ſubject than the triumphs of victory; but it is to ſome the ſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of conqueſt. Suffer me, my dear fellow ſoldiers, to check, for a moment, the current of joy and gladneſs, and blame me not for doing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the memory of the brave heroes, who fell in battle, honourably defending their country. They well deſerve the tribute of a tear, and are juſtly entitled to the honour of being recorded in our breaſts, among the ſaviours of our country. For us and poſterity they bravely fought, and bled, and died, and fell in the field of glory, and the arms of victory. With us they were acquainted, and to us they were dear. Neither officers nor ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhall be ungratefully forgotten by us; for they have done honour to their country, and made a generous ſacrifice of their lives, to the rights and liberties of mankind. Such bravery is worthy of imitation, and gives a dignity to human nature. Follow therefore, ye men of war, their noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and to all your innate bravery, join love to all the friends of liberty, and true love to God, who covered your heads in the day of battle, and ſhielded you from death, when you ſaw his arrows fly ſo thick around you, and ſo many were ſlain. I beſeech you, let not your near eſcape from death, harden you againſt God, and diſpoſe you to forget and neglect him. He is continually doing you good; why will you offend him, and diſregard the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable obligations, you are under, to be obedient to his laws and ſubmiſſive to his will. Behold, how tenderly the Pſalmiſt repreſents the care and kindneſs of the Lord, unto all thoſe who put their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015791_0016_0F9A29F369914410"/>
truſt in him. He ſhall cover thee with his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt. Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flyeth by day. In the ſtrength of God, therefore, go on ye heroes, who, in two battles with the enemy, bravely fought, and have ſurvived thoſe conflicts, and are happily before me this day, employed in the moſt reaſonable and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified ſervice, of praiſing and adoring the Lord of hoſts, the God of battle, who with infinite eaſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes all the events of war, and guides the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly caſual revolutions of kingdoms and ſtates, to his own appointed purpoſes. Walk in the road of glory, and the pleaſant path of true virtue, and gather freſh laurels in every enterprize. Regret not your removal from the late ſucceſsful command of the honourable general Gates, for here is his excellency general Waſhington. Look on him, and catch the genuine patriot fire of liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. Look on him, and learn to forget your own eaſe and comfort; like him reſign the charms of domeſtic life, when the genius of America bids you grow great in her ſervice, and liberty calls you to protect her. Look on your worthy general, and claim the happineſs and honour of ſaying, he is ours. Like him love virtue, and like him, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the name of the great Jehovah. Be mindful of that public declaration which he has made. "That we cannot reaſonably expect the bleſſing of God upon our arms, if we continue to prophane his holy name. Learn of him to endure watchings, cold and hardſhips, for you have juſt heard that he aſſures you, he is ready and willing, to endure whatever inconveniencies and hardſhips may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this winter.</p>
            <p>Are any of you ſtartled at the proſpect of hard winter quarters? Think of liberty and Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and your hardſhips will be forgotten and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Let Europe, nay let the world hear, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015791_0017_0F9A29F429DEFE80"/>
the American army, in the defence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, chearfully ſubmitted to the inconvenience of having no other houſes of accommodation, than ſuch as their own hands reared in the depth of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Be encouraged, therefore, to undertake all that has been propoſed to you, in the generals or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And let me aſſure you, from ſome little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience obtained, in three campaigns, that what has appeared hard and impracticable, at a diſtance, has been found tolerable and eaſy, when the worſt that could be imagined has arrived.</p>
            <p>Surely you, who have carried the war to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry walls of Quebec, and ſupported it through the whole winter, will not complain of the winter's cold, in the ſtate of Pennſylvania. But there are few of this brigade, who are not inured to war, who are not veterans in hardſhips, and loſſes, as well as in the ſervice of their country. Let us be firm and exact in the diſcharge of our ſeveral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as ſoldiers and officers; and by our ardour in the common cauſe, by our patience and obedience, render ourſelves reſpectable, and honourable, in the fight of our leader, and make it ſeem a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to command us.</p>
            <p>Allow me to ſay, my dear gentlemen officers and fellow-ſoldiers, I cannot be ſatisfied that we ſhould be only as good as others; I earneſtly wiſh to have the honour of ſaying, This is the beſt brigade in the continental ſervice: and ſuch a one we may be, if we will ſeriouſly conſider, how much we can poſſibly do to ſerve the public, without going out of our proper ſphere of action.</p>
            <p>Baſe is the man, whether in the civil, eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or military department, who contents himſelf with doing only ſo much, as will preſerve him from the reproach of groſs and viſible neglect of duty. An army conſiſts of many parts, and if ſome parts move either too ſlow, or not at all, the great whole will be thrown into confuſion and diſorder,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015791_0018_0F9A29F4E895E868"/>
and conſequently ſuffer. Uniformity of motion in all the parts, gives ſtrength, and eaſe, and beauty, and expedition, which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary in every enterprize. Not an individual perſon in the army, but may contribute ſo much, in the regular and ſtrict diſcharge of his duty, to the good of the whole, that, were he ſeperated from the army, it would ſuffer ſome real loſs. Let every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider how uſeful, important, and honourable he may render himſelf, in the army and in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country: and on the other hand, how mean and contemptible he muſt appear, if he is either unacquainted with his duty, or negligent in the performance of it.</p>
            <p>I now paſs on, having already taken notice in ſome inſtances, of your valour and ſucceſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you the caution, which is recorded in the word of God. Let not him that girdeth on the harneſs, boaſt as him that putteth it off. The war is not yet at an end, the enemy are not all conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' ſo large an army has been totally ſubdued. We have yet an army to oppoſe; but our proſpect of ſucceſs is glorious. How ſoon it may pleaſe God to deliver them into our hands, or call them away, would be raſh in me to venture to tell; but I however look forward, with an inconceivable pleaſure, and view, not far off, American liberty eſtabliſhed upon a ſure and honourable foundation. Be therefore undaunted in battle, and modeſt in proſperity; theſe diſpoſitions of mind belong to the character of a brave and great man. But I had little reaſon to exhort you in either of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, for you have been culpable in neither. Such a generous ſpirit of candour and modeſty, as you diſcovered after ſo ſignal a victory, has ſcarcely been known in any army. Our enemies themſelves acknowledge, that when they marched in priſoners of war, none of our troops inſulted them, or ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſigns of contempt, or diſreſpect. Happy
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015791_0019_0F9A29F5A9748898"/>
was I to hear this from the mouth of an enemy. Your conduct, my friends and countrymen, was truely characteriſtic of brave and noble ſpirited men. Cowards inſult thoſe who fall into their hands; but the brave are compaſſionate, and fight no longer than there is an abſolute neceſſity. Let general Burgoyne, and his officers generouſly ſpeak the truth, and bear witneſs that nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the part of the noble ſpirited general Gates, and his officers, to render them as happy as poſſible, and even make them forget that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. Glad have I been to find that our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and kind treatment of priſoners, has been ſuch, that it extorted, even from Britons this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; that we treated them much more mildly, than we ſhould have been treated in a ſimilar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Not ſo have our moſt unhappy brethren been treated, who have fallen into the hands of general Howe. Let the mean inſults which Britons have ſo liberally offered to officers of rank and note; officers who might have juſtly diſdained to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with men, who had neither principles of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity nor humanity, and yet men who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them received unmerited favours from the Americans, whom they dared to inſult. Let theſe mean and unmanly inſults, let the wanton cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſtripping helpleſs women and children of the very means of ſubſiſtence, deſtroying their houſes, and burning our towns, in a manner which nothing contributed to finiſh the war; let all theſe things convince the world that we fight with men, who are neither gentlemen, nor honourable ſoldiers, nor yet men poſſeſſed of the common feelings of humanity. May the dying groans, of famiſhed ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, be lodged in the merciful ear of him, who hears the priſoners cry, and will be avenged upon cruel, hard hearted, and bloody men. Oh! tell it not in America, that her ſons periſhed for want of a morſel of bread to eat; and yet proclaim thro'
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015791_0020_0F9A29F6681ED020"/>
the world, that Britons tortured their priſoners, even to death, by the lingering torments of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And ſtill do my ears hear of the ſame cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exerciſed upon thoſe who are ſo unfortunate as to fall into their hands. The blood of ſo many already murdered, has not ſatiated thoſe cruel men. Alaſs! too many are now unhappy victims to their relentleſs rage. Oh! merciful God, if thou haſt permitted that nation ſuddenly to fill up the cup of their iniquity, that thy vengeance may be executed upon them; let not, we beſeech thee, their cup be filled with American blood.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured my friends, that under God, the only means to procure you good treatment, are the ſharpneſs of your ſwords, and your ſkill in war, and your invincible courage in battle. May the groans of the hunger-ſtarved, may the griefs and indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſorrows and aflictions of our ſuffering bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren fire your minds, and ſpur you on to military revenge and univerſal conqueſt.</p>
            <p>I leave the painful gloomy ſubject, and return to conſider what improvement we ſhall make, of the many inſtances of God's goodneſs and mercy, which have been the ſubjects of this day's praiſe and gratitude. The improvement which Joſhua, the heroic and pious leader of the Iſraelites made of all the victories and triumphs which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, was, that they ſhould love the Lord their God. Take good heed therefore unto yourſelves, ſaid he, that ye love the Lord your God. All pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mercies are beſtowed for this very purpoſe, that they may be improved for the honour and glory of God. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul, is the firſt, and great commandment of the law: And God in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential dealings with us, whether merciful or afflictive, enforceth what his law demands.

hero and eminent ſaint, and manifeſt the thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our hearts, for the unexpected and unmerited favours conferred on us, by loving the Lord our God, and fearing to offend him in any reſpect. It is becauſe the compaſſions of the Lord fail never that we have not been conſumed. His judgments ſometimes appear, and with a ſtern and ſevere voice command our obedience unto his laws, and ſay, "Turn ye, turn ye, for why ſhould ye be ſtriken any more." But how much more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do his mercies addreſs us in the mildeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and invite our return unto him.</p>
            <p>Surely when God confers mercies and favours upon us, who are not only unworthy of them, but have deſerved to be ſeverely puniſhed: our hearts muſt be hard and void of every grateful feeling, if they are not melted into love and thankfulneſs for ſuch great goodneſs. If we give ourſelves time to reflect upon our paſt conduct, either as a people, or as individuals, we muſt confeſs that the ſmalleſt inſtance of God's goodneſs and mercy, has been truely unmerited, and far beyond any thing we could reaſonably have expected. We have moſt baſely offended our moſt merciful and gracious God, and that even when he has ſaved us out of the hands of our enemies, and loaded us with his benefits. During the preſent year in particular, men have too commonly lived as if there was no God to take notice, and they were not accountable creatures. Alas my friends, you cannot be ignorant that the name of the great Jehovah, has been commonly prophaned by the profligate ſwearer, in bold and open defiance of his laws and authority. Here might I avail myſelf of the tremendous curſes of God's holy law, and thunder out the denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of heaven againſt wilful offenders, and ſay, <hi>"Curſed ſhall ye be if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God: and the Lord your God will not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

But I forbear, the gentle voice of mercy this day calls upon you; I therefore paſs by every thing dreadful and harſh, and beſeech you to ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſubdued by the overflowing, diffuſive goodneſs of God. The way to obtain greater bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is to be truly thankful for thoſe we have already received.</p>
            <p>We have this day been praiſing God, but, believe me, praiſe cannot aſcend acceptably to God, unleſs it riſe upon the wings of love and obedience. Come then, my friends, conſecrate yourſelves to the ſervice of the Lord our God, humble yourſelves on the account of paſt ſins, and ſin no more. Let the world know that the man who loves and fears the living and the true God, fears not any danger, in the road of his duty. For the man who puts his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in his God, and engages in his ſervice, is in the ſureſt way of protection and ſafety; or if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord, to call him, by death, from the field of battle, it would only be a removal, a little ſooner, from the foot ſtool on earth, to the throne of glory, in heaven. Learn then to endure hardneſs as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt. And, oh I beſeech you! as on my bended knees, reverence and obey the words of that Saviour, who has done and ſuffered ſo much for the ſalvation of ſuch guilty ſinners as you and me.</p>
            <p>SWEAR NOT AT ALL. Think how horridly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful it is to offend and affront that God, who is continually doing us ſo much good. Since God has ſo remarkably ſmiled upon the arms of the United States, let the ſincerity of our gratitude be ſeen by taking heed to fear and love him; and let me aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that to live ſoberly and righteouſly, is the only way to ſhew the thankfulneſs of your hearts, and the high eſteem you have of all our mercies.</p>

May we never forget the tranſactions of this day, nor the occaſion of our meeting. Oh! that the united praiſes and prayers of this great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, may this day meet at the throne of divine mercy and juſtice. May brigades of angels guard our commander thro' all the toils and dangers of war, until peace, liberty and independence are eſtabliſhed; nor let them leave him thro' life, nor at death, but ſafely convoy him to the regions of eternal liberty and happineſs, and ſeat him high, as the moſt renowned heroes of liberty and religion. May angels look down upon us with pleaſure and approbation, while we are contending with our enemies, and grappling with every difficulty in the defence of the bleſſings of heaven. But above all may our adoring praiſe aſcend up to God, ſo pure and ſincere, that it will pleaſe him to ſay, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, I will bleſs this people yet more, I will add unto them bleſſings tenfold more. Your enemies ſhall fall before you by the ſword. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</p>
            <p>Let us, my friends and fellow ſoldiers, unite in earneſtly praying, that God would engage our hearts, in ſincere love and holy obedience to himſelf. Then may we hope and expect, that the Lord of hoſts, the God of battle, will go with our armies, and lead them to new and greater victories, until at length the horrors of war, ſhall be terminated in a ſafe, honourable and laſting peace.</p>
            <p>May God grant this, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of his love; to whom with the Father, and Holy Ghoſt, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all might, majeſty, and dominion, forever, Amen.</p>
