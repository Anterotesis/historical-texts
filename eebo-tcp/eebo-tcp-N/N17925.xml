            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Kingdom of Chriſt is a ſubject of great importance: for, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the views we have of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will our concluſions be, reſpecting various branches of religious conduct. If thoſe views be imaginary, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions muſt be falſe. By the former, the glory of Meſſiah's regal character will be obſcured: by the latter, his worſhip will be corrupted: whereas the true doctrine concerning this holy empire, may not only be the mean of preſerving from thoſe evils, but of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting us with <hi>data</hi> for the deciſion of many diſputes among the profeſſors of Chriſtianity. A competent acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, therefore, with its nature and laws, its emoluments and honors, is cloſely connected with our duty and our happineſs: which acquaintance muſt be derived from divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023213_0003_0FBEDC4624963218"/>
Important, however, as the ſubject manifeſtly is, it has been but ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly diſcuſſed. This conſideration was a leading motive to the preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. To illuſtrate the nature of our Lord's Kingdom, and to infer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions flowing from it, conſtitute the deſign of this Eſſay.</p>
            <p>The author has expreſſed his thoughts with great freedom; yet without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the leaſt offence to any party of Chriſtians, or to any perſon, from whoſe notions and practices he conſcientiouſly differs. In the courſe of diſcuſſion he animadverts, indeed, on ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, with a degree of ſeverity: but then they appear to him in the light of <hi>political artifices,</hi> which either impeach the dominion of Chriſt in his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; or degrade and corrupt that worſhip which he requires. Now, in caſes of this kind, the writer is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that allegiance to the King Meſſiah,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023213_0004_0FBEDC4818055E48"/>and true benevolence to man, demand the language of marked oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Such is the nature of our Lord's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that few of his loyal ſubjects can ſeriouſly reflect upon it, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves both delighted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. <hi>Delighted;</hi> becauſe it is for the honor of their Mediator, to be the Sovereign of a ſpiritual monarchy. A character of this kind apparently ſuits the dignity of his Perſon, the deſign of his mediation, and the riches of his grace.—<hi>Reproved;</hi> becauſe they daily find a want of that ſpirituality in their affections, and of that heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which become the profeſſed ſubjects of ſuch a kingdom. When meditating on the characteriſtics of this holy empire, they ſtand convicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its divine Sovereign of much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and worldly mindedneſs, over which they ſincerely mourn: while
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023213_0005_0FBEDC49987CEBC0"/>merely nominal ſubjects of the King Meſſiah, or ſuperficial profeſſors of the gracious goſpel, are but little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the ſtate of their hearts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to heaven; or with regard to the ſpirituality of their worſhip.</p>
            <p>This being the caſe with multitudes, the author would not be much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were various particulars in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages to prove diſguſting to the taſte of numbers profeſſing godlineſs. But facts are ſtubborn things; and the ſayings of Jeſus Chriſt muſt not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained away, that conſcience may reſt in a falſe peace, or that the public taſte may be gratified<note n="*" place="bottom">LUTHER ſays, Potius quam aliquid Regno Chriſti et Gloriae ejus decedat, ruat non ſolum pax ſed coelum et terra. <hi>Loci Commun.</hi> Claſſ iv. p 35.</note> For, when thinking of our Sublime Sovereign, THY KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM COME, is the language of every up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart, let carnal profeſſors and the profligate world ſay what they pleaſe.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST.</head>
            <p>IT having been revealed by ancient Prophets, that the Lord Meſſiah ſhould be a King, and have univerſal empire, the choſen tribes in every age expected his appearance under the regal character. While, however, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral idea of that expectation was fully warranted by the Spirit of prophecy, the bulk of Abraham's natural poſterity were under a groſs miſtake, reſpecting the true deſign of their Meſſiah's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the real nature of his kingdom: which miſtake had the moſt pernicious influence upon their temper and conduct, when the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming was fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe which they affixed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies reſpecting the great Redeemer, was manifeſtly ſuch as flattered their pride and foſtered their carnality. This gave it a decided advantage, in their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023213_0007_0FBEDC53F4891CA8"/>eſtimation, over that for which our Lord and his Apoſtles contended; and led them to overlook whatever in the ancient Oracles oppoſed their ſecular views. Ignorant of their ſpiritual wants, and fluſhed with a falſe perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of intereſt in Jehovah's peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, on the ground of carnal deſcent from Abraham, and of the Covenant made at Horeb; the doctrine, example, and claims of Chriſt, were extremely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. Not appearing as a temporal prince, diſcovering no diſpoſition to free them from the Roman yoke, and frequently addreſſing their conſciences with keen reproof, on account of their pride and hypocriſy, ſuperſtition and covetouſneſs; they rejected with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined oppoſition all the evidences of his divine miſſion, treated him as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, and procured his crucifixion.—After he was riſen from the dead, and aſcended to heaven, multitudes of them indeed believed, and profeſſed the Chriſtian faith: but a great majority of the nation continued in hardened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, and perſecuted the Apoſtles with unrelenting malevolence. Thus they proceeded till, divine forbearance being exhauſted, <hi>wrath came upon them to the uttermoſt,</hi> in the total ſubverſion of their civil and eccleſiaſtical polity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:023213_0008_0FBEDC54DCE93AD8"/>
This miſtake of the Jews, reſpecting the kingdom of their Meſſiah, lying at the foundation of all the oppoſition with which they treated him, and of their own ruin; it behoves us to guard with diligence againſt every thing which tends to ſecularize the dominion of Chriſt: leſt, by corrupting the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Oeconomy, we diſhonor the Lord Redeemer, and be finally puniſhed as the enemies of his government. Our danger of contracting guilt, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring divine ſentiment in this way, is far from ſmall. For we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with ſenſible objects, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with exterior ſhow, that we are naturally inclined to wiſh for ſomething in the religion of Jeſus, to gratify our carnality. Under the influence of that maſter prejudice, <hi>the expectation of a temporal kingdom,</hi> Jewiſh depravity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt; and our corruption, if we be not watchful, may ſo miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his empire, and oppoſe his royal prerogatives, as implicitly to ſay, <hi>We will not have him to rule over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the numerous admirable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, that ſtand recorded in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are adapted to inſtruction in this important ſubject; there is one
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023213_0009_0FBEDC5654B81B90"/>which deſerves peculiar notice. The ſaying to which I advert, is part of that <hi>good confeſſion</hi> which our Lord witneſſed before Pontius Pilate; <hi>My kingdom is not of this world.</hi> A conciſe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive declaration, and worthy of him that made it!—This capital ſaying may be conſidered as the grand maxim on which he formed his conduct when among men; and it is pregnant with needful inſtruction to all his diſciples, reſpecting the New Oeconomy and the Chriſtian Church Relative to matters of that kind, there is not, perhaps, a more intereſting paſſage in all the New Teſtament; nor one which is better adapted to rebuke the pride and carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of millions who bear the Chriſtian character. To approve of Chriſt as a ſpiritual monarch, agreeably to the meaning and tendency of this emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal text, requires a degree of heavenly mindedneſs which comparatively few poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My kingdom is not of this world,</hi> ſays Meſſiah the Prince, when ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roman governor, and queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned about his claim of dignity. He boldly avows himſelf a King; yet, while advancing his title to the honors,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023213_0010_0FBEDC5877196478"/>of royalty, he tacitly informs Pilate that the civil rights of Ceſar had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear from him; and that his own diſciples had no advantages to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, of a ſecular kind, as the reſult of embarking in his cauſe.—Our Lord, a little while before, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly conveyed the general idea of this declaration, by receiving from a ſurrounding multitude the acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons due to his royal character, when <hi>riding upon an aſs:</hi> for while he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the honours of royalty, the poverty and meanneſs of his appearance plainly implied, that his kingdom was not of a temporal kind. Zechariah had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that the children of Zion ſhould loudly rejoice in this humble manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the King Meſſiah, and that their joy ſhould kindle into rapture. An incontrovertible evidence that he predicted the public inauguration of a Sovereign, whoſe <hi>kingdom is not of this world.</hi> For the loyal and affectionate ſubjects of a political monarch never thought it matter of exultation, that he appeared among them, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed king, with all the marks of meanneſs and of poverty. Yet ſo it was in reſpect of the King Meſſiah.</p>

Relative to this kingdom, and its divine Sovereign, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah ſays; <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</hi> This prophetic Oracle was fulfilled when our Lord, <hi>leading captivity captive,</hi> aſcended on high and ſat down on the right of the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then was he moſt ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated and proclaimed King of the New Teſtament Church, amidſt ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myraids of attendant angels, and <hi>ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of which moſt grand inveſtiture with his regal office, he diſtributed royal donatives, at the feaſt of Pentecoſt, among his devoted ſubjects— ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives, as perfectly ſuited the majeſty of his Perſon, and the nature of his kingdom. Yes, that wonderful aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of ſpiritual gifts and heavenly graces, which he beſtowed upon his diſciples at the Jewiſh feſtival, was a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023213_0012_0FBEDC5E76194228"/>glorious firſt-fruit of his aſcenſion, and of his being <hi>a prieſt upon his throne.</hi> The Goſpel Church, which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his laws, the ſeat of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the object of his care, being ſurrounded with powerful oppoſers; he is repreſented as ruling <hi>in the midſt of his enemies.</hi> Nor ſhall his mediatorial kingdom and adminiſtration ceaſe, till all thoſe enemies become his footſtool.</p>
            <p>The empire of Chriſt, indeed, extends to every creature: for <hi>all authority in heaven and on earth</hi> is in his hands, and he <hi>is head over all things to the Church.</hi> But the kingdom of which we treat, ſtands diſtinguiſhed from that of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Providence, as well as from every political ſtate. It muſt be conſidered, therefore, as conſiſting of thoſe perſons whom he bought with his blood, whom he calls by his grace, and over whom he reigns as a ſpiritual monarch. Theſe conſtitute what is frequently called, the Catholic Church, wherever the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed individuals may reſide. Of ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, or of thoſe who make a credible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of being ſuch, all thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches conſiſt, which conſtitute our Lord's viſible kingdom—that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of which we ſpeak. Into the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023213_0013_0FBEDC5F5E8D9438"/>principal characteriſtics of this holy empire, and into the genuine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of thoſe criteria, we ſhall now enquire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Goſpel Church is a kingdom not of this world, in regard to its origin.</hi> From the time of Nimrod to the preſent age, ſecular empires have generally origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the vile paſſions of their firſt founders: for, in almoſt every inſtance, avarice and pride, ambition and a luſt of dominion, have been conſpicuous.—Not ſo, in the kingdom of Chriſt. The remote foundation of his dominion was laid in the counſels of Heaven before time commenced, by all comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſdom and infinite goodneſs, for the glory of God and the benefit of man: and the immediate baſis on which it ſtands, is his own vicarious obedience to divine law; both as to its precepts, and as to its penalty. Juſtice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, therefore, are the foundation of his throne. Mercy and truth attend the whole of his adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, reſpecting the ſubjects of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous government.</hi> The generality of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all countries, were <hi>born</hi> ſubjects
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023213_0014_0FBEDC62857CA1F0"/>of thoſe governments under which they lived. No ſooner, for inſtance, were we capable of reflecting upon our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil connections, than we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves freeborn ſubjects of the Britiſh crown: and thus it commonly is in the ſovereignties of ſecular princes. Their dominion being confined to the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of human conduct, and not reaching the heart; natural birth and local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſtitue ſubjects of the ſtate, put them under the protection of law, and inveſt them with civil rights. Such ſubjects are perfectly well ſuited to the kingdoms of this world, and to the character of their ſovereigns. For, conſidered as men, kings and ſubjects are on a level: and, as diſtinguiſhed by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical characters, their obligations are mutual; allegiance on the one part, and protection on the other.—Beſides, temporal kingdoms reſpect the preſent world. The mutual duties of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns and of ſubjects, as ſuch, regard the happineſs of civil ſociety, and of that only. As an inveſtiture with poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſovereignty does not conſtitute a lord of conſcience, it gives no claim to authority in ſpiritual things, but is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely confined to the concerns of this world. It is, indeed, the indiſpenſable
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023213_0015_0FBEDC63D3CBB020"/>duty of ſecular princes, and of their people, to love and adore God: yet that obligation does not ariſe from any political relation ſubſiſting among them, but from their being reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It is alſo their happineſs to be the ſubjects of Jeſus Chriſt: but that felicity does not reſult from any thing ſhort of divine mercy exerciſed upon them, as depraved and guilty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The kingdom and claims of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very different from thoſe of Ceaſar, the qualifications and obedience of his real ſubjects muſt be ſo too. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be good ſubjects of a temporal ſovereign, and enjoy the rights of ſuch a character, while they are ſo far from bearing true allegiance to Jeſus Chriſt, as to be quite inimical to his dominion, and entire ſtrangers to the privileges of his kingdom. The empire of Chriſt <hi>is not of this world:</hi> it is not a temporal, but a ſpiritual kingdom. Our Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is a ſpiritual ſovereign; whoſe dominion extends to the mind, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and heart, no leſs than to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal behaviour. Conſequently, all the ſubjects of his government muſt have ſpiritual diſpoſitions, and yield ſpiritual
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023213_0016_0FBEDC6590477330"/>obedience—obedience, proceeding from an enlightened underſtanding, an awakened conſcience, and a renewed heart. For, as is the ſovereign, ſuch are the ſubjects, and ſuch the allegiance required. A ſpiritual Sovereign, and ſubjects yielding an obedience merely external, are manifeſtly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.</p>
            <p>As all mankind are born in a ſtate of a poſtaſy from God: as the natural turn of the heart, or <hi>the carnal mind, is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> we muſt be born again—<hi>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> before we are permitted to conſider ourſelves, or to be conſidered by others, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Him whoſe kingdom is of a ſpiritual kind. Remarkable are the words of our Lord, when ſpeaking of his loyal ſubjects: <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> No: they are deſcribed by the Apoſtles, as being <hi>of the truth; of faith;</hi> and <hi>of God</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023213_0017_0FBEDC6792F3FD60"/>and holineſs from Jeſus Chriſt through believing in him. <hi>Of God:</hi> born of him; or <hi>begotten again to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi>—Such are the ſubjects of our Lord's kingdom: in oppoſition to whom, the New Teſtament repreſents the reſt of our apoſtate race, as being <hi>of the works of the law; of the world; of darkneſs;</hi> and <hi>of the devil</hi>

Eph. v. 8. Joh. viii. 44. Eph. ii. 2.</note> So great is the contraſt formed by Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who are under our Lord's government, and the reſt of mankind! Agreeably to which, real Chriſtians are further deſcribed, as <hi>delivered from the power of darkneſs,</hi> or the tyranny of Satan, and tranſlated into the kingdom
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023213_0018_0FBEDC6C3B2FEE88"/>of God's dear Son: and as being <hi>of God,</hi> while all the reſt of the <hi>world lies in wickedneſs.</hi> None, therefore, but thoſe who are born from above, are the ſubjects of Jeſus Chriſt: for if the heart be not under his dominion, he reigns not at all as a ſpiritual monarch.</p>
            <p>That none but real Chriſtians ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Lord's kingdom, is yet further apparent from the deſcriptive characters of thoſe that were members of the apoſtolic churches. We find them deſcribed in the New Teſtament, as <hi>gladly receiving the word</hi> of grace, as <hi>the called of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and as <hi>called to be ſaints.</hi> The Apoſtles denominate them <hi>brethren, faithful brethren, holy brethren, ſaints,</hi> and <hi>lively ſtones</hi> in the ſpiritual temple<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 41. Rom. i 6. 1 Cor. i. 2. Eph. i. 1. Philip. i. 1. Col. i. 2. Theſſ. i 3.

We may therefore ſay, with VITRINGA; <q>The kingdom of grace, in which Chriſt is king upon mount Zion, is properly and emphatically <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023213_0019_0FBEDC6D926D0E68"/>of Chriſt:</hi> of which none are ſubjects, except thoſe who are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, called, faithful, peaceable, and humble; in whom Jeſus Chriſt lives by his Spirit, as in the members of a myſtical and ſpiritual body, of which he is the head<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>This view of our Lord's ſubjects is perfectly agreeable to the nature and genius of the New Covenant, with which the Meſſiah's kingdom is cloſely connected: becauſe it appears, that ſubjects of any other deſcription, have no reaſon to conſider themſelves as covenantees; and it is plain that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Covenant muſt ſuit the Kingdom to which it belongs, whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian.—When, <hi>in the fulneſs of time,</hi> God performed his gracious and comprehenſive promiſe of bleſſing all nations, it was by the intervention of a New and better Covenant than that which was made at Sinai. For thus it is written: <hi>Behold, the days come, faith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah:</hi> NOT ACCORU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING TO THE COVENANT THAT I MADE<note n="†" place="bottom">8.

            <p>This admirably gracious Covenant is completely ſuited to a ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to the ſubjects we have been deſcribing: for it announces no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, makes no proviſions, confers no bleſſings, but thoſe that are ſpiritual, internal, and everlaſting. The true knowledge of Jehovah, writing his law in the heart, forgiveneſs of all ſin, and perpetual relation to God, are
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023213_0021_0FBEDC7232D7F208"/>the bleſſings for which it engages; but there is not a word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

Covenantees, therefore, under the Chriſtian Oeconomy, can be no other than the ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham: and ſuch are the ſubjects of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Hence the Goſpel Covenant is called <hi>new,</hi> and is expreſsly oppoſed to the Sinai Confederation, from which it is extremely different. It is alſo pronounced <hi>a better</hi> Covenant than that which Jehovah made with the ancient Iſrael: and ſo it is, whether we conſider its objects, its bleſſings, its confirmation, or its continuance.

Now, to this more glorious Covenant, the kingdom of Chriſt, and the ſubjects of it, muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. As, therefore, none but ſpiritual bleſſings are contained in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo none but real ſaints are the ſubjects of our Lord's dominion.</p>
            <p>Very different, then, is the kingdom of Chriſt from the ancient <hi>Iſraelitiſh Theocracy.</hi> For, of that Theocracy, all Abraham's natural deſcendents were true ſubjects, and properly qualified members of the Jewiſh church; ſuch only excepted, as had not been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed according to the order of God, or were guilty of ſome capital crime. To be an obedient ſubject of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government, and a complete mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in their eccleſiaſtical ſtate, were manifeſtly the ſame thing; becauſe, by treating Jehovah as their political ſovereign, they avowed him as the true God, and were entitled to all the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of their National Covenant.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023213_0024_0FBEDC7A4ED787B0"/>Under that Oeconomy, Jehovah ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged all thoſe for <hi>his people,</hi> and himſelf as <hi>their God,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed an external obedience to his commands, even though in their hearts diſaffected to him<note n="*" place="bottom">Judges viii. 23.1 Sam. viii. 6, 7. and xii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſtate of things, however, under the New Oeconomy, is extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. For the great Proprietor and Lord of the Chriſtian church, having abſolutely diſclaimed a kingdom that is <hi>of this world,</hi> cannot acknowledge any as the ſubjects of his government, who do not know and revere him—who do not confide in him, and ſincerely love him. Having entirely laid aſide thoſe enſigns of political ſovereignty, and thoſe marks of external grandeur, which made ſuch a ſplendid appearance in the Jewiſh Theocracy; he diſdains to be called <hi>the King,</hi> or <hi>the God,</hi> of any perſon who does not obey and <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> Appearing as the head of his church, merely under the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023213_0025_0FBEDC7E01795990"/>character of a ſpiritual monarch, over whomſoever he reigns, it is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by the light of his truth; in the conſcience, by the force of his authority; and in the heart, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his love: for as to all others, his dominion is that of Providence, not that of Grace.—The New Teſtament affords no more ground for concluding, that our being deſcended from parents of a certain deſcription, conſtitutes us the ſubjects of our Lord's kingdom; than it does to ſuppoſe, that carnal deſcent, in a particular line of anceſtry, confers a claim to the character and work of miniſters in the ſame kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is of great importance to the right interpretation of many paſſages in the Old Teſtament, that this particular be well underſtood and kept in view, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah is very frequently repreſented as the LORD and GOD of all the ancient Iſraelites; even where it is manifeſt that multitudes of them were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as deſtitute of internal piety, and many of them as enormouſly wicked. How, then, could he be called <hi>their</hi> Lord, and <hi>their</hi> God, in diſtinction from his relation to Gentiles, (whoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, benefactor, and ſovereign he was) except on the ground of the Sinai Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023213_0026_0FBEDC7FD52CDA48"/>He was THEIR <hi>Lord,</hi> as being the ſovereign whom, by a federal tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were bound to obey, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to every political monarch, who ſhould at any time preſume to govern them by laws of his own. He was THEIR <hi>God,</hi> as the only object of holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and whom, by the ſame National Covenant, they had ſolemnly engaged to ſerve according to his own rule, in oppoſition to every Pagan idol. But that National relation between Jehovah and Iſrael being long ſince diſſolved, and the Jew having no prerogative above the Gentile; the nature of the Goſpel Oeconomy, and the Meſſiah's kingdom, aboſolutely forbids our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that either Jews or Gentiles are warranted to call the Great Supreme THEIR <hi>Lord,</hi> or THEIR <hi>God,</hi> if they do not yield willing obedience to him, and perform ſpiritual worſhip. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either for want of underſtanding, or of conſidering, the nature, aſpect, and influence of the Sinai Conſtitution, that many perſons dream of the New Covenant, in great numbers of places, where Moſes and the Prophets had no thought about it; but had the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Horeb directly in view. It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again: As none but real Chriſtians are the ſubjects of our Lord's kingdom, neither adults, nor infants, can be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Goſpel Church, in virtue of an <hi>external</hi> covenant, or of a <hi>relative</hi> holineſs. A ſtriking diſparity this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian church. Of this difference we may be aſſured by conſidering, That a barely relative ſanctity, ſuppoſes its poſſeſſors to be the people of God in a merely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe: that ſuch an external peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuppoſes an external covenant, or one that relates to exterior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and temporal bleſſings: and an external covenant ſuppoſes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal king. Now an external king,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023213_0028_0FBEDC86D708AEC8"/>is a political ſovereign: but ſuch is not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not yet the divine Father.

            <p>The children of Iſrael, being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Gentile world, by a ſyſtem of ceremonial precepts, and their divine Sovereign reſiding among them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When, for example, Moſes with aſtoniſhment beheld the burning buſh, the ground on which he ſtood was pronounced <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah's peculiar preſence there.

Remarkably to our purpoſe is the declaration of God, when ſpeaking of the ancient ſanctuary; <hi>There I will meet with the children of Iſrael, and</hi> Iſrael (not <hi>the tabernacle</hi>) <hi>ſhall be ſanctified by my glory.</hi>

               </q>—Now, as the Divine Preſence had a local, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reſidence over the mercy-ſeat, which was the throne of Jehovah; as that Preſence among the Iſraelites had ſuch an extenſive operation upon their ſtate, both in reſpect of privilege and of duty; as the whole nation was a

            </p>
            <p>Under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe peculiarities have no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For Chriſt has not made an external covenant with any people. He is not the king of any particular nation. He dwells not in a palace made with hands. His throne is in the heavenly ſanctuary; nor does he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his viſible Preſence in any place upon earth. The partition wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jews and Gentiles has long been demoliſhed: and, conſequently, our divine Sovereign does not ſtand related to any people, or to any perſon, ſo as to confer a relative ſanctity, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an external holineſs</p>
            <p>While the Sinai Covenant continued in force, the Son of God was the King of the Jews: for though, by Saul and others bearing the regal character, the Divine government was obſcured, yet it was not aboliſhed. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Iſrael, <hi>in the hands of the Sons

            <p>The Covenant made at Horeb having long been obſolete, all its peculiarities are vaniſhed away: among which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſanctity made a conſpicuous figure. That National Conſtitution being aboliſhed, Jehovah's political ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty is at an end. The covenant therefore now in force, and the royal relation of our Lord to the church, are entirely ſpiritual. All that external holineſs of perſons, of places, and of things, which exiſted under the Old Oeconomy, is gone for ever: ſo that if the profeſſors of Chriſtianity do 'not poſſeſs a real, internal ſanctity, they have none at all.—The National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation at Sinai is expreſsly contraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in holy Scripture, with the New Covenant<note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xxxi. 31—34. Heb. viii. 7—13.</note>: and though the latter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly provides for internal holineſs, reſpecting all the covenante, yet it ſays not a word about relative ſanctity. And, indeed, how ſhould it? ſince, by its commencement, the whole Sinai Conſtitution became obſolete; the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023213_0036_0FBEDC988F63BE38"/>partition wall was broken down; the ſpecial relation between God and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's natural ſeed ceaſed, and left no difference of a religious kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jews and Gentiles—no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in reſpect of nearneſs to God and communion with him, except that which regeneration and faith in Chriſt produce. For, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſpenſation, <hi>Chriſt is all in all.</hi> We may therefore ſafely conclude, that were the Jews converted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled in Paleſtine, both they and their infant offspring would be as entirely deſtitute of the ancient relative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as thoſe Mahommedans are who now reſide in that country.</p>
            <p>But did an external holineſs now exiſt, we ſhould be obliged to conſider it as very different from that of the ancient Iſraelites: for it appears, by what has been ſaid, that the grounds of their exterior ſanctity make no part of the Chriſtian Oeconomy. Beſides, their holineſs extended to the whole nation: but in what Utopia ſhall we find all the inhabitants poſſeſſed of this relative purity? Theirs continued as long as they lived; except they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023213_0037_0FBEDC9F556F4630"/>ſome enormous crime, by which they forfeited their lives, or were caſt out of the congregation. for it did not wear out by age, nor was it loſt merely by continuing in a ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy. Whereas, that external holineſs for which ſo many plead, is not generally conſidered by them as extending beyond the time of infancy. —But why ſhould any contend for the relative holineſs of infants, who deny a ſanctity of that kind, to places of worſhip, clerical habits, and various other things? for it is plain that the Jewiſh external purity, whether of perſons, of places, or of things, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated in the ſame National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in the ſame relation of God to Iſrael: and, conſequently, muſt have the ſame duration in one caſe, as in another. We may therefore juſtly conclude, that the federal and relative holineſs of which ſo many ſpeak, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agrees with the laws of Judaiſm, nor with the nature of Chriſtianity. But if ſo, it cannot belong to the kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Further: If all the ſubjects of Chriſt he real ſaints, it may be juſtly queried whether any <hi>National religious eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:023213_0038_0FBEDCA09EDA73E8"/>can be a part of his kingdom.

The tenor of the New Teſtament, however, agreeably to our Lord's maxim, leads us to conſider particular churches as Congregational; and as conſiſting of thoſe who make a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion of repentance and faith. Such congregations, wherever they be, conſtitute the viſible kingdom of Chriſt.—That the apoſtolic churches were Congregational, is clear from the ſacred Records; and that there was no National church for the firſt three hundred years, is equally evident. Becauſe there could not be any ſuch eſtabliſhment, till the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome nation or other profeſſed Chriſtianity; which was not the caſe before CONSTANTINE aſcended the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial throne. Then, indeed, a kind of political Chriſtianity came into faſhion, which has continued ever
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023213_0043_0FBEDCAD5E5D6830"/>ſince, and is yet in great repute. Nor are National churches likely to fail, while the policy of ſovereign princes, and the pride of aſpiring prelates can ſupport them. But, being eſtabliſhed by human laws, and each of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a viſible head, either civil or eccleſiaſtical, either prince or pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff; they are ſecular kingdoms, and unworthy the name of Chriſtian churches.</p>
            <p>Once more: As none but regenerate perſons belong to the kingdom of Chriſt, no one is a better ſubject of his dominion, or a more honorable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his church, on account of <hi>wealth</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> of <hi>parts</hi> or <hi>learning.</hi> Theſe things, though uſeful in their places, of much reputation to a ſecular empire, and of great conſequence to it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pertain to the true glory of a Chriſtian church, nor to the ſterling worth of a Chriſtian character. For what concern have worldly wealth and civil power, informing a ſpiritual cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or in adorning a ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? The greateſt affluence and the higheſt authority that mortals can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, add nothing to any one's moral worth. No one is a better man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023213_0044_0FBEDCAED57DC520"/>he is rich and powerful; nor the worſe, becauſe he is poor and in a low ſtation. Theſe things are all exterior to moral character. For the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious are often exalted and wealthy, while the moſt upright and amiable are loſt in obſcurity and oppreſſed with want Beſides, when wealth, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is poſſeſſed by a true ſubject of our Lord's kingdom, the honor attending his character does not ariſe from his riches, or his authority; but from the holineſs of his life, or his likeneſs to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As our Britiſh Sovereign is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of honor to all his ſubjects, even ſo is the King Meſſiah to all that are under his dominion. The only way however to be great and honorable in his kingdom, is to be humble, diligent, and uſeful, in promoting the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our fellow Chriſtians and fellow creatures. For among the fundamental laws of Meſſiah's empire, the following is one, and it relates to comparative honor: <hi>Whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your miniſter; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant. Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtered unto, but to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023213_0045_0FBEDCB3E82D2800"/>and to give his life a ranſom for many</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt xx. 26, 27. Mark x. 42—45.</note> This being the law of honor, and the rule of promotion, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, we may ſafely conclude, that the meaneſt domeſtic may be a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified character in a goſpel church, and <hi>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour:</hi> while his wealthy and powerful maſter, profeſſing the ſame faith, may diſgrace the name of a Chriſtian, and bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on the congregation to which he belongs. If the former be diligent and faithful in his menial ſtation: if he be <hi>ſound in the faith,</hi> zealous for God, and heavenly minded; he is an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubject of Jeſus Chriſt, and high in the eſtimation of Heaven. If, on the contrary, the latter be formal in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious profeſſion; if he be unjuſt or haughty, voluptuous or covetous; he does not belong to the kingdom of Chriſt, but is manifeſtly a ſubject of Satan.</p>
            <p>Nor do the moſt ſhining mental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, or literary acquiſitions, enter into the true glory of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Genius and learning, like wealth and power, are frequently poſſeſſed by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023213_0046_0FBEDCB60BCB9F70"/>the worſt of moral characters. They cannot, therefore, make any part of that excellence by which the ſubjects of Jeſus Chriſt are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe ſecular princes. It is not by the gifts of common Providence, among which parts and learning make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous figure; but by the graces of the Holy Spirit, that any perſon, as a Chriſtian, is worthy of regard.—Yes, it is faith in Chriſt, and obedience to him; love to God, and benevolence to man; humility, patience, and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſpirituality, and heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which adorn the ſubjects of our Lord's kingdom—which diſtinguiſh them from the children of this world. Theſe, and ſimilar things, reſpect the ſtate of the conſcience, and of the heart. They form a character for eternity, and ſavour of the heavenly world. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, learning and parts, equally as wealth and power, are quite of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature. The diſtinction they make between one another is entirely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and often diſgraced by a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate heart—belongs only to this world, and has no connection with heaven. But as will appear in its proper place, the kingdom of Chriſt is nearly allied to heaven—is a ſtate of preparation for
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023213_0047_0FBEDCB8AF5343D0"/>that ſublime bleſſedneſs, an introduction to its employments, and gives an earneſt of its fruitions Conſequently, the true glory of that kingdom cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in the lively exerciſe of holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and heavenly affections. The more there is of a likeneſs to heaven, in the heart and life of any Chriſtian; the more there is of that <hi>honor which comes from God,</hi> and the more is the cauſe of Chriſt adorned.—To be a real ſubject of this kingdom, is a much greater honor than merely to be a Prophet, or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. For Balaam was the former, and Judas was the later; yet both of them were baſe and wretched <hi>Rejoice not that the devils are ſubject to you; but rather rejoice that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven. Though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and of angels,—and though I have the gift of prophecy, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all myſteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, ſo that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move mountains, and have no charity, I am nothing,</hi> in the eſtimate of a ſpiritual Sovereign, or in reference to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtate.</p>
            <p>No miniſter of the word, therefore, when performing his public work, ſhould ever think of exalting himſelf as an officer in this kingdom, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023213_0048_0FBEDCBAD97CEAE8"/>his learning, his genius, or his eloquence; for that would be to <hi>preach himſelf, not Chriſt Jeſus the Lord:</hi> but, as <hi>in the ſight of God,</hi> he ſhould honeſtly aim at <hi>commending himſelf to every man's conſcience, by manifeſtation of the truth.</hi> Then will he imitate a firſt rate miniſter in the Meſſiah's kingdom, and obtain the approbation of his divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.—Beſides, in the diſplays of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found learning, by critical diſquiſitions; of great acumen, by metaphyſical ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; or of a ſparkling genius, by agreeable turns of wit. Chriſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience feel their intereſts but little concerned. The former is too obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the preacher's motives, and too jealous of his own honor, to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a procedure; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is either too ſleepy to be arouſed, or too much pained to receive relief, by thoſe means. If our Lord conſider himſelf as honored by the preacher's labours, and if the miniſter have any reaſon to expect ſucceſs, it muſt be by a faithful and ſimple promulgation of revealed truths—thoſe truths which regard ſupreme authority in the divine law, and ſaving grace in the glorious goſpel—thoſe truths, I will add, which
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023213_0049_0FBEDCBC668684B0"/>lie open to common capacities. If the conſcience receive advantage, it is by the operation of the ſame truths; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as convincing of ſin and enforcing duty, or as revealing pardon and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording peace. But the honor of Chriſt and the tranquility of conſcience are ſeldom promoted, in a public miniſtry, by the reſearches of learning, or the refinements of genius: for they are too ſacred, and too ſpiritual, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their obligations to ſuch things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, with regard to the means he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in its firſt eſtabliſhment, and thoſe he appointed for its enlargement and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi> Craft and violence, injuſtice and cruelty, have been commonly uſed in the founding, ſupporting, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſecular kingdoms. The Roman empire was founded, and grew to its height, in blood. Even the Jewiſh republic was eſtabliſhed, enlarged, and defended by force of arms. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh nations, on account of their enormous wickedneſs, were extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the ſword of Iſrael; or, if ſpared by the choſen tribes, became <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> the great Proprietor of the whole earth; and though a righteous execution of puniſhment, for acts of rebellion againſt the Eternal Sovereign; was a plain indication that, in various reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, the Iſraelitiſh church was a kingdom of this world. Such alſo was that kingdom of the Meſſiah which the carnal Jews in our Lord's time vainly expected, whenever the great promiſe made to their fathers ſhould be fulfilled: for they dreamed of being exalted to the higheſt pitch of political grandeur, and of having all the other nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their control.—The principle inſtruments employed by princes, to eſtabliſh, maintain, and extend their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, are—not perſons the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for integrity and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for piety and philanthropy; but thoſe who are moſt eminent for politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prudence, or martial bravery; for ſecret intrigue, or open hoſtility— thoſe who are beſt qualified to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade by eloquence, to circumvent by cunning, or to ſubdue by force.</p>
            <p>But the moſt illuſtrious inſtruments employed by our Anointed Prince in the erecting of his monarchy, were of a
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023213_0051_0FBEDCC50DFF38B0"/>character quite the reverſe. They were chiefly ſelected from the lower orders of life, and called from occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions eſteemed mean. Uneducated in the courts of royalty, in the ſchools of learning, or in the field of war; they were ſtrangers to the fineſſe of politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, little acquainted with Gentile phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and unpractiſed in the art of eloquence. It may be juſtly preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore, that a ſtrong degree of ruſticity appeared in their dreſs, their aſpect, and their accent: for they were apparently <hi>unlearned and unpoliſhed men.</hi> So ignorant were they of ſciences cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led liberal, ſo unpolite in their addreſs, and ſo uncanonical in their garb, that multitudes called Chriſtians, it is highly probable, would be aſhamed to give them a hearing, were they now preſent among us; unleſs the public attention were firſt excited, by the exerciſe of their miraculous powers.—Yes, by the inſtrumentality of thoſe unlettered and plain men did our Lord erect his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or eſtabliſh the goſpel church. In making war upon Satan's empire, evangelical truth and ſpiritual gifts, laborious preaching and ardent prayer, fortitude, patience, and a holy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were the arms they uſed. Such
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023213_0052_0FBEDCC61F08DAD0"/>were the militia, and ſuch the armour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In former times, the Holy Spirit fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently came upon the ſubjects of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah's government, to inſpire them with martial courage for the defence of his kingdom, and to deſtroy his enemies. Hence, among the ancient worthies, we read of thoſe who <hi>ſubdued kingdoms, waxed valiant in fight, and put to flight the armies of the aliens.</hi> But the diſciples of Chriſt being called to a different kind of conflict, divine energy is granted for a different purpoſe. The military ſervice of a Chriſtian, as, ſuch, is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſpiritual nature.

            <p>Neither the force of <hi>ſecular power,</hi> nor the arts of <hi>carnal policy,</hi> ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be uſed in promoting the cauſe of Chriſt: ſuch things being quite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent from his intention, and from the nature of his kingdom. The great deſign of our Lord in founding a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual empire was, to diſplay the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God in the holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his choſen people. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, as before obſerved, is a dominion of truth and of rectitude, of love and of peace. Now the intereſts of ſuch a monarchy, and the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by it, cannot be promoted by any other than ſpiritual means, and thoſe of divine appointment. It is only ſo far as the minds of men are enlightened by heavenly truth, their conſciences impreſſed with God's authority, and their hearts engaged on ſpiritual things, that the cauſe of Chriſt is advanced.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023213_0055_0FBEDCD16A483800"/>But in what way ſhall perſecuting force be applied, to irradiate the dark under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to arouſe the ſtupid conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſanctify the depraved heart? It is only by the fruits of an adoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for God, of ſincere love to the brethren, and of cordial good will to all mankind, that our Lord is honored, or his end anſwered, by the ſubjects of his dominion. How, then, ſhall coercive meaſures increaſe thoſe fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Or how ſhall malevolence, in any of its infernal forms, be employed to ſupport a kingdom of love and of peace.</p>
            <p>Nor are the contrivances of <hi>carnal policy</hi> leſs foreign to the nature of this kingdom, than the exertions of ſecular power. For what has the policy of princes, or of prelates, to do in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; or in extending, and empire of truth and of rectitude? Truth ſeeks no ſubterfuge, and rectitude fears no exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: but the operations of policy are ſubtle, and its firſt deſigns are latent. The policy of great men may form ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil eſtabliſhments of Chriſtianity, and adorn the exterior of public worſhip. It may dignify miniſters of the word with pompous titles, unknown to the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023213_0056_0FBEDCD311B19E08"/>New Teſtament, and inveſt them with temporal power, till their claim of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the Apoſtles becomes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon common ſenſe. Theſe and ſimilar things may be effected by it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fair pretext of rendering reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion reſpectable, and of making it more general: but the empire of Jeſus Chriſt diſdains them all, becauſe they belong to the kingdoms of this world.</p>
            <p>But though our Lord neither needs, nor accepts, the puny arts of men, to advance his cauſe and ſupport his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; yet various methods have been deviſed by accleſiaſtics, to obviate <hi>the offence of the croſs,</hi> to render themſelves reſpectable, and to promote ſomething called <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> That they might not be thought, like the Fiſhermen of Galilee, <hi>unlearned and ignorant</hi> perſons, they have eagerly ſought literary tiles, and to be called <hi>Rabbi.</hi> To adorn the miniſterial office, and to ſanction their adminiſtrations, they have been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as Jewiſh prieſts to appear in cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicals. To prevent the pride of their hearers being diſguſted, certain humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating truths have been kept out of ſight; and that the conſciences of others might not be pained, ſoftening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations

Some, of different communions, have deliberately acted as if the preacher's work were a mere trial of ſkill, and as if a pulpit were the ſtage of a harlequin.

Extravagant attitudes and quaint expreſſions, idle ſtories and ſimilies quite ludicrous, appear in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and conſtitute no ſmall part of the entertainment furniſhed by ſuch characters. But in what a ſtate muſt the conſciences of thoſe preachers be, who can deliberately and with preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023213_0062_0FBEDCDFF9ECC7F8"/>act in this manner!

               </gap>s of a mountebank; and when, if the bulk of his auditory had no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency than himſelf, there would be a burſt of laughter throughout the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? Whatever ſuch declaimers may think, where there is no ſolemnity, there is no devotion: and, we may venture to add, that a perſon habitually deſtitute of devotion in his own heart, while pretending to teach others the doctrine of Chriſt, is a wretched cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the ſight of God, and has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to tremble. Such a man ſerves not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, in ſome form or other. He may wiſh for popularity, and perhaps may,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023213_0063_0FBEDCE12A97D2E8"/>obtain it from the ignorant multitude; but people of ſenſe and of piety will conſider him as diſgracing his office, as affronting their underſtandings, and as inſulting the majeſty of that Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in which he ſtands. For where, upon earth, are we to expect ſolemnity, if not in the pulpit? There, a man ſhould be ſerious and ſolemn as death.</p>
            <p>It may perhads be ſaid; <q>This kind of trifling has its uſe. It is a mean of exciting curioſity, and of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many to hear the goſpel, who might not otherwiſe have the leaſt inclination ſo to do.</q> Such, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, is the chief reaſon by which preachers of this caſt endeavour to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſelves at the bar of their own conſciences. In anſwer to which, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of that capital ſaving, <hi>My king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world,</hi> might be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: for that muſt be a wretched cauſe, even of a ſecular kind, which needs buffoonery to ſupport it. To trifle in the ſervice of God, is to be profane. It is, therefore, an impious kind of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling: and <hi>ſhall we do evil that good may come?</hi>—Through the interference of Providence, and the ſovereign grace of God, various inſtances of enormous
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023213_0064_0FBEDCE426E0CA10"/>wickedneſs have iſſued in the higheſt good to mankind. Of this we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted evidence in the ſelling of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph by his envious brethren. We have a ſtill more ſtriking inſtance in the death of Chriſt, through the treachery of Judas and malice of the Jews. Nay, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has <hi>frequently</hi> been an occaſion of ſpreading the goſpel: yet few, I take it for granted, have perſecuted for that end, or attempted to juſtify the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice upon that principle. Were the farcical conduct, here cenſured, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, there would be reaſon to think that the cauſe of Chriſt, and the intereſts of harlequin, are very nearly allied; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame kind of means is adapted to promote them.</p>
            <p>The Seraphim, however, in Iſaiah's viſion, and the Apoſtles of Chriſt, appear to have had a very different view of the caſe. The <hi>former</hi> (who ſeem to be an emblem of apoſtolic miniſters<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid,</hi> Vitringam in loc.</note>,) are preſented to notice, as performing the ſervice of their Sublime Sovereign with profoundeſt awe. Struck with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of his appearance, and penetrated by the authority of his commands,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023213_0065_0FBEDCE6846C2BF0"/>they adore and obey with all humility, and with all ſolemnity. Agreeably to which, the <hi>latter</hi> give it as divine law, that thoſe who would perform accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worſhip, muſt do it <hi>with reverence and godly fear.</hi> This law of devotion, they further inform us, is founded in the nature of things; as appears by the reaſon aſſigned to enforce the precept, <hi>For our God is</hi> A CONSUMING FIRE.

            <p>Conformable to this idea of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime Being whom every preacher pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to ſerve, was the conduct of Paul when diſpenſing the goſpel. For, in oppoſition to ſome who <hi>handled the word of God deceitfully,</hi> to amuſe the carnal and win their affections; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, <hi>by manifeſtation of the truth,</hi> to <hi>commend himſelf to every man's conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as <hi>in the ſight of God.</hi> Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and God! What facred and ſolemn ideas! Yet Paul, as a preacher, habitually acted under their influence. That evangelical truth might be diſplay ed, that the human conſcience might be impreſſed, and that the will of God
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023213_0066_0FBEDCEAF67187D0"/>might be performed, were all included in his deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How foreign are theſe particulars from every thing of a farci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature! Nor, can any perſon who conſiders himſelf, when preaching the word, as having eternal truth for the ſubject of his diſcourſe, the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men for the objects of his regard, and the omnicient God for a witneſs of his conduct; be otherwiſe than ſolemn: for ſuch an one will ſpeak, as knowing that he <hi>muſt give an account.</hi>—When hearing a miniſter who acts in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and copies the example of Paul, we are led to reflect on that ancient oracle; <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me,</hi> to perform ſacred ſervice. But when ſitting under the effuſions of a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit buffoon, the language of an Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tyrant occurs to remembrance; <hi>Who is Jehovah, that I ſhould obey him?</hi> or what is his worſhip, that I ſhould treat it with reverence?</p>
            <p>When a ſermon was expected from Peter, by Cornelius and his friends, the centurion expreſſed himſelf thus: <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> Theſe Gentiles, it is manifeſt, were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated with devout ſolemnity, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023213_0067_0FBEDCEC6B000E80"/>filled with holy expectation. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled for carnal amuſement, but in order to know and perform the will of God; they conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as in the Divine Preſence: and ſo did their inſpired teacher. A wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy example for us to follow, when convened to preach and to hear the word of truth. But how contrary to this is that pulpit drollery, which is the object of our cenſure! For it converts the ſolemn ſervice of God (ſhocking metamorphoſis!) into carnal amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which numbers indeed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with pleaſure, but with no more devotion than if they were in a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
            <p>Is there any raeſon to be ſurpriſed that men of ſenſe, who are already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt the genuine goſpel, ſhould have their diſaffection to evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical truths increaſed, when they find thoſe truths avowed, and their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance loudly urged, by merry andrews? If, inſtead of <hi>ſound ſpeech, which cannot be condemned,</hi> they meet with extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and nonſenſe, what will thy ſay? Is there any reaſon to wonder, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels ſhould thence take occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule the Scripture, as calculated to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023213_0068_0FBEDCEDCFE0DD78"/>ſerve the meaneſt purpoſes; or that they ſhould contemptuouſly call preaching <hi>prieſt craft?</hi> If thoſe who profeſs to love revealed truths dreſs them up in a fool's coat, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of their hearers, will Deiſts forbear to laugh? If, where the <hi>man of God</hi> ſhould be heard, with all ſolemnity warning ſinners <hi>to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> and intreating them <hi>to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God;</hi> a farcical droll appear, ſpouting low wit and provoking reſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, will the Infidel ſay; <q>The preacher himſelf does not believe the Chriſtian miniſtry to be a divine appointment, nor the exerciſe of it a devotional ſervice; but he finds it convenient for ſecular purpoſes to make pretences of that kind?</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the devices of carnal policy for the ſupport and enlargement of our Lord's kingdom, there are none more contemptible, and few more deteſtable, than of converting the pulpit into a ſtage of entertainment. Of this mind was an old Nonconformiſt miniſter, when he ſaid; <q>Of all preaching in the world I hate that moſt, which has a tendency to make the hearers laugh; or to affect their minds with ſuch levity as ſtage-plays do, inſtead
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023213_0069_0FBEDCF39DA4AF20"/>of affecting them with an holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the name of God.

               <hi>The kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, in regard to the laws by which it is governed.</hi> Secular kingdoms are under the direction of human laws, which are frequently weak, partial, and unjuſt— of laws which, when leaſt imperfect, extend their obliging power no further than the exterior behaviour: for it would be vain and fooliſh in a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſovereign, to think of giving law to the thoughts, or deſires, of any ſubject. Civil penalties are the ſanction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws, and external force gives them their energy.—Not ſo the laws of this holy empire. For, proceeding from Him, in whom are <hi>are all the treaſures of knowledge,</hi> they muſt be conſumately
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023213_0070_0FBEDCF556895920"/>wiſe: being enacted by Him who is inflexibly juſt and ſupremely kind, they cannot but be perfectly good: being given by him who ſearches the heart and is Lord of conſcience, their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extends to the latent deſire, and the riſing conception. Controuling the thoughts and binding the conſcience, their ſanction is entirely ſpiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The motives enforcing obedience to them, are the ſmiles, or the frowns, of Him who has our everlaſting all at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.</p>
            <p>As is the kingdom, ſuch is the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; and as the ſovereign, ſuch are his laws. If the kingdom be <hi>of this world,</hi> it muſt have a political ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; whoſe laws muſt be coercive, and confined to exterior behaviour. But if the kingdom be of a ſpiritual kind, the ſovereign muſt be ſo too. His laws muſt extend no leſs to the conſcience, than to the converſation, and be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſanctions of a ſpiritual nature. Such is the King Meſſiah, and ſuch are the laws of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>The ſubjects of our divine Sovereign may be conſidered, either as detatched individuals, or as united in diſtinct ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:023213_0071_0FBEDCF6CFE27B88"/>and viſibly profeſſing their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his authority. Hence the execution of thoſe laws by which they are governed, comes under a twofold conſideration. <hi>As detatched individuals,</hi> the application of his laws to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, is entirely with him, and with the conſcience of each individual. <hi>As united in diſtinct ſocieties,</hi> which are called particular churches, his laws of admiſſion, of worſhip, and of excluſion, are to be applied by the community— applied, not under the influence of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motives, but under the operation of his authority, and for purpoſes entirely ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>By the laws of this kingdom, a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion of repentance and faith is required of all, previous to baptiſm. Such profeſſion being conſidered as an evidence of their <hi>fellowſhip in the goſpel,</hi> and of willing ſubjection to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſt, they are entitled to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in a particular church. On this ground they are admitted: nor do they forfeit their memberſhip, except by ſome capital departure from <hi>that</hi> goſpel, or ſome flagrant offence againſt <hi>this</hi> authority.—But as, by the laws of our heavenly Sovereign, their admiſſion
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023213_0072_0FBEDCFB21561A78"/>to viſible fellowſhip was entirely for ſpiritual purpoſes, their excluſion from it does not include temporal diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages Their ſituation as men, and as the ſubjects of a political ſtate, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered by their church-relation commencing; they ſhould not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, in thoſe reſpects, by the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that relation. For as the laws of Chriſt ſay nothing about the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of one or another, on account of his domeſtic or civil connections; nor yet for his wealth or influence, his parts or learning; ſo they are equally ſilent about pecuniary fines and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory penances, about civil diſabilities and corporal puniſhments, attending the excluſion of any offender. The former being quite foreign to qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for a ſpiritual kingdom, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be utterly abhorrent from the laws by which it is governed; being manifeſtly the inventions of Antichriſt, and the ſupporters of his cruel throne. Civil penalties, in this caſe, are adapted to generate fear, and promote hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy; to ſuppreſs truth, and render Chriſtianity itſelf ſuſpicious.</p>
            <p>

Here we perceive another diſparity between the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian church. For under the Old Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the laws of religion were ſanctified by <hi>temporal politics,</hi> and frequently thoſe of the ſevereſt kind<note n="*" place="bottom">See Exod, xii. 53, 19. xxx. 33, 38 xxxi. 14. Lev. vii. 20—27. xvii. 3—9. xix. 8. xxiii. 27, 28, 29. Numb. ix. 13. xv. 30, 31. xix. 13. with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſimilar places.</note> To be caſt out of the congregation, to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den acceſs to the ſanctuary worſhip, (except for ceremonial pollution) was to be deprived, not only of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal privileges, but alſo of civil rights. The church and the ſtate being coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and including the ſame perſons, an excluſion from the former was an expulſion from the latter; whether it was by a ſentence of capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in ſome other way. But this, like many other things, was peculiar to that Diſpenſation. It was founded in the-National form of their church-ſtate, and in their Theocracy. Thence it was that blaſphemy and idolatry were puniſhed with death, as being high-treaſon againſt their divine Sovereign. That Oeconomy being aboliſhed, the church of God has taken a new form. <hi>The prieſthood being changed, there is of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023213_0074_0FBEDCFF0ECABE40"/>neceſſity a change alſo of the law,</hi> relating to the conſtitution, members, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church. The laws of admiſſion, and of excluſion, muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be very different; as well as thoſe pertaining to public worſhip. Now, to underſtand theſe laws, we muſt ſtudy—not the Pentateuch of Moſes; much leſs the <hi>Provinciale</hi> of LYNDWOOD, or the <hi>Codex</hi> of GIBSON, but—the New Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt. To reaſon from the conſtitution and form, the laws and government, the privileges and rites of the Jewiſh, to thoſe of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church; is to adopt a capital principle of Papal depravity, and groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to corrupt our holy religion.</p>
            <p>Our divine Sovereign has alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the edification of his loyal ſubjects, by ordinances and rites of worſhip, no leſs than for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his kingdom. As King of the Chriſtian church, it conſtitutes a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed part of his royal prerogative, to preſcribe the whole of that ſpiritual ſervice which is to be performed. Of this prerogative Jehovah was always jealous: nor, under the former Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, did he ever more inſtantly, or more ſeverely puniſh, than when his
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023213_0075_0FBEDD008E486EE0"/>orders about the affairs of religion were diſregarded; even though, as in the caſe of Uzzah, the motive appeared laudable.—What is religion, in its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious branches, but that obedience which is due to God? And what is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but ſubmiſſion to his authority? Now, as authority exerts itſelf in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, there cannot be obedience, there cannot be holy worſhip, where there is no divine command, either explicit or implicit. <hi>Who hath required this at your hands? In vain do ye worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</hi>—exclude and condemn a great number of things, which millions eſteem ornamental and uſeful in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Strange, that any Proteſtant church ſhould avowedly claim a <q>power to decree rites or ceremonies</q> in the ſolemn ſervice of our divine Lord! As if he were not the legiſlator in his own kingdom! Or as if, though poſſeſſed of authority, he had not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enough to provide for his own honor; or were defective in goodneſs, reſpecting his faithful ſubjects! But whatever the compilers and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers of a National Creed may
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023213_0076_0FBEDD06D371A170"/>think, to perform rites which Chriſt did not appoint, and to alter thoſe which he enjoined, are vile impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his royal character, and muſt expoſe to his reſentment. The former uſurps his throne: the latter annuls his laws.—<hi>Strange,</hi> did I ſay? the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion muſt be recalled. For there is no reaſon to wonder that a National reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhment, with a political ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign for its head, ſhould make the claim I have juſt mentioned. Who can doubt whether the ſame authority which conſtitutes, governs, and ſupports a community for any particular purpoſe, may not preſcribe to that community with a view to the end intended by it? But things ſhould not be called by wrong names; and to denominate ſuch an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment <hi>a church of Chriſt,</hi> is a groſs miſnomer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The kingdom of Chriſt is not like the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of this world, in regard to external ſplendor.</hi> The grandeur of a temporal kingdom chiefly conſiſts, in the number and affluence of its nobility, the titles and pompous appearance of its various magiſtrates, the flouriſhing ſtate of its trade and commerce, the wealth of its
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023213_0077_0FBEDD0816DF1E28"/>yeomanry, and the elegance of its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buildings. Magnificent palaces and royal robes are quite in character for ſecular princes. Enſigns of honor, ſplendid equipages, and ſtately manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are ſuitable to the nobles: while a more ſolemn kind of exterior pomp is very becoming the miniſters of public juſtice. Theſe and ſimilar things give an air of dignity, and of importance, to political ſovereignties: but they are all foreign to the kingdom of Chriſt, the glory of which is entirely ſpiritual—The Chriſtian Church is dignified and adorned, by being the depoſitary of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth in its unadulterated ſtate, and by practiſing divine appointments in their primitive purity; by poſſeſſing the beauties of holineſs, and by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſence of God. Such is the true glory of our Lord's kingdom, which renders it incomparably ſuperior to every temporal monarchy.</p>
            <p>It muſt therefore be very abſurd to think of doing honor to Chriſtianity, by erecting <hi>pompous places</hi> of worſhip, by <hi>conſecrating</hi> thoſe places, and by adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mith <hi>ſhowy veſtments,</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of public worſhip. Let the galaces of princes, and the manſions of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023213_0078_0FBEDD098E3F7218"/>the mighty, be magnificent and richly ornamented; let the nobles and judges of the land, when acting agreeably to their different characters, appear in robes of ſtate and in robes of magiſtracy; as thoſe things belong to the kingdoms <hi>of this world,</hi> nor pretend to any thing more, there is nothing amiſs, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſtation or profeſſion. But confine them there, and by no means think of decorating the kingdom, or of promoting the cauſe of Chriſt, by any thing ſimilar. Were any man to lacker gold, and paint the diamond, to increaſe their luſtre, he would certainly be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as inſane Yet the conduct of thoſe perſons is more abſurd, who borrow the trappings of ſecular kingdoms, to adorn the ſpiritual kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>places of worſhip,</hi> conveniency is all that is wanted, and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſimplicity of Chriſtianity.

In regard to <hi>miniſters,</hi> when attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any branch of their holy functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them not think of heightening their own importance, or of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cauſe of Chriſt, by imitating Jewiſh or pagan prieſts, adorned with peculiar habits, when performing their different rites.

It may, perhaps, be ſaid, <q>Clerical habits are indifferent and harmleſs things, except when they are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</q> But if ſo, the idea of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being excluded, the canonical dreſs of a Popiſh prieſt, the red hat of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and the triple crown of a pontiff, may all be juſtified: for, in themſelves, they are equally harmleſs as the gown, the ſurplice, or the band. Innocent, however, as all theſe peculiarities are, detached from the miniſterial charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and from holy worſhip; the <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>motive</hi> of wearing them in ſacred ſervice, may be carnal, baſe, and ſinful. In ſome, there is too much ground of ſuſpicion, a deſire of being eſteemed by the vulgar, either as perſons of learning, or as epiſcopally ordained, when they are not ſo; and, in others, a luſt of increaſing their learned and prieſtly importance, are the latent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of wearing thoſe idle badges of clerical diſtinction. But when illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men aſſume the garb of learning, their vanity is contemptible: when they intend, by ſo doing, to obtain that reſpect from the ignorant, of which they know themſelves unworthy, their practical falſehood is deteſtable: and when any miniſter thinks of magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023213_0082_0FBEDD13AE2DDE70"/>his office, by pompoſity in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, he betrays his ignorance relating to the nature of that kingdom in which he profeſſes to be an officer.—Do the laws of this holy empire forbid the ſubjects to affect ſhining and coſtly apparel, as not becoming thoſe who <hi>profeſs godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

Is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that ſpiritual minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which every avowed diſciple of Chriſt makes an implicit profeſſion, to be fond of a ſhowy dreſs in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of common life; and can it be ſuitable to the ſimplicity of Chriſtian worſhip, to the character of its Lord, or to the example of his Apoſtles, for miniſters to make a more grand appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and take more ſtate upon them, when performing their ſolemn ſervice, than at any other time? Let theſe who underſtand the Chriſtian ſyſtem, and are heavenly minded, form the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It muſt indeed be acknowledged, that the ancient people of God had a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſanctuary, and a ſumptuous temple;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023213_0083_0FBEDD15B097E160"/>that the Jewiſh prieſts, when perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacred ſervice, apeared in holy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that the high prieſt, on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſions, was richly adorned, in a manner peculiar to his office. But then it is plain, that thoſe things were expreſsly appointed by Jehovah; that the Diſpenſation to which they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was of a typical nature; that they were ſuited to the church while in a ſtate of minority; that the whole Jewiſh nation was then the viſible church; that Jehovah was not only the God, but alſo the King of that nation; that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſanctuary was a palace, where po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical royalty reſided<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. v. 35.</note>, as well as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where Deity was adored; and that the prieſts were officers in the ſtate, as well as miniſters of religion. To ſuch a politico-eccleſiaſtical kingdom the ſplendor of the ſanctuary, and the dreſs of the prieſts, were manifeſtly adapted. Hence the tabernacle is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a worldly ſanctuary,</hi> and the rites performed there <hi>elements of the world</hi>

            <p>What, then, have the ſplendor, the laws, or the rites of Judaiſm, to do in the New Oeconomy; except we mean to convert the Chriſtian church into the Jewiſh temple? Grandeur and ſhow, whether as pertaining to places of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or to miniſters of the word, are abhorrent from the Goſpel Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor, under the preſent Oeconomy, have they any other tendency, than to gratify that pride from which they ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate, and to give the kingdom of Chriſt a ſecular appearance.—The New Oeconomy being intended for all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and all ſucceeding ages, is equally fitted for the rich and the poor: nor does it make any diſtinction, in regard to places, where its worſhip ſhould be performed. That God be adored <hi>in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> according to his own rule, is all it requires or one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023213_0085_0FBEDD1B98B69D48"/>or of another. It diſdains, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to borrow any part of its glory, from the grandeur of an edifice, or from the garb of a miniſter. Though far from ſuppoſing ruſticity, illiteracy, and meanneſs, to be characteriſtics of a Goſpel church; yet I may venture to aſſert, that an aſſembly of princes in a ſplendid cathedral, with an archprelate appearing in canonical pomp, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Divine Majeſty, and be utterly unworthy the name of a church; while a congregation of day-labourers, with an illiterate miniſter in the meaneſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, convened in a barn, may be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual temple, enjoy the Divine Preſence, and perform the Chriſtian worſhip in all its glory.—It has been well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by a certain author, that <q>the preſence of God confers dignity and importance:</q> but that <q>he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none from created, much leſs from artificial pomp and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</q> To which I will add, in the words of Dr. OWEN; <q>If the whole ſtructure of the temple, and all its beautiful ſervices, were now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the earth, no glory would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto God thereby: he would receive none from it. To expect the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023213_0086_0FBEDD1D0E601590"/>glory of God in them, would be an high diſhonor unto him<note n="*" place="bottom">On the Perſon of Chriſt, <hi>p. 354, 355.</hi>

            <p>If ſecular grandeur, however, muſt needs attend the religion of Him who was born in a ſtable, and lived in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who received the acclamations of royalty, when riding upon an aſs, and quickly after expired on a croſs;—if, I ſay, it <hi>muſt</hi> appear in the worſhip of any who pretend to follow the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Galilee, thoſe prime miniſters in the Meſſiah's kingdom, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſuch as avow themſelves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a National eſtabliſhment. For, with regard to thoſe who maintain that particular churches are Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, conſiſting of ſuch as make a credible profeſſion of repentance and faith; pomp and ſhow in the worſhip of God are quite unbecoming their principles. Yes, let thoſe monopolize the ſplendor in queſtion, who conſider the church and the ſtate as of equal dimenſions; who acknowledge a viſible head of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical royalty; and who muſt ſearch, not the New Teſtament, but a code of Canons and Conſtitutions larger than

Why ſhould not anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Judaiſm be imitated in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as well as in other things? As the head of the Engliſh Church is adorned with royal robes; as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple officers in it are appointed by him, and are Lords in the legiſlature; and as it is eſtabliſhed by laws of the ſtate, who ſhall forbid the various orders of its miniſters being adorned with ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles, and with pompous canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals?

            <p>Whereas, the immunities, emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and honors of our Lord's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are all of them ſpiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. They are ſuited to the ſtate of

Pardon of all ſin, and complete acceptance with God; adoption into the heavenly family, and a title of future glory, are ſome of the privileges and honors enjoyed by the ſubjects of this kingdom. Bleſſings, theſe, of infinite worth, becauſe of their ſpiritual nature and immortal duration. Nor are they confined to a few diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed favourites of our celeſtial So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; for they are common to all his real ſubjects.

            </p>
            <p>Now, as the immunities, grants, and honors, beſtowed by the King Meſſiah, are all of a ſpiritual nature; his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjects have no reaſon to wonder, or to be diſcouraged, at any perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, afflictions, or poverty which may befal them. Were his empire <hi>of this world,</hi> then indeed it might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the goodneſs of his heart and the power of his arm, that thoſe who are ſubmiſſive to his authority, zealous for his honor, and conformed to his image, would commonly find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſy and proſperous in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

When the rulers and the people in general were punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in obſerving Jehovah's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſtipulations of the Sinai Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſecured them from being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by their enemies, and from any remarkable affliction by the immediate hand of God. Performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their National Confederation, they were, as a people, warranted to expect every ſpecies of temporal proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.

In this reſpect, however, as well as in other things, there is a vaſt difference between the Jewiſh, and the Chriſtian Oeconomy. This diſparity was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated, if I miſtake not, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite modes of divine proceeding, in eſtabliſhing Jehovah's kingdom among the Jews, and in founding the empire of Jeſus Chriſt. To ſettle the Iſraelitiſh church, to exalt the choſen tribes above ſurrounding nations, and to render the ancient Theocracy ſupremely venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the divine Sovereign appeared in terrible majeſty. Waſting plagues and awful deaths were often inflicted by eternal juſtice, on thoſe who dared to oppoſe, or to oppreſs, the people of God. An angel was commiſſioned to deſtroy the Egyptian firſt-born; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, with his mighty hoſt, were drowned in the Red ſea; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh nations were put to the ſword,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023213_0101_0FBEBD9250BFD780"/>that the ſubjects of Jehovah might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their fertile country. Manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications theſe, in connection with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs promiſes, that the ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God would exalt and bleſs the natural ſeed of Abraham with temporal felicity; provided they did not violate the Sinai Covenant.</p>
            <p>But when the Prince Meſſiah found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his kingdom, all things were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. No marks of external grandeur attendeded his perſonal appearance: and, inſtead of executing righteous vengeance on thoſe who oppoſed him, his language was; <hi>The Son of man is not come to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them. Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!</hi>—After a life of labour and of beneficence, of poverty and of reproach, he fell a victim to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and a martyr to-truth. Such was the plan of divine Providence, reſpecting Chriſt our King, and ſuch was the treatment with which he met from the world! Striking intimations, theſe, that his moſt faithful ſubjects would have no ground of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any ſufferings which might a wait them; and that, conſidered as his dependants, ſpiritual bleſſings were all they ſhould have to expect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:023213_0102_0FBEDA6B8882D540"/>
It muſt indeed be acknowledge, that as vicious tempers and immoral prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices have a natural tendency to impair health, diſtreſs the mind, and waſte the property; ſo the exerciſe of holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the practice of true godlineſs, have the moſt friendly aſpect on a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's own temporal happineſs, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo far as perſecution intervenes) and on the welfare of ſociety. But then it is evident that this ariſes from the nature of things, and from the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of common Providence; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than from the dominion of Chriſt, as a ſpiritual monarch. For, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ſpiritual bleſſings are all that they have to expect from his royal hand.</p>
            <p>By the prophetic declarations of our Lord himſelf, and by the hiſtory of this kingdom, it plainly appears, that among all the ſubjects of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, none have been more expoſed to perſecution, affliction, and poverty, than thoſe who were moſt eminent for obedience to his laws, and moſt uſeful in his empire. The moſt uniform ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his authority, and the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt zeal for his honor, that ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon earth; were no ſecurity from bitter perſecution, from pinching po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023213_0103_0FBEDA6CE200E908"/>or from complicated affliction. Our divine Lord, conſidered as a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſovereign, is concerned for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual intereſts of thoſe that are under his government. His perſonal perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and royal prorogatives, his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom, his love and care, are therefore to be regarded as engaged, both by office and by promiſe,—not to make his dependants eaſy and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their temporal concerns; but— to ſtrengthen them for their ſpiritual warfare; to preſerve them from final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falling by their invible enemies; to make all afflictions <hi>work together for their good;</hi> to render them, in the final iſſue, <hi>more than conquerors</hi> over every oppoſer; and to crown them with everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Our Lord has promiſed, indeed, that their obedience to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s royal pleaſure, ſhall meet with his gracious regards in the preſent life.

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023213_0104_0FBEDA6F8D818118"/>and to provide for ſpiritual wants; to indulge with ſpiritual riches, and to ennoble with ſpiritual honors, are thoſe royal acts which belong to Him, whoſe <hi>kingdom is not of this world.</hi> In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of theſe bleſſings, the glory of his regal character is much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But millions of his devoted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may fall by the iron hand of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſtarve in obſcurity, or ſuffer accumulated affliction in other ways; without the leaſt impeachment of his power, his goodneſs, or his care, as the ſovereign of a ſpiritual kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The kingdom of Chriſt is not like the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of ſecular princes, with regard to its limits and its duration.</hi> The widely extended monarchies of antiquity were confined to certain parts of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble globe, and in the courſe of a few centuries they came to an end. Not ſo, the empire of Jeſus Chriſt: for thus run the prophetic oracles, reſpecting him and his kingdom. <hi>He ſhall have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

            <p>As Chriſt is a ſpiritual monarch, his dominion reſpects the underſtandings, the conſciences, the hearts of men;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:023213_0107_0FBEDA79F60B20F8"/>and is a preparation for that ſublime ſtate, where knowledge and rectitude, where obedience and love, where har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and joy, are all in their full glory. The foundation of this government, as it reſpects individuals, is laid in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. There the preparation for heaven begins: and all the genuine fruits of that important change, which is made by divine influence, in the mind, conſcience, and heart of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, have a tendency toward heaven; and many of them are anticipations of it. That worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is performed by the ſubjects of Chriſt, is no further ſpiritual, and agreeable to the New Oeconomy, than it is animated with ſuch affections as abound in heaven.

It is manifeſt from this characteriſtic of our Lord's kingdom, that a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of allegiance to him is entirely vain, not attended with <hi>ſpiritual mindedneſs:</hi> becauſe it is natural for good ſubjects to ſeek the proſperity of that kingdom to which they belong.

In the ſpread of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical truth, and the purity of divine worſhip; in the exerciſe of love, and the practice of holineſs, the intereſts and honor of this kingdom chiefly conſiſt. Indifference about theſe, is an evidence of the heart being diſaffected to our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sovereign; but allegiance to him, will manifeſt itſelf by an habitual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them.—In whomſoever this holy Monarch reigns, there is a reliſh for ſpiritual riches, honors, pleaſures. To enjoy his favor, and bear his image; to perform his will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory, are things of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance in the eſteem of real ſaints.

It is common for ſubjects to imitate a ſovereign whom they love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; eſpeceially, if they have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſignal benefits from his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now ſuch is the nature of our Lord's government, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any one to be under it, without ſincerely loving and profoundly rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him—without ſeeing an excellence in his example, which commands eſteem and excites imitation. But if we be fond of wealth, or emulous of grandeur and ſhow; if we purſue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, and graſp at power; we imitate the children of this world, not Jeſus Chriſt. Thoſe things are eagerly ſought, and highly prized, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Satan, becauſe they are carnally minded; but he is unworthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a diſciple of Chriſt, who is not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually ſtriving to copy his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>It has been juſtly remarked by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain author, <q>That the Legal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy introduced that of Grace, by the goſpel, and then vaniſhed away, The Diſpenſation of Grace, in like manner, is now performing its work, fulfilling its day, announcing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, introducing the kingdom of glory: and <hi>when that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

Thoſe, being typical and ſhadowy, led to theſe, and in them received their final completion. But the New Diſpenſation, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, have no completion ſhort of heaven. Thither they lead, and there they terminate. No wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is agreeable to the Meſſiah's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is not animated by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affections. All the external ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of religion are only ſo many means of exciting thoſe holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of promoting communion with God, and of cultivating a heavenly temper. Conſequently, the worſhip of thoſe who reſt in exterior ſervices, is quite ſuperficial, and has nothing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, nothing heavenly in it.</p>
            <p>Jehovah, under the former Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having choſen the Holy of holies for the place of his reſidence, the Jews were directed to addreſs him in prayer, conſidered as on his throne <hi>between the

               <q>God, ſays Dr ERSKINE, as huſband of the the Goſpel church, claims from his people inward affection and love, and accepts them only who
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:023213_0113_0FBEDA84D5FD3620"/>worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. In the moſaic covenant it was otherwiſe. There he appeared chiefly as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral prince, and therefore gave laws intended rather to direct the outward conduct, than to regulate the actings of the heart. Hence every thing in that Diſpenſation was adapted to ſtrike his ſubjects with awe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. The magnificence of his palace, and all its utenſils; his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous train of attendants; the ſplendid robes of the high-prieſt, who, though his prime miniſter, was not allowed to enter the Holy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſave once a year, and, in all his miniſtrations, was obliged to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the moſt humble veneration for Iſrael's King; the ſolemn rites with which the prieſts were conſecrated; the ſtrictneſs with which all impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and indecencies were forbidden, as things which, though tolerable in others, were unbecoming the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the people of God, eſpecially when approaching to him: all theſe tended to promote and ſecure the reſpect due to their glorious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</q>— It was, however, foretold, by one of the minor Prophets, <q>that in Goſpel times, men ſhould not call

            <p>Yes, under the Moſaic ſyſtem, the high prieſt only, and he but once in a year, was admitted to the mercy ſeat, or throne of Jehovah, in <hi>a worldly ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary.</hi> That appearance of the Jewiſh pontiff before the Lord, though grand and ſolemn, was a mere emblem of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, and of that holy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which all the ſubjects of this kingdom have with God, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſpiritual worſhip.

            <p>The ſuperior advantages of believers under the Chriſtian Oeconomy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to communion with God, and the ſanctifying influence which that holy intercourſe has on their minds, are ſtrongly expreſſed in the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

The Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle here plainly alludes to that glory which appeared in the face of Moſes, after his intimate converſe with Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah on the mount. So dazzling was the luſtre of his countenance, that the children of Iſrael <hi>were afraid to come nigh him.</hi> He therefore put a veil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his face, that they might have fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intercourſe with him<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 29.35.</note>: which veil was an emblem, not only of the Jewiſh blindedneſs, but alſo of the darkneſs of that Diſpenſation.—Now, in contraſt with theſe things, Paul informs us, that the glory of the divine perfections ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and ſhines in the <hi>unveiled</hi> face of Jeſus Chriſt; that this glory is <hi>beheld</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:023213_0117_0FBEDA8F24971890"/>by New Teſtament believers; and that, by beholding it, they are gradually <hi>transformed into the glorious image of God.</hi> What an illuſtrious view does the Apoſtle here give us of the New Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy! He not only repreſents the ſtate and privileges of the Goſpel Church, as greatly ſuperior to thoſe of the Jewiſh people; but as nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the employments, and the fruitions of the celeſtial world. For we cannot eaſily form a more exalted idea of the buſineſs and bleſſedneſs of heaven, than that of contemplating the glory of God, and of making continual advances in likeneſs to him.</p>
            <p>As, in the perſon of our Mediator, the nature of God and the nature of man were not united, till juſt before the commencement of this kingdom; as God was not <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> but with an immediate view to this holy and ſpiritual empire; ſo there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to wonder that the favored ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Meſſiah's government have a more intimate communion with Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, than was ever enjoyed by the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church. Under the Old Covenant, Iſrael in general had a kind of local nearneſs to God, in the performance of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023213_0118_0FBEDA90A5139F78"/>religious worſhip; and real ſaints had ſpiritual communion with him. But then it was by means of prieſts, who had infirmities; of ſacrifices, that were imperfect; and of ſervices, that were mere ſhadows of heavenly things: all which were confined to an earthly ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary. Whereas the ſubjects of Jeſus Chriſt have acceſs to the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, without regarding any prieſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Sovereign; any ſacrifice, beſides his death; any incenſe, beſides his interceſſion. All theſe they regard as appearing, as operating, as efficacious on their behalf, in the heavenly ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. Yes, their High-prieſt, who is of infinite dignity, their ſacrifice, which is of boundleſs worth; and their incenſe, which is conſummately fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, are for ever in the immediate preſence of God—for ever deſerving, and for ever obtaining the divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. On theſe, therefore, in all their approaches to Eternal Majeſty, their dependence fixes Hence their worſhip is performed, through the aids of grace, with reverence and with confidence, with love and with delight. <hi>We have acceſs with confidence, by the faith of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:023213_0119_0FBEDA952C68C258"/>
Now, to worſhip God with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence, yet without a ſlaviſh fear; with ſteady confidence, connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deep humility; with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his will, as the moſt high Lord; with love to his excellence, as the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite beauty; and with joy in his all-ſufficiency, as the Chief Good; is to perform a ſpiritual ſervice, and to adore in a heavenly manner. In the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch worſhip, we have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect</hi>—we enter within the veil—we have fellowſhip with God—we antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the buſineſs of heaven, and taſte its refined pleaſures. In theſe holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the mind, conſcience, and heart, we feel ourſelves near to God, as the fountain of all bleſſedneſs, and are trained for the heavenly world. Thus we are habituated to a kind of celeſtial ſervice, by which our likeneſs to Chriſt is promoted, and our deſires after heaven increaſed. In theſe things the very life of ſpiritual worſhip and of real religion conſiſts. He therefore is not worthy to be called a ſubject of our Lord's kingdom, who is not habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually aiming in his devotional ſervices, at his delightful and ſolemn intercourſe with God. Nor is he deſerving of that
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:023213_0120_0FBEDA9768947550"/>exalted character, whoſe thoughts and cares, whoſe hopes and fears, whoſe joys and ſorrows, are not principally concerned about the government and grace of Chriſt, conſidered in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the heavenly ſtate.</p>
            <p>It muſt, indeed, be admitted, that this communion with heaven is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely imperfect in the preſent life. Becauſe, though every true ſubject of the King Meſſiah be in a ſtate very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of a merely nominal Chriſtian, and though he is thankful for that difference; yet he is not, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied, either with what he knows, or with what he enjoys; with what he is, or with what he does. Not with what he <hi>knows:</hi> for he knows but <hi>in part,</hi> and he feels the deficiency. His acquaintance with the Greateſt and Beſt of beings—with the character and perfections, with the works and ways of God, is extremely ſmall. His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the adorable Jeſus—of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and offices, of his grace and work, of his kingdom and glory, is ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Nay, the knowledge he has of himſelf, and of his final deſtination in the heavenly world, is exceedingly
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:023213_0121_0FBEDA990B4A0B90"/>ſcanty: for <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things;</hi> and <hi>it does not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> He cannot therefore be contented with ſuch a pittance of ſpiritual knowledge.</p>
            <p>Not with what he <hi>enjoys:</hi> for his enjoyment of ſpiritual pleaſure is, at the higheſt, comparatively low. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is frequently interrupted by the inſurrections of indwelling ſin, and by the incurſions of outward temptation. Though he ſometimes exults in the light of God's countenance, partaking of joy that is <hi>unſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> yet he frequently mourns the want of that exalted pleaſure, and <hi>groans being burdened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not with what he <hi>is:</hi> for he feels much depravity, and laments over it, as affecting his mind with darkneſs; his conſcience with guilt, or with ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and his paſſions with carnality. So far from perfectly bearing the image of Chriſt, that his language frequently is; <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not with what he <hi>does:</hi> for though he ſincerely deſires to perform the will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as revealed in divine precepts,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023213_0122_0FBEDA9A61664718"/>and illuſtrated by the example of Chriſt; yet he perceives that his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is very imperfect. Does he, for inſtance, addreſs himſelf to God in prayer? in that devout exerciſe his whole ſoul ſhould be engaged. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the divine Majeſty, and an abaſing ſenſe of his own guilt; ſaith in the great atonement, and confidence in paternal mercy; the ardour of petition, and the comfort of expectation, ſhould be all united. But frequently, alas! his thoughts wander, and his pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are dull, if not dormant. His prayer ſeems little beſides a conflict with his own corruption. He riſes from his knees with ſorrow and with ſighs. Aſhamed of the manner in which he has treated the omniſcient Object of his worſhip, he cannot for bear exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner!</hi> and this, perhaps, is the only petition over which he does not mourn, as deſtitute of holy animation.—Or if he enjoy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in his converſe with the Father of all mercies, how often does he find ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride, and ſelf-gratulation, ariſe in his heart? as if the Moſt Holy would regard his confeſſions, petitions, and thankſgivings for the ſake of their own excellence! Aware of the latent poiſon,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023213_0123_0FBEDA9D637FA968"/>he is almoſt confounded. For well he knows, that Chriſtianity is the religion of ſinners—of depraved, of guilty, of unworthy creatures: and that nothing is more inconſiſtent with evangelical truth, or more deteſtable in the ſight of our Maker, than ſelf-applauſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceptance with God. Knowing himſelf to be a polluted worm that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to periſh, he trembles to think of ever ſuppoſing that the majeſty of the Moſt High, and the purity of the Moſt Holy, will accept his imperfect ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their own ſake. In the moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical manner he, therefore, with Job exclaims; <hi>Behold, I am vile!—I abhor myſelf!</hi> So various and ſo great are the defects in our devotional ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that we might well deſpair, were it not for a High-prieſt who bears the iniquity of our <hi>holy things.</hi> For we <hi>find a law, that when we would do good, evil is preſent with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuch imperfections and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, is a real ſubject of our Lord's dominion liable in the preſent life. But, looking forward to the ſeparate ſtate, when he ſhall <hi>be with Chriſt, which is far better,</hi> and to the reſurrection of the righteous; with joy he adopts the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023213_0124_0FBEDA9E1AAE3B10"/>language of David and ſays, <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied, when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> Yes, when that ultimate and everlaſting Oeconomy commences, his mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all irradiated with divine truth, he ſhall be ſatisfied with what he <hi>knows:</hi> perfectly poſſeſſing the Chief Good, he ſhall be ſatisfied with what he <hi>enjoys;</hi> conſcious of complete rectitude, he ſhall be ſatisfied with what he <hi>is:</hi> and knowing his obedience to be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, he ſhall be ſatisfied with what he <hi>does.</hi>—Delightful, raviſhing thought! To have all our immortal powers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded and filled, with knowledge of the Supreme truth, and with love to the Supreme Beauty; with reverence of the Supreme Lord, and with delight in the Supreme Good, muſt conſtitute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete happineſs. Yet ſuch is the grand reſult of our Lord's dominion in the hearts of men! To this, therefore, we muſt look, upon this our affections muſt be placed, if we would behave as the ſubjects of Jeſus Chriſt, and finiſh our courſe with honor.

            <p>It is one of the nobleſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful employments of the human mind, to contemplate the gradual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jehovah's will, and the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſplay of his eternal favor, from the fall of our firſt parents, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the divine Oeconomy. It is both pleaſing and improving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Patriarchal Diſpenſation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Moſaic Syſtem; on the Sinai Confederation making way for the New Covenant; on the Jewiſh Theocracy leading to the Kingdom of Chriſt; on the government of that kingdom as a preparation for celeſtial manſions; on the performance of holy worſhip, by the ſubjects of Chriſt here, as the mean of communion with <hi>ſaints in light;</hi> and on the preſent ſtate of worſhip and of bleſſedneſs in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſanctuary, as preparing for the ultimate glory.</p>
            <p>In reference to the communion of believers with <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023213_0126_0FBEDAA445B038F8"/>perfect,</hi> in the performance of ſpiritual worſhip; and reſpecting the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all things, Dr. OWEN ſpeaks as follows, with whoſe words I ſhall conclude. <q>Were all that die in the Lord immediately received into that ſtate wherein <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> without any uſe of the mediation of Chriſt, or the worſhip of praiſe and honor unto God by him, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exerciſed in the aſcription of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, glory, power and dominion unto [Chriſt,] on the account of the paſt and preſent diſcharge of his office; there could be no communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us. But whilſt they are in the <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> in <hi>the temple of God,</hi> in the holy worſhip of Chriſt, and of God in him, and we are not only employed in the ſame work in ſacred ordinances ſuited unto our ſtate and condition, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our duties do by faith <hi>enter in within the veil,</hi> and approach unto the ſame throne of grace in the moſt holy place; there is a ſpiritual communion between them and us.
