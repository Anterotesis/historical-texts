            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>By His Excellency <hi>Benjamin Fletcher,</hi> Captain General and Governor in Chief of Their Majesties Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> Province of Pennsilvania, Country of <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and the Territories and Tracts of Land depending thereon in <hi>America,</hi> and Vice-Admiral of the same, Their Majesties Lieutenant and Commander in Chief of the Militia, &amp; of all the Forces by Sea and Land within Their Majesties Collony of Connecticut, and of all the Forts and places of Strength within the same.</head>
            <head>A PROCLAMATION</head>
            <p>WHereas by Proclamation given forth at <hi>Hartford</hi> the 28 day of <hi>October</hi> last past, I did think fit to signifie unto all Their Majesties good Subjects within their Majesties Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> That their Most Excellent Majesties, <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Grace of God, of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> KING and QUEEN, Defendors of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were graciously pleased, by their Royal Commission under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to constitute and appoint me <hi>Benjamin Fletcher,</hi> Captain General and Governour of <hi>New-York, &amp;c.</hi> Their Lieutenant and Commander in Chief of the Militia the said Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> Not only for the assorting of Their Inherent Right and Royal <hi>P</hi>rerogative, but also of their special Grace and tender Care they had for the Security and Defence of Their good Subjects in the same; and that pursuant thereunto, out of the true and tender Regard I had for the Peace of the said Collony, and better satisfaction of all their Majesties good Subjects therein, as for the due Execution of the said Commission, I did with all convenient speed hasten unto the said Town of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and did then apply my self unto the General Assembly there sitting (the present Administrators of the Government) and in the said Assembly caused my said Commission to be publickly read, and left with them a Memorial <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Writing of my Expectation of their ready Submission to Their Majesties Lawful Commission. And for the more speedy and effectual Execution of the same (besides the allowance of a sufficient Time for their Deliberation) I did likewise offer to commissionate all the late Commission-Officers, and to be advised by them in appointing others, to supply the vacancy of officers; and particularly caused a Commission to be tendered to Coll. <hi>Robert Treat</hi> for the Command of all the Militia of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Collony. I did then also assure them, That I had neither <hi>P</hi>ower nor Intention to invade any of their Civil Rights, only requiring Obedience to their Majesties Commission, whereby the Power of the Militia may be acknowledged to be (as it is a Royal Right, inherent to, and inseperable from the Crown. Whereby I did expect, as well as require, That the said General Assembly would have render <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Obedience accordingly: But in leiu thereof they positively refused to yeild Obedience unto their Majesties Royal Commission aforesaid. Whereupon, for the further satisfaction of their Majesties good Subjects in the said Collony, I did by the said Proclamation further declare, That Their Majesties Commission was Absolute and Indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, and was a Command, not only to me to Execute, but all their Majesties Subjects in the said Collony to Obey; and that the same did make Null and Void all former Military Commissions; and that it was not in my Power to suspend or delay the Execution of it, nor the Default, or any other Inconveniencies that may happen thereby, be by any means justified. And did then declare my Resolution, in obedience to Their Majesties Royal Command, forthwith to put the said Commission in Execution; and did, by the said Proclamation, in Their Majesties Name straitly forbid all Persons whatsoever, to execute or obey any former Military Commissions, or to levy any Men and Arms, otherwise than in pursuance of Their Majesties said Commission to me granted, and published in the General Assembly of the said Collony, as aforesaid; and did require, That all Their Majesties loving Subjects in the said Collony, upon their Allegiance would yeild their due Obedience to Their Majesties said Commission of Lieutenancy, and be aiding and assisting to me in the Execution of the same accordingly, as they would answer the contrary at their utmost Peril.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as in my Return through the said Collony, unto the Charge of my Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> I found that the said <hi>P</hi>roclamation had not been duely published and made known unto the respective Towns and Inhabitants of the said Collony, as their Majesties Service, and the true Intent of their Majesties said Commission did of necessity require. And being likewise informed, That by the specious Pretences of Ill Designing Men, not well affected unto Their Most Sacred Majesties, and Their Royal Dignity and Crown of <hi>England, &amp;c,</hi> many of Their Majesties loving Subjects within the said Collony are deluded, inveigled and drawn away from their Duty and Allegiance, as aforesaid, whereby the Peace, as well as Safety of the Collony is very much endangered. For prevention of such Insinuations, as well as for the better Direction of their Majesties good Subjects, and that the Ill Consequencies that must attend such Disobedience, may be avoided, I have thought fit further to Publish and Declare unto all Their Majesties loving Subjects, as aforesaid, That as it hath been Their Majesties most Gracious <hi>P</hi>leasure, out of Their tender Love and Care that they have for the Preservation and Good of Their Subjects in the said Collony, in this Time of Actual War, to invest me with the Powers and Authorities in the said Royal Commission contained. That pursuant thereunto, I do again strictly Charge, Require and Command all Their Majesties loving Subjects, residing, or any other Person or Persons that take upon them the Administration of the Laws, or Conservation of the Peace within Their Majesties said Collony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> That fortwith upon the Publication and Receipt hereof, they do yeild and render an intire Obedience unto Their Majesties most Gracious Commission, as aforesaid, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, as they will answer the Contempt of the contrary hereof at their Perils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Given under my Hand and Seal at Arms, at</hi> Fort William Henry <hi>the Eight Day of November,</hi> 1693. <hi>And in the Fifth Year of Their Majesties Reign.</hi>
