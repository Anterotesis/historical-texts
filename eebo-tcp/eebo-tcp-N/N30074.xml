            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE CLERGY of <hi>MARYLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT appears from the Charter of <hi>Maryland,</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of that Grant, was to promote the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion in that Province:
For in the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is ſaid, <q>That the Proprietor was excited by a laudable and pious Zeal, for the Propagation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith;</q>
which muſt be underſtood of the Faith as profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the ſame Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lays him under an Obligation,
<q>to cauſe all Churches, Chappels and Oratories, to be dedicated and conſecrated according to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo it happened, that no Attempt was made for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a Proteſtant Church or Clergy in that Province, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Government thereof devolved into the Hands of the Crown, upon the happy Revolution under the glorious Reign of his Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> III. At which time ſome Acts of Aſſembly were propoſed and paſſed, for ſettling the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> amongſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Proteſtant Subjects in that Colony; but by Reaſon of ſome Defects, that appeared in the Draught of the ſaid Acts, they were by the royal Authority repealed; and one other immediately prepared and tranſmitted to the Governour and Aſſembly, by Direction of his ſaid late Majeſty in Council, which after paſſing the neceſſary Forms abroad, received the royal Sanction here in the solemn Manner, ſet forth in the Petition hereto annexed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:039950_0002_10161FFA1BAD9A10"/>Thus relying on the Favour and Protection of the Crown, which in that Manner ſo well ſecured a reaſonable Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the Clergy; many regular Divines by the pious Care of the Bishops of <hi>London</hi> from Time to Time were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to go over and ſettle in that Province; not in the leaſt apprehending, it was in the Power of any Governour and Aſſembly to break through ſo firm an Eſtabliſhment without the Concurrence of an equal Authority to that which first gave it a Being; <hi>viz.</hi> the royal Sanction.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs so it is, that on the third Day of <hi>October,</hi> 1728, an Act of Aſſembly was paſſed in <hi>Maryland,</hi> under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the preſent Lord Proprietor's Deputy-Governour, whereby the aforeſaid ſolemn Act for the Eſtabliſhment of the Clergy, is materially altered, and their future Support and Maintenance not only impair'd one fourth Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the whole rendered precarious and ſubject to the fluctuating Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of their popular Aſſemblies from Year to Year; as will be clearly underſtood by obſerving the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whereas, by the first Act ſo carefully drawn up and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards paſſed into a Law by the royal Aſſent, the Clergy were intitled to receive, free of all Charge 40 <abbr>lb.</abbr> of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll, on every taxable Person in <hi>Maryland,</hi> in lieu of Tythes; the late Act directs the said 40 <abbr>lb.</abbr> of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Poll to be paid in current Money, at ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, which is but 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> Sterl. or in Tobacco three fourths for the whole, at the Election of the Planter: So that when Tobacco riſes in Value, the People will chuſe to pay the Clergy at an under-rate in Money, and when the Market falls below ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> hundred, they will pay in To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco three fourths for the whole; whereby in all Events, the Clergy muſt be great Loſers by this Act, and have no manner of Chance with their Fellow-Subjects to ſhare in the propoſed Benefits of the Act, be what they will.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Uncertainty of the Species in which the Clergy is to be paid their Subſiſtence, by this Act, is attended with another moſt grievous Inconveniency, <hi>viz.</hi> In a Country like <hi>Maryland,</hi> where for want of a ſufficient Currency in ready Caſh, the People muſt deal by Barter, and on Credit for their Cloathing and other Neceſſaries of Life; if a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man agrees to purchaſe any thing of the Merchant for Money, perhaps the People, as has been ſaid, will chuſe to pay his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039950_0003_10162634E04039C0"/>
Stipend in Tobacco, and then the poor Clergy-man muſt be at the Will of the Merchant, how much Tobacco he will pleaſe to accept of, for the Money due to him; and on the other hand, if an Agreement be made with the Merchant for Tobacco, if then the People happen to chuſe to pay that Year in Money, the Merchant will ſtill be at Liberty to ſet his own Price on that Quantity of Tobacco, which by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement was due to him: So that whatever happens, the Clergy <hi>muſt be certain Loſers,</hi> without a Poſſibility of ſhare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any Advantage or Improvement that can be made in the Tobacco Trade.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Clergy are moſt grievouſly oppreſs'd by the Time limited in this late Act for collecting and paying their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. For the People have to the tenth of <hi>April</hi> to make their Choice, whether they will pay in Money or Tobacco: and afterwards the Sheriff has to the laſt of <hi>June</hi> to make up his Accounts with the Clergy; by which Means it will often happen, that a Clergy-man may ſerve three Years before he can reap the Benefit of his Labour. For until the first Year is ended (which commonly begins in <hi>November</hi>) there is nothing due; and if the Sheriff be allowed to keep their Tobacco till the laſt of <hi>June</hi> following, the Market will, in all Probability, be over; and the Tobacco lie on their hands until next Year; when if (as it frequently happens) they cannot ſell it, it muſt be ſhipped home for <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and then it will be another Year, before they can expect any Returns. All which the Clergy conceive to be ſuch Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that neither the preſent Sett, nor any who under theſe Circumſtances, may be unadviſedly induced to ſucceed them, can poſſibly ſubſiſt or continue in that Province.</p>
            <p>It is further to be obſerved, that ſome of the Clergy of <hi>Maryland</hi> petitioned the Honourable Council of that Province againſt the paſſing this Act; and the Council having thought fit to enter upon the Back of their Petition, ſome Reaſons for paſſing it into a Law; it will be neceſſary for the better Underſtanding of the whole Matter, to ſubjoin those Reaſons given by the honourable Council in Juſtification of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, with proper Anſwers on behalf of the Clergy.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The honourable Council are pleaſed to ſay, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or Proviſion made for the Clergy is greatly advanced in Quantity, from what it was, when the Act for their Eſtabliſhment was made.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:039950_0004_10162637EFBC2760"/>II. That the Deſign of the Legiſlature in paſſing this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Act, was not to deprive the Clergy of any Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that accrued to them by the former Law: But on the contrary, that their Intention was, by leſſening the Quantity of Tobacco hereafter to be made in that Province, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three fourths of the Clergy's Allowance equal in value, to the whole of what was formerly levied for their Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the Wages allowed to the Members of Council and Aſſembly, the Lawyers Fees, and all Debts due to and from the Inhabitants, are by this Act ſubject to the like Deductions, with that impoſed on the Clergy.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, it is anſwered on behalf of the Clergy, That when the forty <hi>per</hi> Poll was ſettled by the firſt Act, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People were then ſo few, that it did ſcarce any where amount to a Subſiſtence; wherefore the ſame Act gave Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Clergy, to hold two Pariſhes, with the Conſent of the reſpective Veſtries: the Legiſlature then juſtly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that one Pariſh in thoſe Days could not be deemed a Competency. But they did not omit to obſerve as a further Incouragement to the Clergy, that their Income would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly increaſe with Time; and it has proved ſo; tho' there are many Pariſhes that are not yet a Competency: and no ſooner does any Pariſh ſwell to any conſiderable Bulk, but it is immediately diſmember'd and divided by Act of Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſince the making the firſt Law, and contrary to the Intent of it, an additional Duty or Deduction of five <hi>per Cent.</hi> out of the forty <hi>per</hi> Poll, charged for Collection, was put upon the whole Clergy by a <hi>ſubſequent</hi> Act,
tho' that firſt Act had provided and directed <q>that the Sheriff should collect the 40 <hi>per</hi> Poll in the ſame Manner and by the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as he did the Publick and County Levies:</q> which are paid for by the Country, and given to the ſeveral Officers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deducting any Thing for Collection.
So far then has the Intereſt of the Clergy been from being advanc'd, that by this additional Charge for Collection, it was reduced two <hi>per</hi> Poll; and tho' (as was before ſaid) many Pariſhes previous to the late Act for deducting one fourth, are not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency; there was not one in the whole Province that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a reaſonable Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>But further; the Increaſe of People in every Pariſh increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes likewiſe the Miniſter's Labour and Duty, which (it is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039950_0005_1016263A6969A770"/>
humbly conceived) ſhould in juſtice increaſe or add to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
            <p>From all which, it is hoped, that it is Evident that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of People under the aforeſaid Circumſtances, is not a good Reaſon, for deducting a fourth Part of the Clergy's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond Reaſon ſuggeſted by the Council, in ſupport of the Act, it is anſwered in behalf of the Clergy; That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this Act had the pretended or deſigned Effect, <hi>i. e.</hi> by leſſening the Quantity of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> to raiſe it in Value, perhaps to twenty Shillings a Hundred; yet the Clergy can be no Gainers, but great Sufferers, ſince the People are in that Caſe by the Act left at liberty to pay the Clergy in current Money at ten Shillings a Hundred. On the other hand, if (as moſt People think) the Act will not leſſen the Quantity, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently not raiſe the Value of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> it cannot be aſſigned with any colour of Juſtice, as a good Reaſon that the Clergy muſt be paid in <hi>Tobacco, three fourths</hi> for the whole. Such a ſtrange and unhappy Dilemma has this Act put the Clergy under!</p>
            <p>But ſtill, ſuppoſing this Act ſhould leſſen the Quantity of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> the leſs Quantity of that, the People are limited to, th<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> more they will make of other Commodities; which will com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>penſate their Deficiencies in <hi>Tobacco.</hi> And it is humbly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceived, that the leſſening only the Quantity of one Commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dity, when the People are at liberty of making as much a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:039950_0006_1016263D42C63098"/>It is probable, that the Lawyers and others who are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Courſe of Trade and Buſineſs, may gain more than they loſe by the Act; but the poor and unimprovable Allowance that is given for the Maintenance of the Clergy, puts them on no Equality with other People; their whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance being on the Eſtabliſhed Maintenance, ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is taken from them, does ſo far deprive them of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly hoped, that when this Act comes to be deliberately conſidered by the Lords of his Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy-Council, in their Committee for Plantation-Affairs, they will for the Reaſons here offered, be pleaſed to move his moſt Excellent Majeſty to cauſe the ſaid Act to be repealed, with ſuch proper and permanent Inſtructions, to the Governour and Council of the ſaid Province for the time being, as may re-eſtabliſh the Clergy in their former Rights ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conferr'd on them by the Crown, and effectually prevent Incroachments of the like, or any other nature, for the Future.</p>

            <p>That the Clergy of <hi>Maryland</hi> thus relying on the Publick Faith of that Province, but more eſpecially on the gracious Favour and Protection of your Sacred Majeſty, and your Royal Predeceſſors, have been induced to make ſome poor Settlements for the needful Subſiſtence of their Families, in a Country where the Duty of their ſacred Function led them to ſpend their Lives.</p>

that Province, the third Day of <hi>October,</hi> 1728, Intituled, <hi>An Act for Improving the Staple of</hi> Tobacco, whereby a fourth Part of what was granted and eſtabliſhed for the Support and Maintenance of the Clergy, by the before recited ſolemn Act, is cut off, and the remaining three Parts of their Subſiſtence rendred precarious, by being ſubject to the fluctuating Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a popular Aſſembly, from Year to Year, eſpecially in a Country where both the Papiſts and Diſſenters from the Form and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have a conſiderable Influence.</p>
