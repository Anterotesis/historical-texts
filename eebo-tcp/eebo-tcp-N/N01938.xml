            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> THERE are Vain Thoughts in the Hearts of Sinners which are Great Hindrances of their being Saved.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> here intended, are the common cauſe of vain confidence, carnal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and falſe hopes, which prove the ruin of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes under the Goſpel. A deſire of Happineſs is natural to every Man. Nevertheleſs, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Chriſtians do finally miſs of Happineſs. And if we make diligent ſearch we ſhall find that ſome <hi>Vain Thought,</hi> or other, is the great cauſe thereof. Their <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> do fruſtrate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat their deſires, and render them altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to Salvation. It may then be exceeding uſeful to point out theſe <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> and ſhow how greatly they do hinder our Salvation; and alſo diſcover the Vanity of them, that ſo we may no longer ſuffer them to lodge in our hearts. The heart of Man is ſo great a deep, ſo deceitful and deſperately Wicked that 'tis impoſſible to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all thoſe <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> which dwell therein. Yet from the Word of GOD (which gives the cleareſt diſcovery of Man's heart, and in ſo doing evidences its Divine Original) we may come to the Knowledge of a great many of theſe <hi>Vain Thoughts.</hi> I ſhall ſet ſome of them before you under theſe following Heads, with all poſſible plainneſs.</p>

Now GOD cannot thus exactly recompence Men, unleſs He have a full, perfect and diſtinct knowledge of their Deeds. As ſure then as GOD is a juſt Judge, ſo ſure is it that He knows all the Sins of Men, even thoſe that are the moſt ſecret: And accordingly we are informed that GOD in the laſt and great Day, will ſet the Sins of Men in order before their eyes.

               </p>
               <p>FROM theſe things then it is evident, That the thought of GOD's being ignorant of any of the Sins of Men, is a <hi>Vain Thought</hi>; a Thought that has no Truth in it; no real foundation for it, and that will deceive us if we promiſe our ſelves any advantage from it. Well then, let not ſuch a <hi>Vain Thought</hi> as this lodge is our hearts; but let us keep up the contrary Thought in our hearts. Let us for ever keep it in the imagination of the Thought of our hearts, that GOD ſeeth all our ways, and counteth all our ſteps. That His eyes are in every place beholding the Evil and the Good. That if we do evil at any time, in the moſt retired Apartment, yet we do it in the ſight of GOD. Such a Thought at this lodging in our hearts, would be a Thought of exceeding great Service and Advantage to us. This would help to make us watchful and circumſpect; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a great many Sins which we may be tempted unto. The ſetting the Lord always before us, is one of the greateſt preſervatives from Sin, eſpecially from ſecret Sins: It is alſo a good Sign of an heart that is upright with GOD; for none but ſuch have GOD much in their eye. So much for the firſt <hi>Vain thought</hi> concerning GOD.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>IT is a</hi> Vain Thought. <hi>That GOD is ſo Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as not to destroy Men for their Sins.</hi> Sometimes

Men have in their hearts ſuch a Thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning GOD as this is: They imagine Him to be ſuch a merciful GOD as they would have Him to be; a GOD all made op of Mercy, that wont take vengeance for Sin. Are not Perſons ſometimes heard to ſay? <hi>That GOD is more Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than to damn His Creatures.</hi> And is there not the ſame ſecret imagination in the hearts of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Sinners? They take up ſuch a motion of Divine Mercy, as if it would ſuffer none to Periſh in a miſerable Deſtruction. They magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and extol the Mercy of GOD; and ſet it forth to themſelves as a perfection that will infallibly ſecure them from Damnation. When they would flatter themſelves, then they cry up the Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Divine Mercy. Now ſuch a thought as this is a great hindrance of Mens being Saved. This tends to make them go on ſecurely in Sin, and be fearleſs of Damnation: This makes them to think that they may lead wicked lives, and yet that all ſhall be well at the laſt: That Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will prevent their Damnation, and ſecure their Salvation. This thought is a <hi>Vain Thought</hi>; a thought which won't anſwer our expectations nor afford us that ſafety which we promiſe to ourſelves.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>THO' GOD be moſt Merciful, yet He is ſo only to the Repenting Sinner.</hi> Sinners in general are not the Objects of Divine Mercy.

Proſperity thus circumſtanced may be looked upon as an Argument of Divine Love; by this we may know that GOD has a Favour for us.

Did a Man indeed abhor the injuſtice he has perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated and were he afflicted in ſpirit for it, he would labour to repair the damage he has thereby done to his Neighbour. Men do but falſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they hate and are grieved for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Acquiſition, while they contentedly abide in a poſſeſſion equally unjuſt: How could they quietly keep what they have deceitfully gotten, if they had the leaſt ſpark of Godly ſorrow for their deceitful Dealing?

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>THERE are</hi> Vain Thoughts <hi>in the Hearts of Sinners concerning</hi> Obedience, <hi>which are great Hindrances of their being Saved.</hi> Sinners do many times take up wrong notions of true Obedience. They think they do indeed Obey GOD, when they do not; and thus falling ſhort in their Obedience, they do miſs of Salvation. Some of their <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> in this Caſe may be mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>IT is a</hi> Vain Thought, <hi>That Partial Obedience to the Commandments of GOD is true Obedience.</hi> If Men Obey GOD in ſome things, in many things, they think they Obey Him acceptably, though they don't Obey Him in all things. Thus Men ſometimes are ſeemingly careful and exact in obſerving the Duties of the Firſt Table of the Law; they ſeem to be very Religious towards GOD, in performing thoſe Duties of Worſhip which He requires of them. They Pray to GOD in their Families, they Pray alſo in Secret, they frequent the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances of GOD, and are ſeemingly Devout therein: And now they think they are Dutiful and Obedient Chriſtians, though it may be all this while they neglect the Duties of the Second Table of the Law: They are not Juſt and Honeſt in their Dealings, they are not Charitable and Beneficent, they are not Chaſte and Sober.</p>

All theſe were things which GOD required, and yet the Lord teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his abhorence of them. The reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was becauſe they all this while neglected the Duties of the Second Table of the Law; <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Learn to do well, ſeek Judgment, relieve the Oppreſſed, judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widow.</hi> And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt denounces Woes to ſuch Partial Keepers of GOD's Commandments, Matth, 23.23. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rites; for ye pay tythe of Mine, and Anniſe and Cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith; theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> And moſt juſtly may GOD be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at ſuch partial Obedience. For there is no regard to the Authority of GOD in ſuch Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Things are to be done for this reaſon becauſe GOD Commands them: Pſal. 119.4, 5. <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. O that my ways were directed to keep thy ſtatutes</hi>! The Authority of GOD ſhould be the ground of our Obedience; but now ſuch as are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in their Obedience, have no reſpect to the Authority of GOD: If that were their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to keep any of the Commandments of GOD, it would move them to keep all His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the Authority of GOD is alike unſtamped on all the Commandments. Such then are Guilty of Contempt of the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002302_0035_0FDB1CD05D96C4A0"/>
Again, in partial Obedience there is no Exerciſe of Love to GOD: Our Obedience ought to flow from a Principle of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ove to GOD. And when it does ſo, is will make us ſtudy to do all GOD's Will, 1 Joh. 5.3. <hi>For this is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> None of the Commands of GOD are grievous or diſtaſtefull to one that truly Loves GOD: He likes then all, and endeavours to keep them all. Such then as Obey ſome Commands, and diſobey others, do nothing from Love to GOD W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> then may GOD be diſpleaſed at what they do.</p>
                  <p>FROM theſe things it appears that Partial Obedience is not right and acceptable Obedience. Let us not then vainly think that it is true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: But on the other hand, let us think that Integrity or Univerſality is eſſential to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Obedience: And accordingly let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Law of GOD is to be kept with our Spirits, as well as with our Bodies. GOD calls for the Heart and Spirit in His Service, Joh. 4.23, 24. <hi>The true Worſhippers ſhall Worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to Worſhip him.

exact in what they do. If their inward Thoughts, Deſires, Aims and Ends are not regulated by the Holy Law of GOD, they do not rightly obey GOD, though their Speeches and outward Actions be never ſo Conformed to the Law of GOD.

They reſted in a naked Aſſent to the Goſpel Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt. Such as theſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> does particularly write againſt in his Epiſtle. And as there was then, ſo there are ſtill many who think, that if they give Credit to the Doctrines of the Goſpel, they are ſuch Believers as have the Promiſe of Salvation made to them: And hence 'tis that many reckon upon being Saved, becauſe they belong to that Body of Chriſtians, whom they ſuppoſe to be moſt Orthodox and ſound in the Faith: But this is a <hi>Vain Thought</hi> as will appear from two things.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. <hi>THERE are</hi> Vain Thoughts <hi>in the hearts of Sinners concerning</hi> Love to Chriſt, <hi>which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</hi> Love to Chriſt is neceſſary to Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. He that Loveth not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will be accurſed; 1 Cor. 16.22. If Men therefore are deceived about their Love to Chriſt, and think they do really Love Him, when indeed they do not, they are in great danger of Periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eternally. Now it is a common thing for Men to profeſs Love to Chriſt, when as in Truth they are far from Loving Him aright: They have wrong Thoughts, miſtaken Notions concerning true Love to Chriſt, which prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>IT is a</hi> Vain Thought, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is ſincerely Loved, when there is an allowed abiding Love to any Sin whatſoever.</hi> There is indeed ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Love to Sin in all ſuch as do dearly Love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Their Love to it is not wholly taken away, but there are ſome remains of affection to Sin in them, and will be ſo as long as they are in this World. Yet however, this Love to Sin is diſallowed and lamented. It is a grief and trouble to them to find in their Hearts any workings of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards Sin, any tendencies unto delight in Sin. Theſe relicks of Love to Sin, are the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002302_0042_0FDB1CE65B3E8C60"/>
lead and burden of their Souls; and being ſo, they are conſiſtent with ſincere Love to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>BUT now, When Love to any Sin is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, cheriſhed and willingly entertained in the heart, there is no ſincere Love to Chriſt in that heart Yet many may think, that Chriſt may be their Beloved, though they harbour ſome Beloved Luſt in their Boſoms. They think they may have a friendſhip for Chriſt, and a friendſhip for ſome Sin too. If ſome that evidently take pleaſure in Iniquity were asked, whether they really Loved Chriſt, they would ſay, they hop'd they did; and would be much offended if they ſhould be account<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> love for Sin, which ſeparates from Chriſt.</hi> A Lover of Chriſt, is one that greatly deſires and delight in Communion with Jeſus Chriſt. Cant. 1.5. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is what his Soul longs for, as that which is moſt ſweet and refreſhing to him; Cant. 2 3. <hi>I ſat under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet unto my taſte.</hi> No ſuch pleaſant Moments as thoſe wherein they draw nigh to Chriſt, and Chriſt draws nigh to them: Such inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as this, is Heaven begun upon Earth

and is what they would have continued and not interrupted. Hence they cannot but hate Sin which deprives them of Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and ſeperates between Him and them. They know that Sin is a Bar, and the only Bar, in the way of their ſweet Fellowſhip with Chriſt, and therefore they cannot allow themſelves in any Love to it. 'Tis abſolutely impoſſible for Men to hold up delightful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, and delightful Communion with any Luſt. This is in Religion a pure, flat Contradiction.

Such is their Conſternation through the Apprehenſion of their danger of Periſhing under the Wrath of GOD, that they do bewail their paſt Sins, wiſh they had not committed them, are concerned about obtaining the Pardon of them, and have ſome Purpoſes of turning from them. Now when Sinners are under ſuch a Convincing Senſe of the Evil of their Sins and their Danger of Damnation, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought to a Confeſſion of their Sin and ſome Humiliation for it, they are ready to conclude themſelves really Converted; becauſe they are brought out of a State of ſenſeleſs Security in Sin, they think they are brought into a State of Grace; but this may be a <hi>Vain Thought.</hi>

Though he externally turns and abſtains from Sin, yet he may inwardly love it as much as ever: His Abſtinence from Sin may proceed from a meer ſenſe of the hurt it does him in his Name or Eſtate. The Diſgrace and Damage which attend Sinful practices may make him Reform. Or the meer fear of Damnation may

Thus alſo we have the Apoſtle giving that Exhortation to Chriſtians, Phil. 2.12. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> We muſt not give way to ſloth and negligence, but be diligent in the uſe of all means conducing to our Salvation; and that with a ſollicitous Concern leſt we ſhould miſt of Salvation through a failure in our Duty. In the Buſineſs of our Eternal Salvation we muſt not be ſlothful, but fervent, ſerious and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Whatſoever our hands find to do in this matter, we are to do it with all our might, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. The Goſpel is full of ſuch calls to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Labour and Watchfulneſs in order to Salvation. Now theſe calls do moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently teſtify unto us, that 'tis no eaſy thing to be ſaved. Were the obtaining Salvation a matter of no great Difficulty, all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands requiring our utmoſt Diligence, would be needleſs and impertinent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Oppoſition in the way of Salvation is very great.</hi> There are a great many Adverſaries that labour to prevent our Salvation. There are <hi>Luſts within us, which war againſt our ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. Theſe Luſts do all that they can to hinder the Salvation, and to procure the Deſtruction of our Souls. They obſtruct us in doing thoſe Duties which tend to the Salvation of our Souls, and they ſollicit us to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:002302_0049_0FDB1CFB4CDF0370"/>
thoſe Sins which tend to the ruin of our Souls. Indwelling Sin is an active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, never idle, but always working more or leſs. And all its actings are conſtantly againſt the good and welfare of our Souls. Again, there is Satan who is a reſtleſs oppoſer of our Salvation; 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>Your Adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> His conſtant work and buſineſs is to tempt Men to Sin and ſo to bring Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them. He watches all Opportunities and takes hold of all Advantages to make them Sinful and Miſerable. Again, There is the World which is full of Snares and Temptations. The <hi>Men of this World</hi> by their evil Counſels and Examples, by their promiſes and threatnings, do much endanger our Salvation. The <hi>Things alſo of this World,</hi> thro' the inordinate Appetites in us after them, do very much oppoſe our Salvation. Our hearts are apt to be too much taken with them, too much ſet upon them, to the neglect of GOD and our Souls: Yea, we are too apt to abuſe them by exceſs to the ſatisfying our Luſts, and ſo to the deſtroying our Souls. There is then a great deal of Oppoſition both from within and without which we meet with in the way to Salvation. The adverſaries are many, and potent, and skilfull to Deſtroy. It is not then an eaſy matter to withſtand all this oppoſition, and to break thro' it unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. We muſt daily Watch and Pray, and have our eve to Jeſus Chriſt, that His Grace may be ſufficient for us, or we ſhall aſſuredly Periſh by the hands of our Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="96" facs="unknown:002302_0050_0FDB1CFCC6419FA0"/>3. <hi>THE Duties required in order Salvation are exceeding Difficult.</hi> Indeed, <hi>The Commands of Chriſt are not in themſelves grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3. <hi>But his yoke is eaſy,</hi> Matth. 11.28. Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in their own Nature are Eaſy, Pleaſant and Delightful; and as far as Perſons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit, they do in ſome meaſure experimentally find them ſo: Yet however, thro' the Corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt is become impoſſible to unregenerate Perſons, and difficult to the Regenerate in ſome degree, and eſpecially at ſome times. There are ſome Duties ſo contrary, and croſs to the Corrupt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, that they cannot readily be performed without much watchfulneſs over our own Spirits, and very much aſſiſtance from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Of this nature, are thoſe Duties required. Math. 5.44. <hi>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> 'Tis no eaſy thing for Men who are ſubject to ſinful Paſſions and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to do theſe things. Nor is it an eaſy thing to be content with every Condition, to give Thanks in every thing, to truſt in GOD at all times, to deny our ſelves, and take up our Croſs and follow Chriſt. Theſe are things which we cannot do without ſpecial and abundant Aſſiſtance from GOD our Saviour, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>DUTIES of Obedience though difficult muſt be perſevered in to the end.</hi> 'Tis not enough that we Obey GOD for a time, but we muſt Obey Him always, in order to Salvation. Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:002302_0050_0FDB1CFCC6419FA0"/>
is a condition of Salvation; Math. 10.22. <hi>He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Rev. 1 10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>Patient continuance in well doing,</hi> in order to Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. Such as Apoſtatize from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practice of Religion will Periſh; Heb. 10.38 39. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him, but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition.</hi> It is then neceſſary unto Salvation, that we abide conſtant in the Service of GOD. Now it is no eaſy thing to bold on, and hold out to the end, in the way of GOD's Commandments, notwithſtanding all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Oppoſitions we meet withal. Let us not then entertain ſuch a <hi>Vain Thought,</hi> that 'tis an eaſy thing to be Saved. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, let us look upon it as an exceeding difficult thing, and unto Man an impoſſible thing to be Saved. Nothing ſhort of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power can bring us into a ſtate of Salvation; and nothing but the Mighty Power of GOD can preſerve us in that Eſtate, and bring us to the Conſummation of it, in the Kingdom of Heaven. Nor may we expect that GOD will exert His Power unto our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs we are diligent in the uſe of appointed Means. Let us not then ſit ſtill and do nothing, as if the attainment of Salvation were a matter of greateſt Facility: But let us humbly wait on GOD in His own appointed way, being inſtant in Prayer to GOD Day and Night, following Him from one Ordinance to another, then may we hope, that GOD will meet us and Bleſs us, and ſhew us His Salvation.</p>

                  <head>DIRECTIONS follow.</head>
                  <p>Direct 1. <hi>LET us be jealous of our own hearts.</hi> Self-Jealouſy is a good preventive of Deluſion. Our hearts are naturally <hi>Deceitful above all things,</hi> Jer. 17.9. If we be not exceeding watchful we ſhall eaſily be deceived by them: They are apt to flatter us, and to ſuggeſt to us, that all is and ſhall be well with us, when it is far from being ſo. Thus it was with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Our Deceiving hearts incline us to take up too favourable an opinion of our ſelves, and to think our ſtate and ways good, when they are not ſo. It is therefore great folly to truſt to the judgment of our own hearts, without an impartial and thorow Examination of the grounds it goes upon; Prov. 28.26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart is a fool.</hi> It is our Wiſdom not to be too Credulous, when our hearts ſpeak well of the Thoughts we entertain, and the practices we allow our ſelves in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There will be more of Wiſdom, and leſs of Danger, to ſuſpect our own hearts, than to be haſty in believing them: There can be no harm in being afraid leſt we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them. We are more apt to err on the hand of Indulgence than of Severity; and there is more danger in ſelf-Confidence, than ſelf-Jealouſy: If we are jealous of our ſelves, it
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002302_0055_0FDB1D05A22D9688"/>
will only make us more concerned to be better, which will be no inconvenience to us. But if we are ſelf-confident, we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being Secure without due concern to amend what may be amiſs. Let us then put the ſame queſtion to our ſelves, as was once put by <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 King. 10.15. <hi>Is thy heart right</hi>? Let us enquire whether our hearts be right in the judgment they paſs upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we eſpouſe, and the ways we walk in. He that is thus inquiſitive, is in an hopeful way not to be Deceived by <hi>Vain Thoughts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Direct. 2. <hi>LET us Labour to get a well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed judgment. Vain Thoughts</hi> proceed ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily from an erroneous Mind, Eph. 4.17, 18. <hi>Walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having the underſtanding darkned.</hi> Rom. 1.21. <hi>They became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned.</hi> Vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations concerning GOD, and other things, proceed from blindneſs of Mind. We ſhould therefore labour to get our Minds inlightned with the light of Truth. This will ſerve to rectify our Thoughts, and prevent <hi>Vain Thoughts.</hi> To this end we muſt Study the Scriptures which are a Light to diſcover to us the way of Truth and Error. If we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult thoſe Holy Oracles of GOD, they will inform us what Thoughts are <hi>Right</hi> and what are <hi>Vain.</hi> If then we would not be left to call Good Evil, and Evil Good, let us be Converſant with the Word of GOD, which is
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:002302_0056_0FDB11981AB7DFD0"/>
the only Rule whereby to know Good or Evil. Underſtanding in GOD's Precepts, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us <hi>Every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119.104. As ever then we deſire not to be Deceived, let us acquaint our ſelves with the unerring Word of GOD; and let us bring every Thought which we entertain to that Word, and thereby try whether it be a <hi>Vain Thought</hi> or not. If we Diligently and Conſcientiouſly thus do, with a deſire to come to the Knowledge of Truth and Duty, we may hope that we ſhall not be left to the deceiving power of <hi>Vain Thoughts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Direct. 3. <hi>BE earneſt in Prayer to GOD.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſelf-jealouſy and diligent ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we muſt add fervent Prayer to GOD: This is a Duty in all Caſes uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but eſpecially in thoſe Caſes which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Father, Into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi> This Dying Servant of Chriſt, is concerned for the welfare of his departing Spirit, and in order to this he asks nothing more, but that Jeſus Chriſt would r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <div type="doctrine">

                  <hi>DOCTRINE,</hi> It ought to be the great Concern of every Man, That when he comes to Die, his Spirit may be received by JESUS CHRIST.</head>
               <p>THIS was the great Concern of Holy <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> who herein ſhows what ought to be the Concern of every Man.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Under ſeveral Propoſitions this Doctrine may be ſpoken to.</head>
                  <p>Prop. 1. <hi>THERE is a Spirit in Man which is a diſtinct Being from his Body.</hi> Man conſiſts of two parts, a Spirit and a Body which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Subſtances, and of a vaſtly different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Man is not all Body, but is principally Spirit. This is his Chief and moſt Excellent Part: Though what and how Excellent it is, we do not our ſelves perfectly know. The Body of Man is indeed, a moſt wonderful and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Work of GOD; Pſal. 139.14. <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> The frame and conſtitution of the Body is truly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous. The Spirit of Man however is a far
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:002302_0059_0FDB1D0A20AD18D8"/>
more Glorious and Excellent Being than the Body. The Spirit of Man, has ſuch a power of Thinking, as to be able in a Moment to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it's Thought beyond the utmoſt bounds of the whole Creation. It has ſuch a power of Underſtanding, as to be able to diſcern between Truth and Error, Good and Evil. It has ſuch a power of Election, as to be capable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly to chooſe GOD for its laſt end and chief Good. It has ſuch vaſt and large Deſires, which all Created Good is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fully to Satisfy. In ſhort, it is a Being of far more worth and excellency than the whole World, Math. 16.26. <hi>What is a Man profited if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſs his own Soul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 2. <hi>THE Spirit of a Man remains after the Death of his Body.</hi> As for the Body that is Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and muſt Die; ſo has GOD Ordained, and ſo it ſhall be, Heb. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto men once to die.</hi> Death paſſes upon all Men by the unalterable appointment of GOD; and at Death the Body periſhes, turning to rottenneſs and duſt: But as for the Spirit of a Man that remains entire after the Diſſolution of the Body. The Spirit does not Periſh with the Body, as Men may Atheiſtically imagine.</p>
                  <p>Here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>IT remains as to its Eſſence.</hi> For it is not capable of Diſſolution into any pre-exiſtent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as the Body is; and that becauſe it is formed immediately out of nothing. And tho' it be in the Power of GOD to annihilate it, or turn it into nothing again, yet He will not
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:002302_0059_0FDB1D0A20AD18D8"/>
thus do. He has plainly revealed it to us, that the Soul is of an immortal Nature, that it dies not with the Body, but ſurvives it and exiſts after Death, (which will be evinced under the following Propoſitions.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>IT remains as to it's Faculties and the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of them.</hi> The Underſtanding, Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do ſtill continue and perform their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Operations. The Spirit of a Man after Death does not ceaſe to act its Rational Powers; but undoubtedly exerciſes them more vigorouſly than ever. At Death it is freed from thoſe clogs and obſtructions, which it often met with from the Body; and ſo has nothing to hinder its exerting its Powers to the utmoſt. The way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its acting is to us as yet unknown; yet this ſhould not make us in the leaſt to queſtion the Truth of it; for we do not know the way of our Spirit's acting while it is in the Body: Who can comprehend the manner of the Souls acting by the ſeveral Organs of the Body? And yet we make not the leaſt doubt concerning the reality of its Actings. Why then ſhould we diſbelieve the Activity of the Soul after Death, becauſe we cannot conceive the manner of its Operations? But that it Lives and Acts after Death, and is a Subject of Bleſſedneſs or Miſery will be hereafter ſhown.</p>
                  <p n="3">Prop. 3. <hi>AFTER Death the Spirit of a Man remains not with the Body, but is ſeparated from it.</hi> It does not abide in the Body, nor is it preſent with the Body, but departs from the Body; Gen. 35.18. <hi>And it came paſs as her ſoul was in
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:002302_0060_0FDB1D0EB7DEDF28"/>
departing; for ſhe died.</hi> 1 King. 17.21. <hi>Let this Childs ſoul come into him again.</hi> It was then gone out of him. Death diſſolves the Union between Soul and Body, upon which the Soul immediately departs away from the Body. Hence after Death the Spirit is ſaid to be abſent from the Body, 2 Cor. 5.8. <hi>We are willing rather to be abſent from the body i. e.</hi> as to our Spirits. After Death there is a real local diſtance between the Soul and Body, though how great a diſtance we know not in particular, only in general, they are as far diſtant from each other, as Heaven or Hell, the receptacles of Men's Spirits are from the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 4. <hi>THE Spirit of a Man upon its ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Body, goes to Jeſus Chriſt as its Judge.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Great Judge of all Men; all Judgment is committed unto Him. The laſt Judgment of Men and Angels will be managed by Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo is the particular Judgment of Men as to their Spirits immediately upon Death, their Spirits do then go to GOD their Judge, Eccl. 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> The Spirits of Men do not all go to Heaven to appear in the immediate Preſence of the human nature of Jeſus Chriſt, for nothing unclean enters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: But they go to Chriſt as GOD who is every where, and ſo can manifeſt himſelf in any Place whatſoever. Tho' in what Place or after what manner He will thus manifeſt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is unknown to us. But this we know that Jeſus Chriſt has all Power in Heaven and Earth, power over all Fleſh, and power to Judge and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:002302_0060_0FDB1D0EB7DEDF28"/>
Diſpoſe of the ſeparate Spirits of Men, Rev. 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dean; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell and Death.</hi> He has the Keys of Hell or the Inviſible World: He has power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Spirits of Men when they paſs out of this viſible, into the other inviſible World.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 5. <hi>WHEN the Spirit of a Man goes to Chriſt after Death, it is received or rejected by Him.</hi> One or the other is what befalls the Soul of every Man, according to the State in which he dies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>IF a Man die in a State of Sin, his Spirit is rejected by Chriſt the Righteous Judge.</hi> The Son of GOD Judges it, Condemns it, Baniſhes it from His Preſence, and caſts it into Hell. How this particular Judgment is managed, and how long it is in Tranſacting, we cannot ſay: But that Judgment paſſes upon the ſeparate Soul of a Sinner, and that the Judicial Sentence is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon it in its rejection from Chriſt into the place of Puniſhment, is moſt evident from the Scriptures of Truth. Thus it is ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the World of ungodly Men who Periſhed in the Blood, that <hi>their ſpirits are in the infernal Priſon,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.19. And it is ſaid concerning the People of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> that they are actually <hi>Suffering the vengeance of Eternal Fire,</hi> Jude 7. Which can be underſtood only of their Spirits, for their Bodies were conſumed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire which turned the Cities into Aſhes. Thus it is alſo ſaid of the Wicked rich Man that when he died <hi>he went to Hell and was in Torments,</hi> Luk. 16.23. Which cannot be meant of his
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:002302_0061_0FDB1D10DA74C038"/>
Body for that was buried in a Grave. It was therefore his Soul which was tormented in the Flames of Hell; and though this be but a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable yet with the Scope it as clearly repreſents to us the Miſery of ſeperate ſinful Souls, as if it were a real Hyſtory, and aſſerted it in the moſt plain words. Again, We read concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treacherous <hi>Judas,</hi> that when he died, <hi>he went to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> place,</hi> Acts 1.25. This place that he went to cannot mean the Grave, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat is not <hi>Judas</hi>'s own and proper place, but the common place of all Men good and bad, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b</hi> 30.23. It was therefore a place which of <hi>ſpecial right</hi> belonged to him, as a Betrayer of the Lord of Glory, and this can be no other than Hell the place of Torments. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he went to this place at Death, only as to his Spirit; his miſerable Corps remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> upon the Earth as a Spectacle of Horror, while his perfidious Spirit was Suffering the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of GOD in the place of Devils.</p>
                  <p>THUS it appears from the Word of GOD, that the departed Spirits of ungodly Men are ſeperated from Chriſt and ſent to Hell. And beſides the Word of GOD, are there not many Providential Demonſtrations of this Truth, in thoſe dreadful Anguiſhes which ſeize the Souls of Convinced Sinners, when they ſee the Day of their Death approaching? What amazing Diſtreſſes of Conſcience are they under! what fearful Expectations of Wrath and fiery Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Lord, are they filled withal!

Their Fellowſhip with Him now, is only in inchoation and gradual Progreſs, but then it ſhall be in Perfection and Conſummation. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt is then Perfect, when it is immediate, full, uninterrupted and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Now ſuch is the Communion which the Spirit of a Believer is received unto after its Departure from the Body.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Chriſt at Death enjoys</hi> immediate <hi>Communion with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> While the Spirit of a Believer dwells here in the Body it is at a diſtance from the Lord Chriſt, but when it departs from the Body it goes into the immediate Perſonal Preſence of the Lord; 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. <hi>While we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord. We are willing rather to be abſent from the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord.</hi> So, Phil. 1.23. <hi>Having a deſire to depart and be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> The Departed Spirits of Juſt Men, do ſee Chriſt Face to Face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. And therefore they do enjoy immediate and moſt intimate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Lord of Glory. In what manner and ways this Glorious intercourſe is carried on, we cannot particularly and diſtinctly declare. Only this we are aſſured of in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that Glorified Spirits on their part, do immediately Exerciſe all their Powers and Graces upon Jeſus Chriſt, in Contemplating, Loving, Worſhipping and Serving of Him; Rev. 22.3, 4.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:002302_0065_0FDB1D1B7683A870"/>
                     <hi>And his ſervants ſhall ſerve him and ſee his face.</hi> On Chriſt's part, He ſheds abroad His Love in their Hearts, making them to partake of the cleareſt and fulleſt Manifeſtations of His moſt dear Affection for them in a moſt immediate way. Furthermore, what ſweet and Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences may paſs between Chriſt and the Church Triumphant, we cannot ſay. This we know that when He was Transfigured in the Mount, two of the moſt eminent Saints in Glory, even <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> came down and appeared to Him, and held a Conference with Him concerning His Deceaſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luk. 9.30, 31. Surely this was ſomething of Heaven upon Earth, ſome ſmall repreſentation of what is done in Heaven above.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Chriſt at Death, enjoys</hi> full <hi>Communion with Chriſt.</hi> The Souls of Believers while in the Body have Communion with Chriſt only in low degrees. Tho' their Communion with Him be at ſome times more full than at other times, yet 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways incompleat. Chriſt now <hi>Comes into their ſouls, and ſups with them, and they with him,</hi> Rev. 3.20. They enjoy ſome manifeſtations of Chriſt to them, but not full. They enjoy ſome ſenſe of His Love to them, but not full. The fulneſs of their Communion with Chriſt is reſerved for Heaven. There the Saints Love Chriſt with all their Heart, with all their Soul, with all their Mind, and with all their Might. Their Love goes out to Chriſt in its full Strength, and all their Graces are acted on Him in the higheſt degree. There alſo the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines on them in His full Strength, filling them with
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:002302_0066_0FDB1D1CE270F4A0"/>
Light, Life, Comfort, Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, Pſal. 16.11. <hi>In thy preſence is the fulneſs of Joy.</hi> Then ſhall the Apoſtle's Prayer for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> have its utmoſt accompliſhment in all the Saints; Eph. 3.19. <hi>That ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> They are by Chriſt filled with all the fulneſs of GOD, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their enlarged Capacity. They partake of as much of the communicable fulneſs of Chriſt as their Natures are capable of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Christ at Death, enjoys</hi> uninterrupted <hi>Communion with Chriſt.</hi> The Communion of the Saints with Chriſt here on Earth, is much broken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by one means or other. The conſtant riſings and workings of Corruption in them, do always in ſome meaſure disturb their free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Jeſus Chriſt. Such is the remaining vanity and unſteadineſs of the mind, that it often wanders from Chriſt in the Duties of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. The beſt of GOD's Servants do ſadly experience how difficult a thing it is to keep their Hearts engaged in cloſe Communion with Chriſt, and how apt are they to ſtart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from Him in Holy Duties. Again, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Holy Men do fall into ſuch Sins which provoke Chriſt greatly to withdraw from them, and which do very much eſtrange their Hearts from Chriſt. How fearfully was <hi>David's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt interrupted and cut off by his foul Sins? Their Sins do make a very great ſeparation between them and their GOD, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. Again, the neceſſary occaſions of the preſent Life, and the neceſſary repoſe of Nature by Sleep, do take them off from actual Converſe
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:002302_0066_0FDB1D1CE270F4A0"/>
with Jeſus Chriſt. So that on one account or other there is in this World a frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Saints Communion with Chriſt. But now, when their Spirits are received by Chriſt into Heaven all bars in the way of their Communion with Him, are totally removed, nothing deprives them of Communion with Chriſt for a Moment; they ſerve and enjoy Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, Rev. 7.15. <hi>They are before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ſitteth on his Throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi> No Enemy, no Adverſary enters there to give the leaſt diſturbance to their ſweet inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the King of Glory. There are no Temptations, hurries, darkneſs, confuſion, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to cauſe the withdrawing of Chriſt or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to occaſion the leaſt diverſion of Mind from Chriſt the Glorious Object of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations and Adorations.

When therefore the Spirit of a Believer departs from the Body and goes to Chriſt, it arrives unto a fullneſs of Conformity to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>IT it perfectly Conformed to Chriſt in His Sinleſsneſs.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt always was harmleſs, undefiled and ſeparate from Sinners. He knew no Sin, did no Sin, was without all Sin; no Sin was ever inherent in Him or committed by Him. Now herein the Souls of Believers are perfectly Conformed to Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven. In this World their Souls have Sin cleaving to them in all their Faculties, and all their Operations; but in Heaven this vicious quality is quite taken away, their Souls have nothing of Sin dwelling in them: They brought Sin into this World with them, but they carry none of it with them into the other World. There is not in the Mind the leaſt vanity or darkneſs;
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:002302_0067_0FDB1D1E6508F118"/>
There is not in the Will the leaſt averſion from Good, or the leaſt Propenſity to Evil: There is not in the Affections the leaſt impurity or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity. The Soul is without the leaſt ſpot or blemiſh upon it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ejection of Sin is ſweetned by the Bleſſed impoſſibility of its making any re-entrance into the Soul. It's ſtate of compleat freedom from Sin, by the Grace, Merit and Power of Jeſus Chriſt, is immutable. Thus is the ſeparate Spirit, of a Believer altogether ſinleſs and impeccable like unto the Lord who receives it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>IT is perfectly Conformed to Chriſt in His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The Man Chriſt Jeſus always was and is perfectly Holy. He is in a way of eminency <hi>the Holy and Juſt One,</hi> Acts 3.14. His Nature and all His Actions were perfectly Holy. Herein the Spirit of a Believer in its ſeparate Eſtate is made like to Jeſus Chriſt. In this World the Soul of a Believer is <hi>Renewed after the image of Chriſt in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24. And it is renewed more and more Day by Day, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. The good Work of Grace and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication begun in it is carried on in this Life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. But it attains not to Perfection till it be ſeparated from the Body and received into the Hands of Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt has purchaſed Perfection for it but beſtows it not till the Soul goes to Him in Heaven. Then the Soul is made like to Chriſt in the higheſt degrees of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is capable of: It is Holy as the Lord Himſelf is Holy. Not in a way of equality, for ſo none is Holy as the Lord; but in a way of as full Reſemblance as the Capacity of the

Undoubtedly, they expreſs a Grief &amp; Repentance for thoſe neglects. Undoubtedly, they wiſh for, and deſire either a return to this World to Reform their neglects, or a Reception

                     <p>Direct. 2. <hi>LET us receive Jeſus Chriſt with our Spirits.</hi> To receive Chriſt with our Spirits is heartily to approve, embrace and entertain Jeſus Chriſt as the only al-ſufficient Saviour, reſting upon Him alone for Salvation; as ſuch a Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is revealed and offered to us in the Goſpel, and if we Cordially accept Him for our Saviour, fixing our entire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Him for the Salvation of our Souls, then do our Souls truly receive Him. Such an hearty Reception of Chriſt now, may aſſure us of His Reception of our Spirits at the laſt. If our hearts are opened to receive Him, He will open Heaven to receive them. It is ſaid in Joh 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power or privilege to become the ſons of God.</hi> And if they partake of this High and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Dignity of Adoption, they alſo partake of a Coheirſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, or a Title to His Rich Inheritance, Rom. 8.17. <hi>And if Children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They have by Grace and Favour, a right to that Glorious Inheritance, whereunto Chriſt has a right by Nature and Purchaſe. Let us then with our Souls conſent to take Chriſt in all His ſaving Offices. Receive Him as the great Prophet and Light of the World; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the infallible certainty of all His Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and looking to Him for an enlightned Mind ſavingly to Underſtand them.

Receive Him as the King of Glory, Believing his rightful Dominion over us, and yielding Profeſſed and real Subjection to Him.

Thus it can aſcend into the Heavens, and follow our great High Prieſt who is paſſed thereinto, and can exerciſe it ſelf in ſweet Contemplations on Him. As <hi>Steven,</hi> by an extraordinary Strengthning of ſight, looked up to Heaven and with his Bodily Eyes beheld Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding at the Right Hand of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo may a Chriſtian with the eye of his Mind look into Heaven and take a view of Jeſus Chriſt in His Glory there.
