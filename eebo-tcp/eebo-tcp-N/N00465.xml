      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>. Upon the 11 day of <hi>January,</hi> 1691, 2, the Body of <hi>John Clark</hi> was found near <hi>Windham</hi> Landing.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000588_0006_0FA95823E06AB4C0"/>
The Coroner Impannelled an Inquest, who upon viewing the Corps, and diligently searching the same, they found his Neck was very limber, &amp; much shrivelled upon the skin, and seemed more blew than other parts of his body. They sent for the Prisoner; when he was brought, he was bid to touch the Corps, the which he did do, and wished most execrable Wishes, <hi>That God would send some suddain Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, if ever he murthered</hi> John Clark; saying, <hi>if he had murthered him, he would bleed afresh</hi>; saying, <hi>Poor innocent man! why should I destroy him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Corooners Inquest, seventeen in Number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to consider of their Verdict.</p>
            <p>They sent for the Prisoner, asked him to tell them, how he came to the fore-mentioned Goods? He said, he had been with <hi>John Clark</hi> in the Evening, and bought some Threed Buttons of him for some old Cask, and when he came home, his Wife told him, she wanted some blew Tape, and some Mettle Buttons for the Children; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went to the Town Landing, and finding the Boat gone, he went to <hi>Windhame,</hi> and from thence he saw the Boat near near <hi>Salem Creeks Mouth,</hi> then there was three Canows at <hi>Windham</hi> Landing, and he took one of them, which was a knotty Canow, and went to the Boat, finding no body in it, he took the Goods, and put them into the Canow, brought them to <hi>Windham</hi> Landing about half an hour before Sun rising; he hid the <hi>English Goods</hi> in <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Marsh, and carried a parcel of Cheese home that Morning, and fetcht the other Goods home about two or three dayes after.</p>
            <p>Several Persons that were of the said Inquest, were at <hi>Windham</hi> the same Morning (about Sun rising,) that the Prisoner said he landed the Goods there, and they do affirm,

                        <head>King's Attorney</head>
                        <p>May it please the Court, The Prisoner at the Bar is now to be tryed, and that by the good old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the beginning of which Tryal is his Presentment, which is already found by the grand Inquest. He is now to come to his Tryal by Twelve men of his Peers, and of the Neighbourhood legally constituted, who, I trust, will do Justice indifferently; and <hi>Magna Charta, The Petition of Right,</hi> and many Statutes do confirm this way of Tryal; and I hope the Court, and all that hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and see their Proceedings, will receive full satisfaction in the Legality and Fairness of their Proceedings against him, and himself the benefit of Justice and Law.</p>
                        <p>Let none say, The Prisoner is not tryed and judged according to the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England:</hi> The Judgment is given in by twelve men of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
(<hi>vid. Cooks com. upon Littleton</hi>)
the Justices are but to inform the Jury in matters of Law, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Sentence and Judgment written against the Prisoner, and order the same Judgment to be put in Execution.</p>

have their Power limitted; but among Equals in Authority (as it is in this Province of <hi>West-Jarsey</hi>) there is no Superiority, therefore those Magistrates that are in Power here, ought to defend the Weak, punish the Wicked, and be just to all, acting as there is need, and as the Times, Persons and Accidents do require, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Exigency, Distress and Necessity of the case. In vain are good Laws made, if there be none to put them in Execution.</p>
                        <p>May it please this Court, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, You are here for the Trying and Judging of <hi>Thomas Lutherland,</hi> Prisoner at the Bar, for his notorious Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of <hi>John Clark,</hi> late one of the King and Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Subjects, and for the Fellonious taking and carrying away his Goods: He hath been a notorious fellon in <hi>England,</hi> at Sea, in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and in this County of <hi>Salem,</hi> stands now before you to receive the good of Justice.</p>
                        <p>The King and Queen of <hi>England</hi> have lost a Subject, who was in Health at the common Landing place in <hi>Salem</hi> Town after Sun set the 11th day of <hi>November,</hi> 1691. and on the next Morning the said <hi>John Clark</hi> was not to be found, but his Boat robbed, and divers parcels of goods felloniously taken &amp; carried away by the Prisoner, as himself has confessed. That <hi>John Clark</hi> was murthered by the Prisoner at the Bar, seventeen Reputable Persons, on the Coroners Inquest, has given it in their Verdict, and this Fellony has relation to the Murther, for the Murther was committed for love to the Goods. If it be found that <hi>A. B.</hi> was murthered in the Night, and the Goods that he had with him at the time of his Death, shall be found in the possession of <hi>C. D.</hi> the next Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000588_0009_0FA958260780CAA8"/>
Sun rising, it does naturally and necessarily imply, That <hi>C. D.</hi> murthered <hi>A. B.</hi> for the love of his Goods: Had the Prisoner taken the Goods, and spared the mans Life, the man would have discovered him, for he knew him; therefore, because otherwise, take the Goods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being discovered, he took away the mans Life also.</p>
                        <p>The Prisoner himself has disproved himself in his several Examinations: All Circumstances concurs with the Grand Inquests Judgment, <hi>That the Prisoner at the Bar is guilty both of the Murther and Fellony charged upon him.</hi> First, he said, he brought the Cheese home in the Evening, and left the English Goods in <hi>George Hazlwoods</hi> Shallop till the next Morning. Another time he sayes, he brought the Cheese home from <hi>Windham Landing,</hi> and hid the <hi>English Goods</hi> there in the Marsh for two or three dayes.</p>
                        <p>All his Serpentine Turnings, and Windings, and Self-contradictions are but like <hi>Irish Quag-Mires</hi> that have no sollid Ground, or Reason: He is incorporated into Evil by a long habit, in such sort, that his Understanding it self approveth it, and consenteth thereunto; His heart is so hardened, that Wickedness is therein rooted and framed, and as it were naturalized, end his Soul infected and wholly tainted therewith. All his Evasions whereby he endeavours to avoid the Punishment, are but the tying an Artificial Knot in the Halter, whereby to strangle his Conscience.</p>
                        <p>The Truth or Falseness, respectively, lies in the strength or weakness of the Arguments that are brought in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is not any of the Prisoners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions that he hath made at several times, but one is repugnant to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all his study cannot make his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000588_0010_0FA95829466B0D18"/>
words speak Reason, but doubtful and ambiguous words, with particular Reserves, argues a base Mind.</p>
                        <p>It is usual and necessarily lawful to judge of Causes by the Effects, that naturally and necessarily flow from them: The Man is found Murthered, and his Goods some found in the Prisoners house, some hid in the Hay, and some hid among Corn out of the House Evil Actions shew an evil Intent, and both put together declares Guilt.</p>
                        <p>Concerning my self, I bear no Malice to the mans Person, than I do to my dearest Friend; but I hate that cursed Principle of Cruelty and Fellony, which hath so long harboured in him.</p>
                        <p>And now, as the Truth is, I must conclude him guilty of the Murther and Fellony charged upon him; and that he who hath made himself a President in these parts of the World, in committing such Wickedness, I humbly desire, that this Court, for Justice sake, would make him an Example for others, for time to come, that men may hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly; That he, who would not be a Pattern to other Trades-men to live honestly in this Life, may be a President of Justice by his Death.</p>
                        <p>When the Prisoner was first apprehended, the Justice commanded the Constable to search his Pookets, from whence the Constable took a small parcel of Papers tyed together, and the Prisoner said, they were his own Papers; but when they were opened, the first Paper viewed, was a Bill from <hi>John Gillman</hi> to pay <hi>John Clark</hi> thirty Shillings; Then a large Paper was taken out of his Pocket, and he said, <hi>That was his Deed for a Town Lot he had lately purchased</hi>; but being viewed, it appeared to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000588_0011_0FA95829C67A5728"/>
