            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

and ſo are juſtifyed and made heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this change is made <hi>at once</hi> in the Soul; it is wrought in the twinkleing of an eye. There is wont ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a great deal of time ſpent in way of <hi>Preparation</hi> for this change: In order to this change there is wont to be a work of <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Humiliation;</hi> and tho' in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times we read of men paſſing thro' the work in a very little time, yet ordinarily we find that much time is conſumed in the work of Preparation: There be many temptations to be overcome, flatteries and diſcouragements to be removed; men loſe a great deal of time by falling into ſlumbers, by backwardneſs to reform ſome evils, by trying to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, by fearing that they are not elected, or that God has given them up to hardneſs of heart, by imagining their hearts to be better than they be, by unwillingneſs to own the Juſtice and Sovereignty of God, ſo that commonly ſeveral months are ſpent, and ſometimes ſome years, before they get thro' the work of Preparation; yet Converſion it ſelf is wrought at once, in the hearing of one paſſage in a Sermon, by the remembring of one Scripture. As it will be in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 Cor. 15:52. <hi>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump: for the trumpet ſhall ſound and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed:</hi> So it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Preparatory Work</hi> is no part of Converſion. It is an Antecedent to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but no part of Converſion. Sometimes under the work of Preparation, perſons are ſo exact in their Converſation, have ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Comforts that not only others, but themſelves alſo think that they are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they have very great reſemblances of Grace, they have many meltings of heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Sabbaths, zeal againſt Sin, as do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a great appearance of a gracious Spirit; but all that they attain unto is no part of the work of Converſion, they remain ſtill in a natural Condition, and their religious affections are but counterfeit Graces. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemed to himſelf as if he was <hi>alive,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he found himſelf <hi>to be dead,</hi> Rom. 7.9. <hi>I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, Sin revived and I died.</hi> Men under the work of Preparation are under the dominion and government of Sin, their corruptions are ſtunded but not mortifyed, they are reſtrained but not killed, they are like Vermin in the Winter, ſtupifyed but not dead; and whatever ſhew they make, they are deſtitute of Holineſs, in all their affections there is no love to God, in all their lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Sin there is no Godly Sorrow; their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002072_0005_0FBB7A841831B9C0"/>
religion proceeds only from Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Self-Love: The men are afraid of Hell, that makes them walk orderly, reſiſt Temptations and be ſorrowful for Sin; they hope that God is not ſo angry as he was, that makes them forward in duties of religion; they conſider the moral evil of many ſinful practices, and that begets ſome kind of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; they hope in ſuch and ſuch ways to win the favour of God, that makes them forward in duties of Religion and charity; they hope ſometimes that God has pardoned them, that makes them have ſtrong affections; but all theſe things are no part of Converſion: it may be ſaid to them as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 15.42. <hi>You have not the love of God in you.</hi> There is not one ſpark of Grace in them: Grace and Holineſs is quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind: When they have gone thro' <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> Work, Converſion remains wholly to be wrought.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Soul has performed <hi>one holy Action it is converted.</hi> One holy Action may be performed in the twinkling of an eye: An Act of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is done at once: And when the Soul has performed one holy Action it is converted: If one holy Action he Performed, there is a principle of Grace in the heart, there is a ſpirit of Love and Faith and Humility; and ſuch a perſon is in an eſtate of Juſtification. There is a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002072_0006_0FBB7A8594CCA948"/>
A man may carry temperately, chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or juſtly, a day or two, yet not be a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, chaſte or juſt man: but if he carries ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily one day, or one minute, he is an holy man. If he performs one act of Faith, he is a Believer; if he perform one act of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, he is a humble man. One act of Grace is an evidence that the mans heart is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and that he hath a principle of Grace: Men become morally temperate and chaſte by degrees, but they are not made Converts by degrees. The leaſt degree of Grace makes a man a Convert, or a Saint. Converſion may increaſe by degrees, men grow more and more holy by degrees, but Converſion is wrought at once; the firſt act of Grace makes a man a Convert.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Every man is <hi>under the Dominion of Sin,</hi> or <hi>delivered from the Dominion of Sin.</hi> Thoſe that are not converted, are under the dominion of Sin, enemies to God, ſpiritually dead; but they that are converted, are delivered from the dominion of Sin, ſubject to God, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alive; therefore Converſion muſt be in the twinkling of an eye: If there were any conſiderable time wherein this work were a doing, then at that time the man would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be under the dominion of Sin, nor delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the dominion of Sin; there would be a conſiderable time wherein he would be neither dead nor alive, and ſo neither in an eſtate of Condemnation nor Juſtification:

But ſurely, the next moment after his being freed from the dominion of Sin, he is ſubject to God. The ſame moment wherein he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Sin, he is an holy man.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That Grace given in Saving Converſion differs in Kind from all that went before.</head>
                     <p>SOme have been of opinion that <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> and <hi>common Grace</hi> differ only in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> that Sorrow for Sin increaſes till it becomes ſaving, and Love to God increaſes till it becomes ſaving: But certainly, ſaving Grace doth differ <hi>ſpecifically</hi> from all that went before: <hi>Gracious Actions</hi> are of another nature than <hi>Religious Actions</hi> of natural men. The acts of common Grace may be very ſtrong and powerful: The <hi>affections</hi> of the Children of Iſrael were very ſtrong when they <hi>ſang God's praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 106.12. The <hi>affections</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chriſt were very ſtrong, when they cryed, <hi>Hoſanna to the ſon of David:</hi> The affections of the <hi>Galations</hi> were ſtrong, when <hi>if it had been poſſible they would have plucked out their eyes, and have given them to Paul:</hi> And ſometimes the acts of ſaving Grace are very weak; there may be Godly Sorrow in a low degree; there may be an act of Faith
<pb facs="unknown:002072_0008_0FBB7A88A499ACB8"/>
with a great mixture of Unbelief; there may be true love to God where there is but little love to him: Grace is low and weak at firſt, yea, after thirty years growth it is exceeding defective: Indeed true love to God prizes God above all the world, but that doth not prove that it is in a great degree; there may be a ſpirit to prize God before all the world, yet but a ſmall degree of that ſpirit. Innor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love to the world is an affecting of that as the chief Good; when it is in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, it is ſo; that is the nature of it. So love to God whether in a greater degree or a leſs degree, is an affection to God as the chief Good: The difference between ſaving and common Grace don't lie in the <hi>degree,</hi> but in the <hi>nature</hi> of them. This may appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſaving Grace acts From <hi>other Motives</hi> and for <hi>another End</hi> than common Grace doth. The difference in motives and end, makes a ſpiritual difference in actions: If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do; they don't attend the will of God: When men <hi>depend on Chriſt</hi> to ſave them, from the incouragement of their own goodneſs, and meerly that they may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Hell, they act quite after another manner than the man doth that depends on Chriſt only from the encouragement of his

Excellency, and that he may be delivered from Sin as well as from Damnation: When a man <hi>mourns for Sin</hi> becauſe it expoſes him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt among men, or wrath from God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the moral evil of it, he doth quite another thing from that man, who mourns for it becauſe it is a wrong to a God of infinite Glory: If his Sorrow were in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that his nature is capable of, it would not be gracious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the difference between ſaving Grace and common Grace lay in the degree, <hi>no man could judge that his Grace is ſaving,</hi> Men may know that they have ſaving Grace, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. But if the difference lay in the degree, how ſhould men go about to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that their Grace was ſaving? The man may know that he has a greater degree of confidence, and ſorrow, and zeal, than formerly he had; he may have reaſon to think that he goeth beyond ſome other Profeſſors in theſe things; but upon what foundation can he determine that he hath them in ſuch a degree as to ſecure Salvation? Where has God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed what degree is ſaving and what is not ſaving? What warrant has any man to judge himſelf in a ſafe condition, if there be ſeveral degreſs of Grace that are not ſaving? What Rule can any Miniſter lay down to guide men in this matter? Men muſt needs be left in a perpetual uncertainty, and remain in the dark about their eternal eſtate. If a man ſaw that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002072_0010_0FBB7A8FA7ACD470"/>
he believed in Chriſt, that he repented of his Sins, that he aimed at the Glory of God, it would be little comfort to him, becauſe he could not tell that it was in ſuch a <hi>degree</hi> as to ſecure his Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Grace that is given in Converſion is <hi>new.</hi> When a man is converted it's wholly new; when God converts a man he gives him a <hi>new heart,</hi> and puts a <hi>new ſpirit</hi> within him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. He is a <hi>new creature;</hi> not in reſpect of his Soul or the Faculties of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in reſpect of the Inclinations of it. But if common and ſaving Grace differ only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, then his Grace is not wholly new, for he has had religious Joys and Sorrows, and a Zeal a long while; before he had ſaving Grace he had the ſame inclinations and ſpirit, only now it is heightned and increaſed; ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are new, but the inclinations themſelves are not new; ſo that Converſion wou'd be not the giving a new heart, but only an augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch inclinations as were there before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is an <hi>oppoſition between ſaving Grace and common Grace:</hi> If one be oppoſite to the other, then they differ ſpecifically: Thoſe diſpoſitions that have contratriety one to the other, that are at war one with the other, and would deſtroy one another, are not of the ſame kind; and truly theſe are ſo: Common Graces are Luſts, and do oppoſe ſaving Grace: Making his own Salvation his laſt end, is contrary to making the Glory of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002072_0011_0FBB7A90EC7852B8"/>
God his laſt end: Hating Sin, not becauſe it wrongs God, but becauſe it expoſes him, is reſiſting the Command of God: Bringing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing into ſubſerviency to his own ends, is oppoſite to the bringing every thing into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to God's Glory: The man that has but common Grace goeth quite in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther path than that which God directs unto: When he goeth about to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſs, he ſets himſelf againſt that way of Salvation God preſcribes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of ſuch men as have but common Grace, to the ways that godly men take.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Habitual and Actual Converſion are wrought together.</head>
                     <p>THoſe holy <hi>Habits</hi> and Inclinations that God puts into the hearts of his People, are not viſible in themſelves; men cannot diſcern them but by their <hi>actings:</hi> As men are not able to ſee their own Souls, ſo they are not able to ſee thoſe habits that are in them, but only by their actings: They have a power to reflect on the operations of their hearts, and ſo come to the knowledge of thoſe habits that are in them; but they cannot ſee
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002072_0012_0FBB7A9263C9A6D0"/>
thoſe habits immediately: Hence no man is able upon his experience to tell the very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute when the habits of Grace were put into him: And generally men have thought that: the habits of Grace are put into men before their cloſing with Chriſt; and they have been wont to argue in that manner, that there muſt be holy principles before holy actions, there muſt be life before there be life acts: But there is no neceſſity of this; the faculty of acting, muſt be before the action, the cauſe muſt be before the effect; the man muſt have a being before he can have any operation; but it doth not follow from thence, that there muſt be a gracious habit before there be any gracious action: There is no neceſſity that there be an <hi>antecedent habit,</hi> it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if there be a <hi>concomitant habit</hi> and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There was no neceſſity that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould have an habit of Love to <hi>Rachel</hi> before he actually loved her; that <hi>Michal</hi> ſhould have an habit of loving <hi>David</hi> before ſhe actually loved him; there was no neceſſity that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have an habitual inclination to Sin before they <hi>did ſin:</hi> So, there is no neceſſity that men ſhould have an inclination to believe in Chriſt and love God, before they do actually believe in Chriſt and love God; it is ſufficient that there be a concomitant inclination that way: And thus it is from time to time; wherever there is an act of Faith and Love, there is a diſpoſition to act
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002072_0013_0FBB7A93DA3D0698"/>
ſo for the time to come; but there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in Nature that the inclination ſhould be antecedent.</p>
                     <p>And this ſuppoſition of an antecedent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclination before actual Converſion, is attended with this inſuparable difficulty; That a man may have gracious habits, and yet be in a ſtate of condemnation; that he may have a ſanctified heart, yet be for a time under the Curſe; that his heart may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and yet abide for a time under the Curſe. That he may be ſanctified yet not juſtified; for there is no Juſtification till there is actual Faith. When it is ſaid in Scripture that we are juſtified by Faith, the meaning is not that we are juſtified by an habit of Faith, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faith; for that Faith is ſet forth by words ſignifying Action; by believing on Chriſt, receiving Chriſt, coming to Chriſt, opening to him: It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 15.6. The Condition of Juſtification muſt be wrought by us; thence it is actual Faith that is intended: A diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to yield perfect obedience was not the fulfilling the Condition of the Covenant of Works; if that would have done, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> would have been juſtified us ſoon as they were made. So a diſpoſition to believe is not a fulfilling the Condition of the Covenant of Grace; but actual believing.</p>

                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002072_0014_0FBB7A954E10FF78"/>Moreover, it is evident that habitual and actual Converſion are together, becauſe both of them are effected by the ſame divine act, <hi>viz.</hi> The diſcovery of the <hi>truth and glory of the Goſpel.</hi> I am far from thinking that God is tied up unto this way; or that he cannot give the habits of Grace without ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; but it is evident from the Word of God that he doth work the habit of Grace, and draws forth the act of Grace in this way: That he doth give this principle &amp; gracious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this way is plainly taught; 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Changing into the image of God is by giving the habits of Grace unto them; beholding the glory of God as in a Glaſs is the diſcerning the Glory of God in the Goſpel. We are taught the ſame alſo in 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation men do receive the habits of Grace, the heart is renewed, and the man is made a new man; and this is wrought thro' the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by the Goſpel, as <hi>underſtood;</hi> for it is in this way and no other that the Goſpel hath any gracious Efficacy on the heart: If a man hears the Goſpel twenty years, and has not the ſpiritual underſtanding of it, it will have no gracious effect upon him; but he diſcovers what a glorious way of Salvation God has prepared, and that works a great change in his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002072_0015_0FBB7A96C8D4E8F8"/>
heart: The ſame is taught, Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth:</hi> that is, by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which he calls the <hi>word of truth</hi> by way of excellency, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the truth of it was queſtioned by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by this diſcovery God draws forth the exerciſe of Faith at the ſame time; that diſcovery makes men immediately to receive the Goſpel. When men have a ſpiritual ſight of Chriſt, they will believe on him; if they withſtood the calls before and objected, they will be prevailed on by that ſight; Joh. 1.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the ſon and believeth on him may have everlasting life.</hi> And v. 45. <hi>Every man that hath beard and learned of the Father co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo impoſſible in Nature but that men when they do believe in Chriſt ſhould have an inclination or diſpoſition to come to him. Men may do ſome things out of a kind of compulſion, and do them upon ſome accidental, by conſideration, and yet hate to do them at the ſame time: But the accepting of Chriſt is always an act of great freedom; when they do it, they do it out of choice: Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> They do it from conviction of the preciouſneſs of Chriſt and benefit of coming to him; they love to come, and have a diſpoſition to do ſo for the future.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Believing in Chriſt is the firſt Act of Converſion.</head>
                     <p>MEN that are converted do exerciſe all manner of Grace; They perform acts of Love, and Fear, and Submiſſion, and godly Sorrow, and Patience, and Humility; but the firſt act of Converſion is to <hi>believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There is no other gracious act that goeth before Faith. In <hi>this reſpect</hi> Converſion is wrought after the ſame manner in all that are converted: After the firſt act of Grace there is no certain order in the exerciſe of Graces, but this act of believing in Chriſt has the preceeding in all. Some men don't make a beginning in Godlineſs in loving God, and others in ſorrow for Sin, and others in patience, and others in humility; but they all begin by <hi>receiving Christ as offered in the Goſpel:</hi> Falſe Converſions begin ſome in one way and ſome in another, but ſaving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion always begins with believing in Chriſt. The man did a great deal in Religion before he believed in Chriſt, but he had no true Love, nor godly Sorrow, nor Humility before: True Holineſs takes its riſe here, this is their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in at the ſtrait gate: There is no ſure ſign of Election before this, therefore we
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002072_0017_0FBB7AA0972DF1D8"/>
are adviſed to <hi>make our election</hi> ſure by our <hi>calling,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. This is that which brings men into an eſtate of Juſtification: <hi>He that believeth on him hath everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.36. Whatever went before gave the Man no title to Life Eternal: There is no need of Holineſs to go before Faith: If there were need of Holineſs before Faith, either it would be to encourage men to believe; but there is encouragement enough without that, the Grace of God offered in the Goſpel and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are ſufficient encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, tho' men never did one good deed; for <hi>God just fieth the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. That is thoſe who have lived an ungodly life 'till the very minute of their cloſing with Chriſt: Or elſe, if there were need of proceeding Holineſs, it would be to incline the heart to come to Chriſt; but there muſt be ſome firſt act of Holineſs, and there is no neceſſity of any proceeding Holineſs to incline men to do the firſt act of Holineſs. When God diſcovers Chriſt, that inclines the heart to come unto him. Beſides, We may conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Sinners at their firſt coming to Chriſt, <hi>ſee nothing in themſelves to incourage them to come.</hi> When Sinners come at firſt to Chriſt they are <hi>weary and heavy</hi>

blind, and naked,</hi> Rev. 3.17. Tho' formerly they thought themſelves alive, yet they are convinced that they are dead: They take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from <hi>Christ, and the Grace and Faithfulneſs of God;</hi> but they ſee no good in themſelves to be an encouragement to them: Afterwards, godly men ſee ſomewhat in themſelves that is an encouragement to them: they can ſay ſometimes as <hi>David, I love the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 116.1. And as <hi>Job, Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked,</hi> Job. 10.7. And tho' they depend on Chriſt and the Grace of God alone; yet it is an encouragement to them to ſee the Grace of the Spirit in themſelves. But Sinners at their firſt coming to Chriſt, ſee nothing in themſelves to be an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That men are <hi>ſanctifyed by faith.</hi> Act. 26.18. <hi>Sanctified by faith in me.</hi> Act. 15.9. <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their hearts by faith.</hi> Their Love and Repentance are the fruit of Faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other holy carriages are antecedent to Faith. All that are Unbelievers are deſtitute of other Graces: If there be appearances of Repentance and Love to God's Glory, they are but deluſions: If other gracious carriages depend on Faith, they do not preceed Faith; for the effect is not before the cauſe. If Faith have no being it can have no operation: If there were any Holineſs that went before Faith, that Sanctification is not thro' Faith in Chriſt, then their hearts were purified without Faith.</p>

The <hi>Goſpel is the means of Converſion.</hi> It is by the Goſpel that the hearts of men are made holy: 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have begotten you thro' the Goſpel.</hi> The works of Creation and common Providence teach men to be holy, but don't make men holy: So the Law or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works</hi> teacheth men that they ſhould be holy, but that don't make men holy; but it is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that makes men holy: When <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to preach the Goſpel, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to turn men from the power of Satan unto God; and if the Goſpel be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Converſion, men have no Holineſs 'till they do receive the Goſpel. So long as the offers of the Goſpel are rejected or neglected, it can have no ſanctifying efficacy on them: it may work ſome common affections, but it don't change their hearts. If men are not wrought upon by the Goſpel to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to Chriſt, it hath no other gracious effect on them. The firſt gracious effect of the Goſpel is to make men come to Chriſt, other gracious effects are conſequential to this.</p>

and unprofitable; that there is ingratitude, injuſtice and impudence in it: If they conſider ſuch things a thouſand times over, that will not mortify their corruptions; but it is God that doth it; and the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth it, is by <hi>infuſing a principle of Grace</hi> into the heart. The infuſion of Grace and the mortification of corruption, are at the ſame inſtant. Mortification of corruption don't follow after the infuſion of Grace, but is contemporary with it. 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and all things are made new.</hi> Theſe two works are done by the ſame operation. God don't put forth two operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one to make men gracious, the other to kill their corruptions; but the ſame divine act has theſe two effects, to give new inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſtroy the old. God reſtrains the corruptions of men before he puts Grace into them; and takes away much of thoſe evil habits that men had contracted by a Courſe of Sin: He doth that by terrifying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, giving ſome common encouragements, and by humane reſtraints, &amp; education; but it is by giving Grace to the Soul that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is mortifyed. Corruption is not mortifyed before the infuſion of Grace, neither is the infuſion of Grace before mortification; but they are wrought at once by the ſame act.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The ſame light that works gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclinations, doth deſtroy Sin. The
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002072_0028_0FBB7ABDDA8C5F18"/>
way wherein God communicates Grace is by teaching men how glorious he is. He lets in <hi>Goſpel Light,</hi> and ſo works gracious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Men ſee the <hi>reaſon</hi> why they ſhould love God, truſt in Chriſt, and be humble, and this inclines the heart that way. God deals with men as with rational creatures; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to them the <hi>Reaſon and Foundation</hi> of holy carriages, and ſo diſpoſes the heart to them: 2 Cor. 4.18. <hi>We all beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> He makes them know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo makes them ſincere. Pſal. 36, 10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> He teaches them, and ſo they come to Chriſt: Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> And it is the ſame way that he mortifies their corruption. This light weans them from the world, kills the pride of their hearts. This light makes them hate the ways of Sin. At the ſame time that they ſee reaſon to exalt God, they ſee the evil of pride. When they ſee reaſon to love God, they ſee that there is no reaſon to dote on the world, Act. 26.18. <hi>To turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Natural Corruption is nothing elſe but the privation of Holineſs. Contracted habits have ſomething poſitive in them, but natural corruption is only the privation of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002072_0029_0FBB7ABF49404940"/>
Holineſs. When Man loſt the image of God, there was nothing poſitive put into him. The condition of man by nature is, that he is deſtitute of Love, and Faith, and Humility; and thence he runs into evil, and is diſpoſed to love the world, and ſet up himſelf above God. This ſhews that the very giving of Grace mortifies corruption. When the habit is given, the privation is expell'd. When light comes into the eye, the darkneſs is gone: When ſight is given to men, blindneſs is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: When life came into <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he was delivered from Death: When love to God is put into the Soul, innordinate ſelf-love is mortifyed. When Faith is wrought in the heart, Unbelief is mortifyed. When men are made humble, their Pride is morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. When God conveys ſpiritual Life to men, without any more to do, they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſpiritual Death: Rom. 8.2. <hi>The law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, has made me free from the law of ſin and of death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Holineſs doth imply in it a hatred to Sin. Where Sin is hated it is mortifyed; that was <hi>Paul's</hi> ſpirit, Rom. 7.15. <hi>What I hate, that I do.</hi> When Sin is hated, then the ſtrength of it is abated. The ſtrength of Sin lies in men's <hi>love</hi> to Sin. Wherever Sin is hated as the greateſt evil it is mortified: As it loſeth the love of men, ſo it loſeth it's ſtrength. That was a ſign of <hi>David's</hi> morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that he hated vain thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:002072_0030_0FBB7AC0CFE78498"/>
119.113. And wherever there is Holineſs there is an hatred of Sin. If the heart of a man be inclined to believe, he hates unbelief; unbelief is contrary to that inclination: So, if a man have an inclination to love God as his chief Good, he will hate the workings of pride and worldlineſs, the ſetting up any other thing above God. Sinful inclinations are enemies to Holineſs, and holy inclinations are enemies to Sin. They have a tendency in themſelves to deſtroy one another: Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other.</hi> There is a warfare between Grace and Corruption, they ſeek the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The more degrees of Grace men get, the more Sin is mortifyed. The more men put on the new man, the more they put off the old man. Holineſs and Mortification hold an exact proportion one to the other. As one Scale riſes, the other falls: As water comes into the veſſel, the air is expelled: The more light is in the air, the leſs darkneſs: 2 Sam. 3.1. <hi>David waxed stronger and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the houſe of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</hi> As Grace flouriſheth, ſo Sin dies. Whenever there is any addition to Grace, there is a proportionable ſubſtraction from Corruption. The more humility, the leſs pride. They that are very humble, are not very proud. They that have a great deal of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002072_0031_0FBB7AC499A9AFD8"/>
Faith, have but little Unbelief. And when Grace ſhall be perfected, no Sin ſhall remain; the perfection of Grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oth expel all Sin. Where there is perfect light, there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 1 Joh. 15. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> Where there is perfect beauty, there is no blemiſh. Eph. 5.27. <hi>Not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy without blemiſh.</hi>

And the way wherein he doth it, is by <hi>letting ſpiritual light into the Soul;</hi> by irradiating the mind, letting in beams of light into the heart.

While men remain in darkneſs, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Kingdom of darkneſs; but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the mind he changes the heart.

If the perſwaſions do beget ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, if they do beget ſome reſolutions, if they prevail on men to make ſome attempts; yet they don't make men holy: Men muſt be taught of God elſe they will not be holy.

Fear will make men hypocrites, but not Saints. Pſal. 78.34. <hi>When he flew them, then they ſought him,</hi> but, v. 36. <hi>They flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue.</hi> The <hi>fear of Hell</hi> will not make men hate ſin more than hell: Puniſhments will not make men holy. Hell-fire will not purge away men's droſs. One glimpſe of the Glory of God, will do more than all the puniſhments in the world to make men holy. Cant. 1.4. <hi>Draw me and I will run after thee.</hi>

This makes it evident, that men are capable to behold the glory of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the habitual change. God diſcovers his Glory, and that inclines him to aſſent and draws forth an actual aſſent. Which may be further conſidered by theſe conſiderations.</p>

Man <hi>in his corrupted estate has his natural faculty of underſtanding.</hi> He hath the faculty of underſtanding in his corrupted eſtate, and in his renewed eſtate. A godly man has not two faculties of underſtanding, one whereby he knows God, and another whereby he knows other things; but by the faculty of underſtanding he knows God and Chriſt, and the truth of promiſes, and likewiſe rules of art, the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the natural cauſes. Where there is a natural underſtanding, endued with literal knowledge, and aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, there is a power to know God: In that caſe there is nothing wanting in order to the ſpiritual knowledge of God.

An <hi>habitual change in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, don't give men a power to know God.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged, that there is ſuch a thing as an habitual change in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Godly men have a ſanctified mind; they have a principle put into them, that leads them to judge aright concerning God and Chriſt; and a principle of Faith to receive the teſtimony of God: But habits dont give men a power to know. We muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between a faculty of power and an habit: An habit is only an inclination to do a thing; an habit fits a man to do a thing with more facility and dexterity. Habits are not faculties; they don't enable men to do what they could not do before; they diſpoſe and incline the heart that way. A natural man has a prevailing inclination to judge wrong concerning God, and an oppoſition to believe right concerning God; his mind is averſe to the reception of thoſe doctrines that the Scripture teaches concerning God; but yet he has the faculty or power to judge

This <hi>actual light which men receive from the Spirit of God, doth beget habitual light.</hi> It is in this caſe as in many others; a man that has had experience of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hony, is inclined thereby to judge ſo from time to time: He that has had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſaltneſs of the ſea, is inclined to judge it ſo: And he that has underſtood the gloriouſneſs of God, is prepared and diſpoſed thereby to judge ſo from time to time. This diſcovery leaves ſuch a ſenſe and impreſſion on the heart, as inclines it for ever to judge ſo concerning God: They never forget what they have ſeen, and ſo are inclined to judge after the like manner. And the more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have eminent diſcoveries of God and Chriſt, the more ſtrongly they are inclined to judge ſo, and to reject the contrary temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Repeated diſcoveries ſtrengthen the habit, and diſpoſe them with more readineſs to judge ſo.

                     <p>MAny men that have had experience of this ſpiritual light, are able to give a very poor account how it doth at firſt work in their heart. The underſtanding is ſo quick in it's operations, that the ſteps of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that are made to the ſoul, dont fall under their obſervation. They may be able to give ſome account what they ſaw, that they ſaw ſuch and ſuch encouragement to come to Chriſt; but they don't know how they came to be convinced of it. But we have abundant cauſe to conclude, that the firſt diſcovery that is made is of the <hi>gloriouſneſs of God.</hi> The knowledge of God is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all religion: Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving-kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> Joh. 1.3. <hi>This is eternal life to know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou hast ſent.</hi>

                     <p>Two things will make this evident.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The <hi>ſpiritual knowledge of God doth not depend upon the ſpiritual knowledge of other things.</hi> There needs no antecedent diſcoveries in order to the ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of God. When God opens the eyes of men, and gives ſpiritual underſtanding to them, there are two ways wherein they may ſee the glory of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>reaſoning from the works of Creation and common Providence.</hi> There is a great diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the glory of God in making the world, Pſal. 19.1. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy works.</hi> Iſai. 6.3. <hi>The whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> And when they behold the work of God, they may readily ſee, if their eyes be opened, that theſe things were made by a God of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, and wiſdom, and goodneſs. There is a ſelf-evidencing light in theſe works of God, ſhewing that they are the effects of a God of infinite glory. The world is a glaſs, reflecting the glory of God; and when men's eyes are opened, they may plainly ſee it. So in other of the great works of God; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deluge, the burning of Sodom, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of Iſrael out of Egypt, maintaining them in the wilderneſs, &amp;c. God often puts us in mind, that he has <hi>created the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.</hi> That is an abundant manifeſtation to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he is a glorious God, worthy to be believed, and loved, and obeyed. When men's eyes are opened, they ſee the force of the argument, they are at once ſatisfyed about the glorious properties of God. Reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Spirit of God, teaches men convincingly what God is.</p>

The holineſs of the law, and the wiſdom and grace that appears in the goſpel, are in themſelves very evidential of God's glory. And tho' multitudes of men that read and hear the word, are not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the divine authority of it; yet when God lets in beams of ſpiritual light, they receive it as the <hi>word of God;</hi> they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it proceeds from a God of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Glory. When God ſhines into the heart, they ſee the <hi>glory of God in the face of Jeſus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>They do with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. They ſay, ſuch things would never <hi>have entered into the heart of man,</hi> if God had not revealed them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</p>

                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The <hi>ſpiritual knowledge of other things, doth depend on the ſpiritual knowledge of God.</hi> The knowledge of particular reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truths doth depend upon the knowledge of God.

all <hi>Faith</hi> doth depend upon our aſſurance of the <hi>faithfulneſs of God:</hi> But when once we are convinced of the faithfulneſs of God, we are prepared to believe whatever God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. If God reveals things that are beyond natural reaſon to comprehend, as the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God;</hi> ſuch men will believe it. If God reveals things that are very contrary to carnal reaſon; As, that God is angry with carnal men, tho' they live in great proſperity; and that he delights in godly men, and will ſave them, tho' they are low, and in great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If he promiſes pardon to them that have been very ſinful, if they accept of the offers of the Goſpel, ſuch men will believe it. The conſideration of the everlaſting faithfulneſs of God, will overcome all objections. If men were at never ſo much loſs about the truth of them before, and rejected them as falſe, or ſuſpended their belief, looking on them as uncertain; yet as ſoon as ever he underſtands the faithfulneſs of God, the darkneſs of his mind is removed; he ſees a foundatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they laboured in that that they might get ſomething to incline the heart of God towards them, that might appeaſe his anger, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his love: But when they have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they are ſatisfyed in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his grace; they ſee that there is enough in his own heart to move him, that there is an infinite ocean of grace there, that his thoughts are not as our thoughts, that there is an <hi>height and depth, and length and breadth in the love of God,</hi> that it <hi>paſſeth knowledge;</hi> that he can pity his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and love thoſe that have nothing to commend them. They ſay he is God and not man: His mercy dont depend on any excellency in them. His grace is ſovereign grace, and he has <hi>mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Though it be a great thing to be pardoned and ſaved, yet it is not too much for him to do. There is no need of any thing to move his heart; he can do it becauſe it pleaſeth him. They were wont formerly to limit the mercy of God, and to think it would have been ſufficient, if they had not been ſuch great ſinners, or if they were more broken for their ſins; but now they are convinced, that if they were worſe than they are, that the mercy of God is ſufficient for them; that there is an infiniteneſs in the grace of God; and after they have reckoned up many things that grace can do, that there is infinitely more than they can think of.

But no man is able to give an exact account of all that he did ſee at that time The thing was done in the twinkling of an eye; and tho' men never forget it, yet they cannot call to mind all that they were convinced of; no, not if they were to give
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002072_0050_0FBB7AF3266CC2F0"/>
an account the next hour. Men have not at that time the actual underſtanding of all goſpel principles: Indeed they ſaw that that way of Salvation that they had been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years inſtructed in was true; but they have not the actual underſtanding of them at the very time: Yet they did ſee, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally underſtood at the time, a great deal more than they can remember.</p>
                     <p>This may appear by theſe things,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the <hi>ſhortneſs of the time</hi> wherein this diſcovery is made. There is but a very little time between the opening of the eyes, and the hearts cloſing with Chriſt, &amp; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is wont to laſt but a little time; and ſo it is impoſſible that he ſhould have a diſtinct remembrance of every thing that he ſaw, The <hi>Spouſe</hi> gives a very particular deſcription of Chriſt in figurative expreſſions, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>from v.</hi> 16. <hi>ad fin.</hi> And ſo Godly men are able to do from what they find in the word of God; but they can remember but a little account of what they ſaw at that time. If a man caſt up his eyes to heaven, he ſees a multitmde of ſtars; but is not able to give a particular account of what he ſaw of the ſeveral ſtars and conſtellations. So, if a man ſhould caſt his eye upon a beautiful Perſon, he is much affected with his beauty; but he can't give a particular account of all his features, the comelineſs of his forehead, eyes, cheeks and lips, nor give
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002072_0051_0FBB7AF48B2CFE10"/>
a deſcription of them. If a man ſhould caſt his eye upon a <hi>Garden</hi> wherein there is a variety of flowers, he may be much affected with it, yet not able to tell particularly what ſorts of flowers he ſaw. Or if he ſhould caſt his eye upon a curious piece of <hi>Embroidery,</hi> he may perceive immediately that there is much curioſity in it; but he can't give an account of all the colours and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances that he caſt his eye upon. Thus it is when men's eyes are opened. They ſee the way of Salvation to be a glorious way, but they can't tell particularly all that they ſaw; they had but a tranſient ſight, and could not take ſuch diſtinct notice of things, as to lay them up in their memory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There <hi>is need of the actual knowledge of many goſpel Truths, in order to the firſt cloſing with Chriſt.</hi> They heard of thoſe things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, but they underſtood nothing in a right manner before; but they muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them in order to their cloſing with Chriſt.

compaſſion in the heart of God; that he has no need of any external motive to draw his heart; that he can overlook all manner of provocations, <hi>has mercy on whom he will, and compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion,</hi> as Rom. 9.15. Some men at the time had their thoughts more taken up about the <hi>Sacrifice of Christ,</hi> how he has born the curſe, bought us with a price, made his Soul an offering for Sin, fully ſatisfyed the Juſtice of God. And ſome others have their thoughts at the time more fixed upon the <hi>Faithfulneſs of God,</hi> that his <hi>words are pure words,</hi> that he is <hi>not as a man that he ſhould lie, nor the Son of man that he ſhould repent;</hi> that his word is a ſure foundation to build upon.

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> This Spiritual Light doth diſcover thoſe things that Men were convinced of before under the Work of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in a better manner than they ſaw them before.</head>
                     <p>BEfore God converts men, it is his manner to prepare them for it by a common work of his Spirit, which is called <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory,</hi> which puts men upon it to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſeeking after reconciliation. Men are called upon to <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs;</hi> to <hi>labour not for the meat that periſhes, but for that meat that doth endure unto eternal life.</hi> And men are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for ſlighty ſeeking, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. Many ſeek and are not able to enter. And that was the happineſs of ſome, their hearts were mightily ſet in ſeeking the kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.13. Men are labouring, ſome a long while for peace with God before they are converted: They are convinced of the vanity of the world, and of the neceſſity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God and eternal life: They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002072_0055_0FBB7B00B605BE10"/>
alſo of the inſufficiency of their own righteouſneſs, ſo as to relinquiſh hopes from that, but when God lets in ſpiritual light to convert men, that doth diſcover the ſame that they ſaw under the work of preparation; and that after a better manner than they ſaw them before.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When God gives ſpiritual light and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his Grace and the Glory of Chriſt to the Soul, that <hi>diſcovers thoſe things that they ſaw under the work of preparation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That will diſcover the <hi>terribleneſs of Damnation.</hi> One thing that Sinners are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of under the work of preparation is, that the wrath of God is terrible: And they are wont to cry out as he, <hi>What must I do to be ſaved,</hi> Act. 16.30. And as <hi>David, There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh becauſe of thine anger, nor any rest in my bones becauſe of my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 48.3. They ſee they have expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the heavy wrath of God, and are liable to damnation, which is intollerable. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Who can dwell with devouring fire who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> And the ſenſe of this is wont to fill them with <hi>Terror;</hi> they are afraid of dying quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they are urged in ſpirit to cry to God, and beg the pardon of their Sins. This ſtirs them up carefully to reform their lives, and leave off all ſinful practices, and to reſiſt temptations. This makes them ſenſible of the vanity of the world. And
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002072_0056_0FBB7B020A1A7CA0"/>
when goſpel light is let into men, they will ſee the terribleneſs of the wrath of God for Sin. If they did not ſee that, they would not ſee the neceſſity of coming to Chriſt for Salvation; but when they ſee the truth of the Goſpel, they will be convinced of that; for then they will ſee the faithfulneſs of God, and the truth of the threatnings of the law: Then they will believe the greatneſs of Chriſt's ſufferings, and thereby ſee the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrath of God for Sin. Luk. 23.31. <hi>If theſe things be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi> In the ſorrows of Chriſt they will diſcern how intollerable the wrath of God is, and what need there is of deliverance from it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That will diſcover the <hi>vanity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of men's own righteouſneſs.</hi> Under the work of preparation they are by degrees led into the underſtanding of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, that they can do nothing to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the wrath, or merit the favour of God. When ſinners are in diſtreſs of conſcience, they are wont to labour to lay ſome bonds on the juſtice, or faithfulneſs, or mercy of God; and in length of time God is wont to ſhew them that their righteouſneſs dont an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the law, ſatisfys for no Sin, can't draw the heart of God to them; that by their beſt works they are meriting condemnation; that their hearts are full of enmity to God; that they have no power to do any good; that
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002072_0057_0FBB7B03A19A0918"/>
they have nothing of their own to depend upon, but ſtand in need of free grace and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: And when the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel light is let into them, that teaches them the emptineſs of their own works. When men ſee the excellency of Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they ſee it is a vain thing for them to think to pacify God themſelves; they ſhall never be able to get any thing of their own that is comparable to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: That alone will ſerve their turn, and they have no need of any other. Phil. 3.7. <hi>What things were gain to me, thoſe I count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loſs for Christ.</hi> When men ſee their own hearts under the work of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> they ſee the vanity of their own righteouſneſs; but when they ſee the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they ſee further into the vanity of it, and prefer Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and count <hi>their own</hi> as <hi>dung</hi> in compariſon with Chriſt's. Phil. 3.8. <hi>And count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are convinced of theſe things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>better manner</hi> than they are under the work of preparation. Under the work of preparation, they are convinced of them by the illuminations of <hi>natural Conſcience.</hi> They ſee there is great danger of damnation, and that damnation is intolerable, and that the world is vain; that their own righteouſneſs cannot draw the heart of God; that it is juſt with God to deſtroy them. And ſome things
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002072_0058_0FBB7B0514C780F8"/>
they are convinced of by <hi>Experience;</hi> as, that they are blind, and under the dominion of their ſins, that they are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> But when ſpiritual light is let into them, they know theſe things after a better manner; then they ſee theſe by faith; they believe the teſtimony of God in his word, and this has a better effect upon the heart. He ſees ſo much of the world, that he hates a worldly ſpirit; he ſees the vanity of a worldly ſpirit, ſo that it is mortifyed ever after; and the vanity of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hates a ſelf-righteous ſpirit.</p>

but one and the ſame ſoul, diverſely deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated according to <hi>two</hi> ſeveral <hi>ways of working,</hi> which are inſeparably conjoined. When the ſoul has this ſpiritual light, it neceſſarily acts accordingly. Therefore the way to converſion is this,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The ſoul <hi>ſees the reaſon and foundation of ſpiritual carriages.</hi> Holy carriages are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable; but whatever is preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men to perſwade them, nothing will have any efficacy on them, until God gives ſpiritual light; for naturally they are blind, they are at a loſs about the reality of thoſe things, tho' they make a continual profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: But when God ſhines into their hearts with the light of life, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of thoſe things that are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch carriages. They counted them probable before, but now they are evident to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They ſee the <hi>foundations of faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> When the eyes of men are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſee the gracious Nature of God, that he can have mercy on whom he will have mercy, that he can find in his heart to have compaſſion, on them, though they be meer creatures and uncapable to be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to him, though they cannot recompence him; and though ſinful creatures, whatever be the number and aggravation of their ſins: they ſee that there is an <hi>excellency</hi> in the <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002072_0060_0FBB7B099B1BED18"/>
kindneſs</hi> of God. Pſal. 36.7. They are convinced that none is like to God in Mercy; that he can abundantly pardon; that <hi>his ways are not as our ways;</hi> that he is the God of all Grace; that his mercy is unlimited; that his mercy paſſes knowledge; and ſo their unworthineſs is no ground of diſcouragement. He ſees alſo a ſufficiency in Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt is precious in his eyes.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. God has made a new and living way by the blood of Chriſt; what tears would not do, what thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams could not effect, that has been done by the <hi>blood of Christ;</hi> Chriſt has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all the challenges of the Law, and made reconciliation, bought off our Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made a purchaſe of Eternal Life, he has fulfilled every jot and title of the law, there be <hi>unſearchable riches in Chriſt,</hi> there is blood enough to cleanſe away all Sin, a ſacrifice ſufficient to make atonement, price enough for our redemption, ſo that they may be ſav'd without any reflection on the Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God. He alſo ſees the <hi>faithfulneſs of God</hi> in the offers of the Goſpel. God invites him to come to Jeſus Chriſt, and commands him to believe, and has promiſed to accept of him in a way of coming to Chriſt, Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the prophets witneſs that through his name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall have remiſſion of Sins.</hi> And when men ſee thoſe things, they ſee abundant incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come to Chriſt, theſe incouragements
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002072_0061_0FBB7B0B86C43D20"/>
remove all difficulties, there is no one objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but is eaſily anſwered, the way is clear &amp; plain, they ſee there can be no danger in rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ſee the <hi>foundation of love.</hi> When their eyes are opened to ſee the <hi>gloriouſneſs of God,</hi> they muſt needs ſee the reaſon why they ſhould love him: for all the attributes of God, <hi>are lovely;</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> is lovely; his <hi>Mercy</hi> is very endearing that he has a heart to pardon Sin; and to provide a way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for Sinners; his <hi>Glory</hi> is renowned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account. Mic. 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity,</hi> —c. God is mightily praiſed in the Church upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that his mercy endured for ever. His <hi>Justice</hi> alſo is a lovely excellent property, his name is celebrated upon that account; the church praiſes him upon that conſideration: Rev. 19.2. <hi>That true and righteous are his judgments.</hi> So his <hi>Holineſs</hi> is lovely; the <hi>Seraphims</hi> cry before him, <hi>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> His <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is lovely; that is his glory that he <hi>ſearches the heart and trys the reins of the children of men.</hi> Jer. 17.10. His <hi>Power</hi> is lovely. Pſal. 21.13. <hi>Be thou exalted Lord by thy own Strength, ſo will we ſing and praiſe thy Power.</hi> His <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> is lovely; that is his commendation, that <hi>his faithfulneſs reacheth unto the clouds.</hi> Pſal. 36.5. that he remembers his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from generataion to generation. He is
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002072_0062_0FBB7B0E4C9E5CA8"/>
praiſe worthy becauſe of <hi>all his attributes;</hi> he therein excels all men and Angels; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be loved <hi>with all the heart, and with all the ſoul, and with all the ſtrength.</hi> All his Attributes are Perfections, and we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to delight in him. He is ſo excellent on the account of them that we have reaſon to make it the buſineſs of our lives to glorifie him; we have reaſon to take a complacency in him, and chuſe him for our portion. When men ſee thoſe attributes, they ſee upon what account he may juſtly challenge their love.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They ſee the <hi>foundation of humility.</hi> When this Spiritual light ſhines into Men, and they ſee the gloriouſneſs of God, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that <hi>all nations to him are as the drop of the bucket, and as the duſt of the ballance, they are before him as nothing, and they are leſs than nothing and vanity,</hi> as 'tis ſaid, Iſai. 49.15, 17. There is abundant reaſon to be thankful to him for the leaſt mercy, and to ſay as <hi>David</hi> that <hi>he humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are upon the earth,</hi> as Pſal. 113.6. And that it becomes them to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his diſpoſals in all things; to ſacrifice all their intereſts to his glory, and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to his voice in every thing; to be abaſed becauſe of their Sins, and lie in the duſt before him, as <hi>Job</hi> did, Job. 12.5.6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

ſelf and repent in dust and aſhes.</hi> When their eyes are opened to ſee God's glory, they ſee reaſon to lie low before him. Pſal. 8.3.4. When <hi>I conſider the heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and ſtars that thou hast or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man that thou viſitest him.</hi> When men ſee the gloriouſneſs of God, they ſee it an unreaſonable thing to ſet up their wiſdom againſt the wiſdom of God, and their will againſt the will of God, and their intereſt againſt the glory of God. They ſee an infinite difference between God and them, and that there is all reaſon that they ſhould be humble.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. When they <hi>ſee the foundation of holy carriages, they do immediately carry holily.</hi> They forthwith come to Chriſt with a ſpirit of love and humility. When he ſees the foundation of gracious carriages, he will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry graciouſly. Now he acts reaſonably in truſting in Chriſt and loving God. While he was in the dark he was unperſwadable; they might as ſoon prevail with a ſtone as with him: But when he ſees that that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motive, that will work upon his heart. When men ſee reaſon to be afraid, they will be afraid, and when they ſee reaſon to hope, they will hope. So, when they ſee reaſon to believe, they will believe; thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction always prevails on the heart; God
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002072_0064_0FBB7B135CD1A7B0"/>
carries on his work by <hi>Light.</hi> When ſuitable light is let int o the heart, ſinners are ſcared; and when they ſee their own badneſs, they are broken off from their own righteouſneſs; and when they are <hi>turned from darkneſs to light,</hi> they are <hi>turned from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God,</hi> Act. 26.18. When God teaches men, then they come to Chriſt; Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When they ſee the foundation of holy carriages they are <hi>able to carry holily.</hi> Men cannot come to Chriſt unleſs the Father draw them, Joh. 6.44. But the way whereby he draws them is by <hi>teaching them,</hi> v. 45. And when this light is let into them, they are able. Many ſinners are concerned to get the pardon of ſin; and they reſolve to come to Chriſt, and they ſtrive to come to Chriſt, but they cannot; it ſeems to them a dangerous thing to venture themſelves on Chriſt, and they cannot overcome their fears: They ſet many incouraging conſiderations before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they cannot vanquiſh their fears; they dare not for their heart venture upon Chriſt: They are as unable to come as a man that is bound with chains is to come out of priſon. It is a terror to them to continue as they be, yet they dare not caſt themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt: But when their eyes are opened to ſee the free grace of God and the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, their fears are removed; their
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002072_0065_0FBB7B1657A34118"/>
fetters are taken off, and now they can come: Yea, they dare not ſtay away from Chriſt, they would not for a world ſtay away from Chriſt: <hi>Satan</hi> with all his artifices cannot perſwade them to neglect Chriſt. They have been in great diſtreſs, and now they ſee the relief that is provided for them; they are under a neceſſity in their own ſpirits to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the call. In like manner when they ſee the gloriouſneſs of God, they are able to love him. They were before urged in conſcience to do it, and had abundance of arguments ſet before them to induce them to love him; but nothing would prevail upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſtrangers to the lovelineſs of God: But as ſoon as ever their eyes were opened to ſee the glorious grace of God in the goſpel, now they can love him. They made a profeſſion before, but now they are ſincere; Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> The heart is drawn to God; they cannot deny their love to him. Whatever was dear to them before, now God is deareſt to them. And in like manner, now they can indeed abaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they ſee the divine excellency of God: They look on themſelves infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to him, and lay themſelves low before him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When they ſee the foundation of holy carriages, they <hi>love to carry holily.</hi> There
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002072_0066_0FBB7B17CA901230"/>
is naturally an enmity in the heart to holy carriages; Rom. 8.7. <hi>The natural mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> But this light makes them love holy carriages. When men ſee the preciouſneſs of Chriſt, it mightily ſuits them to come to him; they take a complacency in coming to Chriſt. Some men force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after a faſhion to venture on Chriſt; but when they ſee the divine authority of the goſpel, they love to come to him, as the hungry man loves to eat, and the thirſty to drink. Acts 16.34. <hi>He rejoyced, believing in God.</hi> He ſees that that makes it pleaſant to him; he ſees that God is worthy of that honour: He is a God of ſuch grace and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that he is worthy to be truſted in; and he ſees that the honour of a glorious Mediator is due to Chriſt; and he ſees that it is a ſafe thing to come to Chriſt. There is no reſt any where elſe for the ſole of his foot, but Chriſt is a ſure foundation, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious corner ſtone: His heart takes content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in relying upon him: All the world ſhall not perſwade him to forſake him, and make choice of any other refuge. Iſai. 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> So, the man loves to make the glory of God his end; and he loves to abaſe himſelf before God, and look upon himſelf as vanity, and nothing in compariſon of God. The ſight of the excellency of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002072_0067_0FBB7B1947F2D210"/>
God and Chriſt draws his heart; and he loves theſe holy carriages. There was an antipathy againſt them in his heart before; but now God and Chriſt are lovely in his eyes, and he has a mind to come to Chriſt, and to honour God, and he will not be reſtrained; for ſuch carriages are pleaſant to him. The glory of God and Chriſt draws the heart ſweetly and powerfully, and he rejoyceth therein.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Spiritual light <hi>makes the heart ſtand bent that way.</hi> This doth not only draw forth gracious actings, but leaves an Impreſſion and Bias upon the heart that way. Beauty draws forth an act of Love and leaves a diſpoſition to love. This ſight changes the mind and makes men judge otherwiſe of God and Chriſt than they uſed to do, and it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the heart and inclines it to carry ſuitably. The conviction is an abiding conviction, and ſo the diſpoſition is abiding. This diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is like the <hi>needles</hi> touching the <hi>loadſtone,</hi> it inclines it toward the <hi>north.</hi> When this light is let into the man he is principled to truſt in Chriſt, to love God, and live in a way of obedience, it prepares his heart to live in ſuch a way. When once he is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of the gloriouſneſs of God and Chriſt, he is ſet in that way and it will abide with him as long as he liveth; there is an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> left on the heart that will never wear

out. 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When they do perform thoſe holy carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they are <hi>inclined to perform them.</hi> It were impoſſible for to do them without an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do them. If the heart were not incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to truſt in Chriſt, they would not truſt in him. Holy actions are never forced. Men may be under a neceſſity to love God and truſt in Chriſt, but that neceſſity don't ariſe from compulſion but from inclination. Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> Before the man had averſion to thoſe gracious actions, he was under the dominion of a contrary inclination, but when he doth them, he is inclined to do them; and that <hi>actual inclination</hi> leaves an <hi>habitual inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> on the heart that way. We indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay that one act don't make a habit; but we mean that one act doth not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more perfect habit; as <hi>habit</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> which is called <hi>habitus imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus.</hi> But one act commonly doth leave ſomething of an inclination that way: one act of love to another perſon or thing diſpoſes the heart to renew that act of love. One act is preparation for another of the ſame kind; One act of faith puts the Soul into a believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame: and one act of humility into an humble frame; he is more inclined to believe again than he was, and the clearer diſcovery
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002072_0069_0FBB7B1DC2A6BDD0"/>
he had of God and Chriſt, the more ſtrongly he doth believe, and the greater inclination doth remain in him to believe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such men as have this ſpiritual <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry never do utterly forget it.</hi> It is poſſible for a man to forget the firſt time when he had the diſcovery of God and Chriſt made to him, yet I judge that is not ordinary; but if he doth forget the time, yet he never utterly forgets the thing, he remembers that he hath ſeen God and Chriſt to be glorious: There be many times when he hath not the actual remembrance of it, and many times alſo when he has corrupt apprehenſions concerning God and Chriſt, and may be under the prevailings of carnal reaſon and unbelief, yet he never ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgets what he has been convinced of, but doth recover the convictions that the Goſpel is true, and Jeſus Chriſt is an alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient Saviour, and ſo the inclination to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth abide in his heart. 1 Joh. 2.27. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you.</hi> And though he hath not ſuch diſcoveries as he hath had, yet he knows that he hath ſeen it and accordingly he hath an inclination ſtill to carry holily, when the Glory of God and Chriſt are out of ſight. The man is ſure from what he has ſeen that it is ſo, and that maintains an inclination in him to carry himſelf holily.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> There is a great difference between Converting Light, and common Illumination.</head>
                     <p>MEn are wont to diſtinguiſh between <hi>rational</hi> conviction and <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> Which diſtinction had need to be carefully underſtood; for man's rational faculty is the ſubject both of common and of ſpiritual conviction. We have no other faculty capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive conviction but our <hi>Reaſon.</hi> When the ſpirit of God gives common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, he works upon reaſon; and when he gives ſpiritual conviction, he likewiſe works upon reaſon, Beſides, ſpiritual conviction is rational conviction: Godly men act under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly and rationally, when they judge God to be worthy to be truſted, loved and obeyed; when they judge Chriſt to be the eternal Son of God, and an alſufficient Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Yet the <hi>distinction</hi> may be allowed if it be thus explained; that <hi>rational conviction</hi> is that which men by their natural reaſon do attain; which they may gain by the force of their natural reaſon, improving the works and word of God; which differs very much from that conviction which men have by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of God's Spirit.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Common Illumination</hi> is of <hi>two ſorts;</hi> one is from the more common improvements of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, the other from more affecting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries wrought by a common work of the Spirit of God. There is a conviction that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the common improvement of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>l reaſon. Thus men ſee clearly the <hi>Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> religion is better than the <hi>Popiſh:</hi> That it muſt needs be a work of wonderful wiſdom and power to make the world, that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Son of God muſt needs be of great value, that it was great love for God to give his Son to die: And hundreds of things of the like nature.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe rational convictions there are <hi>affecting diſcoveries</hi> of divine truths by the <hi>common work of the Spirit</hi> which make for a time a conſiderable impreſſion on the heart. Luk. 14.15. <hi>When one of them that ſat at meat with him heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the kingdom of God;</hi> Mat. 13.20. <hi>He that receive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Christ, they a intangled therein and overcome:</hi> Heb. 1.4, 5, 6 <hi>For it is impoſſible for them that were once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two ſorts of illumination, are reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of a <hi>twofold ſpiritual Illmmination</hi> that ſaints have. One is by ſanctified reaſon, whereby men are convinced of divine truths. Men underſtand the divine authority of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Scripture, and thereby they are aſſured of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> truth of Promiſes and Threatnings: They are aſſured that God made the world, and from thence they are convinced of his eternal Power and Godhead: They know that Jeſus Chriſt is the eternal Son of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they know the ſaving vertue of his Blood.</p>
                     <p>The other is by ſpecial diſcoveries of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths. They are led into <hi>Chriſt's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> as the 'phraſe is, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. God breaks into the heart by divine light, and gives great diſcoveries of his faithfulneſs, of his holineſs, his grace, the delight he takes in the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and many other things. 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Both theſe ways of conviction ſeem to be intimated, Eph. 1.17. <hi>That God may give unto you, the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The difference between thoſe convictions that riſe from the improvement of natural reaſon, and that do ariſe from ſpiritual reaſon, lies in theſe two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:002072_0073_0FBB7B278EE63198"/>1. Natural reaſon <hi>doth not diſcover the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of divine things.</hi> Sanctified reaſon doth ſee them to be <hi>ſure,</hi> Joh. 6.69. <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> Joh. 17.8. <hi>They have known that I came from thee, and they have believed that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ence of things not ſeen.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>They received the word not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God.</hi> But natural reaſon doth not diſcover the <hi>Certainty</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths: That can perceive the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between one divine truth and another, and perceive how one thing follows certainly from another; but it doth not perceive the certainty of any. Carnal mens reaſoning is from ſuppoſition; they reaſon very rationally, but they do not ſee that which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their reaſoning to be certain. Carnal men and Godly men do both of them argue from the divine Nature of Chriſt. Both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men and godly do ſtrongly argue, that if Chriſt be the Son of God, there is a divine vertue in his ſufferings; and that it is ſafe relying on him. But here lies the difference; the godly man <hi>knows</hi> that Chriſt is the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.6. but the carnal man only <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi> that Chriſt is the Son of God. He ſays the Church believe it, the Old and New Teſtament give an account of it, and there be many things ſaid that make much for the confirmation of it. He diſcovered the ſecret
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002072_0074_0FBB7B290103E340"/>
thoughts of men, did many miraculous works, roſe from the dead. Upon ſuch accounts he ſuppoſes him to be the Son of God, and judges it a heinous crime for any to deny it; but he doth not know theſe things, for he is ignorant of the divine authority of the word, and dare not venture on Chriſt, for fear it ſhould not be ſo. So it was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> they did not believe <hi>Moſes,</hi> Joh. 5.46. Thus they both of them argue from the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> The godly man argues, that there were ſeveral types inſtituted by God, to ſhew the ſaving vertue of the blood of Chriſt; — the ſacraments in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are inſtituted to be amemorial of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man argues from hence, that Chriſt has ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the juſtice of God; that Chriſt was the lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Theſe ſacrifices were only types of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. And he is abundantly ſatisfyed by theſe inſtitutions, that Chriſt is a glorious Saviour. Another man argues in like manner, that God would never have appointed ſuch Signs to ſignify Chriſt, if he would not have us truſt in him. He has not appointed theſe ſigns to deceive us; God would never teach his people a falſe way of Salvation: But his wound is, that he don't know certainly the divine authority of thoſe inſtitutions; he doth not know but they were the inventions of men. So, they both of them argue ſtrongly from the command to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002072_0075_0FBB7B2AA683AA38"/>
from the promiſes of Salvation in a way of believing, from Chriſt's aſcenſion and ſitting at the right hand of God; but the carnal man is uncertain of thoſe things that are foundations of his reaſoning; he does not know but there is ſome miſtake: He thinks that there is a great probability of the truth of thoſe things, but he has no aſſurance: His principles are grounded on an uncertain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and ſo he <hi>knows nothing as he ought to know.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Carnal reaſon doth not <hi>receive a right Idea of divine things.</hi> Godly men though they have the exerciſe of ſpiritual reaſon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find out the Almighty unto perfection: But yet they do know God and Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. They have a true idea of God; they know him to be one of infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they know him to be a God of infinite power, grace and faithfulneſs; they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he is worthy of that love, faith and ſubmiſſion that he calls for; Pſal. 18.3. <hi>I will call upon God who is worthy to be praiſed.</hi> They know that divine honour is due to him; Pſal. 29.2. <hi>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name.</hi> But carnal men have not a right idea of God: They acknowledge that he is infinite in his perfections, and can give ſome deſcription of his infinite perfections; but they have not a right <hi>Idea</hi> of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, are not ſenſible what reverence and glory is due to him; and therefore they
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002072_0076_0FBB7B2C16F0E4F0"/>
are ſaid to be ignorant of him: Joh. 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The difference between thoſe affecting illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations that carnal men have, — thoſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that are given to godly men, lies in theſe two particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The illuminations that carnal men have, are <hi>affecting,</hi> but not <hi>convincing.</hi> They are many times much affected with <hi>Joy;</hi> ſo they ſaid, <hi>What a bleſſedneſs is it!</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> preached the goſpel unto them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. It works deſires in them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.15. And their hearts upon that occaſion may be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily weaned from the world, and taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout heavenly things: They may be mightily tranſported with zeal. The people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo affected with Chriſt, that they were of the mind to <hi>make him a King.</hi> But theſe illuminations don't convince them; the men remain ignorant of God, and Chriſt, and the truth of the goſpel. Theſe flaſhes of light do not diſcover the certainty of divine truths. The people that cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to day, cry <hi>crucify him</hi> another time; and that was a ſign that they did not know him; <hi>for had they known, they would not have crucifyed the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. Many are greatly affected in the hearing of ſermons, that do not firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they hear: Act. 25.48. <hi>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> They were
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002072_0077_0FBB7B31D8869850"/>
generally much affected, but it was only a <hi>ſelect number</hi> that believed. <hi>Stony ground hearers</hi> are much affected, but not convinced. Men are often affected with ſuch things as they look upon as probable; but ſpecial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that God makes to ſaints, are very affecting and <hi>convincing.</hi> Godly men muſt needs be affected with thoſe diſcoveries, for they are wondrous in their eyes: Pſal. 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous things in thy law.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>love of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſhed abroad in their hearts;</hi> that implies great affection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. Divine truths are of a very affecting nature; They will ſtir up joy, and ſorrow, and deſires, and zeal; but theſe diſcoveries do not affect them only, but convince them: They ſee the glory of God; Pſal. 63.2. <hi>To ſee thy power and glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> They know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. When they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of God, they are convinced of the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.18. When God ſhines into their hearts, he gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. When men ſee the ſun, they know it is the ſun; and when they ſee the grace and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, they know he is ſuch an one; they don't only ſee the gloriouſneſs of mercy, and holineſs, and faithfulneſs; but that God is gracious, and holy, and faithful.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:002072_0078_0FBB7B35235ADF70"/>2. The illuminations of carnal men <hi>don't draw forth any gracious Exerciſes.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcoveries that are given to carnal men, have a conſiderable effect upon them; beſides the ſtirring up of affections ſpoken of before, they have an effect upon the converſation; they many times make men to <hi>reform</hi> their lives, and caſt of ſinful practices: 2 Pet. 2.20. <hi>They eſcape the pollutions of the world thro' the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> Sometimes they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men in ſeeking the pardon of their ſins. They may have ſuch a diſcovery of the happineſs of heaven, of the graciouſneſs of God, and of the mercy of God in providing a way of ſalvation, as may greatly encourage them to continue ſeeking his favour. They may likewiſe have that effect to make men preſumptuous. Men may from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their own eſtate good: They may take encouragements for aſſurances of the favour of God: May take occaſion alſo from them to get a falſe faith. If they have ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of a readineſs in God to pardon ſinners, they may take incouragement to think, that men ſo qualified as they, that are reformed and ſorry for their ſins, may be bold to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Chriſt: But thoſe ſpiritual diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that God makes, do always draw forth the exerciſe of grace: Cant. 1.4. <hi>The king hath brought me to his chambers, we will be glad and delight in thee; the upright love thee.</hi> When God breaks into the heart by light,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002072_0079_0FBB7B369D178668"/>
the heart is drawn forth in love, and faith, and repentance. Communion is reciprocal. When God draws nigh to his People, that mightily ſtirs up a ſpirit of holineſs; it doth not only ſtrengthen aſſurance, but it ſtirs up all grace: Job. 42.5, 6. <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in dust and aſhes.</hi> Eph. 3.19. <hi>And to know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge; that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> This gives great increaſe to grace. 2 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>MEn may have the knowledge of their own converſion. The knowledge that other men have of it is uncertain; becauſe no man can look into the heart of another, and ſee the workings of grace there: Yet men may know that they are godly. Some ungodly men think that they have grace; but that which is not, cannot be known: Things that are not, are called, <hi>things that do not appear,</hi> Heb. 11.3. <hi>That which is wanting cannot be numbred,</hi> Eccl. 1.15. All converted men don't know that they are converted. Tho' grace
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002072_0080_0FBB7B380E328580"/>
be viſible, yet many times it is not ſeen. Viſible things are not always ſeen; ſometimes becauſe it is night, ſometimes becauſe they are covered. It is the <hi>Calamity,</hi> and many times the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of godly men that they are ignorant of their converſion. They do know that they have corruptions in them, and they may know that they have grace in them. This is very evident, becauſe many godly men have known their good eſtate. If this knowledge had never been attained, it might more reaſonably be queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were attainable. <hi>Job</hi> was abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfyed; Job. 10.7. <hi>Thou knowest that I am not wicked:</hi> And he was not miſtaken, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.1. So <hi>David</hi> knew it; Pſal. 17.15. <hi>As for me, I ſhall behold his face in righteouſneſs.</hi> So <hi>Paul;</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7. <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith.</hi> v. 8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> And we don't know of one godly man in the <hi>Scripture</hi> that was under darkneſs about his ſincerity. There be ſome Scriptures brought to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, eſpecially ſome paſſages of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. But that <hi>Pſalm</hi> repreſents to us not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe of <hi>Haman,</hi> but of the <hi>Church of Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further, it appears that converſion may be known, becauſe we are directed to <hi>examine our ſelves</hi> in order to it; 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelve: whether you be in the faith, prove
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002072_0081_0FBB7B39ABDDA510"/>
your own ſelves; know you not that Jeſus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> And to what purpoſe ſhould we be adviſed to do a thing that is not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? God don't adviſe us to impoſſibilities. All the commands of God are poſſible to be fulfilled; if not perfectly, yet they may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled: Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt, who ſtrengthneth me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall only add that conſideration, that God makes many comfortable <hi>Promiſes</hi> to them that have grace; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>Jam.</hi> 12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.10. But if men could not know that they have grace, that would fruſtrate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe promiſes; that would take away the foundation of their comfort; they would be uncapable of making application of the promiſes to themſelves. How much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoever is made over to them in thoſe promiſes; yet if they could not know their own grace, they muſt be ſtrangers to their own happineſs, and not rejoyce in the good that is made over to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may a godly man know that he has Grace?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He cannot know it in a way of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</hi> We come to the knowledge of many things in a way of reaſoning; arguing from things known, to things that are not known.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002072_0082_0FBB7B3B5FC56C40"/>
Thus a man may know his juſtification: He may argue thus, He that hath faith in Chriſt is juſtified; or he that has love to God is juſtified; or he that loves the brethren is paſſed from death to life: Becauſe there is a certain connection between theſe graces and a ſtate of juſtification. Thus a man may know by reaſoning, that he has this and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grace: He may argue ſo, If I have the grace of faith, I have the grace of love, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; becauſe there is a concatenation of graces, and they are inſeparable one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: But they don't know that they are gracious in this manner; the knowledge of their graces don't come in at that door.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He cannot prove it from any ſuch acts as may proceed from other principles. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and religious converſation may proceed from other principles: Such a converſation is an argument to other men to be charitable, but it is no demonſtration. The young man in the goſpel walked exactly; Mat. 19.20. <hi>All theſe things have I done from my youth. Paul</hi> was conſcientious; Phil. 3.6. <hi>Touching the righteouſneſs that is in the Law I was blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:</hi> Such a walk may proceed from fear of hell and hope of heaven. Zeal for God don't prove it: There may be zeal where there is no love: The <hi>Jews</hi> were great enemies to Chriſt, yet very zealous; Rom. 10.2. <hi>I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God. Paul</hi> had great zeal before he had any grace.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002072_0083_0FBB7B3FE93C7138"/>
Natural conſcience may produce zeal. Great affections don't prove it: The <hi>Jews</hi> cryed, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David.</hi> Striving againſt a ſelf-righteous ſpirit don't prove it: Men may ſtrive againſt it, yet not mortify it. Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating with godly men don't prove it: <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> was <hi>David's</hi> companion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orrows for the afflictions of the Church, and deſires for the Converſion of Souls don't prove it: Theſe things may be found in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, and ſo can be no evidences of grace. Thoſe things that are common to ſaints and hypocrites, don't prove that a man is a ſaint and no hypocrite. Men muſt do more than carnal men to prove that they have grace: Mat. 5.20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> That which is common to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites is no ſign of ſaintſhip. It is a vain thing to make that a plea, that <hi>Publicans</hi> may plead as well as they, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46, 47. That which may riſe from a corrupt principle, will not prove a gracious principle; that which a beaſt may do, will not prove a thing to be a man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He cannot prove it from any ſuch acts of Providence as are common to carnal men. Some men have ſmiling providences and great deliverances. God is very bountiful; and many argue from thence that they are godly; but they don't argue ſtrongly: God may

                        </gap> of mens being members of the myſtical Church. So, if God do the thing for men that they pray for, that is no argument: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers are granted that are not accepted. God hears the cry of the <hi>Ravens:</hi> God heard the voice of <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Sometimes God denies men's prayers becauſe they ask amiſs, but not always. Men may be inſtruments of a great deal of good in the Church, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; yet be deſtitute of grace. <hi>Saul</hi> did a great deal of ſervice in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.24. <hi>Miniſters</hi> may be inſtruments of the converſion of ſinners and the comfort of ſaints, yet not be godly. There were ſeveral godly in <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the miniſtry of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and the <hi>Ravens</hi> brought meat to <hi>Elijah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They don't know it by <hi>believing that they are godly.</hi> We know many things <hi>by faith:</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>By faith we understand that the worlds were made by the power of God. Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Thus men know the Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God; that he that believes in him will have eternal life; the reſurrection of the dead. And if God ſhould tell a ſaint that he hath
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:002072_0085_0FBB7B44D364E3B8"/>
Grace, he might know it by believing the word of God. But it is not in this way that godly men do know that they have grace: It is not revealed in the word; and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth not teſtifie it to particular perſons.</p>
                     <p>Some think the Spirit doth teſtify it to ſome; and they ground it on Rom. 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> They think the ſpirit reveals it by giving an inward teſtimony to it. And ſome godly men think they have had experience of it; but they may eaſily miſtake. When the ſpirit of God doth eminently ſtir up a ſpirit of faith, and ſheds abroad the love of God in the heart, it is eaſy to miſtake it for a teſtimony. And that is not the meaning of <hi>Paul</hi>'s words. The <hi>Spirit</hi> reveals things to us, by opening our eyes to ſee what is revealed in the word: But the ſpirit doth not reveal new truths not revealed in the word. The Spirit diſcovers the grace of God in Chriſt, and thereby draws forth ſpecial actings of faith and love, which are evidential; but it doth not work in way of teſtimony. If God do but help us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the revelations in the word, we ſhall have comfort enough without new revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning is, that the miraculous works of the Spirit are a witneſs to the Chriſtian Religion. The thing that is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:002072_0086_0FBB7B464D8DB618"/>
to is, that <hi>ſincere Chriſtians are the children of God;</hi> that the Chriſtian religion is the true religion; and that all that embrace it indeed are the heirs of eternal life: And the Perſon that witneſſeth is the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> he teſtifies to it by <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts.</hi> The mighty works of the Spirit of God in the primitive times, were evidences of the truth of the Chriſtian religion; they were wrought for that very end. Heb. 2.4. <hi>God alſo bearing them witneſs with ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5. <hi>Our goſpel came unto you, not in word only, but alſo in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in much aſſurance, and in the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is <hi>by Intuition or ſeeing of grace in their own hearts.</hi> It is by conſciouſneſs; as <hi>Peter</hi> knew his love to Chriſt, when he ſays, <hi>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> Joh. 11.17. And as <hi>David</hi> knew his love to God; Pſal. 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> And as <hi>Job</hi> knew his repentance; Job. 42.6. <hi>I abhor my ſelf in dust and aſhes.</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> knew that he <hi>knew Chriſt;</hi> 1 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed.</hi> There is a reflecting power in man: As he can look out and ſee external objects, ſo he can <hi>look in,</hi> and ſee his <hi>own actions.</hi> In this manner ſaints know the <hi>corrupt workings</hi> of their own hearts: They know their pride, and worldlineſs, and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002072_0087_0FBB7B47C2F7B848"/>
frowardneſs, and unbelief; ſo they know their grace. In this manner they know their natural actions; they know that they think, and what they think about; they know the acts of their Wills, what they chuſe, and what they refuſe; and the acts of their Affections; they know that they love their children; that they deſire meat and drink; that they are afraid of pain and death; that they rejoyce in their good things: So, they may have the knowledge by intuition, that they know God and Chriſt; that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the goſpel; that they love God and the ſaints; that they are ſorry for their ſins. A godly man underſtanding what it is to love God and to repent, tho' he cannot give an exact definition of them, yet may be able by his obſervation to know that he doth ſo; and may be as able to ſay, that he loves God, and believes in Chriſt, as to ſay, he has pride and worldlineſs in his own heart. There may indeed be ſomething of more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it, becauſe many actings of grace are low and weak; on that account it may be hard to ſee it; as it is hard to ſee the motion of water in a river, when it moves very ſlowly; and upon that account, becauſe <hi>grace is much counterfeited;</hi> and there be many actings that do look like the actings of grace that are not ſo: But ſometimes grace works ſo powerfully, that it is <hi>very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;</hi> and men are able to diſtinguiſh between
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:002072_0088_0FBB7B49545BBB20"/>
grace and the reſemblances of it, and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed underſtandingly: 1 Chron. 29.17. <hi>As for me, in the uprightneſs of my heart, I willingly offered all theſe things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this, it may be of great uſe for <hi>Ministers</hi> frequently to be giving <hi>ſigns of Grace.</hi> Theſe ſigns are of great uſe for the diſcovery of hypocriſy. The want of particular graces is a means to diſcover ſome. Some may be undeceived by conſidering, that they have not had an antecedent work of <hi>Humiliation.</hi> The account of the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God works grace, <hi>ſc.</hi> by the <hi>diſcoveries of Goſpel Grace,</hi> may convince others. The want of <hi>Obedience</hi> may convince others. So, the allowing of pride or worldlineſs, and the want of doing duties out of regard to God's glory.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Signs</hi> alſo are of great uſe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſtrengthening of the ſaints. Sometimes the diſcourſing of ſuch things doth draw forth the exerciſe of grace; and men find in themſelves that which they are hearing of. So it was with <hi>Peter:</hi> The very queſtion whether he loved Chriſt kindled a ſpirit of love to him, that he was aſſured <hi>that he loved him,</hi> Joh. 21.17 Sometimes the explication of the ſign, helps men to ſee it more clearly. They were at a loſs; but when it is clearly laid open, it helps them to ſee it. Beſides, it brings to remembrance what they formerly felt; and ſo it brings joy, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:002072_0089_0FBB7B4DC1AB98D8"/>
renews their comfort. Moreover, it helps them againſt many temptations: They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fears becauſe of the Providence of God, and becauſe of corrupt workings of heart; but when they hear that complacency in God, and the ſight of the glory of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſigns of a good eſtate, that ſatisfys them, and is a relief to them under their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                        <hi>warfare</hi> that every godly man doth experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; and theſe are contrary the one to the other: So that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, grace at firſt converſion is very ſmall; if after twenty or thirty years growth, it is very defective, it muſt needs be very ſmall at firſt.</p>
                     <p>There may be many reaſons why God ſuffers much ſin to remain in his people, while they remain in this world.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>the work of ſanctification may be ſo carried on, that they may be in continual need of Justification and Pardon.</hi> The pardoning of the ſins that men committed in their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, is a great manifeſtation of the riches of his grace, and the virtue of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; but God doth day by day pardon the repeated iniquities of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; forgives men thouſands of times, tho' they have abuſed mercy, broken vows, fallen from reſolutions: This doth wonderfully commend the grace of God, and the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt. If there were not experience of it, it would be difficult to conceive that God would be willing ſo to do. Theſe are mighty inſtances of the unſearchable depth of mercy that is in the heart of God; and lead men to ſay, as Mic. 2.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of

                     <p>Some ſaints do attain to greater perfection in grace than others; this is not always in proportion to the time ſince their converſion, but according to the improvement of their time: It is ſaid of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that their

                     <p>It ſeems to be but a little grace compared with corruption that God's choice ſervants do attain unto. It is ſaid of the <hi>angel of Philadelphia, Thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word and haſt not denyed my name.</hi> Rev. 3.8. And the Experience of the people of God ſeems to confirm this: <hi>Sin doth eaſily beſet them;</hi> Heb. 12.1. Corruption is like a fountain that is continually ſending forth its waters. Temptations do quickly infect. Pride and worldlineſs and diſcontent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief are very ready to work; and there is a great backwardneſs to ſpiritual duties, to faith and love, and to ſubmit to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God. Men's enjoyments are ſo dear to them, that they have great difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them up to the pleaſure of God. There is much <hi>formality</hi> that doth attend duties of religion; and there is much ſpiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ignorance of God and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth it make againſt this aſſertion, that ſome of the people of God have <hi>a very

They are zealous againſt ſome ſins, but hate none. They are ſtriving for Salvation, but refuſe the offers of it.

becauſe it is like to be your portion at laſt to lie down in ſorrow.

Can you bear to hear that ſentence, Mat. 24.1. <hi>Depart ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. Is not the wrath of God too heavy for you? Is not hell fire too hot for you? You ſhun reproach, you avoid pain, you hate poverty; and are you able to bear hell? When you come to lie in torment, can you ſatisfy your ſelf that you have had your good things? Will you be able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud your ſelf as having acted the part of a wiſe man? Will you glory in your wiſdom, and bleſs your ſelf for loitering away your time? One hours experience of the pains of hell will effectually teach you that peace with God is worth your care and labour; and that working out your Salvation is no intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burden. If the <hi>Doctrine of Hell</hi> be a dream, if when you died your ſoul would be reſolved into it's firſt principles, if there were no hell but only in the imaginations of doting men, you might bleſs your ſelf in your way: But if there be a God in heaven that will execute vengeance upon ungodly men, your neglecting to get into a converted condition is higheſt madneſs, and folly: You act like the man poſſeſſed with the devil, that caſt himſelf ſometimes into the fire, and ſometimes into the water.

Chriſt has died for the Salvation of ſinners; God has appointed ordinances to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to be ſaved, and is it not worth the while for you to labour in it?

prevent it, ordinarily there is much difficulty in the way; and Chriſt Jeſus makes that argument for men to labour after it. Luk. 3.14. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi> There be abundance of difficulties in the way, ſo that except perſons labour in it, they are never like to be converted: <hi>Many ſeek and and are not able to enter.</hi> Their <hi>Ignorance</hi> makes the work difficult; they are in great danger to take wrong paths; their reaſon miſleads them, and they get out of the right way, and ſo make a great deal of work for themſelves. Their <hi>love to carnal things</hi> makes the work difficult; there is much oppoſition from a <hi>worldly Spirit,</hi> that makes them dull and ſluggiſh, that ſwallows up a great deal of time, that fills them full of care. Their <hi>Pride</hi> is a great hinderance; it fills with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their own ſufficiency. Their <hi>fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> creates a great deal of difficulty, and they are ready to be diſcouraged.

                     <p>There is a great deal of difficulty in the way of <hi>Reformation.</hi> It is a great while ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before they will forſake their evil ways:

and can't conceive that it is a fair thing for God to caſt them off.

And when their hearts appear worſe, they nouriſh an hope to bring them to; and take a great deal of pains to work up ſuch frames as may lay bonds on God to ſave them. They are told, that it is in the pleaſure of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow mercy or deny it; but they dread the thoughts of that, and try twenty concluſions before they will ſubmit to God.

There be many Phariſaical Profeſſors, that glory in themſelves, and <hi>ſpeak peace to themſelves, when there is no peace.</hi> They are deceived with falſe appearances of love, and faith, and <hi>think themſelves ſomething, when they are nothing.</hi> Some others ſpend their days like <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs;</hi> they wander about from mountain to hill, ſeeking reſt and finding none: They beat upon the coaſt, but never enter into the harbour: They are ſtriving, and death comes and puts an end to all their hopes. But thoſe that get into a converted condition, have many difficulties to grapple with before they do obtain; and they are under a neceſſity to labour much in it. Mat. 11.12. <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>

                        <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. Deſpair kills the heart, and cramps the powers of nature, and makes men deaf to perſwaſions; but hope makes men pray, and ſtrive, and run ventures, and endure hardſhip. Hopes of a cure makes the ſick uſe medicines. Hopes of a harveſt makes the husbandman to till his ground. Hopes of arriving at the port, makes the mariner hoiſt his ſails. Hopes of victory makes the ſoldier fight. And God encourages men to ſeek him from the hopes of ſucceſs. Iſai, 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.</hi> Men are wont to give way to a diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged ſpirit, partly from dark appearances, partly from frowardneſs, partly from ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: But they do very ill, for it is <hi>hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> that they may obtain.

There is a number that are redeemed by Chriſt, that he did deſignedly ſhed his blood for: He laid <hi>down his life for his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.15. God would never have ſent him into the world, but that he deſigned to convert and ſave many ſinners through him. He has promiſed to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:002072_0111_0FBB7B7DCA7B3A40"/>
Chriſt the ſalvation of many; Iſai. 49.6. <hi>I have given him to be a light unto the gentiles, and ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> Pſal. 72.17. <hi>Men ſhall be bleſſed in him, and all nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi> This is the promiſe ſpoken of, Tit. 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began.</hi> God has made a donation of an eternal kingdom to Chriſt, Mat. 16, 18. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail against the Church.</hi> The work of converſion ſhall be carried on in all ages. Ordinances ſhall not be in vain; Mat. 28.19, 20. <hi>Go, teach all nations, baptizing them; and lo I am with you even to the end of the world.</hi> When God ſends ſowers to ſow, <hi>ſome ſeed</hi> ſhall fall on <hi>good ground.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is as a <hi>Net</hi> that gathers ſome <hi>good fiſh, and ſome bad.</hi> As other great works of God are continued, ſo this work of converſion ſhall continue in all ages. Though ſatan has a kindom in the world, yet Chriſt will always have a kingdom here as well as he.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There is <hi>ground to hope that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow converting grace on you.</hi> You are under the means of grace; accordingly the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the goſpel ſhould hope for you, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly take pains with you: It would be a very ſinful thing if they ſhould be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about you, and neglect to teach, and warn, and direct you. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that he warned all his hearers, <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 31. And as there is ground for the Miniſter to take encouragement
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:002072_0112_0FBB7B7F464A5A00"/>
to endeavour your converſion, ſo there is ground for you to be encouraged, to ſtrive for your own converſion. If it were beyond the power of God to convert, or beyond the grace of God to pardon you, then you would have reaſon to be diſcouraged. Men may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect impoſſibilities; but God can renew his image within you. The ſoul of a man is a ſuitable ſubject for grace; and as long as the faculties of the ſoul do remain, a capacity to be gracious doth remain. Your corruptions are accidental, and ſo may be mortifyed. Your mind can't be ſo blind, as to be incapable of light. Your heart cant be ſo hard as to be uncapable to be made ſoft. If your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are very ſtrong, omnipotency can overcome them. Mat. 19.26. <hi>With God all things are poſſible.</hi> Neither is it beyond the grace of God to pardon you. It is great folly to ſet limits to that which is infinite. God's grace exceeds man's ſinfulneſs: His <hi>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways;</hi> but high above them, as the heavens are above the earth. Indeed if God had revealed, that he would not pardon you, that would cut off all hope; but there is no ſuch thing in the word. God ſays in his word, <hi>that his ſpirit ſhould not always ſtrive with fleſh,</hi> Gen. 6.3. but that only ſignifys, that he would <hi>wait only an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty years, and then bring the flood.</hi> He ſays, that the heart of the people ſhall be <hi>made fat,</hi> Iſai. 6.10. but that was a <hi>national Judgment;</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="unknown:002072_0113_0FBB7B85DCC54F88"/>
particular perſons might be converted for all. Sometimes God ſware concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould not <hi>enter into his rest,</hi> Pſal. 95.11. but there is no ſuch thing ſaid concerning you. God ſometimes pronounces that curſe, <hi>Let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt ſtill, and him that is filthy be filthy ſtill,</hi> Rev, 22.11. but he is uſing means with you ſtill. You may take notice of ſome dark appearances in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; that you are of ſuch an age; that God has refuſed hitherto to hear your prayers; that in the days when many have heard the voice of the Son of God, you have been left; But it is unwarrantable and preſumptuous, without Scripture or Reaſon, to draw any dark concluſions from thence.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) If <hi>you be striving, there is a great deal of hope that you will obtain.</hi> If men are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and will not be diſcouraged, it is very hopeful that they will in time be converted; eſpecially if they be directed aright, and be not flattered; for diligent ſeeking is God's way: God's voice unto men is, <hi>Seek ye my face;</hi> Pſal. 27.8. So, <hi>Seek the Lord and his face, ſeek his ſtrength evermore;</hi> Pſal. 105.4. There is hope that God will own men, when they take the directions of his word. Though natural men when they ſeek converſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do it with a ſelfiſh and hypocritical Spirit, and God don't accept it as ſervice to himſelf; yet it is not ſtrange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e ſhould bleſs his own <hi>appointments.</hi> Indeed the ſeeking of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:002072_0114_0FBB7B88820C75B8"/>
God diligently, reforming mens lives, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the way of Salvation, has a great tendency to promote Salvation; for it takes them off from their ſinful practices, and worldly deſigns that hindred them from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the way of life. They are ſearching into thoſe things that will conduce to their converſion. Beſides, when men are earneſtly ſeeking after that, it is a ſign that the Spirit of God is at work with them: And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is promiſed to make the means of Grace effectual. Joh. 16.7, 8. <hi>If I depart, I will ſend the Comforter to you; and when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of Judgment.</hi> And when he doth intend to convert, his way is, firſt to convince of ſin; and when he doth convince of ſin, many times it is in order to converſion. And indeed many perſons have had experience that in a way of labouring after converſion, God has ſhewed mercy on them; while oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have been careleſs and ſlighty, have continued in an unconverted condition. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have been ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate have obtained; and it is always ſo, that where there is in any place, an earneſt deſire to be ſeeking after peace with God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do obtain mercy; and if that ſpirit ſhould continue longer, many more might obtain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, Mat. 11.12. <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:002072_0115_0FBB7B89CDD171F0"/>6. If <hi>you ſhould obtain converſion, you would not be in an unconverted eſtate again for all the world.</hi> A man that has a fair eſtate, may be very willing to exchange for another: But if you were converted, you will deſpiſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Principalities in compariſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The glory of the world might poſſibly be a temptation to you; but you would never be willing to change a converted eſtate for the glory of the world. When you called to mind the doleful condition of ſuch men, you would look upon them objects of commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration; their jollity, and wealth, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, would not reconcile you to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: You would remember the worm wood and the gall: You would think of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their hopes, the dolefulneſs of their death, and their eternal confuſion; and their ſtate would be matter of horror to you. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> dreaded to <hi>return to the houſe of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi> What ever enjoyments you had, pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, eſtate, honourable offices; upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you would call your ſelf happy, that you were converted.

deal of darkneſs in the minds of men about it. Many times godly men have ſcruples, and ſometimes great fears, that they are not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: They often ſet in judgment on themſelves, and are at a loſs what ſentence to pronounce. And ſome ungodly men have great hopes that they are in a good eſtate, and ſteal comfort that dont belong to them. Some can't ſee their way to condemn themſelves, and ſome give judgment for themſelves. But the Apoſtle doth here direct the one ſort and the other in the determination of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Firſt, he tells us how a godly man may know his godlineſs: He that ſees the workings of the grace of love in himſelf; he that ſees more or fewer actings of that grace, may conclude for himſelf, that he is born of God, hath had a work of regeneration, the goſpel has had a ſaving efficacy on his heart, he has the ſpiritual knowledge of God, his eyes have been opened to ſee the glory of God. Secondly, he tells us how hypocrites may know their hypocriſy: He that loveth not, that liveth in the omiſſion of love, that hath nothing of the working of that ſpirit, that lives in the neglect of it, hath not the ſpiritual knowledge of God; whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences he makes, this caſts the caſe againſt him.

Every godly man has a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principle remaining in him, and that principle don't lie ſtill; but is buſy and active.

If they are alone, if they are in company, if they are in the works of their calling, if they are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelves in the duties of religion, they are always haunted with a corrupt heart. They have a multiude of evil thoughts, deſires, delights, fears, ſorrows. Unbelief is often ſtirring; ſo pride and worldlineſs, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and envy. There be many ſtirrings of ſin that they dont perceive; but abundance that falls under their obſervation. A corrupt principle will ſtir upon all occaſions; every thing that occurs will awaken it: Therefore ſaints are warned to keep their hearts with all diligence. <hi>Prov.</hi>

But as a man that has corruption in him may do choice acts of holineſs, ſo a man that has grace in him may commit groſs acts of ſin.

Pſal. 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, that walk in the law of the Lord.</hi> And we find that godly men have been well ſatisfyed that they have walked in a way of holineſs. Iſai. 39.3. <hi>Remember, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy fight.</hi> If it be enquired, how they do know that their obedience is not the fruit of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience and common grace, as it is with many others: The Anſwer is, that they ſee now and then the plain exerciſes of grace, and from thence conclude, that they are under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a gracious ſpirit in their walk; that though they be guilty of much formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and hypocriſy, yet there is a ſpirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs working in them, and an hearty care to keep the commandments of God. If a man ſees now and then a ſpirit of love to God, he may ſafely conclude that his religion is not the fruit of oſtentation, or ſlaviſh fear, but that a gracious ſpirit doth ſtir him up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his duty, and that his walk is holy.</p>
