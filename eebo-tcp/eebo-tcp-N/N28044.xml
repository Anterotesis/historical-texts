            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN David firſt heard of the death of his father and of his friend, he was deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and diſcovered the ſtrongeſt marks of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſorrow. "Then he took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewiſe all the men that were with him; and they mourned and wept until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his ſon, and for the people of the Lord, and for the houſe of Iſrael." As the remains of theſe illuſtrious war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors were in the power of their enemies, David could not, as he did on a ſimilar occaſion, follow them to their graves, and weep over them there. But all that he could do, in his diſtreſſed ſituation, he did. Being no leſs expert with his pen, than with his lyre and ſpear, he poured forth the tender emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his heart in a ſolemn, plaintive, funeral dirge. Though he felt a warmer attachment to Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037369_0004_100CEE5E1EA8BD58"/>
than to Saul, yet in celebrating their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, their talents, and their public ſervices, he pays them an equal tribute of public reſpect. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, with all his poetic ſkill, to inſpire the whole nation with the ſame ſenſibilities, which he felt in his own boſom, and calls upon them, in the moſt pathetic ſtrains, to unite in deploring the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely deceaſe of the great ornaments and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors of their country. "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!" Our loſs is great and irreparable! The death of our generals is the death of our hopes and the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our arms! Our national calamity calls for our national mourning, lamentation, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Theſe are the ſentiments, which this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful poem was deſigned to inculcate. And theſe are the ſentiments, which every people ought to feel and to expreſs, when thoſe, who have been eminently uſeful in life, are laid in the duſt.</p>
            <p>To deſcribe men of eminence, and to ſhow the propriety of lamenting their death, will be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the enſuing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>No man was made merely for himſelf, but all men for the ſervice of each other. Uſefulneſs, therefore, does not ſo much conſiſt in ſeeking our private, perſonal happineſs, as in promoting the general welfare of all with whom we are any way concerned. Though moſt men are capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037369_0005_100CEE60CD9036B8"/>
ſomething for others as well as for themſelves; yet only a few individuals poſſeſs either talents, opportunities, or inclinations, to become exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively uſeful. And among theſe there are ſo many degrees of merit, that it is extremely difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the preciſe point, where mediocrity ends and eminence begins. It is eaſy, however, to give a general deſcription of thoſe, in various depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, whoſe uncommon exertions for the public good juſtly place them in the noble rank of eminent men.</p>
            <p>Since the general good of ſociety requires par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons to devote themſelves to particular employments, any individual, of a ſuperior genius and of an enterprizing ſpirit, may become emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently uſeful, in any lawful profeſſion. The theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical farmer, who ſpares no labor nor expence, in trying experiments, and in diſcovering the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt modes of cultivating the earth, is an eminent citizen. The man, who purſues the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of commerce upon the broad baſis of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral utility, promotes the public good as well as his own, and is extenſively uſeful to his country. The man, who, by cloſe application and critical obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, makes advances in the healing art, and employs his ſuperior ſkill in relieving the pains and maladies of his fellow men, is a great public bleſſing. The man of genius and integrity, who
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037369_0006_100CEE625FE3AA70"/>
is profoundly learned in the law, and who exerts all his abilities in promoting the cauſe of juſtice and defending the rights of his fellow citizens, does honor to his profeſſion, and contributes large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the general good of civil ſociety. In a word, every one of a public ſpirit and ſuperior talents, who makes it his ſupreme object, in his private em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to promote the public happineſs, is an eminently uſeful man.</p>
            <p>There is a higher claſs of eminent men, who move in the higher walks of life. Theſe, inſtead of ſeeking merely the honors and emoluments of office, have ſo much greatneſs of mind and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, as to employ their public and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſtations, as the means of more public and extenſive uſefulneſs. On this eminent liſt we ought to place all thoſe, who ſhine with a peculiar luſtre, either in the ſeats of learning, or in the courts of juſtice, or in the councils of ſtate, or in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme command of fleets and armies.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome who riſe higher ſtill on the ſcale of uſefulneſs; I mean thoſe, who extend their views beyond the limits of their own nation or country, and exert their influence to promote the general good of all mankind. There are a few individuals, among the many millions of our race, who have heads and hearts equal to ſuch a great,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037369_0007_100CEE646139A550"/>
extenſive, and benevolent deſign. It muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all, that the Inventors of uſeful arts and ſciences, the Founders of civil, religious, and literary inſtitutions, and the Deliverers of nations and kingdoms from ſlavery and ruin, are the moſt illuſtrious and eminently uſeful men in the world. The happy effects of their great and noble exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will continue and increaſe to the remoteſt periods of time.</p>
            <p>When ſuch eminently great and uſeful men are removed from the ſtage of life, their removal is a public calamity, which calls for public mourning and ſorrow. All nations have felt the propriety of lamenting the loſs of thoſe who have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently uſeful in life, and of paying them peculiar honors at death. This appears from the practice of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and eſpecially from the funeral rites of the Jews, at the deceaſe and interment of their eminent Judges, Generals, Kings, Prieſts, Prophets, and Patriarchs. When the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Patriarch Jacob died in Egypt, his death was publicly lamented, by a moſt ſolemn and ſplendid funeral. His body being embalmed, the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians mourned for him <hi>threeſcore and ten days.</hi> And after this we are told, "Joſeph went up to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his father; and with him went up <hi>all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of Pharaoh, <hi>the elders</hi> of his houſe, and <hi>all the elders</hi> of the land of Egypt. And <hi>all the houſe</hi> of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037369_0008_100CEEB2E88D87E0"/>
and <hi>his brethren</hi> and <hi>his father's</hi> houſe. And there went up with him both <hi>chariots</hi> and <hi>horſemen:</hi> and <hi>it was a very great company.</hi> And they came to the threſhing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they <hi>mourned with a great and very ſore lamentation;</hi> and <hi>he made a mourning for his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeven days.</hi> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, <hi>ſaw the mourning</hi> in the floor of Atad, they ſaid, This is a <hi>grievous mourning</hi> to the Egyptians." The deceaſe of Aaron on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Canaan was deeply regretted. "When all the congregation ſaw that Aaron was dead, <hi>they mourned</hi> for Aaron <hi>thirty days,</hi> even <hi>all the houſe</hi> of Iſrael." Though Moſes, the ſervant of the Lord and king in Jeſhurun, died and was buried in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; yet his death was publicly and univerſally lamented. It is recorded to his honor, that "the children of Iſrael <hi>wept</hi> for Moſes in the plains of Moab <hi>thirty days:</hi> ſo the days of <hi>weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for Moſes were ended." Samuel was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prophet and Judge in Iſrael, and his death was deplored as a national loſs. We read, "<hi>All the Iſraelites</hi> were gathered together, and <hi>lamented</hi> him, and buried him in his houſe at Ramah." Our text and context contain the lamentation, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the premature and ſudden death of Saul and Jonathan. In a few chapters forward, we find a particular account of the funeral honors paid to an eminent General, who fell by the hand of an
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037369_0009_100CEE660ACF5580"/>
aſſaſſin. "And David ſaid to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with ſackcloth and <hi>mourn</hi> before Abner. And king David himſelf followed the bier. And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and <hi>wept</hi> at the grave of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and <hi>all the people wept.</hi> And the king ſaid to his ſervants, Know ye not that there is a prince and great man fallen this day in Iſrael?" Of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada the prieſt we read, that "he waxed old, and was full of days when he died. And they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him in the city of David, <hi>among the kings,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he had done good in Iſrael,</hi> both toward God, and toward his houſe." It is recorded of Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, that pious prince and eminent reformer, that "he ſlept with his fathers, and they buried him <hi>in the chiefeſt of the ſepulchres of the ſons of David.</hi> And <hi>all Judah</hi> and <hi>the inhabitants</hi> of Jeruſalem <hi>did him honor</hi> at his death." The ſame religious people more deeply lamented the untimely death of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and paid a more public and laſting reſpect to his memory. The account of his death and of their conduct is very ſtriking. "And the archers ſhot at king Joſiah, and the king ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Have me away; for I am wounded. His ſervants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him into the ſecond chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jeruſalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the ſepulchres of his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037369_0010_100CEE69E0C52900"/>
fathers. And <hi>all Judah and Jeruſalem mourned</hi> for Joſiah: and the ſinging-men and ſinging-women ſpake of Joſiah <hi>in their lamentations to this day;</hi> and made them <hi>an ordinance</hi> in Iſrael." Though God often reproved his antient people for paying reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious homage to the idols of the Heathens; yet we never find, that he reproved them for paying fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral honors to departed men of ſuperior merit, among their own nation. Their example in this reſpect, therefore, ſeems to have a divine ſanction, and plainly teaches us the propriety of lamenting the death and commemorating the virtues of thoſe, who have been eminently uſeful in life. But the propriety of this may be ſtill further illuſtrated. Here then permit me to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The death of eminent men never fails to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the glory of a people. Such illuſtrious characters are the ornaments of human nature, and of the nation to which they belong. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, whom God has endued with noble talents, and favored with peculiar opportunities of doing good, either bury or abuſe their intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and become a reproach to their country as well as to their race. But thoſe do honor to their nature and to their nation, who diſplay ſuperior a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, by a ſeries of great and noble actions. A few ſuch illuſtrious characters will render a nation reſpectable in the eyes of all the world. The Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037369_0011_100CEE6B6FDB6B48"/>
were never very rich, nor very numerous, and yet there never was a more renowned nation on earth. Their eminent men have commanded the reſpect and admiration of all ſucceeding ages. Great and good characters are a greater glory to any nation, than all their wealth and numbers. Whenever, therefore, their greateſt and beſt men are removed by death, their glory departs, and they neceſſarily ſink in the view of ſurrounding nations. This ſeems to have been the firſt idea, which ſtruck the mind of David, in compoſing his mournful ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy on the death of Saul and Jonathan. "The <hi>beauty</hi> of Iſrael is ſlain upon the high places." As their lives had increaſed, ſo their death diminiſhed, the glory of their nation. And any people have reaſon to lament the loſs of their glory, when they are bereaved of the fathers and friends of their country.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The death of eminent men not only dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes the glory, but weakens the ſtrength, of a people. Wiſdom is better than weapons of war. The ſtrength of a nation lies in the heads and hearts of thoſe, who have the care and direction of the national concerns. A people may poſſeſs a very rich ſoil, a very extenſive country, and very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſources of wealth; and yet be extremely weak and defenceleſs, merely for the want of able men, to preſide in their councils, and to lead in their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037369_0012_100CEE6D15461F08"/>
armies. This was frequently the caſe in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation. In the time of Joſhua, they were ſtrong, and ſtruck terror into all their enemies; but after his deceaſe, though they increaſed in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet they declined in ſtrength, and became an eaſy prey to every people, who had courage enough to invade their country. In the days of David they were again univerſally reſpected and revered; but in ſucceeding ages, the want of wiſe and valiant men expoſed them to poverty, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſlavery. The ſtrength of the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful nations has often been ſuſpended upon the exertions of a ſingle warrior or ſtateſman. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander raiſed the Grecians to the empire of the world, and that empire was ſuſpended upon his life; for his death divided and diſſolved his exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive dominions. Though it is not very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe, that a ſingle perſon is the ſole ſupport of a people; yet the death of one who ſways either the ſceptre or the ſword, never ſails to give a great national ſhock, and to weaken either the civil or the military ſtrength of the kingdom. David was deeply impreſſed with this painful thought, while deploring the death of thoſe, who fell in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their country. "How are the mighty fallen!" He repeats the ſad reflection. "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!" What avail all our numbers, all our fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and all our national reſources, after our mighty
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037369_0013_100CEE6FD45E7658"/>
men of valor, wiſdom, and experience, are laid in the duſt! The ſame ſentiment he expreſſed with greater ſenſibility on the death of Abner. "I am this day weak, though anointed king." A nation often ſuſtains a greater loſs by the death of an able General, than by the defeat of a numerous army. For it is much eaſier to recruit a numerous army, than to replace a renowned General. No men have been more ſincerely and univerſally lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than thoſe brave and mighty Generals, who have fallen in the field of battle, and by their death depreſſed the hearts, and weakened the hands, of a whole nation. A people, therefore, can never have a greater cauſe for public mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, than the loſs of noble patriots and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, who have been the ſtrength and protection, as well as ornaments, of their country. I may add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The removal of wiſe, virtuous, and valuable men from a people is not only a diſtreſſing, but an alarming diſpenſation of divine providence. It indicates, that God is about to bring a train of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgments upon them, for their ingratitude, and abuſe of public bleſſings. He often took away from the houſe of Iſrael their greateſt and beſt men, as a prelude to a ſeries of national calamities. This appears from his expreſs declaration, by the mouth of the prophet Iſaiah. "Behold, the Lord,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037369_0014_100CEE723478D898"/>
the Lord of hoſts, doth take away from Jeruſalem, and from Judah the <hi>mighty</hi> man, the man <hi>of war,</hi> the <hi>judge,</hi> and the <hi>prophet,</hi> and the <hi>prudent,</hi> and the <hi>ancient,</hi> the <hi>captain</hi> of fifty, and the <hi>honorable</hi> man, and the <hi>counſellor,</hi> and the <hi>cunning</hi> artificer, and the <hi>eloquent</hi> orator." This was a heavy calamity in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a preſage of impending judgments. For it is added, "And I will give <hi>children</hi> to be their princes, and <hi>babes</hi> ſhall rule over them, and the people ſhall be <hi>oppreſſed.</hi>" We often find a train of evils following the death of great and good men in Iſrael. After the death of Joſhua and of the elders that outlived him, the people fell into licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, anarchy, and confuſion, from which they never recovered, until the days of David. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was a prince of peace, and raiſed the nation to the ſummit of earthly glory; but his death di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the kingdom, and threw the twelve tribes into all the horrors and miſeries of civil war; the fatal conſequences of which remain to this day. When a pillar of the ſtate is taken away, it never fails to weaken or unſettle the whole frame of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. While the celebrated Pitt guided the national councils of Britain, ſucceſs crowned all her enterprizes; but as ſoon as he ceaſed to breathe and to ſpeak, her councils were diſtracted, her ſchemes were blaſted, and ſhe ſuſtained a loſs, which will never be repaired. It has often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the courſe of human affairs, that a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037369_0015_100CEE73C68290A0"/>
has fallen, by the death of a ſingle ſtateſman or warrior. And it ought to be remembered, that what has been, may be again. God ſeverely frowns upon a people, when he takes away their great and uſeful men; and at the ſame time, threatens them with ſtill further tokens of his awful diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. This ſhows the duty, as well as the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of their going into mourning, under the bereav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of his providence, which has laid thoſe in the duſt, who once gave energy to their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and victory and triumph to their arms.</p>
            <p>You will now, my hearers, ſpontaneouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we have great reaſon to deplore the late death of General WASHINGTON, as a ſevere frown of Heaven upon our riſing nation. He was unqueſtionably the moſt <hi>uſeful</hi> as well as moſt <hi>illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious</hi> man, of the preſent age. He early entered upon the theatre of public life, and ſpent near fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years in the ſervice of his country. In ſuch a long courſe of time, the important ſtations which he filled, and the trying ſcenes through which he paſſed, gave him ample opportunities of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ſignal deeds of valor, of wiſdom, and of patriotiſm. Though our nation has produced many eminent men in the civil and military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, as well as in every learned and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſion; yet America never produced any other man, who has been ſo eminently and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037369_0016_100CD78AFB5FD828"/>
uſeful to his country and to the world, as WASHINGTON THE GREAT. It is hard to ſay, whether the ſtrength of his mind was ſuperior to the ardor of his patriotiſm; or whether this was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to his ſucceſs in his country's ſervice. In the military department, he undoubtedly intended to ſave his nation from the ſword of their enemies; and here he was completely ſucceeded. In the civil department, he undoubtedly intended to ſave his nation from anarchy and confuſion; and here he was alſo completely ſucceeded. In every ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, whether in the field or in the cabinet, or in his beloved ſeat at Mount Vernon, he always had it in his heart, to ſacrifice his <hi>perſonal</hi> intereſt to the <hi>national</hi> happineſs. This he diſcovered by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and aſtoniſhing inſtances of his <hi>diſintereſted</hi> conduct. Though he jeoparded his life in the high places of the field, purely to defend the lives and liberties and fortunes of his countrymen; yet he would never accept of any pecuniary rewards for his military exertions, which it was in their wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or power to beſtow. Though he took the reins of government into his hands, in mere condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the unanimous voice of the nation; yet he utterly refuſed to receive the legal emoluments of his arduous office. And though, after his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from public life, the people once more teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their high eſtimation of his perſonal merit, by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037369_0017_100CEE7563CB25A0"/>
offering him a gratuity for his great and noble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; yet his patriotic heart would not permit him to accept it, on any other condition, than that of devoting it wholly to public and beneficent uſes. How many men of diſtinction, in the late Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war, had the courage to perform noble and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic deeds; and yet, at the ſame time, had the meanneſs to make their private fortunes, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding the public? And how many famous ſtateſmen and heroes, in other nations, have firſt gained the applauſe of their country, and then mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited the execration of the world, for their mean and mercenary motives? But it is the peculiar glory of Waſhington, that his character will admit of no deduction. He never deſerted, he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, he never oppreſſed the people, whom he defended in war, and governed in peace. Inſtead of putting his money, he put his character at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. The noble, patriotic ſpirit, which he uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly diſplayed, ſpread a glory over all his public conduct, and had a greater influence, than all his wiſdom and valor, in uniting America and the world in his favor. His love to his country ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſecured his country's love, which placed him in thoſe eminent ſtations, in which he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch pre-eminent ſervices, as will embalm his memory, and perpetuate his fame, to the lateſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:037369_0018_100CEE778D3919F0"/>
But, alas! amidſt all his glory and uſefulneſs, God has been pleaſed to remove him, not only from our ſight, but from our help. "How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!" The glory of our nation is departed. We have loſt a large ſhare of reſpectability in the eyes of Britain, in the eyes of France, and in the eyes of every nation, to which our flag has wafted the fame of Waſhington. Diſtant nations have heretofore formed their opinions of America, from the great and amiable character of him, who defeated our enemies, and put us in poſſeſſion of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom and independence. Whether, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are friendly or unfriendly to our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing country, they cannot view us in that exalted light, in which they were conſtrained to view us, while we juſtly claimed, as our own, the greateſt patriot, the greateſt general, the greateſt man, in the world.</p>
            <p>But our national ſtrength, no leſs than our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional glory, is diminiſhed. How are the weapons of war periſhed in the periſhing hand of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington! Whilſt he lived to direct and animate our little band of warriors, they virtually poſſeſſed all the martial ſpirit and ſtrength of the United States. His ſingle voice could call as many fighting men into the field to their aſſiſtance, as the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037369_0019_100CEE7A454C4AF0"/>
exigencies of the times could demand. This our foreign enemies believed, and kept their diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This our internal enemies knew, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in ſilence and deſpair. But God has ſeen fit to take from us the <hi>mighty man</hi> and <hi>man of war,</hi> who was the ornament and defence of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, at a moſt critical time, when the world are in arms, and every nation ſeems to be ſpreading miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and deſtruction to the utmoſt of their power. Though the armies of Europe have not invaded our country, yet the courts of Europe have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their political arts to embarraſs our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, divide our councils, and draw us into their deſtructive contentions. And how far they have ſucceeded, the melancholy event, which we this day deplore, may ſerve to diſcover. The death of our renowned Chief may encourage, unite, and ſtrengthen all our national enemies. How far it may affect our preſent Embaſſy to France and the preſent oppoſition to the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we cannot determine, though we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much to fear. The deceaſe of the Friend and Father of our country would have been, at any time, a public calamity; but at this dark and diſtreſſing day, it is a peculiar frown of Heaven. God is now, therefore, loudly calling us to humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation and mourning. And though we may <hi>ſay and do too much,</hi> yet there is the utmoſt danger <hi>of our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037369_0020_100CEE7D10E58408"/>
too little,</hi> under his correcting hand. The plain and ſolemn language of his providence is, "Put not your truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts periſh." Waſhington is no more with reſpect to us, and it will be groſs idolatry ſtill to confide in his tomb, or to depend upon any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his in our favor, in the world of ſpirits. His removal, at this peculiar time, we have reaſon to believe, was deſigned as a ſolemn admonition to America, to renounce an undue dependence <hi>on an arm of fleſh,</hi> and to place their ſupreme confidence <hi>in the Lord Jehovah, in whom there is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> And what could have been better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to produce this deſirable effect? Is Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington dead? His ſucceſſor in command may die. Is Waſhington dead? The Preſident may die. Is Waſhington dead? The wiſeſt and beſt man in any department may die, and diſappoint the hopes of the court, of the army, of the navy, of all his fellow citizens. Death has lately made breach after breach in the congregation of the mighty. How many men of eminent wiſdom, integrity, and patriotiſm, who were the bulwarks of our land, have been followed to their tombs, by their weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countrymen, in the courſe of a very few
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037369_0021_100CEE7EA3D416B0"/>
months! "Ceaſe ye therefore from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?"</p>
            <p>God ſeems to be coming out againſt us in the way of judgment, and it nearly concerns all ranks and orders of men, to prepare to meet him in the alarming diſpenſations of his providence. By the death we are deploring, he is reading a ſolemn lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the vanity and frailty of life, and teaching every one the abſurdity, as well as criminality, of relying on any inherent quality or outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, to ſhield him from the ſtroke of death. Let not the ſtrong man truſt in his ſtrength; for Waſhington the Mighty is dead. Let not the rich man truſt in his wealth; for Waſhington the Wealthy is dead. Let not the great man truſt in his greatneſs; for Waſhington the Great is dead. Let not the benevolent man truſt in his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and uſefulneſs; for Waſhington the Father of his country and the Friend of man is dead. This ſolemn inſtance of mortality, which has now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the whole nation in the houſes of God, and dreſſed all claſſes of citizens in the garments of mourning, loudly calls them to conſider, that "they are this day going the way of all the earth." The time cannot be far diſtant, when they muſt all deſcend to the grave, ſtripped of their wealth, of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037369_0022_100CEE814DDA6EB8"/>
their ornaments, and of all their earthly diſtinctions, and lie as low in the duſt, as the man they lament.</p>
            <p>But while we are contemplating the tomb of Waſhington, and deploring the day of his death; let us not forget to rejoice at the day of his birth. That day was a ſignal mercy to America, which ought to be had in grateful and perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. He was born neither too early, nor too late, for his own glory, or the public good. He came upon the ſtage of life, at the very time, when the wideſt field of uſefulneſs was opened before him. He entered into that field, and ſpent his days in performing the moſt illuſtrious and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſervices for his native country. For theſe, we juſtly owe him a large debt of public gratitude and reſpect, which is the only proper and adequate reward of eminent virtue and public uſefulneſs. We can eaſily calculate the value of that time or ſtrength, which is employed for our perſonal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; but who can fully eſtimate the worth of thoſe eminent virtues and talents, which are diſplayed in eminent ſervices for the public good? The path to every ſpecies of eminence is extremely ſteep and difficult. No man ever arrived at extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary uſefulneſs, without extraordinary exertions. It is as hard to comprehend the cares, the perils, the ſelf-denying and arduous labors of thoſe, who
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037369_0023_100CEE83E5387910"/>
guide the movements of armies, or direct the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of ſtate; as it is to eſtimate the great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous benefits, which may accrue to a nation, to a country, or to the world, in the courſe of ages, from their great and noble efforts. Nothing, therefore, can fully diſcharge our ſtrong and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing obligations to the Father and Defender of our country, but the moſt grateful emotions of heart, and the moſt durable monuments of public reſpect. Let theſe be erected, and ſacredly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as long as the name of Americans ſhall be known in the earth But while we are faithful to the Fame of our illuſtrious Benefactor, let us be wiſe to appreciate his great and amiable Example, which is really more valuable to each of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, than all his legacies, bequeathed to his friends. There is ſomething in his illuſtrious life, which comes home to the buſineſs and boſom of every perſon, whether he acts in a public or private capacity. Let thoſe, who manage the affairs of government, imitate his wiſdom, integrity, patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and invincible firmneſs. Let thoſe, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the field, imitate his courage, fortitude, prudence, patience, ſecrecy, and ſelf-poſſeſſion. Let thoſe, who live in wealth and affluence, imitate his private charity and public beneficence. Let thoſe, who are fond of ſplendor and parade, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his Republican virtues, and imitate his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037369_0024_100CEE85730D2B08"/>
ſimplicity of manners. Let the wealthy and independent farmer follow his example of econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, induſtry, and perſeverance in buſineſs. Let the aged imitate his decent gravity and perfect equanimity. Let the young deſpiſe the vanities, which he deſpiſed; avoid the vices, which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; and practiſe thoſe ſober and manly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which he practiſed, in the morning of his days. In a word, let all claſſes and deſcriptions of men imitate that moderation, that public ſpirit, and that tender concern for the good of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which he ſo eminently diſplayed in every part of his private and public life. Whoever wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be eminently uſeful in any private employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or public ſtation, let him think, and act, and live like Waſhington. He never loſt any time. He never purſued any trifles. He never neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any advantages. He never buried any talents. He never lived for himſelf, but for the univerſal benefit of his fellow men. This commanded their love and admiration, while he lived; and this throws them into mourning and ſorrow, at his death. "How beautiful is ſuch an example? how worthy of univerſal imitation?" Whoever follows it, ſhall live univerſally beloved, and die univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally lamented.</p>
