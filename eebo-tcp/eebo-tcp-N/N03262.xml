            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And from the Days of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> until now, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by force.</p>

            <p>THE great goodneſs of the Bleſſed God is equally apparent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in preparing a Happineſs for his People, revealing the way to it, and ſending his Servants to incultate by all Arts of Perſwaſion poſſible, the Neceſſity, Importance and Reaſonableneſs of travelling in the One, in order to obtain the other. Of this the Text under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſideration treats, in which we may Note Three Things,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A Commendation of the Baptiſts Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>An Illuſtration of Gods Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>A Deſcription of the Way to Happineſs.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Baptiſts Commendation: It's ſaid, that <hi>from his time the Kingdom of Heaven
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003966_0004_10031AA3058B53A8"/>ſuffered Violence,</hi> i. e. from the Time in which he began to preach, the Goſpel Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be remarkably eſtabliſhed; its Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines eagerly embraced, and it's Precepts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently Practiſed; and in this importunate painful courſe, his convinced hearers longed after, and labour'd for the Happineſs of the bleſſed in Heaven. To this purpoſe <hi>Piſeator</hi> and others, ſpeak. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> obſerves perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People were forbid to touch the <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> but that now we may uſe Violence in aſcending the miſtical Mountain: So <hi>Grotius</hi> alſo notes, <hi>Suffers Violence, Biazetai,</hi> i. e. is obtained by <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Repentance, Ignominy, Poverty,</hi> ſo <hi>Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius, Baſil, Chriſoſtom, Hilarie, Auſtine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God's Goodneſs is great in not only ſuffering guilty Creatures to take Heaven by Violence, but even in exciting them to it, and in aſſiſting them in the performance of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have a Deſcription of the Way to the Imperial Heaven in theſe Words, <hi>and the Violent take it by Force:</hi> Theſe who are truly convinc'd of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and of Judgment<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> 16.8.</note> labour to take Heaven by Storm and will not ſtick at any coſt to obtain it. Theſe ſeek with importunate vehemence,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003966_0005_10031AA62349E3C8"/>like <hi>Jacob</hi> of old, and will not ceaſe until they obtain the bleſſing.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26.</note> Theſe put a force upon their corrupt Nature, are willing to perform the hardeſt Services, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the ſevereſt ſufferings, in order to obtain the great Salvation, <hi>(by force)</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves; the <hi>Jews</hi> who were the Children of the Kingdom rejected it, and the deſpiſed <hi>Gentiles</hi> imbrac'd it with readineſs and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence; even the Publicans and Harlots; the poor and Illiterate People, whom the proud Rabbins deem'd accurſed.</p>
            <p>Again, the Word ſeems to ſignify, that the Kingdom of Heaven is not now confin'd to one People as of old, but lies open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, without any National Incloſures, that whoever will take perſevering pains for it may poſſeſs it; ſo <hi>Brugenſis, Tirinus, Hilary</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Once more it may ſignify that the Kingdom of Heaven, is not now ſo much entail'd on Deſcent and progeny, as confer'd on perſevering Virtue; ſo <hi>Menochius</hi> and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate.</hi> We are ſaid to take that by Violence which we tear out of anothers Hands; the Kingdom of Heaven ſeem'd to belong to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Children by Covenant, even that Kingdom is ſeiz:d and taken out of their Sloathful indolent Hands, by the inferiour
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003966_0006_10031AA7E94EAD30"/>
               <hi>Gentiles,</hi> through the violence of Faith and earneſt Labour.</p>
            <p>From the Words of our Text, thus briefly paraphrazed, we may obſerve the following Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe who wou'd obtain an Intereſt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, muſt uſe <hi>Violence,</hi> in order to it.</p>
            <p>Intreating upon this Propoſition, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew, 1ſt, what are the Properties of this Kingdom. 2d, What are the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its Poſſeſſors, or what is included in that <hi>Violence</hi> which is neceſſary in order to obtain an Intereſt in it. 3d. With whom we ſhould uſe Violence. 4th. In what, 5th, For what. And then Improve it in a Threefold Uſe.

            </p>
            <p>And, 1. I am to ſhew you what are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of this Kingdom; it will appear, I think, by conſidering the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that it has all the amiable Qualities that may command Eſteem, or excite, Deſire. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is an Ancient Kingdom, it had its riſe before the Foundation of the Earth were laid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Specious Kingdom: The Globe of the Earth is a vaſt Body in extent and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and yet it is but a ſmall Point, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the viſible Heavens, which at an immenſe diſtance circle and compaſs it. Now
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003966_0007_10031AADB7A5DD68"/>the Emperial, or third Heaven is Superiour to, and therefore doubtleſs greater than the Chriſtaline. Therefore well might the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus inform his mourning Diſciples, that in his Fathers Houſe were many Manſions, <hi>John</hi> 14.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A rich opulent Kingdom; it abounds with all things, that are neceſſary, for Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Support, Wealth, Pleaſure. There are Thrones of Righteouſneſs, Enſigns of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Palms of Victory, Manſions of Beauty, Diadems of Glory.</p>
            <p>There unambitious Honour bears unſullied Laurels, being fearleſs of a Rival, or invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Detractive, the poignant Darts of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Reproach ſhall never ſtain the white Names of the Lambs followers in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There is the Manna of Angels to feed upon; there be the pure Chriſtal Fountains of Life to bathe in, and drink of, that Spring from the Throne of God, and the Lamb, with an invarible and eternal Tenor; there is the Tree of Life, richly laden with Apples of Salvation, bearing Twelve manner of Fruits, whoſe Leaves are for the healing of the Nations.<note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev,</hi> 22.1, 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are Streets of Gold, Gates of Pearl, and Walls of Jaſper.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</note> But above all,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003966_0008_10031AAF6E6B0E80"/>there is a Lamb of God, the Pearl of great Price, who is infinitely more valuable than if the immenſe Globe of the Earth, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable Deeps of the Ocean, the broad Sheets of the Chriſtaline or Emperial Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were turned into a Body of Maſſy or Liquid Gold! And this Pearl, <hi>dear Brethren,</hi> whoſe worth Surpaſſes the higheſt Flight of an Angel's Thought to conceive, or his Tongue to expreſs, belongs to every inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of that Kingdom. O Bleſſed God, how Great and Stupendious is thy Mercy, and dear Affection, that ſuffers ſuch a Kingdom to be taken through Violence by the guilty, baſe Creatures. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>There are pure and perpetual Pleaſures, ſinleſs and unſtain'd Delights; for the Lamb is the perpetual ſource of Light to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of that Kingdom; there ſin with all its ruful train of Sorrow, Shame, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Diſeaſes, Darkneſs and Death, has not acceſs or reſidence; all Tears are wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Sorrow and Sighing forever flee; the Inhabitants of that Kingdom ſhall not ſay, they are ſick.<note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24.</note> So that there will be no Avenues of entrance for that Sable Serjeant <hi>Death</hi> to arreſt them: But on the contrary, the Sun of Righteouſneſs will ſhine with uncloaded Luſtre upon all the Denizons of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003966_0009_10031ABB0315A088"/>that City, opening to their Underſtandings, all the dark Scenes of Nature, Grace and Providence, ſhewing the united tendency of every of them to exalt the declaritive Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Divine Perfections, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the compleat Happineſs of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>But more particularly expreſſing the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing heights of his Wiſdom, the Stupendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous depths of his Love, and the awful extent of his Power! what joyful Tranſports muſt needs poſſes the Breaſts of the Redeem'd! When without an intercepting Glaſs they ſhall perpetually behold the Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, the amiable and tranſcendent Excellencies of the Redeemer, and clearly perceive (without the leaſt doubt to Eternity) every of theſe engaged to promote their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and alſo feel the everlaſting Streams of the Divine Love and Affection; and be bleſs'd with the Social Worſhip of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, without any defect, variation or Period. but do I pretend to deſcribe theſe things!

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003966_0017_10031ADAC59CDFD8"/>and reſiſt the flattering Charms of it, as a drowſy Man would do when he perceives the Houſe on fire over his Head. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite to this, we ſhould conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as the Sluggards Field is cover'd with Thorns, and his Back with Rags, as <hi>Solomon</hi> inſtructs us, ſo Sluggiſh Souls are over grown with Corruptions, depriv'd of the Robes of the Redeemers Righteouſneſs, and can expect nothing (reaſonably) but Shame and contempt.

            <p n="2">2. That the Sluggards deſire, ſlay him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Hands refuſe to labour,<note n="(g)" place="bottom">

And may not carnal Slothful Sinners, that fondly hug their ſinful Eaſe and Security in deſpite of the Remonſtrances of Reaſon and Conſcience, fooliſhly delaying to ſeek pardoning Mercy? and courting a little more Sleep, a little more Slumber, alſo expect to eat their own Fleſh i. e.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003966_0018_10031ADE6EC62AB8"/>to be fill'd with ſuch Indignation againſt themſelves (perhaps when it's too late to mend the matter) that they will be deſirous to tear out their own Bowels for their Madneſs in neglecting (thro' Sloth) to improve the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Price put into their Hands, in Hell there will be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth. Once more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Sluggard will not Plow by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of cold, and ſo want's Bread in Harveſt.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Prov. <hi>20.4.</hi>
               </note> ſo are there not many ſloathful Souls that neglect theſe Duties of Religon, which are as neceſſary to obtain Happineſs as plowing is to prepare for a Crop, becauſe of ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that attends the performance? But as there is no Compariſon between ſuffering a little Cold and ſtarving for want of Bread: So is there any paralel between the temporary. Pains of Mortification and the eternal Agonies of Damnation? but</p>
            <p n="2">2, We ſhould equally reſiſt the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan with the Sloth of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; O how many are the Artful policies and deep devices of Satan to keep the People of God, eſpecially from the ſweet Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes he will tell them that they are not in a right Frame now, your Prayer with
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003966_0019_10031AE7067D58B0"/>ſuch a cold Frame, will ſignify nothing, it will be but a meer mocking of God, ſtay a little longer till you get a good frame, and then go to Prayer; and ſo perhaps the Seaſon of the Day is loſt and the poor Soul is brought under Guilt by the ſinful Neglect; Satan thy Temptation is both unreaſonable and falſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's unreaſonable; it's as if a poor Beggar would neglect aſking an Alms, 'till it was given him without aſking for, (which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably expect) and then go and aſk for it. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's falſe that there is no good in ſuch Prayers as are offer'd with a Cold frame; the Matter is ſurely good, for it is an Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the divine Command; and oftentimes when the People of God begin with a cold frame, they end in a warm one; for God will meet theſe that wait upon him in his Way. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence after this manner, with a holy Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is an Evidence of our uprightneſs, and the good God is not unjuſt to forget our Work and Labour of Love. And truly it is an Act of greater Self-denial to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in Duty when Gods Face is hid from us, than when we are under the ſhines of it. Again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Satan will plead, you have no Time, no Time for Prayer; and ſo point to other Duties you have to do; <hi>Anſw.</hi> Pray how
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003966_0020_10031AEB79568720"/>can this be, for what was all our Time given us? But to ſerve God and ſecure an intereſt in his Love? What have we time to free our Bellies and chatter idle Diſcourſe, and no time to ſerve the God that made us? O ſhame! But</p>
            <p n="4">4. It Satan finds that we will go to Prayer do what he can, then he'll liſten into your Ear, be ſhort, be ſhort, juſt run over the Heads of Prayer, and that will do for this Time well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; God knows your wants before you ſpeak, you can't inform him, he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, you can't turn him, and alſo you muſt beware of vain Repetitions. It's true Satan, we can't inform God, but we ſhould obey him, we can't affect him, but we may in ſome Sort our ſelves. Again</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Devil will alledge that it favours too much of the Covenant of Works of a legal Spirit to be ſo Diligent in Duties.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the pleaſures of the World: How lively can many be in diſcourſe, in eating and drinking, they can ſit up late enough to perform theſe pleaſant tasks; but when ever Prayer comes upon the Board, then their Spirits lag, and they are preſently diſpos'd to take a Nap; Is this taking Heaven by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence!</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.
