         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OF all the Pamphlets you ſent me on the Differences in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> none ſurpriz'd me ſo much as that entitled, "<hi>A Letter from</hi> Charles Read, <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> John Ladd, <abbr>
                  <hi>Eſq</hi>
               </abbr>"—When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this Letter either as the Production of the Secretary or Judge, I am amazed to think how it came into print. As Secretary, it was out of his Province to write ſuch a Letter to Juſtices; he had nothing more to do, than to ſignify his Excellency's Orders of Protection; and had the Governor not thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to give any Account of the Diſturbances
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009774_0003_0F7A563EE49A9330"/>in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the Letter-Writer ſhould have ſaid ſo, and delivered the Governor's Sentiments, and not his Own.— As a Judge there is no Excuſe; and it grieves me to think that a Juſtice of the Supream Court, ſhould ſo far forget himſelf, as to give his Opinion upon Hear-ſay, and brand People with the Name of MURDERERS, upon bare Report.</p>
            <p>The Letter has a moſt extraordinary Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: I ſhould be glad to know who the <hi>ſome Perſons of good Character in Philadelphia,</hi> are, upon whoſe Application the Governor ſo readily granted his Licence and Protection for <hi>ſome</hi> Indians to reſide in this Province; and who thoſe Indians are, that we are told, <hi>"have been always in the Engliſh Intereſt."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Letter-Writer certainly knows: Why did he not then ſpeak out? I am ſure indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Men will think it very ſtrange to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to intereſt Magiſtrates in Favour of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009774_0003_0F7A563EE49A9330"/>Indians, by Invectives againſt Men they are Strangers to, as well as to the Motives of their Conduct.</p>
            <p>Any Application from private Perſons, of ever ſo good Character, in my Opinion, was not a ſufficient Reaſon to iſſue an Order of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for the Protection of Indians, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with high Crimes, by the Inhabitants of the Frontier-Counties of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> The People will judge for themſelves; and when they know that the Government of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> did not apply, but that theſe Indians ought to be in the City of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> they will naturally conſtrue this Letter as a preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated Thing, and an entering voluntarily on one Side of a Queſtion, and giving a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgment againſt a Number of Men, on the bare Word of <hi>ſome</hi> Perſons who are not known, in favour of <hi>ſome</hi> Indians, who may be Enemies, for ought we know</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009774_0004_0F7A56408DD74DF0"/>
But to brand a People with the Name of MURDERERS—to repreſent them in a State of Infatuation—to charge them with Crimes of the blackeſt Dye, ſurely requir'd better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than bare Report; and plainly ſhews that the Letter-Writer had inliſted himſelf as Advocate in a Matter and Meaſures wherein the Province was not in the leaſt concerned, but he determined to ſupport.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Weak Minds are apt to be inflamed,"</hi> he is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>"on reading an Article in the Gazette, of a few Perſons being killed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, &amp;c."</hi>— And no Wonder, as the Indian Mode of War is horrid, and their Cruelty ſhocking: But this is the firſt Time I have ever heard it palliated, and that generous Ardor that is raiſed on the Report of Indian Inroads, (which, if properly directed, would chaſtiſe Indian Inſolence) ſtiled <hi>a Weakneſs</hi> of Mind, and lowered to a Ferment rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to Human Nature. At the ſame
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009774_0004_0F7A56408DD74DF0"/>Time he confeſſes the Affair at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> has raiſed his <hi>Reſentment;</hi> whether it is a Proof of the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of his Mind, I leave to him to determine. This he muſt allow, that the People have as good a Right to judge as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and it may be feared they will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <hi>Weakneſs</hi> to him only.</p>
            <p>But he has drawn his Pen not ſo much to ſignify the Governor's Orders, as to write profeſſedly in Favour of Meaſures that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtify'd; and has not heſitated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn without Evidence, and to ſpeak of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in a Manner none can approve.</p>
            <p>Had he reflected ever ſo little on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Affairs, he muſt have found that it was not a Time to cry up Indian Numbers, when we are juſtly arming to ſcourge them for their Inſolence and Cruelty: He would have found that ſuch Stories might diſcourage the inliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men for the Campaign; and that when the People hear, from his Pen, that ſuch are the Indians and the Situation of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that half a Million of Men (for of ſo many as leaſt conſiſted the Armies on all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009774_0005_0F7A56412A78E8D8"/>Sides the laſt War) are not able to effect their Ruin, might it not naturally follow that our People may be backward to inliſt and diſpirited when led to the Field: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he ſhould have attended to, and conſider'd, before he blindly eſpouſed a Party, and aſſerted Facts he can have no Evidence to ſupport: But his over Zeal has prevented the bad Effects his round Aſſertion might otherwiſe have produced.</p>
            <p>There are many other Things in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Letter which I would take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, but I have exceeded the Bounds I preſcribed, which nothing could have induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to, but the Regard I have for <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and my real Sorrow to ſee the Authority of its Government proſtituted, to ſupport a Party in the Protection of Indians in this Province, which they found themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do in their own.</p>
