            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, TO THE Rev. Mr. DAVID BOSTWICK. At NEW-YORK.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend and dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MOST gladly I embrace the preſent Opportunity to anſwer you Requeſt, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That I would give you a brief Account of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s Education, Character, and fitneſs for his deſigned Miſſion:—Moſt gladly,—becauſe, I am not without Hope, that it may have ſome Influence, to promote one of the moſt important and beneficent Deſigns in the World: As I am well aſſured it will, if by Means thereof, any well diſpoſed Perſons ſhall be excited to contribute the more liberally toward upholding and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> in his Miſſion among the aboriginal Natives of <hi>America;</hi> and any of them by the Bleſſing of God upon his Labours, for that Purpoſe ſhould be truly evangelized.</p>
            <p>To make Uſe of Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s own Phraſeology, He was brought up a <hi>Heathen</hi> till he entered upon the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of his Age: At which Age, he began to ſeek after an increaſing Acquaintance with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and to labour after being indoctrinated in the Chriſtian Religion. But before the Expiration of this Year, (which he calls the Year of Salvation to him) he ſays, that he can but hope, "it pleaſed GOD to reveal his Son JESUS CHRIST, in him and to him," in a
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:008808_0003_102FEF9716DCDFF0"/>
ſpiritual and ſaving Manner. He had at this Time, a clear, powerful, and practical Conviction of the moral Pollution of his Nature, and of the great Defilement of his Life, by actual Sin; of his loſt, miſerable and undone State by Nature; of his utter Inability to liberate himſelf from this deplorable Condition; of his Unworthineſs to be help'd, and of the Juſtice of GOD in his final and eternal Rejection. And having with deep Solicitude, and Anxiouſneſs of Mind, turned every Stone, and tried every Expedient within the Compaſs of his Power, by the Uſe of Means, in order to obtain Salvation, found thereupon, an abſolute Neceſſity of reſigning himſelf up to GOD, as rightful Lord, and an infinite Sovereign, who might ſave or deſtroy him forever, as he pleaſed: And thus ſubmiting to GOD, as merciful, and could ſave, and juſt if he caſt off and deſtroyed; at this ſolemn Seaſon, he believes, the holy Spirit illuminated his Mind, and enabled him to behold the divinely glorious Objects of Faith, and inclined him to elect and chooſe GOD, as his laſt End, and chief Good, through the divine Mediator CHRIST JESUS. From which Time to the preſent, he ſeriouſly profeſſes, to have found a great Change wrought in the Temper, Bias, and Inclination of his Soul; turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it from Sin to Holineſs, from the Creature to GOD. He obſerves, that among other Things, opening to View at this Time; he ſaw in an affecting Light, the infinite Reaſonableneſs of dedicating himſelf, entirely and abſolutely, to GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, as his Owner, to be diſpoſed of by him, as his Ruler, to obey him, as his Benefactor and chief Good, thankfully to depend on him, and love him, and live to him, as his ultimate End. And alſo, that while he looked upon his <hi>Kinsfolk,</hi> "as periſhing for Lack of Viſion," he found within himſelf a bleeding Tenderneſs of Heart, and unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Bowels of Compaſſion toward them: Which excited in him, ardent Deſires after becoming under Advantage to promote their Inſtruction, in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Chriſtian Religion, and to befriend them with Regard to their eternal Salvation.—Hearing that
<pb facs="unknown:008808_0004_102FEF9AF4A81658"/>
the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eleazar Wheelock,</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Lebanon,</hi> had a Number of Youth under his Care and Tuition, Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> earneſtly requeſted of him, the Favour of becoming one of the Number; which, after ſome Examination was readily granted. Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> lived about three Years with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Wheelock,</hi> and one Year with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Pumroy,</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Hebron,</hi>—proſecuting the Study of the <hi>Engliſh, Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Languages; and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome Acquaintance with the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>—During this Time, Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> made ſuch Progreſs in Learning, that he was ſo well fitted for Admittance into College, (which was deſigned) that he doubtleſs would have entered upon his ſecond Year, at his firſt Admiſſion. But through intenſe Application to Study, he very much weakened his Eye-Sight, ſo that 'twas judged prudent for him to deſiſt from ſevere Study for a Time: After ſome Months Trial, finding his Eye-Sight ſtill remained ſo weak as not to admit of hard Study, 'twas thought adviſeable, that he ſhould enter upon the Buſineſs of keeping School: Which he accordingly did among the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Montauk,</hi> who live upon the Eaſt End of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> to whom he has been very beneficial, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Youth and Children <hi>there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT a Year and a Half before Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Reverend Aſſociation of <hi>Windham</hi> County, in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> gave him a <hi>Licence</hi> to preach, as a Candidate for the Goſpel Miniſtry, and referred him to <hi>our</hi> Preſbytery for Ordination, in caſe <hi>we</hi> thought proper. While theſe Things were tranſacting, ſeveral Letters came to Hand, from our worthy and dear Friend, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Davies,</hi> (ſince Preſident of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> College, and we truſt now in Glory) warmly urging Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s Ordination, with a View to his going upon a Miſſion among the <hi>Cherokees;</hi> but they taking an unhappy Turn, and engaging in a War with us, that Deſign was obſtructed. We received the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the perfidious Conduct of the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Nation, a few Days before the Time appointed by the Preſbytery
<pb facs="unknown:008808_0005_102FEF9D73595ED8"/>
for Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s Ordination; nevertheleſs, that was not preventive of it; for a Motion had been made for his entering upon a Miſſion among the <hi>Mohawks;</hi> and there are ſeveral Tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> on the Continent, and alſo upon this <hi>Iſland,</hi> that he could miniſter unto occaſionally; and it was hoped that GOD in his Providence, in due Time, would open an effectual Door for his Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, among them who dwell in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>—Whereupon, the Preſbytery finding of him, upon due Examination, poſſeſt of a hopeful Meaſure of neceſſary Qualifications therefor, proceeded to ſeparate him to the Work of the ſacred Miniſtry, according to Goſpel-Rule and Order.</p>
            <p>FROM which Time to the preſent, he has principally preached to the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Montauk;</hi> who, I fear will ſoon perceive ſome lamentable Effects of his Departure from them.</p>
            <p>'TIS now eleven or twelve Year ſince Mr. <hi>Occum</hi> has officiated in the Quality of a School-Maſter; during which Time, he has been making Proficiency in the various Parts of Learning, which ſerve to qualify, in their Place, for preaching the Goſpel, which all along he has had in View. But his Progreſs in Learning has been much retarded, and his Uſefulneſs greatly embarraſſed, for Want of due Support, and thereby Freedom from wordly Cares and Avocations; yet he has improved Time with ſo much Vigilance and Induſtry, as to become poſſeſt of a good Degree of uſeful Learning; and has been improving to good Purpoſe in the Chriſtian Life. He is endued with no ſmall Degree of Knowledge in the holy Scriptures; and in the whole of his Deportment, he exhibits ample Evidence, that he has a living Faith within, of divine Truths.</p>
            <p>As a Preacher of the Goſpel, he ſeems always to have before his Eye, the great End of the Miniſtry, the Glory of GOD, and the Salvation of Men. As the Matter of his Sermons is deſigned for the good of Souls; ſo his Way of Expreſſion is proper to that End. He uſes great Plainneſs of Speech, and makes cloſe Application of Truth
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:008808_0006_102FEFA00596BD88"/>
to the Conſcience; which you well know Sir, that although this is not ſo agreeable to thoſe, who are loth to have their Minds impreſſed with a juſt Senſe of the Weight of Things eternal; nor ſo pleaſing to them who form a Taſte rather for the Flowers of Oratory, than for the ſubſtantial Food of the Sanctuary; yet 'tis that Method of preaching which is beſt adapted to do good to the Souls of Men; and upon which, the LORD is pleaſed to command his Bleſſing. Thoſe, who have had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to obſerve, take Notice, that his Manner of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when he preaches to the <hi>Indians,</hi> is vaſtly more natural and free, clear and eloquent, quick and powerful, than 'tis wont to be, when he preaches to others. As an Inſtructor of the <hi>Indians,</hi> he makes frequent Uſe of apt and ſignificant Similitudes, to convey and illuſtrate Truth: Such a Method of conveying <hi>Ideas,</hi> you know, Sir, is natural to <hi>Indians</hi> in general, and therefore, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as pleaſing as 'tis natural.</p>
            <p>IN Prayer, his Solemnity and Reverence are becoming one that beholds him who is inviſible: He appears eminently enrich'd with a Spirit of Adoption; and ſeems often indulged with much holy Freedom of Acceſs to the Throne of Grace. His Mind is chiefly intent upon, and his Heart much drawn forth, in Deſires after thoſe Bleſſings which are infinitely the moſt excellent and important.</p>
            <p>HE adds Force to the Doctrines he preaches, by the prevailing Charms of an unſpotted Life, and a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as becomes the Goſpel. From the Time that he hopefully experienced a ſaving Change, to this very Day, he has been preſerved from that Sin, which ſeems to be the <hi>Indians' Conſtitution Sin;</hi> and from every Sin, that is commonly called ſcandalous: In all Reſpects, he has a negative Goodneſs; and ſhines in the poſitive Beauties of Holineſs. In ſhort, he is an Ornament to the Chriſtian Religion, and the Glory of the <hi>Indian</hi> Nation,</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Occum</hi> is well acquainted with the Nature and Eſſence of Religion, as it eminently conſiſts in a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the whole Soul to the moral Excellencies of GOD,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:008808_0007_102FEFA2B6D50490"/>
and his Will. He is ſound in Principle, and well eſtabliſhed in the Belief of divine Truth; and is far from reſting in a naked and cold Aſſent thereto, he labours after, and appears actually poſſeſt of a good Degree of the Life and power of Godlineſs; as a Man, judiciouſly zealous and happily free from an enthuſiaſtick Turn of Mind; an Attainment, we believe, Sir, as truly excellent as 'tis uſeful and r<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

He is indeed well pleaſed with raiſed and holy religious Affections, as the Reſult of a proportionable Degree of Illumination of Mind, and as they powerfully influence to practical Holineſs, and excite to a permanent Devotedneſs to the Service and Glory of GOD. There is therefore, juſt Ground to believe, that as an Inſtructor of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> he will teach them the Truth as it is in JESUS; that he will be far from reſting of them in the <hi>Form</hi> of Knowledge, and mere external Reformation; without preſſing upon them the abſolute Neceſſity of Regeneration, by the holy Spirit's Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thereupon, the Fruits of evangelical and univerſal Holineſs.</p>
            <p>AND now, Sir, from theſe broken Hints, and that agreeable perſonal Interview, I ſuppoſe you will likely have with Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> when theſe Lines come to Hand, you will no Doubt, judge for yourſelf, as to his Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Fitneſs for the Miſſion he is entering upon.</p>
            <p>MY known Affection to Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> may perhaps incline ſome to conclude, that I am prejudiced in his Favour, and therefore am exceſſive in giving theſe Sketches of his Character: 'Tis true, that I am not aſhamed the World ſhould know, that my Heart loves him; that I rejoice in the Grace of GOD conferred upon him; that I admire the Pearl of Goſpel Grace, that is <hi>ſet,</hi> not in the Heart of a Nobleman, but in the Heart of an <hi>Indian,</hi> born a <hi>Pagan;</hi> where it diſplays a ſprightly Beam, may be of ſignal Service, and afford a Fund of Uſefulneſs; and that I ſeek to promote his being under Advantage to do much Service in his Day, by what I now write; but then I riſque my Character upon it with thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpel, and private Chriſtians, who
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:008808_0008_102FEFA5913A04D8"/>
are moſt acquainted with Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> that, (ſo far as I know) I have written no more than what is juſt, and the real Truth, with Reſpect to him.</p>
            <p>I am apt to believe, Sir, that in the Requeſt you exhibit,—you ſeek not ſo much your own Satisfaction, (having before now heard ſo much in Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s Favour) as the Information of thoſe, who would gladly be informed what Encouragement there is to promote him in his Miſſion, on Account of his Qualifications therefore: And that you propoſe as a ſpecial End, an Incentive to the benevolent and truly generous Spirit of Chriſtianity, that nothing of an outward Nature may be wanting, which may be conducive to promote his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and glorious Embaſſy. This, Sir, I hope will ſufficiently juſtify your Requeſt, and my Compliance, in giving ſo much of the Character of a Man yet in the State of ſo great Imperfection, and in a World of ſo much Temptation, as this in which we at preſent live. We have, doubtleſs, often thought, when we have beheld for a Time, ſhining Appearances, and hopeful reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Virtues, at length overcaſt with the diſmal Gloom of Error in Doctrine, or Scandal in Practice; that 'tis enough to ſay of the beſt Man upon Earth, by Way of Encomium, "All Things as yet appear well and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and we have ſufficient Reaſon to hope they will do ſo:" And thus much I may truly ſay, with Reſpect to our dear Brother Mr <hi>Occum.</hi> Amidſt all that Reſpect and Honour he receives from many, I am well aſſured, that he has ſome particular Friends, who obſerve to him the Danger he is in of receiving Injury by that buſy Sin Pride; not becauſe they ſee the Appearance of it in him, but as ſuppoſing <hi>Satan</hi> very active in his Temptations, and that he would exert himſelf more to effect his falling into Sin, preventive of his Uſefulneſs, than he would to procure the Fall of twenty other Chriſtians, not Half ſo likely to act a Part deſtructive to his Kingdom. Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> is not unapprehenſive of Danger from this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he receives with becoming Reſpect, and retains with a watchful Eye, that needful Exhortation to all
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:008808_0009_102FEFA718508490"/>
Chriſtians, "Let him that ſtands take Heed leaſt he fall." His Heart ſays <hi>Amen,</hi> to that divine Sentence, ſummarily expreſſive of the whole Deſign of the Goſpel, "Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord." With Pleaſure he adapts that Declaration of the Apoſtle, ſo deſcriptive of Self-emptineſs,—"I am, what I am, by the Grace of GOD:" May ſuch Grace-exalting Language ever have a genuine Flow, from his and our Hearts!</p>
            <p>IT yet remains that I obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Occum</hi> has a Family, conſiſting of a Wife and ſix Children; he has one Son at School, under the Care and Inſtruction of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Wheelock:</hi> (who has a conſiderable Number of <hi>Indian</hi> Lads under his Tuition, that promiſe well for eminent Uſefulneſs in their Day, by the Bleſſing of GOD.) From the firſt of Mr <hi>Occum'</hi>s coming to <hi>Montauk,</hi> he has been ſo faithfully engaged in keeping School, that he has been able to do but little for the Support of his Family: He has indeed received about Twenty Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> from the Gentlemen Commiſſioners in <hi>Boſton;</hi>—and a few private Donations, from particular Friends, all which, hath in no due Meaſure been equal to the neceſſary Expences of his Family; ſo that in order to it's Support, he is become much involv'd in Debt; and therefore he ſtands in Need of conſiderable charitable and liberal Donations, in order to the Diſcharge of Debts already neceſſarily contracted, as well as for the preſent Support of his Family, and for his own Expences, while engaged in his Miſſion.—It verily ſeems a Thouſand Pities, that Mr. <hi>Occum'</hi>s Uſefulneſs ſhould be flung away, for the Want of his due Support; eſpecially in this Day, in which a very glorious Proſpect opens to View, for evangelizing Multitudes of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and thereby, for his doing much for GOD's Honour, and Men's Salvation. While there are ſo many Chriſtians, who daily ply the Throne of Grace, and pray for the magnificent Enlargement of the divine REDEEMER's Kingdom among Men; we hope, we muſt in Charity hope, that their liberal Donations, to promote the Propagation of the joyful Tidings of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation among the Heathen, will agree and correſpond with
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:008808_0010_102FEFA9964AD538"/>
their ſolemn Prayers: Surely we need not heſitate a Moment, whether 'tis poſſible to honour GOD, in a more excellent Way, with our worldly Subſtance.—</p>
            <p>AND now, my dear Sir, I can ſcarce lay my Pen aſide, 'til I have taken the Liberty, and received the Pleaſure, of expreſſing ſome of our joyous Proſpects, our harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Hopes, and our hearty Wiſhes. We receive the Information as well authenticated, that the <hi>Oneida Indians</hi> (to whom Mr. <hi>Occum</hi> is going) make the firſt Motion themſelves, and earneſtly requeſt that a Goſpel Miniſter may be ſent among them; they promiſe to receive him with Joy, to treat him with Reſpect, and to hear him with Candour. They have already collected two or three Hundred <hi>Dollars,</hi> which they Deſign, (with others to be collected) to improve for erecting a Meeting-Houſe, that therein they may unite in the Worſhip of the true and only GOD. They hope their Couſins the <hi>Tuſcaroras</hi> will join with them in receiving the Goſpel: So that the Proſpect is hopeful, that GOD has a Deſign of ſpecial Mercy towards them. And upon the agreeable Suppoſition, that the Goſpel ſhould become the Power of GOD to their Salvation, 'tis quite hopeful the bleſſed Leaven will ſpread, and be diffuſed far and wide among the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations: And how "this Grain of Muſtard-Seed may grow, and increaſe and ſpread," GOD only knows. When we take a View of the ſignal Succeſſes the LORD OF HOSTS, hath given to <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Forces, eſpecially when we call to Mind the moral Impediments that were in the Way thereof, and the Manner in which GOD hath wrought, the Wonder and the Proſpect grows upon us; that he hath a Deſign at this Time, to ſpread the the Name and Fame of the glorious and dear IMMANUEL among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> in theſe Ends of the Earth.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice in Hope, that all thoſe who are repleniſh'd with generous and active Zeal for the Glory of GOD, the Honour of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men, will ſoon ſhare in the ſublime Joy and Satisfaction of hearing, that they "who dwell in the Wilderneſs," hear of, truſt in,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:008808_0011_102FEFAC35352F70"/>
bow before, and yield unfeigned Subjection to the exalted King of <hi>Zion.</hi> And as conducive thereto, may we not hope, that a generous Scheme will ſoon be ſet on Foot, for forming a <hi>Society</hi> in theſe Parts, to receive Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Contributions, with Deſign to promote the Education of <hi>Indian</hi> Youth, the Support of School-Maſters among the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Diſtribution of uſeful Books, and in due Time Bibles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially, with a Deſign to promote the Propagation of the Goſpel among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> by the due Support of well qualified <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> for that beneficent and glorious Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>WHEN we recollect the tragic Scenes of Years paſt, our Forts demoliſhed or burnt to Aſhes, our Armies cut to Pieces, our Countrymen, in Numbers, butchered and mangled;—and call to Mind, how the Voice of Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Woe was heard in our Streets! How the Hearts of Multitudes were failing them for Fear, while they heard the confuſed Noiſe of War, ſaw Garments rolled in Blood, and the inſulting Foe, ſpreading Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Ruin all around! And when we remember, what a diſmal Storm ſeem'd gathering faſt upon us, big with awful Fates, threatening of us with Privation of our wordly Subſtance, our ineſtimable Privileges, civil and ſacred, and all in this World, that ought to be the moſt dear to us! Ill-boding, as if Ignorance and Superſtition, Slavery and Perſecution, would ſoon overſpread theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Light and Liberty; and when at the ſame Time, we recognize, that notwithſtanding the Demerit of our Crimes, juſt at this momentous <hi>Criſis,</hi> the GOD of Armies, the GOD of Salvations, by Miracles of Providence, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered mighty Forces, diverted the Storm, and wrought an admirable Train of glorious Deliverances, and poſitive Salvations for us; I obſerve, when we view and review theſe Things, we can but hope, that furniſhed with an irreſiſtable Train of Motives and Obligations, Praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Charity will be reflected from Breaſt to Breaſt: And that we ſhall ſee Chriſtians, though in ſome leſſer Matters of differing Opinions, agreeing harmoniouſly in this truly generous, intereſting and important Work, <abbr>

            <p>WE wiſh, that in Anſwer to a Spirit of Prayer pour'd out in a Kind of caeleſtial Torrent upon Believers, the Kingdom of our Lord CHRIST among Men, may be enlarged intenſively and extenſively; that the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations, who have been for Length of Time, overcaſt with rayleſs Gloom, and benighted with Shadows of Death, may be enlighten'd and enliven'd, by that glorious Goſpel, which hath brought Life and Immortality to Light: That they, who have long been reſident "in the Pit in which there is no living Water," may ſee Rivers open'd in high Places, and Fountains in the Deſart, that they may taſte the Sweetneſs, and feel the ſalutary Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fountain of Life, that they may drink copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Draughts of thoſe heavenly Streams, the living Waters of the Sanctuary; and by them be quickened, purified, comforted, and live for ever.

            <p>ALTHO' ſoon after the Delivery of the enſuing Sermon, undeniable Importunity prevailed upon me to conſent to its Publication by the <hi>Preſs,</hi> yet I deferr'd for a Time, as hoping divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence would open a Door for Mr. <hi>Occum,</hi> to enter upon a Miſſion among the ſavage Nations in the Wilderneſs: And that Hope not being in vain, the Sermon under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as now more fitly timed, comes to Hand from the <hi>Preſs.</hi> Having aſſerted therein ſome Things diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to that Scheme of Principles which ſome Men embrace, I ſhall meet with no Diſappointment, if I come under their Cenſure. All Men don't ſee Things in the ſame Point of View; yet 'tis a common Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we muſt think for ourſelves.

            <p>IN the following Sermon I have freely declared it as my Opinion, that Men who enter upon the holy Miniſtry, ought to know the LORD JESUS CHRIST ſavingly. If any ſhould cenſure me, as chargeable with Arrogancy, think that I aſſert Points too boldly, and that I affect Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: I have this to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>I freely acknowledge, that many who agree with me in point of Principle, would doubtleſs have done far greater Juſtice to the Subject, and have handled it to vaſtly better Advantage, I ſaid that Days ſhould ſpeak, and multitude of Years ſhould teach Knowledge. I found

            </p>
            <p>When I preach'd the Sermon, I had juſt Reaſon to fear, that a Decay of the Life and Power of Godlineſs among us, and the Prevalency of <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles in ſome Places, would unhappily prepare the Way for ſome Men to grow more bold than ever, in oppoſing divine Truth, and experimental Religion; and as a native Conſequence, the next Thing would be their open and warm Oppoſition to the Examination of Candidates for the Goſpel Miniſtry, as to their experimental Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Religion. For if Men can once imagine, that the Goſpel does not require ſaving Grace, or which is the ſame Thing, the ſaving Knowledge of the LORD, as a neceſſary Qualification in Candidates,—what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that, as <hi>Arminians,</hi> they drop all Pretence to the Examination of Candidates, upon the Point of their experimental Acquaintance with divine Truth, by effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious and ſovereign Grace. In the View of theſe, and ſuch like Things (ſadly ominious to the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) I was, and am willing, according to my ſmall Ability, and Sphere of Influence to give a Caveat againſt threatening Errors, to declare Truth for the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome, and to offer Matter of Conviction to others: And whether it be judged too aſſuming, or not, I am as yet apprehenſive, that I did not fear where there is no Danger.</p>
            <p>IF cenſured as aſſerting this, and other Points too boldly, ſmall Apology muſt ſuffice. I own real Modeſty in aſſerting Points properly dubious, to be graceful; but falſe Modeſty, concealing or betraying the Truths of the Goſpel, is abominable. "I have believed," and aſſign'd the Reaſons why I thus believe, and have ſpoken plainly, and whoſoever will, may call this ſpeaking boldly. As a Chriſtian Miniſter, I think myſelf under the ſtrongeſt Obligations to ſpeak our my Principles openly, and ſo honeſtly: And as a Believer to dec<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:008808_0016_102FEFBAC1E8EFF8"/>
Truths of the Goſpel of my LORD and SAVIOUR, boldly. Let him that heſitates, and cannot anſwer this Queſtion, "What is Truth?" Speak doubtfully. Let <hi>Arminians</hi> ſculk and peep in the Dark, and as well as they can by unſanctified Reaſon, defend their unhallowed Principles, which cannot bear the glorious Light of Divine revealed Truth. Let Trimmers with the Times, obſerve their needful Decorum, and be ſure to ſpeak modeſtly, and with a bright Eye watch narrowly, or they may loſe their beloved Popularity. But let the Miniſters of the enthron'd SAVIOUR CHRIST JESUS the LORD, who know Goſpel Truths in their Life-giving and transforming Power, as illuminated by the HOLY GHOST, "Preach the Kingdom of GOD, and teach thoſe Things which concern the LORD JESUS CHRIST with all Confidence." When pernicious Errors are advanced and diſputed for, and important Truths rejected and diſputed againſt; with Zeal awaken'd to Flame we will to ſpeak our Opinions, with the Reaſons of them, with an undaunted Parrheſia, with a noble Boldneſs, whilſt we plead the precious Cauſe of GOD, and dear <hi>Zion.</hi> When Truths that greatly concern the Honour of GOD, the Glory of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men, are concealed or betrayed, given up or oppoſe; can the Miniſters of the living Word, appear as void of ſacred Fervor, as lifeleſs Statutes? Can they imagine that GOD or his Prophets, that CHRIST or his Apoſtles, inſtructed Men in the modiſh Art of keeping Silence? Or can they dream, that Love Divine ſent Preachers among Men to palliate Goſpel Truths? No; ſurely. We have renounced the hidden Things of Diſhoneſty:—We ſpeak as in the Sight of GOD:—We have the Teſtimony of JESUS to keep us in Countenance, and are not aſhamed of his Goſpel,—which giveth Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt that univerſal Fire, which ſhall melt the Elements, and ſhrivel up the Heavens like a Roll of Parchment.</p>
            <p>IF cenſured, as holding an Opinion for the ſake of Singularity, I diſcard the Thought, as I do being a <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian,</hi> for the gain of Popularity. I am quite ſure,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:008808_0017_102FEFBC4722F338"/>
that in the preſent Caſe, I am far from being ſingular in my Opinion: Many of my Fathers and Brethren, I well know, hold the ſame Principle. And all Men of any tolerable Reading in Divinity, know that numerous Divines, in various Ages, moſt renowned for Wiſdom and Piety in the Church of GOD, have been of the ſame Opinion, I own indeed, that in the Compaſs of my ſmall Reading, I have not, that I remember, ſeen the Point handled by way of methodical Argument, yet caſual Hints, and plain Declarations, in Authors, give us their Opinions: To quote, would be endleſs. If numerous Authorities may add Force, and ſerve to confront Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, the Balance is in my Favour.

            </p>
            <p>IN Conſequence of the foregoing Principle; in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I have inſiſted upon the ſtrict Examination of Candidates,—as to their Acquaintance with experimental Religion: For 'tis quite beyond me to comprehend, how to ſeperate here, with Conſiſtency. Nevertheleſs, we find that Men will ſometimes make the Conceſſion, that Candidates for the Goſpel Miniſtry ought ſavingly to know the LORD, and yet don't care to admit that they ſhould paſs an Examination, as to their experimental Religion. Here I would take the Liberty to obſerve: That upon this Conceſſion, that the Goſpel does require ſaving Grace, as a neceſſary Qualification in a Candidate for the Holy Miniſtry, then he has not a ſolid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Right to engage therein, unleſs he is poſſeſt thereof. And of Conſequence, Miniſters ought not to ſeperate him to the Work of the Miniſtry, without Evidence ſufficient to found a Judgment of Chriſtian Charity upon, that he is truly gracious: For Faithfulneſs to our LORD, does neceſſarily require, that we have all Reaſon to believe that the Candidate to whom we commit the Miniſtry, is qualified as the Goſpel does injoin: And therefore we muſt have all the moral Evidence, and Satisfaction, the Nature of the Caſe will admit, that the Candidate is truly gracious. The Point then ſeems to turn upon this
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:008808_0018_102FEFBDCE4DFCC0"/>
Hinge, or upon the Solution of this Queſtion, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> "How ſhall we have all the Evidence the Nature of the Caſe will admit, in order to exerciſe a Chriſtian Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, that the Candidate is truly gracious?" Now, for a Perſon to appear blameleſs, as touching the Law, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he did before Converſion, or as ſtrict a Legaliſt as the the young Man in the Goſpel, who yet lacked the main Thing; will this, or in other Words, will an Appearance of outward Holineſs of Life, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a King of mere negative Charity, afford all the Evidence for the Exerciſe of a Chriſtian Judgment of Charity, that a Perſon ſavingly knows the LORD, that the Nature of the Caſe will admit? If it will, nothing farther muſt be ſought. But if the Nature of the Caſe will admit, that a Profeſſion of the Eſſentials of Chriſtian Piety, or an honeſt Declaration of experimental Religion, as affording ſome Degree of Evidence, for the Exerciſe of a Chriſtian Judgment of Charity, that a Perſon ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows the LORD; then, in the preſent Caſe, ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or experimental Religion, muſt be ſought. Now whether experimental Religion has in it, ordinarily, any Thing of the Nature of Evidence; and is of Uſe, or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as to a Judgment of Chriſtian Charity towards a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let all judge who profeſs to believe there is ſuch a Thing as experimental Religion, and that the Bible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us what it is.</p>
            <p>THAT I may be the better underſtood by my common Reader, I will ſuppoſe, that he and I were Preſent the other Day, at a Seſſion of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> when the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Popularus</hi> were examined: We had ſome previous Knowledge of them both, ſo as to have an equal negative Charity.—They were aſked as to their Aims and Views;—As to what they had experienced of the Power of Divine Truth, convincing, ſanctifing and comforting.—As to a Life of Faith, and Devotedneſs to GOD.—And, 'tis needleſs to repeat,—we remember Queſtions and Anſwers.—To be ſhort, ſo far as we could judge, (and we could not help forming ſome Judgment) <hi>Theodorus</hi> gave an Account of his experimental Religion,

and a Life of Holineſs, as a Fruit of Faith in CHRIST, well agreeing with the Word of GOD: But <hi>Popularus</hi> could give no ſuch Scriptural Account of experimental Religion and Holineſs, for he had none to give. Now if my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will acknowledge, that he has more Evidence for a Judgment of Charity, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> is truly gracious, than he has that <hi>Popularus</hi> is ſo, I have gained the Point I have purſued.—'Tis not my Deſign at preſent to anſwer Objections; "What ſaith the Law and the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies?—However, as there is one that is Chief, and is thought by ſome unanſwerable, and as bearing all, that can be ſaid, down before it, it may not be improper here to give it a brief Conſideration, The Objection is this, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> If ſaving Grace is required in the Goſpel, as a neceſſary Qualification in a Candidate for the Miniſtry, the LORD CHRIST would have given ſome certain Rule, whereby Miniſters might aſſuredly know whether they have ſuch Grace, or not; but no ſuch Rule is given, therefore the Goſpel does not require ſuch Grace in the Candidate. Now, if there is any Strength in the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it lies in the Truth of his Propoſition, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That whatever Qualification the Goſpel requires in a Candidate, the LORD CHRIST has given ſome certain Rule, whereby Miniſters may know whether he has ſuch a Qualification, or not. If this Propoſition is not true, than there is no Force at all in the Argument. But is there a Divine upon the Face of the Earth, that will aſſert and ſtand to it, that this Propoſition is true? No; not one: For all will own that ſome internal Qualifications are required, ſome King of Faith and Sincerity, and all muſt own they have no certain Rule whereby they can aſſuredly know the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Things of the Heart: And this is to diſown the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as to its Truth, and conſequently to give up the Objection, or Argument. I ſuppoſe all who make the above-mentioned Objection, againſt what I have aſſerted, are agreed, to a Man, that the Goſpel does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in Candidates for the Miniſtry, what they call moral Sincerity, moral Seriouſneſs of Spirit, and ſoundneſs in the Faith, as neceſſary Qualifications. I will now ſuppoſe,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:008808_0020_102FEFC539D50208"/>
that ſome one, lax in Principle, and rude in Speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and Objector againſt my Objectors, ſaying, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you hold a Set of rigid Principles indeed: You aſſert that the Goſpel requires that Candidates for the Holy Miniſtry, muſt have theſe Qualifications, moral Seriouſneſs of Spirit, and Soundneſs in the Faith: But the LORD CHRIST has given you no certain Rule, by which you can aſſuredly know that a Candidate has ſuch Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; therefore the Goſpel does not require them. Now, what will my Objectors do? To profeſs they have ſuch a Rule, they know they cannot; to ſay that CHRIST has been unfaithful to his Church they dare not; infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they have not; to give up their Principle they muſt not, for the Goſpel expreſly requires theſe Qualifications: What can they, what muſt they do! There is but one Thing that can be done conſiſtent with common Senſe, and that is to acknowledge, that their grand and beloved Objection, brought againſt the Truths I aſſert, has no Force at all in it. Should they imagine any, it lies as much againſt them, as others: In ſhort the Argument proves too much, if any Thing, and therefore nothing at all. I am quite ſenſible that the Things I aſſert fall heavy upon thoſe Candidates, who are not what they ought to be, and diſlike to be told what they ſhould be:—I expect their Diſpleaſure, however, they have my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and my Prayers. They no doubt greatly applaud the Conduct of thoſe Miniſters who look upon it needleſs to examine Candidates for the Goſpel Miniſtry, as to their experimental Acquaintance with Religion: Yet I take the Liberty to tell ſuch Candidates, that if ever a Sovereign GOD is pleaſed to give them ſanctifying Grace, and impreſſes their Hearts with a due Senſe of his glorious Attributes, the Holineſs of his Law, the Purity of the Goſpel, the Weight of Things Eternal, and the immenſe Worth of Souls, they will then be very far from an Approbation of the Practice of ſuch Miniſters, upon the Point of which I ſpeak; (not to ſay of their experimental Religion alſo) or I am greatly miſtaken.</p>

            <p>THE Glorious <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the Meſſenger of the Covenant, the everlaſting Covenant between the Perſons of the holy Trinity, firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the eternal <hi>Secret</hi> of redeeming Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Love, unto trembling Man in the Garden: This Revelation the Apoſtle remarkably termeth the glorious Goſpel. Thus it will appear, if conſider'd as the unalterable Diſpenſation of GOD, toward a complete Diſplay of the Perfections of his Nature and Will; and as the grand Mean for bringing about the Glory of the adorable Trinity, and as the only Contrivance for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the Salvation of loſt Man; and alſo, that its infinitely important and amiable Truths, will furniſh the redeemed, and even all the bright Intelligences above, with ſublime Praiſe and Admiration to all Eternity. If we ſeriouſly conſider Things in this Point of View, we ſhall be apt to conclude, that the Goſpel muſt ſurely be a "scheme of Doctrines" worthy of devout Meditation,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008808_0023_102FEFC9D04085C0"/>
deſerving the moſt cordial Reception; and alſo, calling for the moſt ſolemn Manner of Diſpenſation; as by Men enrich'd not only with doctrinal and ſpeculative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning our Lord Chriſt, and the important Truths of his glorious Goſpel, but alſo truly adorn'd and embelliſh'd with that Knowledge, which is experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and practical; or in other Words, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be revealed in, and ſavingly manifeſted to them, by the Illumination and Operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>THE great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, that excellent and noble Pattern of Miniſterial Qualifications and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, was brought up at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> and not only ſo, God from Above revealed his Son in him; thereby making up a moſt accompliſhing Mixture of ſaving divine Knowledge, and ſolid human <hi>Literature.</hi> He had an extraordinary Call to preach the Goſpel, and was furniſhed with extraordinary Gifts and miraculous Powers, the proper Credentials of ſuch a Call. Having preach'd the Goſpel for a Time to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Proſelytes, without receiving Miniſterial Ordination; when the appointed Time came, for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come "Fellow Heirs with the believing <hi>Jews," St. Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Colleague, were made Miniſters by Divine Deſignation, ſubmitting to Goſpel Ordination, according to the Direction of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THEN, I am to ſhow what Revelation and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of our Lord CHRIST that is, which thoſe ought to be the Subjects of, who preach Him to others.</p>
            <p>PREACHERS of the Goſpel, entruſted with the Holy Miniſtry, as a neceſſary Qualification, ought to know the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not only by objective Light, or the external directive Light of Divine Revelation; but alſo by an internal, powerful and ſaving Illumination of the Mind, by the Irradiation and Operation of the Holy Spirit. And ſo to become poſſeſs'd of a Knowledge, that is not produced by the Power of human Reaſon, or the common Methods of Education or Inſtruction; and therefore a Knowledge not confin'd to the Head, but ſeated in the Heart. An affectionate and fiducial Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; diſpoſing the happy Subject of it to an intire Reliance upon the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for Righteouſneſs, Grace, and eternal Life; and to love Him ſuperlatively, as diſcerning his incomparable Beauty, Glory, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. A Knowledge that is Soul-humbling, Self-emptying, Soul-transforming, Chriſt-exalting; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Hatred to all Sin, and of a ſincere, cheerful, ſolemn Conſecration of the whole Man to the Service, Honour, and Glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is that Knowledge, which diſpoſed <hi>St. Paul</hi> to improve all his Abilities to holy Ends and Purpoſes; which put him upon ſubordinating all his natural and acquired, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and moral Accompliſhments, unto the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Good of his Church: And according to the Meaſure of it received, will always have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Effect upon Miniſters of the Goſpel. This is that Knowledge, which the Apoſtle in Diſtinction from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008808_0025_102FEFD230C8F7C8"/>
the Form of Knowledge, calls the Savour of Knowledge;<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</note> and with Reſpect to which, he accounted all Things but Loſs and Damage, as in the View of it's vaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and tranſcendent Excellence;<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</note> and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with which, he determined to know nothing, even in <hi>Corinth</hi> itſelf, the Seat of Learning and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="§" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2.</note>. This is that Knowledge by which all the Divine Perfections are beheld, as they ſhine forth in their united Glories, with a bright and charming Luſtre, in the Perſon, and Mediation of our Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and transform the Spectator, in Heart and Life, into his Holy Image.</p>
            <p>THUS the Apoſtle had <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> revealed in him, and ſavingly manifeſted to him, before he preach'd Him to others: And this ſupernatural, experimental, and practical Knowledge of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> every Man ought to be poſſeſt of, that enters upon the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>FOR, unleſs the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt </hi> is thus revealed in, and ſavingly manifeſted unto a Man, he cannot be qualified for the Goſpel Miniſtry, as the Word of GOD does require; nor in any due Meaſure anſwer the Characters and Epithets given to Goſpel Miniſters, in the ſacred Pages. The Word of GOD requires, that Men be Holy who are put into the Holy Miniſtry;<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7.</note> and the Holineſs required is not meerly relative, but real, and injoined as a neceſſary Qualification for a Goſpel Miniſter. The Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Church, have a ſacred Rule of Direction given them, that will abide tho' Heaven and Earth paſs away; that they put <hi>faithful Men</hi> into the Miniſtry:<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</note> And 'tis required of Men in the Goſpel Miniſtry, that they be <hi>faithful;</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2.</note> and Faithfulneſs in this Caſe, includes pure and ſpiritual Aims and Intentions for GOD; and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implies the ſaving Knowledge of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Derivation of Divine Grace from him. Amongſt the many Characters of the Miniſters of the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture, we repeatedly find this given them, <abbr>viz,</abbr> 
               <hi>the Man of</hi> GOD:<note n="§" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.</note> This honourable Compellation or Title imports, that a Goſpel Miniſter ought to be a Man
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008808_0026_102FEFD4E0C5DCB0"/>
greatly conformed in his Nature to the moral Excellencies of GOD, and in a ſincere Manner devoted to his Service and Glory: And therefore implies ſaving Illumination in the Knowledge of our Lord <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Holy Spirit gives the Character of Goſpel Miniſters, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Men in a State of unrenewed Nature, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diverſe and exceeding oppoſite, the one to the other. Men in a State of unrenewed Nature, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſaving Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He calls blind, dark, ignorant, ungodly, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> But aſcribes to Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Titles and Epithets of Watchmen, Stars, Angels, Men of GOD, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Now can there poſſibly be a greater Soleciſm in Nature, a more abſolute Inconſiſtency in Terms; than to ſay, a blind Watchman, a Star of Darkneſs, an ignorant Angel, an ungodly Man of GOD? Men, nor Angels, can't render theſe diſcordant, jarring Terms and Characters correſpondent and harmonious. If without the ſaving Knowledge of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Men can't be qualified for the Goſpel Miniſtry, as the Word of GOD does expreſsly require; nor anſwer the Characters the Holy Ghoſt gives to Goſpel Miniſters.—The Conſequence is plain.—</p>
            <p>I proceed, unleſs Men ſavingly know the Lord, they can't covenant with Him, after the Manner He requires, at the Time of ſolemn Separation to the Work of the Holy Miniſtry, by Prayer, and the Impoſition of the Hands of the Preſbytery. At this Time, there is a Covenant enter'd into the GOD, call'd the Covenant of <hi>Levi;</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note> the Perſon ordained vows and ſwears Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Lord, that he will be faithful in the Work now devolved upon him, as ſincerely conſecrated to the Service of GOD. Now, how can a Perſon thus declare before GOD, Angels, and Men, that he ſincerely gives up himſelf to GOD, and promiſe all good Fidelity; when at the ſame Time he keeps back his Heart, and has not the leaſt Spark of Grace to enable him to be ſincere and faithful? Nor does it avail here to ſuggeſt, that altho' he has not gracious, yet he has moral Sincerity; for in this Covenant, GOD calls for the Heart, for Uprightneſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008808_0027_102FEFD979CD60E8"/>
of Heart; and will accept of nothing ſhort thereof. There is not one Word in all the <hi>Bible</hi> that tolerates us, in ſubſtituting moral Sincerity in the Place of gracious; nor that permits us to play the Hypocrite or Paraſite with GOD: The Conſequence again is plain.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, if Men who know not the Lord ſavingly, enter upon the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform the Duties of the ſacred Function after the Manner he requires, nor meet with his Approbation or Acceptance therein. 'Tis often, and truly ſaid, that not <hi>Nouns;</hi> but <hi>Adverbs</hi> make good Works; that 'tis not meerly doing <hi>Bonum</hi> a good Thing, but doing that good Thing <hi>Bene</hi> well, which is what the Apoſtle calls Well-doing. For a Work to be good, as to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Performance, and circumſtantially conſider'd; it muſt be done, not only according to the declared Will of GOD; but alſo muſt proceed from the noble Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Principles of Faith and Love, and be perform'd with an ultimate View to the Glory of GOD: But this never can be, 'till a Perſon ſavingly knows the Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> conſequently the Perſon deſtitute of Evangelical Obedience, cannot meet with the Acceptance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the infinite Majeſty of all Worlds; and if not his Approbation, then of Conſequence diſapproved by Him: A Thought infinitely ſhocking! The Miniſter who knows not the Lord ſavingly, will neceſſarily and unavoidably ſeek himſelf, ſupremely and ultimately. He ſets up himſelf in the Room and Place of GOD; and the grand <hi>Idol Self,</hi> is prefered to the GOD of Heaven and Earth, and his Glory. He undertook the Miniſtry under the Power of ſelfiſh Views; and let him ſtudy, try to pray, and preach; in all he does, the grand Object <hi>Self</hi> ſtill terminates his Views. He acts the Part of down right Rebellion, againſt his infinite SOVEREIGN; and, as it were, diſputes the Rights of God-Head with Him. Becomes guilty of a ſacrilegious Robbing of GOD, and the vileſt Idolatry under the Sun; and the Violation of infinite Obligation to his glorious and dread Sovereign. Now, let thoſe who impartially read the <hi>ancient Goſpel,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008808_0028_102FEFDB3938E148"/>
judge, whether Men thus diſapproved of GOD, and ſuch Self-ſeekers; can be Chriſt's duly qualified Miniſters.</p>
            <p>I go on to obſerve, That the Nature and Reaſon of the Miniſterial Office, and Service, requires that Men engaged therein, ſhould ſavingly know the Lord. The Laws of God required the Prieſts under the Law to be holy Perſons, in the moſt ſtrong and vehement Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, founded on the ſpecial Relation they ſtood in, to God; and the Nature and Reaſon of their Office, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and repeatedly enjoining Holineſs upon them.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 21, 6, 7, 8,</note> The Obligation is as expreſs and ſtrong under the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Diſpenſation. Does it not appear reaſonable and fit in the Nature of Things, that they who are call'd to ſerve the holy GOD, in a high and holy Station; to ſtand before Him, to miniſter in holy Things, for high and holy Purpoſes; ſhould be truly Holy, his hearty Friends and Servants, wiſhing well to his Cauſe and Intereſt in the World? Are not known Enemies in Heart, to the Perſon and Intereſt of the Prince, unfit Perſons to be entruſted with negotiating the important Affairs of his Kingdom? There is no Man who is not either a true Subject to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Enemy. That Man who don't truly know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſubmit to him as his King and Lord, by bearing true Faith and Allegiance to him; is the Enemy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>DOES it not appear inconſiſtent in its own Nature, to beſeech others to become reconciled to God; and at the ſame Time to be irreconciled to God, and an Enemy to the exalted King of <hi>Zion?</hi> A Preacher going forth to evangelize others; and yet a Stranger to real Goſpel Holineſs, and incapable of performing any one Act of Duty evangelically? A Preacher of that Word which is pure and holy, of that Goſpel which is glorious in its Light, Life, and Power; himſelf unholy and impure, in Darkneſs, legally and ſpiritually dead? As a Miniſter, the Servant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by Legation; and yet ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with a ſupreme Affection? The <hi>Chariot</hi> and Horſeman of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet unable to promote the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God's People, by Zeal and fervent Prayer,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008808_0029_102FEFDCC5BAD3D0"/>
unſkilful in wielding the Sword of the Spirit, by which the <hi>Devil</hi> is not invulnerable? The Glory of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet himſelf in Darkneſs, and under the black Banner of Wrath Divine? The Salt of the Earth; yet unſavoury? The Light of the World inſtrumentally; yet never truly illuminated by transforming Beams of Light from the Sun of Righteouſneſs? I ſay, is there not an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, and an unfitneſs in theſe Things, in their own Nature and Relation conſidered.</p>
            <p>AND does it not appear as having a Sort of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in it, that the Miniſter who is the Mouth of the People to GOD in Prayer, leading the Devotion of the Aſſembly, in which, we would charitably hope, there is ordinarily a Number of gracious Souls in a ſpiritual Frame, breathing forth a Spirit of Adoption; and the whole Aſſembly greatly needing Bleſſings for both Worlds, Bleſſings to be given in Anſwer to Prayer, "the inwrought Prayer of the righteous Man;" but the Miniſter himſelf deſtitute of a Spirit of true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſiſting Grace, and real Adoption?</p>
            <p>HOW many, and how various, are the Temptations, Deſertions, Trials, ſpiritual Conflicts, and Exerciſes of the People of GOD, in this twilight-State of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Grace, and probation-Seaſon for Eternity? And how much in ſuch Caſes they need a ſpiritual ſkilful Guide? Unexperienced Miniſters will be miſerable poor <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> in ſuch Caſes. And alſo with Reſpect to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; if by ſome Means, any are awaken'd, and ſolicitous to know how they muſt be ſaved; now, now, for a Meſſenger of the Lord, one of a Thouſand, to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon. But the Miniſter that knows not the Lord ſavingly; in preaching, and in converſe with ſuch poor diſtreſſed Souls; will moſt likely place Duties, in the Room of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and after all the Help he can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Books and Reading, he will be a blind Leader of the Blind; and the Conſequence of ſuch Conduct, our Lord has told us.</p>

the Chriſtian Religion; we ſhall ſee them, ordinarily now, very deſirous of the Preſence and Prayers of a Miniſter: (peradventure in ſome Inſtances before ſlighted) The very Verge of Time is now come, the eternal Judgment is at the Door, unmeaſurable Eternity opens with a growing View; the Exchange of Worlds appears an Affair of great, of ſolemn, of infinite Weight; the Angel's dread Trumpet ſounds, "Time ſhall be no more;" the immortal Spirit muſt enter upon the unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable interminable Joys of Heaven, or be plunged into the intolerable eternal Torments of Hell In this final Hour, ſome few, a ſpecial, little, happy Number; are highly favour'd of the Lord, with copious Meaſures of divine Light; with the Triumphs of Faith, with the joyous proſpect of the ſubſtantial, untarniſh'd Glories of the Sanctuary of Immortality: Altho' theſe do not ſtand in ſo much Need, yet they rejoice, greatly rejoice, in the Preſence, Converſe, Prayers, and Praiſes "of the Man of GOD." Others who hopefully "have the Root of the Matter in them," have the Evidences of their gracious Sincerity much clouded over.—Some are terribly harraſſed with Templations—Others are under the Power of Self-Flattery, and a vain Confidence; and need to have their Foundations ſhaken.—Some are awfully ſecure, and need an alarming Word.—Others are full of Anxiety, as perceiving themſelves tottering, not only upon the Verge of Life, but on the very Brink of Hell: Alas for them! What a dying Paleneſs invades their Cheeks? What Agonies of Fear rend the Heart? What tumultuous Throbbings ſeize the Breaſt? Millions, Millions of Gold, were too cheap a Purchaſe for Health to be reſtored, for the Day of Grace to be prolong'd: The Voice of pardoning Mercy, would now ſound in ſweeter Accents than the Muſick of the Seraphic Choir; the Weight of Worlds eternal, is ſuſpended upon the Event of one momentous deciſive Hour. Now, altho' all real Sanctification, and Preparation for eternal Glory, depends upon the holy Spirit's Agency; yet as Means are the Appointment of Heaven, without an undue
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008808_0031_102FEFE3DD076198"/>
Dependence upon them; the Preſence, ſpiritual Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Counſel, and Prayers of "the Man of God," at ſuch Times, and in ſuch Caſes, muſt ſurely be of no ſmall Importance, and ought to be much deſired and prized. And O! how ſad the Calamity, when the Miniſter is unfit to deal with Perſons <hi>underſtandingly</hi> in Soul-Caſes, eſpecially at ſuch a Time; as whatever Attempt he may make, is not able to offer up one Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to GOD, in a right Manner for them; having no ſpecial Intereſt in the Redeemer, nor Acceſs to the Throne of Grace. In ſhort, the more cloſely we view the Nature and Reaſon of Miniſterial Office and Service, and the various Duties of the ſacred Function; the more evident it will appear, that Men who enter upon the holy Miniſtry, ought to be Men who have a ſaving Knowledge of the Lord; and an experimental Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with the Power and purifying Influence of divine Truth upon their Hearts.</p>
            <p>LASTLY <hi>here,</hi> thoſe, and only thoſe, who ſavingly know the Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> have Warrant to expect his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpiritual Preſence with them in their Work. As Miniſters of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we can neither look for Aſſiſtance in our Work, nor Succeſs unto it; but from the promiſed Preſence, and ſpecial Influence of the holy Spirit alone. The Goſpel is call'd "the Miniſtry of the Spirit,"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 8.</note> as it is that Miniſtry which the Spirit makes effectual unto all the Ends of it; or becauſe 'tis that <hi>Miniſtry</hi> whereby the Spirit, in his Gifts and Graces is communicated unto Men. The Kingdom of our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſpiritual, and the animating Principles of it inviſible. If we fix our Minds only on outward Order, we loſe the Riſe and Power of the whole; 'tis not an outward "viſible Ordination by Men," tho' that is neceſſary by Rule and Precept, but <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit according to Promiſe; that gives Being, Life, Uſefulneſs, and Succeſs to the Goſpel Miniſtry. 'Tis only thoſe Miniſters who ſavingly know the Lord, that have any juſt Ground to hope for his

Preſence with them, and his Bleſſing upon their Labours: To them He hath ſaid,—"And lo, I am with you to the Conſummation of all Things." Lo, I am with you, to qualify, protect, aſſiſt, and ſucceed you, by the Aids and Influences of the Holy Spirit. 'Tis a Point of Truth that may be evidenc'd, as Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi> obſerves, That now under the <q>New Teſtament, there are Miniſters of the Spirit, and not of the dead Letter and empty Sound. That with the Word there goes a Miniſtration and Life. It is very diſcernable, what a great Difference, and another Appearance, there is both on Miniſters and Chriſtians at one Time, from what they are at <hi>another,</hi> in the Diſcharge of Duty, as if theſe were not the ſame Perſons; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not only in the Enlargement, and ſtraitning of their Gifts, but alſo in Power and Life. Is it not ſeen, with what Liberty theſe do ſometimes <hi>pray,</hi> and are as a Ship with a full Gale before the Wind? That 'tis then eaſy to preach.</q>—When Miniſters have the Grace of GOD in them, and the ſpecial Preſence of the Spirit of GOD with them, they are wont to preach ſo as they could not if left to themſelves, deſtitute of Divine Influence and Aſſiſtance. We pretend not thereby to immediate Revelations and Inſpirations of new Truths, no; there is an exact Agreement between the Works of the Spirit, and the Word of GOD; and therefore all Impulſes, Revelations, or pretended Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit, which are contrary to, or have no Foundation in the Scriptures; are to be rejected as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic Fancies, or ſatanical Deluſions. But we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the holy Spirit "takes of the Things of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſhews them unto us;" illuminates our Minds, and helps us to diſcern the moral Beauty and Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Things Divine; draws forth our Graces into lively Exerciſe while we are preaching; increaſes our Views of the infinite Importance, as well as ſurpaſſing Excellence of Divine Truth; and thereby enlarges our Hearts, and helps us to ſpeak with Power and Freedom, concerning the Things of GOD. And I ſee not why,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008808_0033_102FEFE6E81BF1C0"/>
we may not freely own, that the holy Spirit frequently helps us, in the Time of preaching, to ſeaſonable Thoughts, which upon a quick and due Scanning, we perceive to be important Truth, and pertinent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe; and hereby we enlarge upon ſome Branch of our Diſcourſe, and urge ſome Points home upon the Conſciences of our Hearers, beyond what we thought of in the Time of Compoſition; and ſo as to exceed what we have done at ſome other Times, when under the beſt Advantages by preparatory Thought. But this is not the Point I mean to purſue at preſent. That which we inſiſt upon to our preſent Purpoſe, is, That the aſſiſting Influence of the holy Spirit in preaching the Goſpel, is a Bleſſing of great Importance; and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the Lord works by, and improves thoſe Men, as Inſtruments for the Converſion of Sinners, and the progreſſive Sanctification and Conſolation of his People; whom He hath qualified and fitted for his Service, by confering upon them, both the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit: And thereupon granting them preſent divine Influences, and crowning their Labours with his effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bleſſing. Of this we are firmly aſſured, from the Word of GOD; and as acceſſory Evidence, from Church <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and ſome Degree of Obſervation. At the ſame Time, we do not imagine, that the Efficacy of the Word diſpenſed, depends upon the Worthineſs and Holineſs, or Good-will and Intention of him that ſpeaks, no; the Lord is an infinite Sovereign, He hath not limited himſelf, tho' He hath us: He may bleſs Truth by whomſoever ſpoken; and ſometimes diſplays his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereignty in this Reſpect. Nevertheleſs, we inſiſt upon it, as a Point never to be given up; that Miniſters eminently need the Spirit of the Lord with them, and in them; in order to preach, and to perform Miniſterial Duties, as they ought, and in a due Manner. By the Aids and Influences of the holy Spirit granted to Goſpel Miniſters, they are endued with Zeal for God's Glory, the Honour of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls; and are diſpoſed to ſtudy and preach
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008808_0034_102FEFE871679158"/>
ſuch Things as do eſpecially tend to promote thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Purpoſes; thereby they are prepared to declare the Word of GOD powerfully and faithfully; are ſaved from the enſnaring Fear of Man, and the ſuperficial downy Touch of Conſcience; now they become <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerges,</hi> proclaiming the Terrors of <hi>Horeb'</hi>s <hi>fiery Law,</hi> in the ſhocking Accents of <hi>Sina'</hi>s dreadful Thunder; they lift up the Voice like a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and will not ſpare to declare important Truth, whether People will hear or forbear; and <hi>Barnabas</hi> like, they ſound the jubilee Trumpet of the Goſpel; proclaiming Liberty to the Captives, and offering the Oil of Joy to the broken-hearted and diſconſolate Chriſtian; and hereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe to win Souls to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to conduct them on their Way to eternal Glory. Now, when the Lord is thus preſent with his Miniſters, and affords them ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Aſſiſtance; He ordinarily aſſociates the Influences of his Spirit with the Word preached, and makes it powerful to Salvation. But the Preacher that knows not the Lord ſavingly, can lay no claim to his gracious Preſence, by any Word of Promiſe; nor has he any juſt Ground to expect a Bleſſing upon his Labours. The true State of the Caſe is, the Inſtitution of the Goſpel Miniſtry is eminently the Work of the Holy Ghoſt; (I mean not excluſive of the Father and the Son, the Works of the Trinity, towards the Creatures, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided) 'tis his Work to confer on Men Gifts and Graces, as neceſſary Furniture for, and to put them into the Miniſtry,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> and to aſſiſt and ſucceed them therein; making them able Miniſters of the New-Teſtament, and thereupon crowning their Labours with glorious Succeſs. Therefore, the Man that has not an experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſanctifying Operations of the holy Spirit in and upon his Heart; cannot honeſtly, and with a well informed <hi>Conſcience,</hi> engage in the Goſpel Miniſtry: If he does, he enters upon this arduous and difficult Work alone; and alas for him, abides in it alone! As he goes on therein without a ſaving Knowledge of the Lord, he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008808_0035_102FEFEDEE9B3E70"/>
can't prove himſelf call'd of GOD to preach the Goſpel, nor can he in Faith pray for a Bleſſing upon his Labours, having no Word of Promiſe for that Purpoſe, nor any juſt Ground to expect the Lord's Bleſſing.—And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhining Appearance he may make in his own Eye, and in the Judgment of <hi>ſome;</hi> there is great Deficiency in all his Performances, a main Excellency is wanting. We muſt hence conclude, that if the gracious Preſence of GOD, the aſſiſting Influence of his Spirit, and his Bleſſing are important and excellent; that ſuch Men, and only ſuch, ought to engage in the Goſpel Miniſtry, who ſavingly know the Lord: And ſurely we muſt believe, that the Divine Influences to ſanctify, aſſiſt, and bleſs; are of the laſt Importance, and higheſt Excellence. The whole Succeſs of the Miniſtry in propagating the Goſpel in the World, and building up the Church; depends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon the Miſſion, Preſence, Aſſiſtance, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Holy Spirit. Upon the whole then, if the Preacher who knows not the Lord ſavingly, is thus left <hi>alone,</hi> without his Aſſiſtance and Bleſſing;—if the Nature and Reaſon of Miniſterial Office and Service, require that Men who enter upon the holy Miniſtry, ſhould truly know the Lord;—if they cannot ſerve GOD aright, nor meet with his Approbation in their Work, unleſs they thus know Him;—if without ſuch Knowledge of Him, they cannot tranſact a Covenant with Him, as He requires; if they cannot anſwer the Title and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a Goſpel-Miniſter, nor be qualified for the Work of the holy Miniſtry, as the Goſpel does expreſsly require;—we conclude thus, that Men who enter upon the holy Miniſtry, ought to be Men who have had the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> revealed in, and ſavingly manifeſted to them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THE great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> often ſpeaks of it as a myſterious Diſpenſation of GOD, that our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be preached to them; and he intimates
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008808_0036_102FEFEFB89BBAD0"/>
thus much in our Text. Altho' we find that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Promiſes, reſpecting this grand and marvellous Event, lie thick in the <hi>Old-Teſtament;</hi> yet in former Ages it was not ſo clearly made known to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: The Time when, the Manner how, and Means by which, were not well underſtood, 'till now revealed by the Holy Ghoſt. When GOD gave his Word to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Statutes to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> "He dealt not ſo with any other Nation;" other Nations were left to walk after their own Ways, but to them Himſelf came down, Angels attending Him, Clouds and Darkneſs covering the Place, Voices and Flames diffuſing the Law and Authority of infinite Majeſty. All along from that very Time, when GOD revealed that Promiſe, which was blooming Goſpel; that "the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's Head," 'till He came, who was the Deſire of all Nations; He was narrowing the Intereſt of Religion, by every new Diſpenſation of the Covenant, 'till the Goſpel came to be preached in the laſt and beſt Edition. Every new Diſpenſation, though it made the Covenant brighter, yet it made the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it ſtraiter. The Empire of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for many Ages, for Thouſands of Years, appear'd only in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Compaſs, as if He loved not a Diffuſion, but a Confinement of his Kingdom and Glory; 'till by his <hi>Croſs</hi> he broke down the Wall of Partition between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and broke up the Encloſures of his own making; and as Almighty Lord and Conqueror, aroſe from the State of the Dead, and thereupon gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Orders to his Diſciples, his flaming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, on this wiſe, Go, ſaith He, and diſciple all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, preach the Goſpel to every Creature. From this Period of divine Mercy and eternal Wonder, according to ancient Prophecies, BEHOLD! "The Wilderneſs and the ſolitary Place are glad, the Deſert rejoices and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms as the Roſe! The Gentiles ſee the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of the God of <hi>Iſrael!</hi>" But why was GOD ſo long ſilent to the Gentiles? And why did He ſpeak out at laſt? Whence was it, that the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008808_0037_102FEFF25040C440"/>
Love He uſed to keep within Bounds, now ſhone out at large, and became the Glory of the Univerſe? Even ſo it ſeem'd good in his Sight! The <hi>Jews</hi> train'd up for ſo many Ages, and by all Kind or Preparations for a Redeemer, reject him; and the Gentiles who were no Way prepared, receive him; He who was the Deſire of all Nations, becomes the Contempt of his own.—Without any preparatory Dawn, the Light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel is darted among the Gentiles, like a ſudden Ruſh of Light in a cloudy and dark Day. And among thoſe who have the Province of preaching <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Heathen, aſſign'd them, behold <hi>Paul!</hi> Who was <hi>Saul</hi> the Perſecutor, apprehended by Grace Divine, when on the Brink of Hell, be-miracled with ſovereign Mercy; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is revealed in him, and he commences a Preacher of him to the Gentiles! In the View of theſe, and ſuch like Things, no Marvel that <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſo often, and with ſo much ſeraphic Praiſe, ſpeaks of the Preaching of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as a myſterious Diſpenſation of GOD: For verily it expreſſes his Wiſdom, his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and univerſal Goodneſs; its full of his Glory, it bears his Image, its wondrous in our Eyes; 'tis rather to be admir'd than explain'd, we can neither leave the Subject with Indifference, nor comprehend it with Knowledge.</p>
            <p>IN Purſuance of the Method propoſed, I would briefly obſerve, that to preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the Gentiles, intends, that we make him the grand Subject of our preaching: That we declare him to be the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between GOD and Man; and as Mediator, inveſted with a prophetical, prieſtly, and kingly Office; and thoroughly furniſh'd for his Work of Mediation, as wanting nothing to render him ſucceſsful therein; that we repreſent him as ſufficient to anſwer all the Danger our Souls are in, and all the Neceſſities they labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both by Way of Atonement for them, and of Conqueſt over them; that we proclaim his infinite Willingneſs, as well as Almighty Power to ſave; that we aſſert his Authority over the whole Creation, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008808_0038_102FEFF4E5AEF518"/>
eſpecially over the Churches. That we declare, that He of whom we aſſert theſe Things, is by Nature GOD; eſſential and eternal God, poſſeſt of all infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and that as God-Man Mediator, having by his Obedience and Death purchaſed Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sanctification and Redemption; He muſt certainly be a moſt perfect and complete Redeemer. Thus the Goſpel exhibits Chriſt to our View, in his perſonal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and mediatorial Fulneſs, and thus He is to be the main Subject of our preaching.</p>
            <p>To preach Chriſt, is to preach the Goſpel, and to preach the Goſpel, is to preach thoſe Things declar'd in the Goſpel; there are thoſe Things which are proper and peculiar to the Goſpel, and are its own, and are no where elſe to be found. Of this Nature are all Things concerning the Love and Will of God in Jeſus Chriſt; the Harmony and Glory of the divine Attributes, as moſt conſpicuous in the Perſon and Mediation of Chriſt; his Natures, Offices, and whole Mediation; of the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Spirit, and our Participation thereof, and Union with Chriſt thereby; our Adoption, Juſtification, and effectual Sanctification thence proceeding. In brief, every Thing that appertains to the Purchaſe of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the effectual Application thereof as by the Holy Spirit. Theſe Things are purely and properly evangelical, peculiar to the Goſpel alone. I add alſo, to preach the Goſpel, is to preach the Precepts and moral Duties, with their Sanctions therein declared and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, with an evangelical and proper Reference to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel firſt propoſes and declares the Things which are properly its own, lays them as the Foundation of Faith and Obedience, and inlays them in the Mind, thereby conforms the whole Soul unto them; this Foundation being laid, it then grafts all Duties of moral Obedience on this Stock of Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> directs unto a right Performance of them, from a right Principle, by a right Rule, and to a right End and Purpoſe; and by a Communication of the Spirit, if ſupplies with Strength for their Performance,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008808_0039_102FEFF739E146A8"/>
in the Manner it preſcribes; and ſo to their Acceptance with GOD: Hereby the Goſpel gives them a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and turns <hi>moral Duties</hi> into <hi>evangelical Obedience.</hi> And this is <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Morality; a Morality ſpringing from Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and animated by Goſpel-Principles and Incentives, governed by Goſpel Rules, and directed to Goſpel-Ends. Theſe Things are the appropriate Glory of the Goſpel: And for a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> among the Heathen, thus to preach them, is for him to preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to them. The Caſe is juſt the ſame, with Reſpect to <hi>us,</hi> who preach to thoſe that are apt to call themſelves <hi>goſpellized;</hi> to them we muſt thus preach the Goſpel. We have no juſt Warrant to look for the Preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with our Sermons, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not thus in our Sermons: "The Things that concern the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>" the Principles of his Religion, muſt live upon our Lips, muſt reign in our Sermons, or it can't be truly ſaid, that we preach Chriſt; without which, we can't hope for a divine Bleſſing to attend our preaching. This is the Way to preſerve the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion in its full and evident Diſtinction, from every falſe Religion; this is the Way to make Chriſt crucified appear "the Wiſdom and the Power of GOD;" this is the Way to keep Profeſſors ſound in the Faith, and to make them obedient to the Faith; and this is the Way to advance the Kingdom of GOD, and to promote the true Knowledge of GOD, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which is Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>BY the Way, theſe Things preſent to our View, the main Difference between legal and evangelical Preaching. Men who have no true Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Goſpel, in its Spirituallity; yet have ſome Notion about <hi>moral Duties,</hi> which have their Foundation in the Law and Light of Nature. Theſe moral Duties taught in the Goſpel, the legal Preacher pretends to embrace, as eſteeming them full as good, or rather better, than <hi>Seneca'</hi>s Morals; and having his Mind principally fix'd upon them, he makes them the reigning Topicks of his Diſcourſe. He profeſſes indeed to admit the Goſpel
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008808_0040_102FEFFA52A404B8"/>
Scheme of Doctrines, and reſolves to appear a warm Advocate for it's enjoin'd Duties; he thereupon cries up moral Duties, but alas, not in their proper Place, nor to their proper End! Theſe he makes the Foundation, according to the Place they held in the Law of Nature, and the Covenant of Works; whereas the Goſpel allows them to be only neceſſary Superſtructions on the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> And by advancing Morality above the <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and Grace of the Goſpel, thereby the Goſpel is rejected; and ſtrictly ſpeaking, Morality is deſtroyed alſo; for take it from its proper Foundation, and it falls of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Such a Preacher, will ſometimes have a cold and caſual Hint relating to the Merits and Grace of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but is evidently ſo defective therein, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly eſcape the Compellation <hi>Arminian,</hi> or legal Preacher; tho' he may for the preſent, the more odious Epithet, <hi>Infidel.</hi> The evangelical Preacher dwells much upon thoſe very glorious Topicks, which are Matters of pure Revelation: He is indeed fully aſſured, that the Scripture Doctrine of Salvation, by free and ſovereign Grace, is a Doctrine according to Godlineſs; he urges, he warmly urges, the Performance of all Duties enjoin'd in the Goſpel, and this in their proper Place, and to their proper End; always taking Care to have a beautiful Intertexture of References to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus to make <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Sum and Subſtance, or ſubject Matter of our preaching, either directly or reductively, is that which is intended by preaching of Him to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might alſo obſerve, that to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> intends that we make Him the End and Deſign of our preaching: That herein, we do not principally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our own Honour and temporal Intereſt, but that we have in View the Honour and Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as our ultimate End; "Preaching not ourſelves, but <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Lord."—But the Time would fail to enlarge here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To obſerve, that the Calls of</hi> GOD <hi>to engage in his Service, are to be obeyed without Delay.</hi>

"IMMEDIATELY, ſays the Apoſtle, I confer'd not with Fleſh and Blood:" The Apoſtle had an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Call to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof, by extraordinary Gifts, which we look not for at this Day. But it holds as a general Rule, that the Calls of GOD ſhould be inſtantly obeyed; and that, becauſe of the infinite Wiſdom of GOD;—the ſupreme Authority of GOD;—and the infinite Reaſonableneſs of his Calls.—Omitting Enlargement here.</p>
            <p>THE Queſtion will occur, how ſhall the qualified Preacher obtain Evidence and Satisfaction, that he is call'd of GOD in a mediate Way, to enter ſoon upon a Miſſion among the Heathen? As preliminary to the Solution of this Queſtion, it may be obſerved, that preaching the Goſpel to the Heathen, ſeems to be a Sort of moral Duty, and a Work of Benevolence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under that general Precept of doing Good unto <hi>All;</hi> and a Work, in ſome Reſpects, much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, as appears evident from the Apoſtle's Declaration, "Yea, ſo have I ſtrove to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was named, leſt I ſhould build upon another Man's Foundation.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                              <hi>The Reverend Mr. </hi> Eleazer Wheelock, <hi>Paſtor of a Church of Chriſt in</hi> Lebanon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> You have thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd preaching Service, upon a Perſon younger, and much more unworthy; and who hopes you will permit him to uſe great Plainneſs and Freedom of Speech.</p>
                        <p>I am well aſſured that your Candour and good Senſe, will not allow you to imagine, that by what I have ſaid in the preceding Diſcourſe, I ſuppoſe every one that ſavingly knows the Lord, is thereby fitted for the Work of the holy Miniſtry, and that human Learning is an unneceſſary Endowment in the Goſpel Miniſter; and that regular Induction, according to the ſtanding Order of the Goſpel, is not to be obſerved; no, thus you do not receive what I have ſaid: Nor that I Countenance Seperations from Miniſters, merely upon Suſpicion of their Want of the ſaving Knowledge of the Lord. If a Miniſter of the Goſpel is guilty of moral Scandal, or unſound in Point of Doctrine; or but more rarely preaches upon the more important Doctrines of the Goſpel, and when he does, gives them but a ſuperficial Handling; or is ſome how notoriouſly deficient in his Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſuch Caſes, I will not deny, but People have Liberty to ſeek a Redreſs of Grievance, according to the Method the Goſpel preſcribes.—Nor will you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I mean to inſinuate, that the Want of the ſaving Knowledge of the Lord in a Miniſter, abſolutely invalidates his Adminiſtrations, and renders then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void; no, a Man being conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Miniſter of the Goſpel, according to the known and ſtanding Laws of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom, found in his Word, and thus inveſted with Office Power,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008808_0044_102FF00570D37360"/>
according to Goſpel Order; he has lawful Right and Authority to perform all Parts of the Miniſterial Work. But then, may I not here apply that Maxim, in uſe both by <hi>Civilians</hi> and <hi>Divines?</hi> "Quod factum fieri non debet, factum valet;" at leaſt ſo far avails, that there is Validity in Ordinances adminiſter'd by ſuch a Man; tho' it might have been well, if ſuch a Man had not been permitted to enter into the holy Miniſtry; for an unconverted Miniſtry is one of the greateſt Calamities.</p>
                        <p>HAVING thus preſumed upon your Candour and Judgment, I am apt to imagine you have gone before me, in drawing this native Inference, from what has now been ſaid, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> That it greatly concerns us, to uſe utmoſt Care and Caution in putting Men into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, leſt we commit the holy Miniſtry to ſuch Men as known not the Lord ſavingly. Our bleſſed Lord and Maſter has charged us, not only to "lay Hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on no Man," but alſo "to commit the Miniſtry to faithful Men." I am well aſſured, that we are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in this Opinion, that Men ought ſavingly to know the Lord, who engage in the holy Miniſtry. We take the Liberty to think for ourſelves, as well as others, who are not of the ſame Opinion: And 'tis at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, that we have all the ſame Liberty of thinking for ourſelves, yet no Man has Liberty to think contrary to Truth, be that what it will. As for thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare there is no ſuch Thing as forming any Judgment about Men, whether they are truly gracious, or not; and think it needleſs to make any Inquiry after a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate's Acquaintance with experimental Religion; as ſuppoſing, that if he has a compotent Meaſure of <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,</hi> and is not groſsly ignorant, or ſcandalouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, he is fit to be put into the ſacred Miniſtry; upon their Principles, whole Cluſters, of light, airy, graceleſs young Men; who are far from a ſavoury Reliſh of the Things of GOD, and a ſerious, ſolemn Senſe of Things Eternal; may be introduced into the holy Miniſtry: Is not this to throw down the ſacred Encloſure our Lord hath ſet about his Vineyard, and to Act the Part of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008808_0045_102FF006F4FCCDD8"/>
Oppoſition, to that ſolemn Prohibition, "Lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man?" Some there are who in Terms profeſs, that Candidates for the Goſpel Miniſtry, ought to be godly or gracious Perſons; and yet, when they explain their Profeſſion, we find it does not amount to holding, that a Candidate ought to be gracious, or a real Convert, in order to give him Right to undertake the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry. Their Meaning ſeems to be this, that they ought to be truly gracious; for ſo ought all that hear, as well as all that preach the Goſpel; adding thus much, that renewing and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, is a very uſeful Qualification in the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date; but then tis not their Opinion, that it muſt be inſiſted upon as ſuch a neceſſary Qualification, as that the Want of it ſhall be preventive of engaging in the holy Miniſtry. They plead Neceſſity, in Juſtification of Principle; that there are a great many vacant Churches and Congregations, and perhaps more in Number, than there are truly godly young Men to afford a Supply; that that which is wanting can't be number'd, that they muſt take up with ſuch as they can get.—I would at preſent only obſerve here, that whatſoever the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Chriſt's Church are, Men whom we ſet apart to the Work of the holy Miniſtry, ſhould be ſuch as his Goſpel does require them to be. The Queſtion in Debate, in plain Terms, is this, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> Does the Word of GOD ſo require ſanctifying Grace, in a Candidate for the holy Miniſtry, as that being deſtitute thereof, he has not a ſolid Right of Foundation to engage therein? Now, if a Perſon who has not ſanctifying Grace, or a ſaving Knowledge of the Lord, cannot lawfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry, as I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to prove from the Word of GOD, and the Reaſon of Things; then Miniſters of the Goſpel ought not to ſeperate a Perſon to the Work of the holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, without having Evidence ſufficient to found a Judgment of Chriſtian Charity upon, that a Perſon does thus know the Lord: For Faithfulneſs to our Lord and Maſter, will not ſuffer us to commit the holy Miniſtry
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008808_0046_102FF009951A67A0"/>
to a Perſon that we do not judge qualified therefor, as his Goſpel does require: Therefore, in putting Men into the Miniſtry, we muſt ſeek all the Evidence that the Nature of the Caſe will reaſonably admit, that Men ſavingly know the Lord, and cautiouſly avoid taking up with any Thing ſhort of this.</p>

                           <salute>Reverend and Dear Sirs,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>YOU will allow me to ſpeak out our Opinion freely. In them whom we introduce into the Miniſtry, we look for and expect to find, a Competency of natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, acquir'd Improvements, Orthodoxy, or Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Faith, viſible Holineſs of Life, as 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd, and that they give us ſome Account of their Acquaintance with experimental Religion, ſuch as ſhall appear to us ſufficient for the Exerciſe of a rational Judgment of Chriſtian Charity, that they ſavingly know the Lord. We pretend not to immediate Revelation from Heaven, and Infallibility of Knowledge in this Caſe, no; but we ſeek ſuch Evidence, as the Nature of the Caſe will admit, and as Faithfulneſs does require. We are to form a Judgment of the ſpiritual State of our Fellow-Men, in the Caſe before us, by what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with the Mouth, and the Influence ſuch a Profeſſion has upon the Life. Men without an Intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, may impoſe upon themſelves, and upon us; yet this is no Argument againſt an Examination as to theſe Things; yea, tis an Argument that we ſhould be the more ſtrict upon the Point of Examination. If we conſider Faith as appearing in the Profeſſion of it, we find the Apoſtle accounting the Influences of the holy Spirit, neceſſary to enable a Man to make ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Faith, as was to be admitted by Chriſtians: "No Man can ſay that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt." A Man may ſo explain himſelf about his Faith, and give ſuch an Account of his experimental Religion, and his Faith may have ſuch Influence upon his Conduct in Life, as to leave no reaſonable Ground to ſuſpect but that he ſavingly knows the Lord. For
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008808_0047_102FF00E6D850BB0"/>
a Man to appear free from thoſe Sins, commonly called openly ſcandalous, and to have a Life ſo harmleſs as to afford a Kind of meer negative Charity, is not enough in the preſent Caſe: We therefore ſeek a Profeſſion of Faith, expreſſive of the Eſſentials of real Piety, or that the Candidate give a rational, ſcriptural, and ſatisfying Account of a ſanctifying Work of God's Spirit upon his own Heart; and that his Belief, and Experience of the Power of Divine Truth, influences him to live the Truth, ſo that his Light ſhines before Men: Theſe Things are included in the Nature of Evidence, in the preſent Caſe, and therefore Miniſters have full Authority, and juſt Right to demand them, and are bound in Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſo to do; and of Conſequence the Candidate is obliged to exhibit ſuch Evidence, if 'tis in his Power honeſtly ſo to do. Until we have ſought and found ſuch Evidence, as now mentioned, we have not ſatisfying Evidence that a Man is qualified for the Goſpel Miniſtry, nor dare we ſeperate him thereto. Let us then hear what the Candidate has to ſay for himſelf, as clearing up his Call to enter upon the Work of the Holy Miniſtry? What his Views and Aims are? What his Faith, and experimental Acquaintance with Divine Truth, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: With Tenderneſs and Candour, we would gladly hear him upon theſe Points; and ſeek Satisfaction, as to the Influence of his Faith upon his Conduct in Life.</p>
                        <p>'TIS verily to be fear'd, that many Candidates for the Goſpel Miniſtry, were they to be duly and properly examined as to Qualifications therefor, ſuch as the Goſpel doth require, would be found evidently deficient.</p>
                        <p>BUT we deſire to bleſs the Lord, we ſometimes find a hopeful Meaſure of all Goſpel Qualifications, in the Candidate under Examination; and thereupon, when called, with unutterable ſolemn Pleaſure, proceed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate him to the Work of the evangelical Miniſtry, according to Goſpel Order. Sometimes the Candidate appears poſſeſt of a Meaſure of all neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but 'tis dubious whether in a Degree equal to what ought to be judged ſufficient;—ſometimes there
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008808_0048_102FF01014D5B1C8"/>
may appear great Deficiency as to ſome one Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ex.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gr. aptneſs to teach;—ſometimes we are greatly exerciſed, as in Doubt, about the Reality of the Candidate's experimental Religion: It may be, he has more Confidence than Evidence, or honeſtly tells us, that he has near upon an equal Meaſure of Fears and Hopes, as to his ſaving Knowledge of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon due Examination of him, with Reſpect thereto, 'tis much ſo with us, ſo that our judgment of Charity, ſeems in a Meaſure ſuſpended. We are full of Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs toward hopeful Youth, are unwilling to damp any agreeable Appearances, and to prevent Uſefulneſs; at the ſame Time, fear to run before the Call of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, tremble at the Thought of giving the <hi>Ark</hi> a wrong touch; and upon the Whole, are ready to ſay, we know not what to do! To which permit me to reply, That when we know not what to do, we muſt not do we know not what. In the preſent Caſe, our Hopes muſt exceed our Fears, or we can't proceed to promote the Candidate, with a good Conſcience. He who ſuppoſes his Judgment in <hi>equi-librio,</hi> is in the Quality of a <hi>non Liquet,</hi> and nothing can be done by him actively: And ſhould this be the Caſe with the greater Part of the Examiners, the Candidate muſt ſtand by, 'till he becomes poſſeſt of brighter Evidence of Divine Grace. And now, where is the ſeemingly great Difficulty and Perplexity? Does it not abate, or rather evaniſh? Is not Duty plain before us? Does our Lord require more of us than is reaſonable? He neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, nor expects that we ſhould be infallible Judges of the ſpiritual State of Men, but that we exerciſe a rational, Chriſtian Judgment, according to Light; and that we be faithful to the Truſt depoſited in us, keeping our Conſciences void of Offence toward Him.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſpoken my Opinion the more freely, becauſe I am well aſſured that ſome of my <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008808_0049_102FF012B824E108"/>
Lord has devolved upon us, the ſacred Truſt of putting Men into the holy Miniſtry, "the ſame commit <hi>thou,</hi>" thou <hi>Timothy,</hi> a Miniſter, a Man in Office: And He has charg'd us, not only "to lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man;" but alſo "to commit the Miniſtry to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men;" and our Fidelity in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> is of the higheſt Importance.</p>
                        <p>To commit the Miniſtry to an unconverted, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd Man, is to commit it to a Man that is not likely to anſwer the important and excellent Deſigns and Purpoſes of the Goſpel Miniſtry. A very ſhocking Thought! He may indeed help to keep up the Form of Religion for a Time; but if Religion ſhould revive and flouriſh, by the out-pouring of the holy Spirit from on high; partly through Ignorance and Enmity, and partly from Pride and Envy, (which breed a Hell in the Boſom where they dwell) at the Succeſs of others; (unleſs he receive Conviction of his awful State) he is quite likely to oppoſe, not only ſome Imprudences, common in ſuch a Day, but alſo the Eſſentials of the Work of GOD.</p>
                        <p>HE will probably commit the Miniſtry to others, like himſelf; and in Proceſs of Time, now unborn Ages may feel, forever feel, the Weight of that HAND, which we lay upon the Head of the Man that has an unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied HEART. And how dangerous the Enterpriſe for the Man himſelf! Upon the dreadful Suppoſition, that he ſhould never be converted, what Tongue can expreſs, what Thoughts conceive the dreadful Aggravations that will attend his eternal Perdition! No Doubt, if Miniſters of the Goſpel are finally found Chriſtleſs and Graceleſs, of all Men living they will be the moſt miſerable. What Horror, Tribulation, and Anguiſh, will ſeize upon their guilty Hearts? and what Shame and Confuſion will cover their Faces, when the dreadful Judge ſhall come in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance upon the Diſobedient, and the Blood of loſt Souls ſhall cry for Vengeance againſt them! In a Word, as we Regard the Lord's Honour, the Proſperity of <hi>Zion,</hi> the Salvation of Men,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008808_0050_102FF0143B6D4D78"/>
and Peace of Conſcience; let us take Care that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Miniſtry to faithful Men.</p>
                        <p>AND let us alſo be often engaged in an accurate Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our Knowledge of the Lord Chriſt, and ſeek renew'd Manifeſtations, and the fulleſt Aſſurances thereof. And, oh! how importunate we ſhould be in Prayer, for the gracious Preſence of the Lord with us, and for the divine Influences to accompany our Miniſtrations. Let us labour to ſee and feel ourſelves living in a State of conſtant Dependence upon the Lord Chriſt, for the Reception of ſuitable, ſeaſonable, and ſufficient Grace, for all preſent Needs and Duties. The Purpoſes we ſerve are ſo high and God-like, our Work ſo important, ſo ſpiritual, ſo difficult, and ſo much above our Strength; how is it poſſible to go on in it, without much of the Preſence of the Lord with us? Moſt of the Work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted us, is with God and Souls; it's about what is myſterious and ſupernatural; it's of vaſt Compaſs and great Variety, and Eternity is concern'd in what we are about; we had need therefore to be fill'd with the Spirit of Grace and Holineſs, to have a double Portion of his Gifts and Graces, of his Aid and Influence. Thereupon we ſhall become wiſe to win Souls, and hopefully ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; and finally, ſhine as the Stars yea, as the Sun, in the Kingdom of our GOD and Father, for ever and ever.</p>

You are call'd to aſſiſt in bringing in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Revenue of Honour and Glory to GOD, Father, Son, and Spirit: And this too, in a Day in which we have Reaſon to believe from Scripture Prophecy, and the preſent Aſpect of Divine Providence, that the Latter-Day Glory is dawning; a Day alſo, in which, by the Smiles of Heaven upon our Forces, and the Succeſs of our Armies in <hi>America,</hi> a joyous Proſpect opens to View, far beyond all that ever appear'd before, for evangelizing the Heathen in theſe Ends of the Earth. At this very Day of growing Wonder and refreſhing Hope, the Lord calls you to preach the Goſpel to thoſe, who from Time immemorial, have been wandering out of the Way of Salvation, "without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and without GOD in the World." With Regard to the Miſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, you may ſay unto GOD, with Humility and adoring Thankfulneſs, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, in another Caſe, "Here I am, for thou doſt call me." Methinks there is now a Voice utter'd by the adorable <hi>Trinity,</hi> "whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us?"<note n="*" place="bottom">

Lord now call you to preach the Goſpel to the Heathen? Surely you will not confer with Difficulties and Dangers, or carnal Intereſt; but ſeek to be on your Way to the Heathen Nations as ſoon as may be, to let them hear of your Lord and Saviour. While you feel the Love of our dear <hi>Immanuel</hi> glow in your Breaſt, how, oh, how! your Heart akes and bleeds within you, for your poor benighted Kinſmen after the Fleſh, that are periſhing for Lack of Viſion! How long? How much? And how often it has done ſo? I give you Joy, <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> for the Door of Hope for their Salvation, opens to View with a promiſing Appearance. At one and the ſame Time, Opportunity preſents for you to vent your Love to the divine <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and your Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the periſhing Souls of your Nation.</p>
                        <p>NOW then, <hi>our dear Brother,</hi> go, go; and may the Lord go with you, and now ſend Proſperity! Go in the Spirit of an Apoſtle, go do the Work of an <hi>Evangeliſt;</hi> Go lift up your Voice in the Huts of Savages, and cry aloud to the People that dwell in the gloomy Shades of Death! And let them "hear the joyful Sound." Go tell them of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> tell them who the Saviour is; tell them, "He is GOD over all, bleſſed forever more;" tell them of his divine and mediatorial Glory, alluring Fulneſs, and perfect Excellence; tell them he is the only Mediator and Saviour, and that he is both able and willing to ſave them; tell them King <hi>Jeſus</hi> Reigns, God's own almighty Son, and they who dwell in the Wilderneſs muſt bow before him, ſubmit to him, believe in him, love, worſhip, and adore him, <hi>as Lord of All.</hi> And whether they will hear or forbear, know thou, <hi>our dear Brother,</hi> your Judgment will be with the Lord, and your Reward with your GOD; glorious in full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to your Diligence and Fidelity.</p>

                        <p>I always feel great Tenderneſs toward hopeful Youth, who have ſerious Thoughts toward engaging in the Goſpel Miniſtry; eſpecially toward you, who have moſt of you, for a Time, ſojourned under my Roof, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally purſuing <hi>Theological</hi> Studies. Suffer me therefore to addreſs you by Way of Exhortation, to ſee to it that you know the Lord JESUS ſavingly. Preſume not to reſt in the charitable Opinion of others, as your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that you ſavingly know the Lord: You may have the Sanction of the charitable Hope and Judgment of <hi>Preſbyteries,</hi> or <hi>Aſſociations,</hi> and yet be eternally rejected by the Lord. The eternal Judge, "whoſe Eyes are as a Flame of Fire," and whoſe Prerogative alone it is to ſearch the Heart; will one Day ſay to many, to Multitudes, that have propheſied, that have preached in his Name, I approve you not, depart from me.—If they who have preach'd in his Name, may periſh in his Wrath, how greatly it concerns them that preach, to have ſatisfactory Evidence, by the Actings of Grace, that they truly know the Lord! To ſome, it may poſſibly ſeem a very bold Aſſertion, but I declare it in plain Terms, that no Man can ever prove to himſelf, that he was call'd of GOD, to engage in the holy Miniſtry, who has never been effectually call'd by divine Grace, ſo as to know the Lord ſavingly. And unleſs you thus know the Lord, with what Heart, with what Confidence, can you enter upon the ſacred Miniſtry? If you ſhould run the Riſk, the awful Riſk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> void of ſuch Knowledge, what Comfort can you take therein? Or what of Succeſs can you expect thereupon? Without Controverſy, it will one Day be a Soul puzzling, Soul confounding Queſtion to many, "Man, who made you a Miniſter?" Who gave the Commiſſion to treat for <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And to whom, but them, who preach an unknown <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and and who run before they were ſent, as regardleſs of Goſpel Order? I beſeech you therefore, <hi>my young Friends,</hi> that in the firſt Place you be well ſatisfied that you
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008808_0055_102FF02329204E18"/>
ſavingly know the Lord. Ply, warmly ply the Throne of Grace, that you may become rich in Experience of divine Grace, and that you may enjoy copious Meaſures of divine Influence. Go on indeed to ſeek all uſeful and ſuitable Furniture for the great Work you have in View, and never imagine you have come to a <hi>ne plus ultra.</hi> Amidſt other Parts of uſeful Learning, ſtudy Oratory, and artful Method of Addreſs; but reſt not here. If you had all Knowledge, and underſtood all Myſteries, and could uſe all the Force of Perſuation, and Charms of Eloquence; were you furniſh'd with all the flowing Oratory of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and all the Thunder of <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> and could you employ them in every Sermon you preach; yet, without the gracious Preſence of the Lord with you, you would in Reality be but as the ſounding Braſs and tinkling Cymbal, that makes an empty Noiſe and uſeleſs Muſick. I pray GOD, that the Day in which we live, may not be a Day in which the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of preaching becomes loſt, for want of due Regard to the Influences of the holy Spirit. While the Study and Uſe of fine Language and Oratory are ſo much in Vogue among Preachers, and ſo pleaſing to many Hearers, as at this Day, and tend ſo much to recommend the Preacher, and to promote his Reputation, the Temptation, to the young Preacher eſpecially, is prodigiouſly powerful to ſubſtitute theſe Things in the Room of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Aſſiſtance, and to reſt in them. But alas, for us that preach! alas for them that hear, when it ſhall become thus! In the Eye of a judicious ſpiritual Hearer, can it look like preaching the everlaſting Goſpel, and having to do with the eternal GOD, and immortal Souls, for Time and endleſs Worlds, to make the Pulpit a meer Stage, and juſt to flouriſh out a pretty pert Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, top'd up with one or two general jejune Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences? How much ſoever this may pleaſe the vitiated Taſte and Humours of ſome, the two diſtant Poles are not more remote from each other, than ſuch Manner of Pulpit Work from a genuine Aptitude and Tendency to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008808_0056_102FF02527523538"/>
pierce the Heart, to awaken the Conſcience, and to do good to the Souls of Men. 'Tis true indeed, Men have their various Gifts, Talents, and Turns of Mind; 'tis natural to ſome Men to communicate their Thoughts in a correct, maſculine, nervous, ſtriking and charming Stile and Diction; as truly natural, it appears beautiful. Some ſuch there are, who from the ſpiritual Frame of their Hearts, are zealous, lively and practical Preachers, and excel in making the moſt warm Applications and earneſt Addreſſes to the Hearts and Conſciences of them that hear. Their Delivery and Geſtures are natural, grave and decent, Action is lively and ſignificant, void of Affectation; their Sermons are evidently calculated, not to gratify Men's Curioſity with pleaſing Speculations, but to pierce their Hearts with pungent Convictions; not to pleaſe their Fances, but to awaken their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and to convert and ſave their Souls. They appear as Men who have been with GOD in private, and thereupon ſpeak by his ſpecial Aſſiſtance in publick; theſe are doubtleſs juſtly celebrated Preachers of the Goſpel. If we would act the Orator, the Miniſter, or the Chriſtian, we muſt endeavour to know and to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the peculiar Turn of our own Mind, and not indulge a vain Affectation, nor Attempt a forced Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any Man. It will appear unnatural and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to a judicious Hearer, when it becomes too evident, that the Preacher who has not a natural ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous flow of ready and elegant Expreſſions, has la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd hard to poliſh his little Compoſition, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Glitter of ſhining Phraſes, by arranging his Words, beautifying his Language, rounding his Periods, ſo as really to ſtiffen his Diſcourſe: When by minding little Things over much, he has betray'd the Want of a Heart deeply aw'd and impreſs's with a Senſe of what he is about, and the Want of a due Regard to divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and a pointed Form of Addreſs, ſuch as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be found in the Sermons which our Lord Chriſt preached. While looſe and general Harangues
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008808_0057_102FF027B3B00A58"/>
are now grown ſo faſhionable in Pulpits, that the true Spirit of evangelical Preaching may not be loſt, let young Preachers learn true Oratory from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſeek copious Meaſures of his gracious, ſpiritual Preſence with them. That Preacher has hit upon the true Maſter-Key of ſacred Eloquence, and obtain'd the beſt Part of a Pulpit Orator, who is Maſter of a good Diſcourſe, and is ſkilful in applying of it, in its full Weight home upon the Conſciences of Men, who knows how to lay open the human Heart, and trace it's Windings, it's Diſguiſes and Corruptions, and how to draw Voice and Paſſion from the Heart, ſo that every one ſhall hear, ſee, and recognize himſelf, and ſtand acquitted or condemn'd in his own Breaſt, according as he deſerves one or the other: But no Man is like to do <hi>this</hi> to Purpoſe, unleſs the Lord is with him, and ſpeaks by him. Labour and Art may make a Man an elegant and correct Speaker, ſo as to be much admir'd by himſelf, and by thoſe who ſeek nothing farther; but I will be bold to ſay, that no Man can become a real powerful Chriſtian Orator, unleſs the Lord is with him, impreſſes divine Truth upon his Heart, and helps him in ſome good Meaſure to preach as he ought, "even in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power." I beſeech you, <hi>Sirs,</hi> labour to be Maſter of the Subject you handle, to be full of it, to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly enlighten'd and warm'd with it, to feel every Sentiment you deliver, and every Paſſion you mean to inſpire. Remember the Pulpit is a Place in which Men ordinarily affect to ſhine, in Brightneſs of Sentiment, Fineneſs of Compoſition, and a Gracefulneſs of Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the Preacher does but think, (and 'tis a Wonder if he don't) that he has obtain'd the Reputation of a fine Speaker, great is the Force of Temptation, to bring him under the Power of Pride and Self-Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that he may now deſpiſe the Smiles, as well as Frowns of the People, and by Humility be kept ſafe, as not forming big Ideas of his own Importance, and his own Performance; and that he may have a Mind
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008808_0058_102FF02A382E6A70"/>
exalted in all Reſpects above this World, and above it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how much he needs a Combination of grand and ſolemn Views of divine Objects, and Things Eternal, by the gracious Preſence of the Lord with him? The Lord being thus with you, you will ſink into Nothing; feel leſs than an Attom, as ſtruck with the Majeſty of his Perfections, and tranſported with the Wonders of his Love: Now you will ſee the Beauty, Glory, and Excellence, now Taſte the Sweetneſs, and feel the Power of divine Grace and Truth upon the Heart; and now you will be filled with Bowels of Compaſſion and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Pity toward the Souls of Men: And now your Manner of Preaching, will neceſſarily be inſtructive, warm, caſuiſtical and pathetical; addreſſed often to the Conſciences, and frequently to the Affections of your Hearers; the moſt hopeful Method to enlighten and vivify others. After all, ever remember, that the ſaving Efficacy of all Means, depends upon the Co-operation of the holy Spirit; powerful <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and eloquent <hi>Apollos</hi> water, 'tis God giveth the Increaſe: Therefore you muſt be very converſant with Heaven, importunate, inceſſant at the Throne of Grace, praying the Lord to grant divine Influences to the People, as well as to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And if he ſo does, and works by you, aſcribe all the Glory to him, to his free and ſovereign Grace. In fine, <hi>my dear Sirs,</hi> be ſure that you always give due Honours to the Aids and Influences of the holy Spirit; and thus, 'tis hopeful, you will become powerful and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Preachers of the Goſpel; and thus may the Lord be with you and bleſs you, and make you Bleſſings in your Day, and finally Crown you with immortal Glory!</p>
