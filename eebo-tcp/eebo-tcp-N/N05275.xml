         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He that ſpells truly moſt of the other's Words, is Victor for that Day; he that is Victor moſt Days in a Month, to obtain a Prize, a pretty neat Book of ſome Kind uſeful in their future Studies. This Method fixes the Attention of Children extreamly to the Orthography of Words, and makes them good Spellers very early. 'Tis a Shame for a Man to be ſo ignorant of this little Art, in his own Language, as to be perpetually confounding Words of like Sound and different Significations; the Conſciouſneſs of which Defect, makes ſome Men, otherwiſe of good Learning and Underſtanding, averſe to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting even a common Letter.</p>

LET the Pieces read by the Scholars in this Claſs be ſhort, ſuch as <hi>Croxall</hi>'s Fables, and little Stories. In giving the Leſſon, let it be read to them; let the Meaning of the difficult Words in it be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and let them con it over by themſelves before they are called to read to the Maſter, or Uſher; who is to take particular Care that they do not read too faſt, and that they duly obſerve the Stops and Pauſes. A Vocabulary of the moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difficult Words might be formed for their Uſe, with Explanations; and they might daily get a few of thoſe Words and Explanations by Heart, which would a little exerciſe their Memories; or at leaſt they might write a Number of them in a ſmall Book for the Purpoſe, which would help to fix the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Words in their Minds, and at the ſame Time furniſh every one with a little Dictionary for his future Uſe.</p>

               <p>WHERE the Author has us'd an Expreſſion not the beſt, let it be pointed out; and let his Beauties be particularly remarked to the Youth.</p>
               <p>LET the Leſſons for Reading be varied, that the Youth may be made acquainted with good Stiles of all Kinds in Proſe and Verſe, and the proper Manner of reading each Kind. Sometimes a well-told Story, a Piece of a Sermon, a General's Speech to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, a Speech in a Tragedy, ſome Part of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, an Ode, a Satyr, a Letter, Blank Verſe, Hudibraſtick, Heroic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let ſuch Leſſons for Reading be choſen, as contain ſome uſeful Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Underſtandings or Morals of the Youth, may at the ſame Time be improv'd.</p>
               <p>IT is requir'd that they ſhould firſt ſtudy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Leſſons, before they are put upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them properly, to which End each Boy ſhould have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dictionary to help him over Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. When our Boys read <hi>Engliſh</hi> to us, we are apt to imagine <hi>they</hi> underſtand what <hi>they</hi> read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>we</hi> do, and becauſe 'tis their Mother Tongue. But they often read as Parrots ſpeak, knowing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing of the Meaning. And it is impoſſible a Reader ſhould give the due Modulation to his Voice, and pronounce properly, unleſs his Underſtanding goes before his Tongue, and makes him Maſter of the Sentiment. Accuſtoming Boys to read aloud what they do not firſt underſtand, is the Cauſe of thoſe even ſet Tones ſo common among Readers, which when they have once got a Habit of uſing, they find ſo difficult to correct: By which Means, among Fifty Readers we ſcarcely find a good One.

               <p>SPEAKING properly and gracefully, which is near of Kin to good Reading, and naturally follows it in the Studies of Youth. Let the Scholars of this Claſs begin with learning the Elements of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric from ſome ſhort Syſtem, ſo as to be able to give an Account of the moſt uſual Tropes and Figures. Let all their bad Habits of Speaking, all Offences againſt good Grammar, all corrupt or foreign Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and all improper Phraſes, be pointed out to them. Short Speeches from the <hi>Roman</hi> or other Hiſtory, or from our <hi>Parliamentary Debates,</hi> might be got by heart, and deliver'd with the proper Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Speeches and Scenes in our beſt Tragedies and Comedies (avoiding every Thing that could injure the Morals of Youth) might likewiſe be got by Rote, and the Boys exercis'd in delivering or acting them; great Care being taken to form their Manner after the trueſt Models.</p>
               <p>FOR their farther Improvement, and a little to vary their Studies, let them now begin to read <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> after having got by Heart a ſhort Table of the principal Epochas in Chronology. They may begin with <hi>Rollin</hi>'s <hi>Antient and Roman Hiſtories,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at proper Hours as they go thro' the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Claſſes, with the beſt Hiſtories of our own Nation and Colonies.

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006668_0006_10293F2D79D081B0"/>to give the beſt Account of what they have read, as to Times, Places, Names of Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will make them read with Attention, and imprint the Hiſtory well in their Memories.

               <p>THE Natural and Mechanic Hiſtory contain'd in <hi>Spectacle de la Nature,</hi> might alſo be begun in this Claſs, and continued thro' the ſubſequent Claſſes by other Books of the ſame Kind: For next to the Knowledge of <hi>Duty,</hi> this Kind of Knowledge is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt uſeful, as well as the moſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Merchant may thereby be enabled better to underſtand many Commodities in Trade; the Handicraftſman to improve his Buſineſs by new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Mixtures and Materials; and frequently Hints are given of new Manufactures, or new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of improving Land, that may be ſet on foot greatly to the Advantage of a Country.</p>

               <p>COMPOSITION. Writing one's own Language well, is the next neceſſary Accompliſhment after good Speaking.
