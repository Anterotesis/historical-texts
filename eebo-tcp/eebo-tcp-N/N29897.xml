            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ANSWER TO A BOOK, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Having taken ſome Remarks upon ſaid Book as followeth. In his Preface he ſeems to limit the Worſhip due to God, more at ſome certain times than at other times; and to carry a long, as if Prayer was one of the greateſt Part of Worſhip to God, quoting <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. which Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the whole Doctrine of Prayer, which Chriſt taught in a general way to his Diſciples, as appears in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Sermon to them, Mat. 5.1.2. <hi>His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples came unto him, and he opened his Mouth and taught them.</hi> Compare this with the Concluſion of his Sermon Mat. 7.14. <hi>Therefore whoſoever heareth theſe Sayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe Man,</hi> &amp;c. So that this contains a general Doctrine to all his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples relating to Prayer, not to be as the Hypocrites are, as in the 5th Verſe, <hi>for they love to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Verily I ſay unto You, they have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that is, the Praiſe of Men. Thus Chriſt ſingles out his Diſciples from the Multitudes of Hypocrites, (as appears <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.1.2.) as God did his People Iſrael. Exod. 20.2, 3. <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>

have no other gods,</hi> &amp;c. Thus, as God ſingles out Iſrael as being his peculiar People, ſo doth Chriſt his Diſciples, Mat. 6.6. <hi>But thou when thou prayeſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaking to his peculiar Diſciples, in the ſingular Number, ſingling them out from Hypocrites, as God did Iſrael from other Nations, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other god,</hi> &amp;c. Even ſo ſaith Chriſt unto his Diſciples, <hi>When thou prayeſt thou ſhalt not be as the Hypocrites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God's Children were in a Holy Frame, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to Faſt and Pray, they did it not with a mixt Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in publick Aſſemblies, as Hypocrites are wont to do; as appears, Neh. 9.1, 2. <hi>The Children of Iſrael ſeparated themſelves from all Strangers,</hi> in time of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Prayers unto God. Acts 1.13.14. <hi>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper Room,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe all continued with one accord in Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. And we no where read, throughout the whole Bible, that God's Children ever prayed in a publick Aſſembly with a mixt Multitude, in a cuſtomary way, as Hypocritical Iſrael was wont to do; as throughout the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth appear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scripture makes a Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Faſting and Prayer, and Worſhip to God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, Joh. 9.31. <hi>Now we know that God heareth not Sinners,</hi> (that is, their Prayers) <hi>but if any Man be a Worſhiper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</hi> Here the Scripture makes a Diſtinction betwen the Worſhip of God and Prayer, ſhewing that he that worſhipeth God and doth his Will, ſuch an one God heareth his Prayers, Zech. 7.5. <hi>When ye faſted and mourned</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did ye at all faſt unto me? And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink; did ye not eat, and did ye not drink for your ſelves?</hi> But the true Worſhip of God is expreſs'd in the 9th and 10th Verſes. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6th and 7th Verſes ſpeaks of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but the 8th Verſe ſpeaks of Worſhip to God.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Worſhip of God is not limited to any particular Place, as appeareth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4, 21, 22. compared with the 23d Verſe. <hi>The hour cometh, when ye ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039751_0004_1015C0C1787A5FC0"/>
Father: Ye worſhip ye know not what,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the hour cometh and now is, when the true Worſhipers, ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 14.17, 18. <hi>For the Kingdom of God is Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt: For he that in theſe things ſerveth Christ, is acceptable to God,</hi> &amp;c. For the Service, or Worſhip we owe to God, is <hi>to preſent our Bodies a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which it the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service we owe to him,</hi> Rom. 12.1. No Man can ſerve God while he is in the Spiritual Egypt, or under the Power of Sin, nor till the Son of God ſets him free from that Bondage, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did Iſrael, before they could ſerve God, as appears, Joh. 8. comparing the 34th Verſe with the 36. <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Sin: If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all Prayer that proceeds from an unclean Heart, is an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.11. compared with the 16th, 17th, and 18th Verſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. And all Prayer that is offered to God, and not in Faith, is but a Deluſion: <hi>For without Faith it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. For every Prayer that is offer'd up to God, &amp; not in Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but a vain Babbling, &amp; will avail nothing, as appears <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. comparing the 6th Verſe with the 7th. <hi>But let him ask in Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For let not that Man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord,</hi> i. e. if his Prayer be not in Faith; and this Faith cannot be but to a pure Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p>This have I written that People may not be miſled, by thinking they worſhip God in Forms, and ſet Times of Prayer, while they are in a State of Sin; and that they may conſider, the Publican, upon his firſt Prayer, accompanied with true Repentance, went away rather juſtifyed than the other, that was zealous in his often Faſting and Prayers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.10, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the next Place I ſhall enter upon his Scripture Proof about his Firſt Day Sabbath, ſeeing the Scripture <hi>is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction, that the Man of God may be perfect,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. <hi>For if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039751_0005_1015C0C4D4DBE7A0"/>
is becauſe there is no Light in them,</hi> Iſai. 8.20. <hi>For where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. 4.15. And therefore I ſhall examine his Scripture Proof, and ſee what Law he produceth out of the holy Scriptures for his Firſt Day Sabbath.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 5th ſaith he, <hi>The Apoſtle doth not oppoſe the keeping one Day in a Week holy to God.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is not what the Apoſtle doth not oppoſe, but what the Apoſtle commands, 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> An unholy Man cannot do one holy Act, no more than a corrupt Tree can bring forth good Fruit: But I have no where read in the Books of the New Teſtament, that we are commanded to keep one Day more holy than another.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame <hi>Page</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Christ came not to deſtroy the Law,</hi> Mat. 5.17. This is very true, <hi>for what the Law could not do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God ſending his own Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for Sin, or by a Sacrifice for Sin, condemned Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.3.4. Thus Chriſt fulfills the Law in us, for there is no Law againſt the Fruit of the Spirit. And thus Chiiſt came to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law in us, <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit, beauſe the Love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5.5. And by this Love we keep the Law perfectly, as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. So that Chriſt did not come to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of it in us, <hi>for Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> Rom. 10.4.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame <hi>Page</hi> he quotes Mat. 24.20. <hi>Pray that your Flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath Day.</hi> This was ſpoken of a Time that was to come, which came to paſs (as he ſaith) about Forty Years after, which is very true. Now we are to conſider, that theſe Jews had a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, for we find by Record of Scripture, that in Chriſt's Time they were very zealous in the Obſervation of the Seventh Day Sabbath, having a very plain Commandment for it, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039751_0006_1015C0C6A4BB3E78"/>
often judged our Saviour as being guilty of the Breach of it, in bidding the Man that was healed to carry his Bed on it, with ſeveral other Things which he did upon it, and therefore did the Jews perſecute Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he had done theſe Things on the Sabbath Day. Joh. 5.16. <hi>Therefore ſaid Some of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, This Man is not of God, becauſe he keepeth not the Sabbath Day,</hi> Joh. 9.16. But at this time they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roman Government, who did not allow them to put any Man to Death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18, 31. But Forty Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they rebelled againſt the Romans, and then put in Execution their own Laws: And tho' it was no greater Sin to take their Flight on the Sabbath than in the Winter to ſa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Life (for it was a Deed of Mercy, and a Duty as much to be done on the Sabbath Day as on any other Day,) but more danger of Death by the Jews, than to take their Flight in the Winter; for poſſibly they might eſcape in the Winter, but if taken by the Jews in their Flight on the Sabbath Day, there was then nothing to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them but Death, without Mercy: Therefore our Lord exhorted his Diſciples to pray to him that was able to cauſe them to eſcape thoſe two Dangers, upon their Flight which he exhorted them to take, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.20, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.16.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame <hi>Page</hi> he quotes <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.22, 23. and ſaith, <hi>New Teſtament Worſhip is here foretold in Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Phraſe,</hi> which I will not deny: But I ſay, <hi>from one New Moon to another meaſures the whole Month,</hi> and <hi>from one Sabbath to another meaſures the whole Week,</hi> and limits no time one more than another, and carries in it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Worſhip to God: for they that worſhip him in theſe Goſpel Times, muſt not think to worſhip him in New Moons and Sabbaths, as it was under the Law, which were only Shadows and Signs, but <hi>the body is of Chriſt,</hi> Ezek. 20.12, 20. Col. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

things were finiſhed, and was very good, as they came from the Hand of God: and this God's Sabbath, or Reſt from his Works of Creation, had no Evening or Morning aſcribed to it, becauſe it was his Eternal Reſt or Sabbath, all things being now finiſhed: And it could be no <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> for he had done no Work to <hi>reſt from,</hi> for he was the finiſhing Work, or laſt thing God created: So that God's finiſhing Work, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt becoming a living Creature, began at one and the ſame time: So that <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Creation, entred into God's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſo continued, till he by Sin brought Labour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> quotes this very Place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. as is to be ſeen <hi>Hob.</hi> 4.4. which ſpeaks only of God's own <hi>Rest</hi> from the Works of Creation, and we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Account in Scripture of any Sabbath commanded or kept from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes</hi> time; for God did not make that Covenant of the Ten Commandments till <hi>Moſes</hi> time, as appears <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.2, 3. and compared with the 15th Verſe, which gives the Reaſon of the 4th Commandment, why Iſrael was commanded to keep the Sabbath: For when God delivered the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Ten Commandments, he gave <hi>Moſes</hi> a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account about the Seventh Day Sabbath, how it was a Sign, as is to be ſeen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compared with the laſt Verſe. In the 13th Verſe ſaith the Lord, <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep, for it is a Sign between me and you.</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>It is a Sign between me and the Children of Iſrael.</hi> And a <hi>Sign</hi> is not the thing ſignified by it, no more than the <hi>Shadow</hi> of a thing is the <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 7. is quoted <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.28. <hi>The Son of Man is Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Sabbath:</hi> But he adds to what is there written for Chriſt did not there ſpeak as he was the Son of God, but Son of Man; for the Reaſon that Chriſt there renders to them how the Son of Man came to be Lord of the Sabbath, is, becauſe <hi>the Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath; therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath,</hi> for it was commanded to be kept for a <hi>Sign</hi> between God and Iſrael, ſo that it was made for Man to be a Sign to him, and therefore (ſaith he) <hi>the Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> He doth not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039751_0008_1015C0C9F5577CB0"/>
ſpeak here, as if he had any Power as he was the Son of Man to change it, for he <hi>as Son of Man,</hi> was <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> as much as any other Son of Man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. But what he ſaid, was to convict them of their Blindneſs, in preferring the Sanctification of the Sabbath before the ſatisfying the hungry Soul, whenas the Sabbath was made only for a Sign to Man. So that Chriſt's Argument was good, to prove that every Son of Man that it was made for, was Lord of it, it being made for him, to be a Sign to him: for the Lord of any thing is to be preferred before the thing made for him. The Man was not made for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Man is Lord of the Woman, ſo called in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.26. But this is no Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that a Man may change his Wife, becauſe he is her Lord.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 8. he quotes <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. which ſpeaks of the Antitype of the Weekly Seventh Day Sabbath, which it was a Sign of, as appears in the foregoing and following Verſes, <hi>There remaineth therefore a Reſt, or keeping a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to the People of God; for he that is entered into his Reſt</hi> (which is <hi>Christ) hath ceaſed from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to enter into that Reſt.</hi> This is the everlaſting Sabbath that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is entered into, and we are exhorted in this place, to labour to enter into it, which the Seventh Day was a Sign of; and this place relates nothing to any <hi>Firſt Day Sabbath,</hi> but to that <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 11. ſaith he, <hi>The Firſt Day was prophecied of,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 118.22, 23, 24. <hi>The Stone which the Builders refuſed, is become the Head Stone of the corner. This is the Lord</hi>'s <hi>doings, and it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the Day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> This was fulfilled in <hi>David,</hi> as he was a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and fulfilled in <hi>Christ,</hi> as he was the Antitype of <hi>David;</hi> and relates nothing to any rejoycing in a natural or artificial Day, but in God, who had brought <hi>David</hi> out of the Day of his Troubles, who was the Stone that <hi>Saul</hi> and the Builders of Iſrael had rejected, and ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039751_0009_1015C0CF75329760"/>
but now God had brought him to the Kingdom, and made him the Head of Iſrael: Even the Stone which the Builders refuſed, was now become the Head Stone of the Corner, and was the Day that <hi>David</hi> and his Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in the Lord, even the Day that the Lord had made him the Head Stone of the Corner, but his Joy was not in any one natural or artificial Day, but in the Lord, who had made it the Day of his Proſperity and Exaltation, the Day of his Adverſity <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing now over: It is a Scripture Phraſe, not intending any particular Day, but a Day or Time of Gladneſs. And was alſo fulfilled in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was a Man of <hi>Sorrows,</hi> &amp; rejected &amp; put to Death, but God raiſed him from the Dead, and hath exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name, ſo that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow, &amp;c. And this is the everlaſting Day of rejoycing with the Saints in God that hath made it, and not in a natural Day, either to obſerve the Day of his Birth, or the Day of his Reſurrection, when no ſuch thing is commanded of God, for that is worſhiping the Creature, and not the Creator.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall ſhew, that the Firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that both the Angel of God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf gave forth to his Apoſtles, was to make the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week (the Day of his Reſurrection) a Day of Labour, by travelling out of one Province into another, as appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.5. compared with the 10th and 7th Verſes, <hi>And the Angel anſwered and ſaid to the Women, go quickly and tell his Diſciples, that he is riſen from the Dead, and behold, he goeth before you into Gallilee, there ſhall ye ſee him. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, go tell my Brethren, that they go into Gallilee, there ſhall ye ſee me.</hi> And in the 8th Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And they departed quickly, and did run, to bring his Diſciples Word.</hi> Compare this with Luke 24, 10, 11. <hi>It was Mary Magdalen,</hi> &amp;c. which told theſe things to the Apoſtles, <hi>and their Words ſeemed to them as idle Tales, and they believed them not.</hi> Thus it appears, that had they believed them that was ſent by the Angel of God, and by <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, they ſhould have ſet out on their Journey early in the Morning for <hi>Gallilee,</hi> which was in another Province, and by all Probability, more than
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039751_0010_1015C0D11BE65968"/>
one Days Journey, as appears in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> which ſhews, that Chriſt's Parents went a Days Journey towards <hi>Gallilee</hi> before they miſt him; and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> not believing, &amp; thereby not obeying his order, he did not appear to them all that Day, but travelled with Two of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that were going from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Immaus,</hi> which is Sixty Furlongs, which contains Seven Engliſh Miles and Half, as appears, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.13. And it appears Verſe 28, 29. that he made as tho' he would have gone further, but they conſtrained him to abide with them, for it was towards Evening, and the Day was far ſpent, ſo he went in to tarry with them; but their Eyes were holden, that they knew him not, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. But as they were eating he gave them Bread, <hi>Verſe</hi> 30. And their Eyes were opened. Verſe 31. <hi>And he vaniſhed out of their ſight, and the ſame Hour they returned back</hi> the Seven Mile and half, and they went and told it to the Reſidue, <hi>neither believed they them,</hi> as appears, Mark 16.12, 13. It was after this, that Chriſt appeared to the Eleven, as appears in the 14th Verſe. So that it appears, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Day, otherwiſe than to make it a Day of Labour; but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that would not believe that he was riſen, were aſſembled together for fear of the Jews, as appears, Joh. 20.19, <hi>Then the ſame Day at Evening, being the first Day of the Week, when the Doors were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, Chriſt appeared to the Eleven;</hi> Mark. 16.14. <hi>As they ſat at Meat, and upbraided them with their Unbelief and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, becauſe they believed them not which had ſeen him after his Reſurrection.</hi> This is the <hi>firſt time</hi> that he appeared to them after his Reſurrection, and before this time they would not believe that he was riſen. Thus have they left it upon Record behind them, that through their Unbelief, they were diſobedient to the Meſſage that Chriſt ſent them, and did not make it a Day of Labour by travelling, as they were required by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God, and by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; which Journey, according to Hiſtory, was above Forty Mile, and the Meſſage was ſent to them in haſte, to ſet out upon this Journey, upon the <hi>First Day of the Week,</hi> the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039751_0011_1015C0D2A67B16E8"/>
for <hi>Gallilee,</hi> for this was the Place he had appointed to appear unto them, the Night before his Suffering, as appears, Mat. 26.32. <hi>But after I am riſen again, I will go before you into Gallilee.</hi> Compare this with Mat. 28.16. <hi>Then the Diſciples went away into Gallilee, where Jeſus had appointed,</hi> as before is expreſs'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.32. But ſome doubted, to wit, <hi>Thomas,</hi> as appears, Mat. 28.17. compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.26, <hi>&amp;c. And after eight days again, his Diſciples were within.</hi> This is the ſecond Time that Chriſt appeared to them, after his Reſurrection, which was in <hi>Gallilee.</hi> And in <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.1, &amp;c. compared with the 14th Verſe, ſheweth the third Time that Chriſt appeared to his Diſciples after his Reſurrection, as they were a fiſhing in <hi>Gallilee.</hi> His ſecond appearing to them after Eight Days of his firſt appearing, make it no more a Sabbath, than his third appearing to them (as they were a fiſhing) made that Day a Sabbath. His <hi>firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi> to them was in the Evening, which divided the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> from the <hi>Second Day</hi> of the Week, for the Evening and the Morning was the Second Day (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.8.) of the Week. So that his ſecond appearing, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his firſt appearing to them, was more than Nine Days after the firſt Day of the Week, and there can be no eighth Day in the Week.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 19. he quotes Rev. 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords Day,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> that is, I was ſpiritualized on the Lords Day of his Revelation, for that work he imployed me in, but here is no account what day or days it was of the Week, or Month, this God hath not revealed to us, Deut. 29.29. <hi>The ſecret things belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our Children for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> So that what is revealed in this Book of the Revelation, belong to us &amp; to our Children forever; &amp; <hi>John</hi> calls it the Lords Day, in reſpect that it was the Lord's Day of his Revelation: So the Bread &amp; Wine which he communicated unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, while he was at Supper, is called the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, tho' we have no Account that he did eat of the Bread, or drink of the Wine himſelf. But for any to aſſert it to be on a <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week is preſumption, ſeeing

no ſuch Name, in Scripture was impoſed on the <hi>First Day of the Week,</hi> in any other Place of the Scripture, nor ever in the holy Scripture honoured with any other Name than the other Five working Days of the Week.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 25. he quotes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. It is needful to expreſs this Collection in order, to open it by Scripture Teſtimony. The Reaſon of this Collection is to be ſeen, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. From hence it appears, that it was a Gathering or Collection for the poor Saints that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſent by the Hands of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> it being Alms for the poor Saints, as appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.17.

               </gap>. for <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to the Romans from <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos,</hi> as is to be ſeen in ſaid Epiſtle, at the end of it, and ſignifies in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.25, 26, 27. that then the Collection was come to be a Contribution. And it appears in this Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. that as <hi>Paul</hi> had given Order to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> ſo did he the like to this Church, as in the ſecond Verſe, <hi>Upon the firſt Day of the Week</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let every one of you lay by himſelf in Store</hi> (for ſo <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it) <hi>as God hath proſpered him.</hi> This I underſtand to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; as God had proſpered him the Week before, and now a new Week beginning even the firſt Day of it, and they now entring upon a new Weeks Work, ſhould conſider how God had proſpered them the Week paſt, and ſo upon this new Weeks beginning, every one of them in particular, ſhould lay by him, or by himſelf in Store, that there might be no Gatherings when <hi>Paul</hi> come, who was to receive it; for then every one that had laid it up in Store by himſelf, might bring it in by way of Contribution, into the Hands of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> who was to recive it, and ſee it tranſported to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, for the poor Saints in Judea. And the Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Alms, was ordered, and attended, according to Chriſt's Doctrine, <hi>Mat,</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not according to the Practice of Hypocrites, <hi>who give their Alms in the Synagogues,</hi> or publick Aſſemblies; but theſe were by an

Order, every one of them Weekly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>lay by himſelf in Store, as God had proſpered him;</hi> for the Words are plain, <hi>Let every one lay by himſelf in Store,</hi> according to Chriſt's Doctrine, ſo that <hi>their left hand might not know what their right hand did, that their Alms might be in ſecret,</hi> as ſaith Chriſt. Thus we ſee, here is nothing ſpoken of any Meeting or Aſſembly in this Place, but it makes to the contrary, and ſheweth it to be the <hi>first Day of the Week,</hi> or beginning of a new Week, and to think of this good Work upon the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of the Week, upon their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their own new Weeks Work, and that this good Deed might be their <hi>firſt Meditation</hi> upon the beginning of a new Week. And this Collection might be the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Corn, or other Proviſion, for it was that which was wanting, as is to be ſeen, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here is no Title put upon the Day, above the other Five work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Days neither <hi>Sabbath, Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day.</hi> nor any <hi>Aſſembly</hi> aſſerted to be upon it; ſo that all theſe Scriptures make ſtrongly <hi>againſt</hi> all his Arguments and Reaſoning for it to be any <hi>Sabbath</hi> or Aſſembly that was upon it, but to the contrary: But when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this <hi>Epistle to the Romans,</hi> he had then received it; for every one that had laid it up in Store by himſelf, brought it unto <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of Contribution, as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.25, 26.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 27. he quotes <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>And upon the first Day of the Week, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread, Paul preached to them,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter</hi> of Scripture, is Scripture, therefore I ſhall examine into this Place of Scripture, by other Scriptures. This Text tells us, the Diſciples coming together was to break Bread; it doth not ſay, to celebrate a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or give the Day any Name of Pre-eminence, above the other Five working Days of the Week; but <hi>upon the first Day of the Week, they came together to break Bread,</hi> which Word is a Scripture Phraſe, and frequently uſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eating, as for Inſtance, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.35. In this Verſe we ſee the word <hi>breaking of Bread</hi> is uſed in common Eating, Act, 2.46. <hi>Breaking Bread from Houſe to Houſe, did eat their Meat with Gladneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.30. Here Chriſt brake Bread to two of his Diſciples in common
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039751_0014_1015C0DBE52C9618"/>
Eating; and the word <hi>breaking of Bread</hi> is uſed, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> fed Five Thouſand Men, and the ſame word is uſed when he fed Four Thouſand Men. Thus we ſee, this Word <hi>breaking of Bread</hi> in Scripture is frequently uſed in common Eating, and there is no further Account given us in this Place, but <hi>coming together to break Bread.</hi> And we find by Scripture Teſtimony, that in them times, the Churches had <hi>Feasts of Charity,</hi> Jude 12. <hi>Theſe are Spots in your Feasts of Charity.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.13. <hi>Spots they are,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>while they feast with you.</hi> Luk. 5.29. Here we read, that <hi>Levy</hi> made <hi>Christ</hi> a great <hi>Feaſt</hi> in his Houſe, <hi>and there was a great Company,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ſat down with them.</hi> And in this place it is ſaid, <hi>they came together to break Bread,</hi> rendring no other Reaſon of their Meeting, and <hi>Paul</hi> was at this time tending on a Ship, as appears in the 6th, or foregoing Verſe. <hi>And we ſailed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and came unto them at Troas.</hi> This <hi>Troas</hi> was the Place of their Meeting to break Bread; and it was the Day before the Ship intended to ſail, as appears in the 13th Verſe, and in the 25th Verſe, we have an Account, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſignified to them, that it was the <hi>laſt time that ever they ſhould ſee his Face.</hi> Compare this Verſe with the Two laſt Verſes of this Chapter, which ſhews, how they fell on his Neck and kiſſed him, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing <hi>moſt of all for that they ſhould ſee his Face no more.</hi> Theſe Scripture Proofs, I produce to ſhew by all Probability, it was a Feaſt to welcome <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe that were with him; for their coming together is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd only to break Bread. Some have immagined it to be the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> but I ſhall give Scripture Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary; but if it were, it makes no Matter relating to a Sabbath, or holy Time. But as to the Lord's Supper, it was always attended at Supper-time: It was <hi>first inſtituted by Chriſt at Supper,</hi> as appears, Mat. 26.20. <hi>Now when the Evening was come he ſat down:</hi> Thus Three of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> teſtify. And <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Gentile Apoſtle,</hi> hath left it upon Record, that he did deliver it to the Gentiles, to be attended in the Night, as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. compared with the 25th Verſe, <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039751_0015_1015C0DEB50AB470"/>
the Lord Jeſus, the ſame Night in which he was betrayed took Bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when they had ſupped,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Churches attended the Time and Seaſon, tho' they got into a diſorderly Way of partaking of it, yet they attended the Seaſon, as appears in the 21ſt Verſe, <hi>For in eating, every one taketh before other his own Supper.</hi> This ſheweth they attended the Seaſon in the appointed Time; and made a Supper of it. God was very <hi>strict</hi> in requiring Iſrael to attend the Figure of <hi>Chriſt's offering himſelf,</hi> in its Seaſon, as appeareth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.2, 3. And tho' in ſome Caſes, they might alter the Mouth, but not the appointed Seaſon of the Evening, as appears in the 10th and 11th Verſes, and much more doth he require us to attend the Goſpel Ordinance, of <hi>Christ's offering up his Body for our Sins,</hi> in his appointed Seaſon; for in that very Night of the Paſſover, he inſtituted this Ordinance: And if it be ſaid of the Figure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.42. <hi>It is a Night to be much obſerved unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is a Night of the Lord, to be obſerved of all the Children of Iſrael, in their Generations,</hi> how much more then ſhould the Ordinance of <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover,</hi> who was Sacrificed for us, be attended in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Seaſon. Thus it appeareth, that they did not come together, to partake of the Lord's Supper, for that was commanded and attended always in the Evening: And Paul took the Opportunity of the Night following to preach to them, which ſheweth, the Day time was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in breaking of Bread, it being a <hi>Feaſt of Charity,</hi> and <hi>Paul continued his Speech till mid-night;</hi> and had not the young Man fell from the Third Loft, and been taken up dead, we know not how much longer his Sermon would have continued: So that we ſee, this coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to break Bread, on the <hi>first Day of the Week,</hi> was not for Preaching, for that was attended the Night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; nor for the Lord's Supper, for that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and attend, always in the Evening, after the Work of the Day was over. Thus it appears, that there could not be a plainer Scripture to diſprove the <hi>First Day,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either a Sabbath or Holy Time, ſeeing no Religious Thing was obſerved upon it, excepting only a <hi>Feaſt of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039751_0016_1015C0E061DAAFE0"/>

            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 37 ſaith he, <hi>Therefore the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment required to keep one Day in Seven holy to God.</hi> This is a groſs <hi>wresting of the Scripture,</hi> to miſlead People, for it required and limited the keeping of the Seventh Day, and commanded Work to be done on the other ſix Days. But what he aſſerts is to open a Door of Confuſion, in leaving it to every Man's Liberty, which Day of the ſeven he will keep for a <hi>Sabbath:</hi> ſo that one Man may ſay, I will chuſe the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of the ſeven, another, I will chuſe the <hi>ſecond</hi> of the ſeven to keep for a <hi>Sabbath, &amp;c.</hi> throughout the whole Week, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.39.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Page</hi> 52. ſaith he, <hi>Such Conſiderations as theſe, ſhould move and quicken us, very carefully, constantly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienſciouſly, to ſanctify the Sabbath, even to obey the fourth Commandment.</hi> Here he overthrows all that he hath been ſaying in his Book before, about his <hi>first Day Sabbath;</hi> for if we obey the fourth Commandment, we muſt work upon the <hi>first Day of the Week,</hi> it being one of the ſix working Days by it commanded to work upon; and we

muſt <hi>ſtrictly reſt from Labour</hi> on the ſeventh or laſt Day of the Week; for ſo that Commandment commands us. This puts me in mind of Chriſt's Words, Mat, 23.3. <hi>All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do, but do not ye after their Works, for they ſay and do not.</hi> If this Doctrine be good, what a miſerable Condition is <hi>New-England</hi> in, that prophanes this Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment with both Hands (if it ſtand good) in not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working upon the Day it forbids, but alſo <hi>reſting</hi> from Work upon one of the Six Days, of which it ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt labour.</hi> But the Fourth Commandment, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only a Sign to be obſerved, of the Saints <hi>everlaſting Sabbath,</hi> that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> will bring them unto, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12, 20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13, 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.17, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. And ſo was the ſeventh Year Sabbath, which was commanded, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.4. tho' it be not expreſs'd to be a Sign in ſo plain Words as the Seventh Day is: for as the <hi>first Adam,</hi> by his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, brought Labour upon us, ſo the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> will bring the Saints into an <hi>everlasting Reſt</hi> or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> when God ſhall have created and finiſhed the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the new Earth, and made it habitable for the Saints, then ſhall be fulfilled what is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, from hence forth, yea ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi>

            <p>SInce what is above written, a Pamphlet is come to my View. The Author is nameleſs: The Title of it is, <hi>Theſis concerning the Sabbath.</hi> Printed by <hi>Timothy Green</hi> in <hi>New-London.</hi> It contains Nine Articles by way of a general Argument or Poſition, built upon no Foundation of Scripture, being <hi>ſophistical Sophiſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Argument is, <hi>Jeſus Christ is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> If he thus ſaith intentially from any Place of Scripture, I conceive it muſt be from what is written, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.28. <hi>Therefore the Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> This was ſpoken of the Seventh Day Weekly Sabbath, and is anſwered before in this Book,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039751_0018_1015C0E7CB42D3E8"/>
               <hi>Page</hi> 6, 7. But it is needful to examine into this Place of Scripture, and ſee in what reſpect the Son of Man is to be underſtood <hi>Lord of the Sabbath.</hi> It is to be ſeen in the 24th Verſe, how the <hi>Phariſees</hi> blamed <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, for doing that which was unlawful on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as they judged: And in the 25th and 26th Verſes, Chriſt ſignifies to them, what <hi>David</hi> did when he had need, and was an hungred, as his Diſciples were at that time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.1. And in the 27th he ſets before them, how that the <hi>Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath:</hi> So that upon this reaſon they muſt confeſs that the Son of Man is Lord of it, according to Chriſt's Words. This was to convict them of their blind and ignorant Zeal, in preferring the Sanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath before the ſatisfying the hungry Soul, <hi>ſeeing the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> Seeing it was made for him, he muſt needs be Lord of it; ſo that the reaſon he here renders to them, is to convince them, how the Son of Man comes to be Lord of the Sabbath, to wit, becauſe it was made for him, ſo that the ſatisfying of his Hunger was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before the Sanctificaiion of the Sabbath: And his Argument is good on the behalf of every Son of Man, for whom it was made for; for he himſelf, as Son of Man, <hi>was made of a Woman, and made under the Law,</hi> as much as any other Son of Man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and had no more Power to alter or change it, than any other Son of Man for whom it was made: And I can find no other Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath inſtituted in the holy Scriptures, or any other Weekly Day commanded, called or kept for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath throughout the Bible. The Acts of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was written many Years after Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, and calls no other Day the Sabbath, but the ſeventh Day of the Week, and ſhews that it was the Day that <hi>Paul</hi> preached and reaſoned upon, both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> every Sabbath Day, as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. comparing the 4th Verſe with the 11th Verſe, <hi>And he reaſoned in the Synagogue every Sabbath, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Jews and the Greeks. And he continued there a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039751_0019_1015C0E95C86FE68"/>
Year and ſix Months, teaching the Word of God among them.</hi> Acts 13. comparing the 42d Verſe with the 44th, <hi>And when the Jews were gone out of the Synagogue, he Gentiles be ſought that theſe Words might be preached to them the next Sabbath, and the next Sabbath Day came almoſt the whole City together to hear the Word of God.</hi> We have here no account that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Gentiles, come to Morrow, for to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the firſt Day of the Week, is the Chriſtian Sabbath. But this Seventh Day Sabbath which was made for Man, to be a Sign to him, as appears, Exod. 31.13. Ezek. 20. 12. compared with Deut. 5.15. was aboliſhed, as appears, Col. 2.16, 17. and not changed; for <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> God bleſſed for evermore, did not give Signs &amp; Shadows under the Law to be changed, but to be <hi>fulfilled by Chriſt</hi> under the Goſpel, by bringing in the Subſtance they ſhadowed out.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, <hi>That Day of each Week, which it is the Will of Christ, ſhould be the Sabbath Day, ought to be obſerved as ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, No Day of each Week, ſince the aboliſhing of the Seventh, is revealed to be the Will of Chriſt to be kept for a Sabbath, and therefore no Day to be obſerved as ſuch, but to the contrary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10, 11. So that here is no Foundation to the Theſis, concerning the pretended Weekly Sabbath, and therefore the Theſis muſt fall, having no Foundation to ſtand upon.</p>

            <p>Second Counſel, <hi>That you be determined by this Rule in the whole of Religion.

            </p>
            <p>Upon this Conſideration, I requeſt this Favour of you, ſo that we may venture in with you in keeping of it, by a Commandment from God, if you know of any, for this will be more for your Honour than to compell us againſt our own Conſciences, and (your own Counſels) by your own Law, accompanied with your Whips, Stocks, Fines and Impriſonments, which hitherto you have been uſing to compel us to offer in Divine Worſhip, that which God hath not commanded; and beſides this, we are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (I do not ſay you) to pretend to be <hi>orthodox Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to reſolve our Faith into Education, Inſtruction, and the Perſwaſion of others, ſeeing you ſay in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Page</hi> 6.
