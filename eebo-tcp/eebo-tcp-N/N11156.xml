            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE INTEREST OF THE MERCHANTS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE conteſt between Great-Britain and her Colonies, being now arrived at a height that calls for ſome ſpeedy deciſion, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt having been repreſented as only a diſpute between the adminiſtration and the colonies, the following ſhort ſtate of the caſe is ſubmitted to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every candid Engliſhman; from which it will appear, how far the merchants and traders in the country are intereſted in it, and on which ſide they ought to wiſh the deciſion to fall.</p>
            <p>It is admitted on the part of Great-Britain, that the Colonies are part of the dominions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

In all foreign countries, they have the ſame protection with the King's Engliſh ſubjects, and enjoy the ſame advantages of treaties and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances. Their perſons and properties are equally protected by the laws of England, and they may, equally with the natives of Great Britain, become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, by purchaſe or inheritance, of any lands within the iſland of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>The poſſeſſions of the Crown in America are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely extenſive, and the iſland of Great Britain, compared with them, appears very inconſiderable. No art or power can enlarge Great Britain, but their is abundant ſcope in America for making additions, ſtill more extenſive, to what the Crown already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes there.</p>
            <p>This moſt important difference in the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the two territories requires a different plan of policy to be adopted in reſpect to the culture and improvement of each. But ſtill the perſonal rights of the inhabitants ought to continue the ſame; And the proſperity and happineſs of the ſubjects in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ought to be equally attended to, and promoted by government, as that of the ſubjects in England, for they are equally the King's ſubjects and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen.</p>
            <p>The lands in America have been granted by the Crown on very cheap terms to the occupiers; and where a country is ſo very extenſive, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants few, the lands muſt continue cheap for many ages, in compariſon of the price of lands in Great Britain.—Should then the occupier of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can lands cultivate the ſame products as are cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Great Britain, and have equal liberty to carry them to the ſame market, they muſt preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014129_0004_0F9301A31AF970F8"/>the commerce and culture of Great Britain, by ſelling at a leſs price.—Now nothing could argue greater folly and wickedneſs, in any government, than the ſuffering the people of the ancient dominions to be deſtroyed, for the ſake of raiſing a new Empire, and new ſubjects, in another part of the world.— Wiſdom, juſtice and policy, therefore, required that the means to be uſed, to forward the proſperity of the new dominions, ſhould be ſuch as not to injure the old; and that, where all parts cannot have the ſame advantages, compenſation ſhould be made, for what is with held in one way, by the grant of ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or advantages in another.</p>
            <p>The right to the ſoil of America is allowed to have been in the Crown of England, antecedent to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of any Engliſh ſubjects there; for the firſt, and all future adventurers carried with them grants from the Crown, of the lands on which they ſettled; and all the lands in the Colonies are at this day held by their occupiers, under titles derived from the Crown. The Crown had, therefore, a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe conditions to thoſe who obtained thoſe grants; and the grantees were bound, in law and equity, to a performance of thoſe conditions. Moreover, the adventurers in this new country ſtood in need of the aſſiſtance and ſuccour of their fellow ſubjects in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. They were unable to ſubſiſt, much leſs to protect themſelves. The bounty, the confidence, and humanity of individuals in England were freely exerciſed towards them; and the power of the ſtate, raiſed and maintained at the ſole expence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England, was fully exerted in their behalf. The people of England have, therefore, a right to reap advantage from the ſucceſs of the adventurers.</p>
            <p>Under theſe two titles, of a right to the ſoil in the Crown, and a right to compenſation in the people of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014129_0005_0F9301A3D94037D8"/>England, let us view the conduct of the Legiſlature (which comprehends both) towards the Colonies. In reſpect to the perſons of the natives of the Colonies, no diſtinction or difference has ever been made. There is not a ſingle Act of Parliament, from the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Colonies to this day which makes a diſtinction between a man born in England and a man born in America. The original equality has been inviolably adhered to. The ſame law and rights are for a native of America in England, as for an Engliſhman. And an Engliſhman is, in America, ſubject to the ſame law, and claims no others than a native there.</p>
            <p>The moſt violent partizan of the Colonies can here then have no ground of complaint; for neither the Crown or the people of England have here made any claim, or ſought compenſation.</p>
            <p>The lands of America, and their products, have alone been the objects upon which they have made any demands, and whether they have aſſerted their claims in an arbitrary, cruel, and unjuſt manner, as the Colonies ſay they have, we ſhall ſoon ſee.</p>
            <p>The people of England and the American adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers being ſo differently circumſtanced, it required no great ſagacity to diſcover that, as there were many commodities which. America could ſupply on better terms than they could be raiſed in England, ſo muſt it be much more for the Colonies advantage to take others from England, than attempt to make them themſelves. The American lands were cheap, covered with woods, and abounded with native commodities. The firſt attention of the ſettlers was neceſſarily engaged in cutting down the timber, and clearing the ground for culture; for before they had ſupplied themſelves with proviſions, and had hands to ſpare from agriculture, it was impoſſible they could
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014129_0006_0F9301A49EA0D200"/>ſet about manufacturing. England, therefore, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to ſupply them with manufactures, and either purchaſed herſelf, or found markets for the timber the Coloniſts cut down upon their lands, or the fiſh they caught upon their coaſts. It was ſoon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the tobacco plant was a native of, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in Virginia. It had been alſo planted in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and was found to delight in the ſoil. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, however, wiſely and equitably conſidering that England had variety of products, and Virginia had no other to buy her neceſſeries with, paſſed an act prohibiting the people of England from planting tobacco, and thereby giving the monopoly of that plant to the Colonies. As the inhabitants increaſed, and the lands became more cultivated, further and new advantages were thrown in the way of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Colonies. All foreign markets, as well as Great Britain, were open for their timber and proviſions, and the Britiſh Weſt India Iſlands were prohibited from purchaſing thoſe commodities from any other than them. And ſince England has found itſelf in danger of wanting a ſupply of timber, and it has been judged neceſſary to confine the export from America to Great Britain and Ireland, full and ample indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity has been given to the Colonies for the loſs of a choice of markets in Europe, by very large bounties paid out of the revenue of Great Britain, upon the importation of American timber. And as a further encouragement and reward to them for clearing their lands, bounties are given upon the tar and pitch, which are made from their decayed and uſeleſs trees; and the very aſhes of their lops and branches, are made of value by the late bounty on American pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes. The ſoil and climate of the Northern Colonies having been found well adapted to the culture of flax and hemp, bounties equal to half the firſt coſt of thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014129_0007_0F9301A567BD4378"/>commodities have been granted by Parliament, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able out of the Britiſh revenue, upon their importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Great Britain. The growth of rice in the Southern Colonies has been greatly encouraged, by prohibiting the importation of that grain into the Britiſh dominions from other parts, and allowing it to be tranſported from the Colonies to the foreign territories in America, and even the ſouthern parts of Europe. Indigo has been nurtured in thoſe Colonies by great parliamentary bounties, which have been long paid upon the importation into Great Britain; and of late are allowed to remain, even when it is carried out again to foreign markets. Silk and wine have alſo been objects of parliamentary munificence; and will one day probably become conſiderable Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican products under that encouragement.</p>
            <p>In which of theſe inſtances, it may be demanded, has the Legiſlature ſhewn itſelf partial to the people of England and unjuſt to the Colonies? Or wherein have the Colonies been injured? We hear much of the reſtraints under which the trade of the Colonies is laid by Acts of Parliament, for the advantage of Great Britain, but the reſtraints under which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Great Britain are laid by Acts of Parliament for the advantage of the Colonies, are carefully kept out of ſight; and yet upon a compariſon, the one will be found full as grievous as the other. For, is it a greater hardſhip on the Colonies, to be confined in ſome inſtances to the markets of Great Britain for the ſale of their commodities, than it is on the people of Great Britain to be obliged to buy thoſe commodities from them only? If the Iſland Colonies are obliged to give the people of Great Britain the pre-emption of their ſugar and coffee, is it not a greater hardſhip on the people of Great Britain to be reſtrained from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing ſugar and coffee from other countries, where
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014129_0008_0F9301A623938F28"/>they could get thoſe commodities much cheaper than the Colonies make them pay for them? Could not our manufacturers have indigo much better and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from France and Spain than from Carolina? and yet is there not a duty impoſed by Acts of Parliament on French and Spaniſh indigo, that it may come to our manufacturers at a dearer rate than Carolina indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, tho' a bounty is alſo given out of <hi>the money</hi> of the people of England to the Carolina Planter, to enable him to ſell his indigo upon a <hi>par</hi> with the French and Spaniſh? But the inſtance which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been taken notice of, the Act which prohibits the culture of the tobacco plant in Great Britain or Ireland, is ſtill more in point, and a more ſtriking proof of the juſtice and impartiality of the ſupreme Legiſlature; for what reſtraints, let me aſk, are the Colonies laid under, which bear ſo ſtrong marks of hardſhip, as the prohibiting the farmers in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ireland from raiſing, upon their own lands, a product which is become almoſt a neceſſary of life to them and their families? And this moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſtraint is laid upon them, for their avowed and ſole purpoſe of giving Virginia and Maryland a monopoly of that commodity, and obliging the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Great Britain and Ireland to buy all the tobacco they conſume from them, at the prices they think ſit to ſell it for. The annals of no country that ever planted Colonies, can produce ſuch an inſtance as this of regard and kindneſs to their Colonies, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon the inhabitants of the Mother Country for their advantage. Nor is there any reſtraint laid upon the inhabitants of the Colonies in return, which carries with it ſo great appearance of hardſhip, altho' the people of Great Britain and Ireland have, from their regard and affection to the Colonies, ſubmitted to it without a murmer for near a century.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014129_0009_0F9301A6DDD93470"/>
It is true the Legiſlature, in this as well as in other inſtances, has had a view to divert the Coloniſts from manufacturing; but has not that object been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by means the moſt generous and juſt? Ought the Coloniſts to complain that they are <hi>diverted</hi> from working up their flax or hemp, by getting a better price for it rough, than they could hope to obtain by manufacturing it? Or is it blamable in the Legiſlature to excite them to the culture of commodities which yield a better profit from their cheap lands, than they could have by employing their labor in manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? But why do they not manufacture? They are not hindered from making any commodity they might think fit for their own uſe, or erecting any machine for the purpoſe except mills for ſlitting iron. The only reaſon is, that they find it more their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to cultivate their lands, and attend the fiſhery, than to manufacture. Their intereſt it is alone which reſtrains them, and ſuch is the wiſdom, the equity, the bounty of that government, they are ſo impatient of, as to employ no other means to <hi>divert</hi> them from manufactures, than by giving them greater profits for their labour in other things. This is a point which cannot be too much inculcated, for it ought to be univerſally known and conſidered, eſpecially by the trading part of this kingdom. I therefore repeat it, that the only means employed by the Legiſlature, for diverting the Colonies from manufacturing, is the giving them better prices for their labour in other things: and the Colonies well know this to be the caſe, and they conduct themſelves according to that knowledge; for in every inſtance where they think they can employ their labour profitably in manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they do it. This the people of England do not know, but they ought to be made acquainted with it. They imagine the inhabitants in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014129_0010_0F9301A7AD85E288"/>are prohibited from making any thing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, much more from trading in their own manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures: whereas the fact is, they are prohibited from making no one thing for their own uſe, or from exporting any one of their own manufactures; except hats, wool, and woollen goods. And they do make many things, and export ſeveral manufactures, to the excluſion of Engliſh manufactures of the ſame kinds. The New England people import from the foreign and the Britiſh Iſlands, very large quantities of cotton, which they ſpin and work up with linen yarn into a ſtuff, like that made in Mancheſter, with which they clothe themſelves and their neighbours. Hats are manufactured in Carolina, Pennſylvania, and in other Colonies. Soap and candles, and all kinds of wood-work, are made in the Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and exported to the Southern. Coaches cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, chaiſes, and chairs, are alſo made in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Colonies, and ſent down to the Sourthern. Coach-harneſs, and many other kinds of leather manufactures, are likewiſe made in the Nothern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and ſent down to the Southern; and large quantities of ſhoes have lately been exported from thence to the Weſt India iſlands. Linens are made to a great amount in Pennſylvania; and cordage and other hemp manufactures are carried on in many places with great ſucceſs: and foundery ware, axes, and other iron tools and utenſils, are alſo become ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of commerce, with which the Southern Colonies are ſupplied from the Northern. Thus while the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature is paying the money of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in bounties to one part of the American ſubjects, another is employed in rivalling the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in ſeveral of their moſt valuable manufactures.</p>
            <p>Thus far, at leaſt, the conduct of Great Britain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Colonies cannot juſtly be taxed with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014129_0011_0F9301A88720E7C8"/>nor the comparative ſituation of America deemed unequal and diſadvantageous: But we are told by the advocates for American claims, that the profit of all their labors centers here, and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of America are condemned to work for the people of England; let us therefore examine the truth of theſe two propoſitions.—If it be true that the inhabitants of America are condemned to work for the people of England, is it not equally true that the people of England are condemned to work for the people of the Colonies? Nay, not for their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects there only, but for the ſlaves of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects! If a planter in Virginia raiſes tobacca for the Engliſh merchant, does not the Engliſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer make him clothing for himſelf and his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in return; and wherein can the one be ſaid to work for the other's advantage, more than the other does for his? Do any of the Colonies ſend their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts to England for nothing, or do they take any thing from England in payment which they do not want? Does England fix prices upon their products, and ſay, You ſhall ſell them to us for ſo much; or does ſhe inſiſt upon their buying her commodities at higher prices than her own natives pay, or than ſhe ſells them for to other countries? Nothing of all this is pretended to be the caſe; then pray in what ſenſe is it that the people of the Colonies can be ſaid to work for the people of England, other than that in which the people of England work for them? The threſher may be ſaid, it is true, to work for the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; but does not the miller work alſo for the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? But the profit of all the labour of the Colonies centers in England. If this be true, the conſequence will plainly ſhew it; for no ſtate or ſociety of men was ever known to thrive by unprofitable labour. Whence then ariſes the preſent wealth and greatneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014129_0012_0F9301AC4614E668"/>of America, (of which we hear ſo much upon other occaſions) if England has reaped the fruit of all the labour of the Colonies? The ſettlers, we all know, did not carry great riches with them, and whence could they have acquired them, but from the profits of their labour? But the trade of England, ſay they, has been greatly augmented by the Colonies. It is by no means clear that the ſame increaſe would not have happened if the Colonies had never exiſted; for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had many avenues open for her commercial indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. But without purſuing that conſideration, from what ſource did the Colonies derive the ability, and the means of trading with England? Who paid for the axe and the ſaw with which they cut down the tree, and made it into boards, to cover their huts at their firſt landing? or through whoſe credit have they ſince built towns, improved their farms, and erected for themſelves ſtately houſes? Is it not to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh merchants they are indebted for all their opulence? We ſee a recent inſtance of this in the Ceded Iſlands; whilſt the Engliſh merchants gave them credit the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures were making large ſtrides to wealth and grandeur. The value of lands was every day raiſing, plantations were ſettling, and towns ſpringing out of the woods; but the inſtant that credit was with-held, the bubble burſt, and the airy ſcene vaniſhed like a dream; diſtreſs and calamity ſucceeded to opulence and parade, and the higheſt eſtimated lands can no longer find purchaſers at any price: now, had the Engliſh merchants continued to give credit, and make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for theſe adventurers, their is no doubt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would at length have ſucceeded; they would have raiſed products, and, by induſtry and good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, acquired fortunes. What then ſhould we have thought of them, or what ought we to have thought of them, if, when they came to make remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to the Engliſh merchants, they ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014129_0013_0F9301AE513D6808"/>that it was hard they ſhould be condemned to work for the people of England; that England reaped all the fruits of their labour and induſtry, and that it was the higheſt cruelty and injuſtice to oblige them to ſend their products to England, that the Engliſh merchants might gain a commiſſion on the ſale of them?</p>
            <p>The Northern Colonies, it is true, have not had ſuch ample credit with the Engliſh merchants as the Iſlands, but the circumſtances under which the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in both made their ſettlements, are not ſo diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as to render what has been ſtated reſpecting the one, inapplicable to the other. The great amount of their debt to the Engliſh merchants, is a full proof that it was upon the ſtock of the people of England they have hitherto ſubſiſted.</p>
            <p>The merchants in the Colonies, no more than the planters in the continent, are wealthy men. They buy their goods in England, upon nine months cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at leaſt; the planter is ſupplied by them, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year, upon the credit of his crop as the end of it. The planter has his houſe to build, or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make, or new land to clear and take in, all which requires ready money, and therefore, when his firſt crop comes, he muſt ſell it for caſh, and cannot pay the merchant any thing towards the reduction of his debt that year. The acquiſition of the next year's crop requires a freſh advance; hence the planter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes indebted to the merchant for two year's ſupply before he makes him any payment; and as it very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens that at the end of the ſecond year he pays the expence of one, he goes on increaſing his debt, but at the ſame time increaſing his eſtate in a much greater proportion; and all this time the Engliſh merchant, who ſupports the whole, is without any returns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:014129_0014_0F9301AE9123FC38"/>
Thus it is that England reaps the advantage of all the toil and labor of the Colonies. She pays for the purchaſe of the land, for the labor employed in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, for the maintaining the ſtock neceſſary for its cultivation; her return is a commiſſion upon the ſale of the produce, with a moderate intereſt, not very well paid, upon the capital advanced, while all the benefit of the increaſed value belongs ſolely to the Americans.</p>
            <p>The truth of what has been advanced will be ſtill more evident from a compariſon of the ſtate of the Colonies of other nations with our own. We have ſeen the ſlow progreſs the French made in Canada the many years they had it; and the large ſtrides it is making to wealth and importance ſince it became a Britiſh colony. Grenada too has flouriſhed in a ſtill greater degree, and the ſame cauſe has wrought the happy change in the circumſtances of both, which is no other than the ſuperior credit given to the planters by the Engliſh merchants, to what they had from the French merchants. Now if we inquire into the cauſe of this unbounded confidence and credit given by the Engliſh merchants to the Colonies, from which the Colonies have reaped ſo great advantage, it will come out to be <hi>the ſecurity which they have for the property by the operation of the laws of England in the Colonies;</hi> they give no ſuch credit to the ſubjects of other ſtates, either in Europe or America; and yet there are countries in which they might lay out their money to greater profits than in the Britiſh Colonies; but in foreign countries they cannot be certain of a legal ſecurity for their property, or a fair and effectual means of recovering it; whereas in the Britiſh Colonies they know the laws of England follow their property, and ſecures it for them in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014129_0015_0F9301AFB8F0FEF0"/>ſecurity, and there is an end of their confidence, and conſequently an effectual check to the proſperity of the Colonies. And indeed good reaſon it ſhould be ſo, for their is no want of evidence to ſhew how willing the Colonies are to avail themſelves of Acts of their own Aſſemblies to injure their Britiſh credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; witneſs the attempts in Jamaica and Virginia to make the lands and negroes freehold, and not liable to the payment of book debts; ſo that a Planter might buy lands and negroes on Engliſh credit, and leave them to his children, without paying a ſhilling to the Engliſh merchant, with whoſe money he bought them; and witneſs alſo a late Act of the Aſſembly of Grenada, poſtponing the payments due to their Engliſh creditors for eighteen months. Theſe and ſuch like practices in the Colonies gave occaſion to the act of Parliament the 5th of George the Second, for ſubjecting lands and negroes in the Colonies to the payment of Engliſh book debts, which may truly be called the Palladium of Colony credit, and the Engliſh merchant's grand ſecurity; and yet this Act of Parliament is one of thoſe which are now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the Colonies, and the Britiſh merchants are modeſtly deſired to apply to Parliament for its repeal, and thus ruin their trade and fortunes with their own hands <note n="*" place="bottom">The following petition of ſeveral merchants of London to the King in the year 1732, and the report of the Lords of Trade there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, will ſhew the neceſſity of the interference of Parliament in the Britiſh merchant's behalf, and the great ground there was for paſſing the Act of that year, for the merchant's ſecurity, which the Colonies now want to ſet aſide.

            <p>I acquit them of any intention of ſeparating from Great Britain; for I believe them too wiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the advantages of being treated as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen in Great Britain and throughout the world; of enjoying the protection of her fleet and armies equally with the people of England; and at the ſame time, neither contributing revenue to their ſupport, or dealing with her for any thing which they can buy cheaper, or ſell dearer elſewhere. They would no doubt like to continue to have the monopoly of ſupplying the Britiſh Weſt India Iſlands with lumber and proviſions; to have the monopoly of ſupplying Great Britain and Ireland with tobacco; to receive large bounties upon other of their products out of the revenue of England; to have the advantage of fiſhing on the Engliſh fiſhing banks of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and in the gulph and river of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Colony of Quebec, provided they continued to pay no revenue, were ſubject to no reſtraints upon their trade, but might carry their commodities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought fit, import all ſorts of goods from all countries, and lay out their money wherever they found they could buy cheapeſt.

They plainly tell the Britiſh merchants, <q>Gentlemen, we have now made fortunes out of your capital, and we find that the people in England pay ſuch heavy taxes for the payment of the intereſt of a debt, which they contracted in our defence; and for the maintenance of a military force, of which we enjoy the protection; that ſome of their manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures come higher charged to us, than we can get the like for from Holland or France: we alſo find, that from the ſame cauſe they cannot afford to give as high prices for ſome of our commodities, as we can ſell them for in other countries. Now there are certain Acts of Parliament, which oblige us to come to you for what we want; and to carry to you many of our commodities in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we deſire therefore that you will aſſiſt us in our endeavours to ſet aſide the authority of theſe laws, that we may trade where we will; and come no more to you but when we cannot do ſo well elſewhere. There is another thing too which we want you join to us in; we are prevented by an Act of Parliament from entailing our eſtates to the prejudice of our Engliſh creditors; we now owe them about four millions, and it this Act was out of our way, we could make all our families rich at once, by purchaſing lands, and building houſes, with this money, and ſettling them upon children, inſtead of paying our Engliſh creditors: but as we are afraid the Parliament might perceive our drift, in applying for repeals of theſe laws, or if they even repealed them <hi>now,</hi> they might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after re-enact them; or others of a like nature, which would defeat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

This reſolution is no other than to deny the authority of the Legiſlature to make any Acts whatever to bind us. In this our grand purpoſe, we hope you will do all you can by petitioning, inſtructing, and remonſtrating in our behalf; for if you do not join us in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelves, we tell you once for all, that we will neither buy goods of you, nor pay you for thoſe we have already bought, for we are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to carry our point by one means or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I appeal to the underſtandings of my countrymen whether this is an exaggerated repreſentation of the Colony claims, as ſet forth and ſtated in their ſeveral pamphlets, and the Reſolutions of their public Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. And I think I need not uſe any further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince the merchants and manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Great Britain, how fatal to their intereſts the ſucceſs of the Colonies in their deſigns muſt be. The continuance of their trade to the Colonies, clearly and entirely depends upon the laws of England having authority there. It is their operation which binds the commerce of the Colonies to this country. It is their operation which gives ſecurity to the property of the trader ſent thither. Give up the authority of Parliament and there is an end to your trade, and a total loſs of your property. But if that authority is ſupported and maintained, the trade of the Colonies muſt remain to Great Britain, and the property you intruſt them with will remain ſecure, protected by acts of Parliament made in your behalf.</p>
