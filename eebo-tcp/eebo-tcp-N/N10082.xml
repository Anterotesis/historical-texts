            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE holineſs is, by the confeſſion of all, the ſum of all moral excellence, and the higheſt and moſt neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; it is of the laſt importance that we ſhould well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it's nature, and diſtinguiſh it from all counterfeits. This will help us to underſtand the bible; to form right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the divine perfections, and diſtinguiſh true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from that which is falſe. Wrong conceptions of the diſtinguiſhing nature of holineſs lead to all kinds of deluſion in religion. And, on the other hand, juſt &amp; clear apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this are the beſt preſervative from fatal miſtakes; and have the happieſt tendency to remove the difference and oppoſition in ſentiments, and the ſad diviſions, ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong profeſſing Chriſtians: And to bring them to 'ſpeak the ſame thing, and be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.'</p>
            <p>The more I have attended to the religious controverſies of this day, among us, the more have I been convinced that our different ſentiments chiefly originate, either from too great inattention to the nature of holineſs, or very different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about it: And that the real queſtion is, <hi>What is God's moral character?</hi> What is conformity to it? What oppoſes it? Were we agreed in this, moſt of theſe diſputes would ſubſide. In this view, they are far from being tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, and deſerving that neglect and contempt, with which many affect to treat them. But appear intereſting, important, and worthy the attention of all.</p>
            <p>I humbly conceive there has been too little attention to the nature of holineſs, among divines in general; and that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and intelligible definition of it is not eaſily to be found in bodies of divinity, or elſewhere. And moſt of thoſe who think it a very eaſy matter to tell what holineſs is, and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012811_0004_0F8AC0054AFD0CA0"/>
that we are all agreed in this, have been contented with a ſet of words, which expreſs no diſtinct ideas; but leave the thing wholly in the dark. They will perhaps ſay, <hi>God's holineſs is his purity.</hi> If it is aſked, in what does this <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> conſiſt? The common anſwer is, <hi>in that which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to all ſin, the greateſt impurity.</hi> We have now got what, I think, is the moſt common definition of holineſs. But who is the wiſer? This does not help us to any idea of this <hi>purity,</hi> unleſs we know what ſin is. But this cannot be known, ſo long as we know not what holineſs is: For we do not learn what holineſs is, by <hi>firſt</hi> obtaining the idea of ſin; but we muſt firſt know what holineſs, or, which is the ſame, what the divine law is, in order to the knowledge of ſin.</p>
            <p>Some have attempted to tell what holineſs is, by ſaying, <hi>It is not properly a diſtinct attribute of God; but the beauty and glory of all God's moral perfections.</hi> But we get no idea by theſe words, till we are told <hi>what is this beauty and glory.</hi> To ſay, <hi>it is holineſs,</hi> is ſaying nothing, or that which is no better.</p>
            <p>Under a conviction of this too general inattention to the nature of holineſs—the great defect in the moſt common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of it—the importance of diſtinct and clear ideas of it—that the controverſies before us turn chiefly upon this and will be decided the ſhorteſt and beſt way, by determining what holineſs is; I preſent to the public the following <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry;</hi> hoping it may give ſome light on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and aſſiſt ſuch as are willing to inquire into the nature of holineſs, as deſcribed in divine revelation: And in the light of this, help them to find on which ſide the truth lies, in the preſent controverſies.</p>
            <p>In this, however, I don't pretend to be an original. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>EDWARDS,</hi> in his diſſertation on the nature of true virtue, has given the ſame account of holineſs for ſubſtance, though under a different name, which the reader will find in the following inquiry. All I can pretend to, as an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, is to have explained ſome things more fully than he did; and more particularly ſtated the oppoſition of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012811_0005_0F8AC0060ACBF638"/>
to ſelf-love; and ſhewn that this repreſentation of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is agreeable to the ſcripture: And to have anſwered ſome objections he has not mentioned, and made a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
            <p>As Mr. Hart had publiſhed objections againſt Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's account of the nature of true virtue, it ſeemed neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they ſhould be conſidered and obviated. This I have done in an appendix, that what puts on the air of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy might be by itſelf, and at the ſame time have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the foregoing inquiry.</p>
            <p>As Mr. Mather had publiſhed ſomething reſpecting ſelf-love, &amp;c. which appeared very contrary to the nature of holineſs; and on this ground objected to Mr. Edwards's ac-account of a holy taſte, and to ſome things wrote by me; ſome brief remarks on him are ſubjoined, to detect the fallacy of his ſcheme, and ſhew that his objections are groundleſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Some remarks were alſo intended on what Mr. Dickinſon has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in ſupport of the affirmative of the following queſtions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I.</hi> Whether blindneſs of mind, is the primary cauſe of all wickedneſs, that there is in the hearts and lives of men?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>II.</hi> Whether the work of regeneration, is wrought in the ſouls of men, by the ſupernatural influences of the holy ſpirit, operating with the goſpel, whereby they are enlightened, and enables to know and love the truth as it is in Jeſus?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>But as, on further conſideration, it appeared probable that few would admit the extraordinary things he aſſerts in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port theſe propoſitions, viz That our firſt parents, while perfectly holy, admitted the moſt blaſphem us thought of God, and really believed them to be juſt, which we ſinners can hardly mention without horror, and that there was no ſin in all this. P. <hi>12.</hi>— That the angels before they ſinned, &amp; while they were perfectly fautleſs were blind, <hi>through their own fault,</hi> by ſome means of other.' P. <hi>14</hi> — That faith in Chriſt is the great duty that is commanded in the goſpel, and the firſt act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:' And yet muſt take place before there is any change of heart, as the cauſe of all obedience.—And ſince he does not attempt to confute any thing I have ſaid in ſupport of the contrary; and all he ſays is really ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated in the inquiry and appendix: I have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the remarks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to make room for an anſwer to Mr. Hemmenway, which ſeemed of much more importance.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>When Mr. Hemmenway's vindication made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſeveral reaſons, the principal of which is mentioned in the introduction, induced me to anſwer him in an appendix: Whence the book exceeds the ſize at firſt propoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012811_0006_0F8AC006C955B1B8"/>However diſagreeable theſe diſputes are in themſelves, and offenſive to many, I have the ſatisfaction to think they have already been of great advantage to truth; and the pleaſure of believing they will yet be more ſo, if protracted. When in this ſenſe, <hi>many run to and fro, knowledge will be increaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are thoſe, I know, who, in their own apprehenſions, dwell in ſuperior light, looking down with pity, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and contempt, upon thoſe concerned in theſe diſputes, as doing much miſchief—contending in the dark about they know not what—diſputing about words, &amp;c. And are too wiſe ſo much as to read any of theſe controverſial wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, being poſſeſſed of the happy talent of determining all theſe matters without any of this trouble, or much thought. We are willing ſuch ſhould know we do not envy their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior knowledge and wiſdom; and think they would not give leſs evidence of them, were they willing to be at the pains of <hi>hearing the matter,</hi> before they <hi>anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The author wiſhes that peace, truth, and <hi>HOLINESS,</hi> may be promoted by theſe efforts: And that they may, in ſome meaſure, conduce to bring on the happy aera, when 'the knowledge of the glory of the Lord ſhall fill the earth, as the waters cover the ſea': And 'there ſhall be upon the bells of the horſes, <hi>HOLINESS UNTO</hi> the LORD.'</p>
            <p>May every reader remember, that whatever are his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and which ſide ſoever of the diſputed queſtions he takes; yet <hi>without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD. And let him who reads, and is in any meaſure enlightened, and ſtrengthened in the way of holineſs, by what is now offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his peruſal, bleſs God, and give all the glory to <hi>HIM.</hi>

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> SOME general, introductory obſervations concerning the <hi>nature of true holineſs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. HOLINESS is, in all reſpects, perfectly conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with right reaſon, and agreeable to its dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates: Or reaſon, properly exerciſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, will in all caſes, and without fail, determine holineſs to be what it really is. However viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the taſte may be, and the heart diſreliſh, hate and oppoſe true holineſs, the ſame perſon's reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may pronounce it to be holineſs. Though the reaſon of man is liable to be blinded and prejudiced, by the vicious taſte and reigning luſts of his heart, and often is ſo to an amazing degree; yet it is not always and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſo blinded; but may, and often does, dictate the truth in this matter; and always does, when reaſon is properly exerciſed. Hence men of corrupt minds, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to holineſs in heart and practice, may reaſon well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nature of holineſs, and be able to prove what it conſiſts in, by inconteſtible arguments. Hence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012811_0010_0F8AC009CE06AAF0"/>
of <hi>reaſoning</hi> on this ſubject. And we may be ſure that ſo far as we reaſon right, and find what reaſon dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, we have found the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Holineſs is that in which the higheſt enjoyment or happineſs conſiſts; and is really the greateſt good in the univerſe. It, in a ſenſe and degree, puts us in poſſeſſion of all good. That therefore which gives true enjoyment, and tends to the higheſt, perfect, univerſal good of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent beings, is true holineſs; and nothing elſe can be worthy of that name.</p>
               <p>It is true, that holineſs may be the occaſion of miſery; and a perfectly holy being may not be perfectly happy, in certain peculiar circumſtances. As the imperfect holineſs of the ſaints in this life, is the occaſion of pain and diſtreſs of mind, which no unholy perſon can have: And Chriſt, in the human nature, though perfectly holy, was ſubject to great pain and ſufferings. But this is not properly owing to any thing in the nature and tendency of holineſs, but the peculiar circumſtances which attend it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe exerciſes of mind which give a being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoyment his nature is capable of, and put him in poſſeſſion of all poſſible good, and at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the greateſt happineſs of the whole, is true holineſs. And thoſe exerciſes which have not this nature, but the contrary, are oppoſed to holineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Holineſs is the higheſt poſſible excellence in the univerſe. It is that in which the higheſt and moſt perfect beauty, and all real worth do ſummarily conſiſt. 'Tis in ſuch a ſenſe and degree the excellence and perfection of intelligent beings, that without it they have no real excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor any true worth; but they are, in themſelves, odious, deſpicable, and worſe than nothing. The more they have of natural capacity, powers and endowments, if they have no holineſs, the further they are from all real excellence, and the more hateful; becauſe they, not being holy, are of courſe more oppoſed to holineſs, or have more of that which is moral evil, than beings of leſs natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities could have.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:012811_0011_0F8AC00A86BEA388"/>If holineſs could be baniſhed from the univerſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as comprehending Creator and creatures, and ſhould actually ceaſe, there would be no real excellence or worth in univerſal exiſtence: But it would be in truth infinitely worſe than univerſal nothing. Holineſs is the beauty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, brightneſs, glory and perfection of God, by whatever name it is called. And this is true of all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent creatures. Therefore, if we can find what true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beauty, worth or excellence is, it will determine what is holineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Holineſs is that by which intelligent beings are united together, in the higheſt, moſt perfect and beautiful union. It conſiſts in that harmony of affection, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, by which the intelligent ſyſtem becomes ONE, ſo far as holineſs prevails; which fixes every being, by his own inclination and choice, in his proper place, ſo as in the beſt manner to promote the good of the whole.— There is no moral beauty or happineſs among intelligent beings, without harmony and union of heart. All ſin is oppoſed to this; it ſets intelligences in oppoſition to each other, and ſpreads the moſt diſagreeable, unhappy diſcord. But holineſs unites them; it conſiſts in the higheſt and moſt excellent kind of union in nature. It is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and perfect bond, by which intelligent beings are, by their own voluntary exertions, united and cemented to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the ſtrongeſt and moſt happy manner. If we can, with any degree of certainty then, determine what affection of heart that is, which thus unites intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we may be equally certain that we have found the object of our inquiry, viz. true holineſs.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Holineſs is eſſentially, in nature and kind, the ſame thing in all beings that are capable of it. Holineſs in God is not different, in nature and kind, from the holineſs of creatures. God's holineſs differs from the holineſs of creatures in degree, and in circumſtances, or in mode and form, agreeable to the infinite degree of his exiſtence, and the different manner and circumſtances in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012811_0012_0F8AC00CB2B02E58"/>
but is of the ſame nature, and ſo eſſentially the ſame thing, in both. We have the greateſt certainty of this, in that holineſs in the creature is, in ſcripture, called the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and that by which they partake of the divine nature; and is repreſented to be the holy ſpirit of God, or God's holineſs, dwelling and acting in them; by which God dwells in them, and they dwell in God.</p>
               <p>Holineſs in different creatures may alſo differ in ſome circumſtances, and in the particular form and manner of its exerciſes, owing to their very different ſtate, relations and circumſtances. Thus, the holineſs of creatures, who never have ſinned, is, in ſome reſpects, as to the form and manner of its excerciſes, different from the holineſs of thoſe who have ſinned, and being redeemed by Chriſt, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to holineſs. And in this lies the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is called legal holineſs, and evangelical holineſs; the former being the holineſs of angels, and of man before he ſinned; the latter is the holineſs of thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from among men. This difference might eaſily be pointed out; but this will not be attempted here, as we are inquiring into the general nature of true holineſs. This, I ſay, is the ſame in all creatures; and therefore has but one and the ſame rule, the law of God, and conſiſts in conformity to that.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we can find what is the nature of divine holineſs, we may be certain that we have found what is the holineſs of creatures; and ſo <hi>vice verſa.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be kept in mind, as what may be of uſe in our inquiry.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. True holineſs is in its own nature one ſimple, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded thing. It is not made up of different and various kinds of exerciſes, properties and ingredients, which may exiſt diſtinct and ſeparate, or in any degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of each other, and being put together make one compound: But, in oppoſition to this, is perfectly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and uncompounded.</p>
               <p>This is moſt certainly true of the divine holineſs. And
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012811_0013_0F8AC00CD83F4E50"/>
if holineſs in creatures is of the ſame nature and kind, being a participation of the divine nature, and conſiſts in the ſpirit of God imparted to the ſoul, &amp; dwelling in it, which is the ſcriptural repreſentation of the matter, as has been obſerved; then this muſt be true of creature holineſs.</p>
               <p>Holineſs is in ſcripture called life: It is indeed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt perfect kind of life. Now life is one ſimple thing: It is not compounded of different things, and made up of various parts, which differ in nature and kind, and do not imply &amp; involve the whole. This may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome illuſtration, perhaps, from animal life. This, as it appears in exerciſes towards different objects, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circumſtances, and by different ſenſes, ſight, taſte, hearing, &amp;c. is called by different names; but it is the ſame ſimple, uncompounded thing in its nature, and in all its exerciſes: It is the ſame animal life, in whatever form or name it appears. Every property and motion, is the motion and property of this ſame life, and implies the whole. So holineſs, though it has obtained different names, as it is exerciſed in different circumſtances, and towards different objects, is the ſame moſt ſimple, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſpiritual life. This remark may be of uſe in the inquiry we are entering upon. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">It has been ſaid, that
<q>virtue is a complex thing: It does not primarily conſiſt in one ſingle diſpoſition, tendency or affection of mind, all other affections riſing out of that as their root; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes various affections, equally original and eſſential to virtue.</q>
But not the leaſt probable evidence of this aſſertion has been offered, or even attempted, ſo far as I have obſerved. See Mr. <hi>Hart</hi>'s remarks on preſident Edwards, p. 40, 41.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. The nature and diſtinguiſhing properties of true holineſs are ſo clearly deſcribed in the holy ſcriptures, that nothing is needed but to underſtand the moſt important truths revealed there, in order to know what true holineſs is, as diſtinguiſhed from all counterfeits. It is one chief end of divine revelation to make known and aſcertain the diſtinguiſhing nature of true holineſs. The great end of divine revelation is to make known the true God to man, and manifeſt his glory; eſpecially to reveal his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012811_0014_0F8AC00DBA93C5F8"/>
which is his glory. And this is the ſame with his holineſs; for this is all the moral perfection in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe. And ſo far as the bible reveals the duty and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man, which is doubtleſs done with all poſſible clearneſs, and in the wiſeſt and beſt manner, juſt ſo far is the nature of true holineſs revealed; for in this both the duty and happineſs of man conſiſt. Therefore he only underſtands his bible, who has learned what is true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And he who is ignorant of the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this, is blind to the moſt leading, important things contained in divine revelation. He knows not God; he is ignorant of the divine law, and the goſpel; of Jeſus Chriſt, and his own true intereſt. The bible is indeed a ſealed book to him, and he is in darkneſs even until now. But he who has a true idea of holineſs, knoweth him who is holy in all his works: He underſtands the goſpel, and walketh in the light. This at once ſhews how important the inquiry is which we are entering upon; and the great help we may expect from the bible, in determining this queſtion; and conſequently, the reaſonableneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of attending conſtantly to that, in all our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations, being kept in view, will greatly help us in our inquiry into the nature of true holineſs, and ſerve as land-marks to direct us. If reaſon, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly improved will direct us to it—If it is that alone in which true happineſs conſiſts, and which tends to the greateſt general good—If it is the higheſt, the ſupreme beauty and excellence; that in which all the real worth of intelligences conſiſts, and without which the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, moral world would be infinitely worſe than nothing— If it unites intelligent beings together, in the moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, happy manner and degree; and is the only bond of ſuch union—If it is, in its nature, one ſimple thing; ſo that if we can find what is any one thing which comes into the nature of holineſs; or any thing which is properly a branch of holineſs, we have found, in that, every thing eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012811_0015_0F8AC00FBB751D78"/>
—If holineſs is the ſame in nature and kind, in whatever being it is found—If one chief deſign of divine revelation is to teach us what holineſs is, and it is from the beginning to the end of the bible held up to view in the moſt clear and intelligible manner, in the beſt way to give us a true idea of it, as it ſtands diſtinguiſhed from every thing elſe; ſo that he who runs may read it <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Iſaiah xxxv. 8.</note>—If all this is true, then ſurely nothing can be more certainly, and with greater caſe determined, than the queſtion before us; as we may be ſure, on the one hand, that whatſoever does not agree to all theſe, is not true holineſs, however it may ſeem to agree to ſome: And on the other hand, that which is found to bear all theſe marks, has the divine ſtamp, and may be ſafely fixed upon, without any further reſearches.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Wherein it is ſhewed that holineſs conſiſts in LOVE.</head>
               <p>THE law of God is the ſtandard of all moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or holineſs. Holineſs conſiſts in conformity to this, and in nothing elſe: Therefore the knowlege of the precepts of the moral law, decides the queſtion before us; for whatever the holy law of God requires is holineſs, and nothing elſe can deſerve the name. Our divine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has, in his great wiſdom and goodneſs, given us a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the divine law, in the following words:
<q>Thou ſhalt LOVE the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind. This is the firſt and great commandment. And the ſecond is like unto it. Thou ſhalt LOVE thy neighbour as thyſelf. Upon theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</q>
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Matt. xxii. 37, 38, 39, 40.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012811_0016_0F8AC00FDFB5A148"/>Here all obedience to the law of God is reduced to one thing, LOVE; love to God and our neighbour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ourſelves; this is the whole that is required. Therefore this is the whole of true holineſs; it conſiſts in this love, and in nothing elſe. When Chriſt ſays, 'on theſe two commandments <hi>hang</hi> all the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,' he muſt be underſtood to aſſert, that the whole of the law and the prophets, all that is required in them, is <hi>love.</hi> All depends upon this; ſo that if love is removed, all that is required is removed; the law &amp; the prophets come to nothing, and fall to the ground. Take love away, and there is nothing left that is required in the whole of divine revelation. If love was not the whole that the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, it could not be ſaid to be wholly <hi>ſuſpended</hi> on this, ſo as utterly to fall, if love is excluded: For the law would ſtill exiſt, as there would be yet ſomething com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>But if there could be any doubt about the meaning of theſe words of our ſaviour, St. Paul has explained them, when he ſays, 'LOVE is the fulfilling of the law; for <hi>all</hi> the law is fulfilled in <hi>one word,</hi> even in this; thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.' If <hi>all</hi> the law is fulfilled in love, then this is all that the law requires; for the law is not fulfilled, unleſs the whole is given which it requires. Therefore love is the whole of that obedience which the law requires. Perfect, ſupreme love to God, and that love to our neighbour which is implied in it, i. e. loving him as ourſelves: This LOVE expreſſed in all proper ways, which is implied in its being perfect, is the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law; this is true holineſs. Therefore the love of God, and keeping his commandments is ſpoken of as one thing: 'For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.' <note n="(b)" place="bottom">1 Joh. v. 3.</note> This could not be, if there was any obedience or holineſs, which is not love; or there was any command which required any thing leſs or more than love.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 10. Gal. v. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012811_0017_0F8AC01091F50BC0"/>Thus far then we go on ſure ground, and have the greateſt certainty that holineſs conſiſts in LOVE. And all the difficulty in the queſtion before us is in determining what is meant by love; what is the nature and kind of that love which the law requireth. This will be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attended to in the following ſection.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> Wherein it is inquired what that love is, in which all true holineſs conſiſteth.</head>
               <p>THOUGH 'tis certain from the holy ſcriptures that all true holineſs conſiſts in love; yet all love is not holineſs. If it were, then all men would be holy, and have a great degree of holineſs; for we all exerciſe much love, even in all our volitions and conduct. But it is ſo far from being true, that all kinds of love, and love to all objects is holineſs, that there is a ſinful love often ſpoken of in ſcripture. Such is the love of them that hate the Lord; <note n="(a)" place="bottom">2 Chron. xix. 2.</note> The love of the world; <note n="(b)" place="bottom">1 Joh. ii. 15.</note> and love of our own ſelves. <note n="(c)" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 2.</note> There is a kind of love therefore which is in its nature contrary to holineſs. Of this the world has been full in all ages. It is neceſſary therefore that we ſhould carefully inquire into the nature and kind of holy love, in order to find the true and proper diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and difference between that, and the love in which there is no holineſs.</p>
               <p>Love has been uſually diſtinguiſhed into love of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence or good will; love of complacence or delight; love of eſteem—and love of gratitude. The love of benevolence is good-will to beings capable of good or happineſs, and conſiſts in deſiring and purſuing their good, or rejoicing in their poſſeſſing it. By benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012811_0018_0F8AC016B34D6470"/>
is, I ſuppoſe, moſt commonly meant, that good-will which is exerciſed towards other beings, in diſtinction from ſelf-love: But good will is as really implied in ſelf-love, as in the love of others; for they who love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, exerciſe good will towards themſelves.</p>
               <p>Complacence is that affection of the mind in which we are pleaſed with any object. There is what may be called complacence in benevolence itſelf, even in all the exerciſes of it; being neceſſarily implied in it. Good-will to any being, ſuppoſes a taſte for good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; that we have ſome good in view, with which we are pleaſed. If any one wiſhes well to himſelf only, this is taking delight in ſome good, <hi>as his own.</hi> And wiſhing well to others, implies a taſte and reliſh for the good of others, <hi>as theirs,</hi> and a delight in it, when they are ſeen poſſeſſed of it.</p>
               <p>But by the love of complacence, when diſtinguiſhed from benevolence, is, I think, generally meant, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight we take in the perſon and character of an intelligent being, as beautiful and excellent. In this ſenſe the word will be uſed in this diſcourſe. And, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence being underſtood in this ſenſe, it may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that benevolence and complacence have not always the ſame object. We may exerciſe good will to a perſon whoſe whole character is very diſagreeable and diſpleaſing to us; ſo that he may, at the ſame time, be the object of our benevolence and of our diſplicence and averſion; becauſe, though capable of happineſs, his preſent charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is diſagreeable and hateful.</p>
               <p>The love of eſteem is nothing diſtinct from benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and complacence, exerciſed towards a worthy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent object, at leaſt in our apprehenſion. The love of gratitude is that affection which we exerciſe towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſidered as a benefactor, for his good will exerciſed towards ourſelves, or others. This includes in it both benevolence and complacence, and is nothing diſtinct from this, as might be eaſily ſhewn, was there need of it;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012811_0019_0F8AC018C834FB90"/>
and will perhaps be mere particularly attended to in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>Having obſerved theſe things concerning love in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it now remains to be ſaid, what that love is in which holineſs conſiſteth. This is love to God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, including ourſelves; and is univerſal benevolence, or friendly affection to all intelligent beings. This uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, with all that affection or love which is included in it, and inſeparable from it, is the holy love which God's law requires, and is the whole of true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This love is diſtinguiſhed from all other kinds of love, both in its nature, and object. The object is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Univerſal being, including God and all intelligent creatures. Benevolence, or univerſal goodneſs, has for its object all beings which exiſt, capable of good, or that can be, in any ſenſe and degree, objects of good will. Any kind of good will, or any thing which has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of benevolence, which is limited to particular objects, and will not extend to all towards which good will can be exerciſed, is not <hi>univerſal</hi> benevolence; but is eſſentially different from it, and quite of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That good will, which will extend only to a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed number, or a certain kind or circle of beings, by the ſuppoſition, is not univerſal good will: It falls, as it were, infinitely ſhort of it, in this reſpect, and is ſo far from uniting its ſubject to univerſal exiſtence, that it is circumſcribed by very narrow bounds, and is conſiſtent with ill will and oppoſition to general exiſtence; yea, it is in fact in its own nature ſuch: For it ſets up an infinitely ſmall part of exiſtence, compared with the whole, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards it above the whole; which has the nature of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly diſregard, and real oppoſition to the whole. It hence appears to be ſo far from true univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that it is of an oppoſite nature; as it does <hi>from its nature</hi> oppoſe it. Beſides, it is certain that ſuch limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good will has nothing of the nature of univerſal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but it is ſomething <hi>in its own nature</hi> which thus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012811_0020_0F8AC0198BAE3048"/>
it to a ſmall part of being, in oppoſition to being in general, as there can be no other reaſon of this limitation, but the nature of the affection itſelf: Which could not be, if it was not <hi>in nature</hi> different from univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and contrary to it. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. Edwards has ſet this in a clear light, in his diſſertation concerning the nature of true virtue, p. 129, 130, 131.</p>
                     <p>And this view of the matter ſhews us in what ſenſe univerſal exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the <hi>primary</hi> object of holy benevolence. This is the firſt and moſt eſſential thing in it, in which lies its diſtinction from all love which is not holy. This is the leading, governing thing in it, as that in which its peculiar diſhinguiſhing nature conſiſts. He who exerciſes true benevolence towards any particular being, does it as a friend to the whole; ſo that his love to him is really love to being in general, as he belongs to the whole, and is included in it.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>But holy love unites the heart to univerſal exiſtence, ſo far as it comes into view, and is the moſt cordial friendſhip to all without exception; and wiſhes and ſeeks the good of every individual, ſo far as this is conſiſtent with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of being in general; except thoſe who are known implacable enemies to general exiſtence. And theſe are neceſſarily oppoſed by this univerſal benevolence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another object of univerſal benevolence is <hi>the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of the whole.</hi> As ſoon and as far as the eyes of the benevolent perſon are opened to ſee what is the true good of intelligent beings, and higheſt happineſs of the univerſe, this good becomes the object of his wiſhes. And as holineſs itſelf is this true and higheſt good, even holy love and benevolence, by which intelligences are united together in the moſt beautiful, happy manner, every one to his utmoſt conſpiring to promote the greateſt general good, and enjoying this good: I ſay, as this is the higheſt good, it becomes the object of his delight, and of his wiſhes; ſo that this is the object of his benevolence, and of his complacence at the ſame time. And in this alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love is diſtinguiſhed from every other kind of love, as that has not holineſs for its object in any ſenſe or degree, but is conſiſtent with the utmoſt averſion to it. And this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012811_0021_0F8AC01A4EF8A058"/>
holy love differs from all other kinds of love in its <hi>nature,</hi> as well as object. The nature of it may be determined by its object. That affection whoſe object not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in nature and kind from the object of other love, but is oppoſite to it, muſt itſelf be of a different and oppoſite nature. But the particular nature of this love will be more fully explained hereafter.</p>
               <p>This univerſal benevolence, or love to being in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, muſt have God, who is infinitely the greateſt and moſt excellent, and the ſum of all being and perfection, for its object, and is exerciſed towards him, in loving him with all the heart, with all the ſoul, with all the mind, and with all the ſtrength. This is, I think, well expreſſed by Mr. EDWARDS, in the following words:
<q>The mind being under the ſovran dominion of <hi>love to God,</hi> does, above all things, ſeek the glory of God, and make this his ſupreme, governing, and ultimate end; conſiſting in the expreſſion of God's perfections in their proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and in the communications of the infinite fulneſs of God to the creature; in the creature's higheſt eſteem of God, love to God, and joy in God, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exerciſes and expreſſions of theſe.—And as far as ſuch a mind exerciſes benevolence to created beings, it chiefly ſeeks the good of the creature, conſiſting in its knowlege or view of God's glory and beauty, its union with God, conformity and love to him, and joy in him. And that temper or diſpoſition of heart, that conſent, union, or propenſity of mind to being in general, which appears chiefly in ſuch exerciſes, is real holineſs. And no other affection but this is of the nature of true virtue.</q>
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Nature of true virtue, p. 133.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be proper here more particularly to ſhew, that all holy affection conſiſts in this benevolence or goodneſs; and that it can conſiſt in nothing but this, and what is implied in it. This will be evident, if the two following propoſitions can be ſupported.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012811_0022_0F8AC01B10BEC610"/>1. Univerſal benevolence does imply love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and all holy love. He who exerciſes univerſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence does eſteem and take complacency in all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their worth and excellence: For not to do ſo is unkind and injurious, and therefore contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of benevolence. And benevolent affection, from the neceſſity of its nature, is pleaſed with this ſame affection in others. Every one muſt be pleaſed with friendſhip to thoſe to whom he himſelf is a friend; for not to be ſo, would be a contradiction.</p>
               <p>Benevolent, kind affection neceſſarily implies alſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to benefactors for kindneſs exerciſed; for this is nothing elſe but being properly affected with the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of others, which has juſt been ſhewn to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of benevolence. Beſides, not to exerciſe gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the benevolent and kind, is itſelf unkind; and therefore contrary to the nature of benevolence. A man muſt be ſtripped of all true benevolence, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude gratitude: Where the former is, the latter is found to an equal degree.—Thus evident is it, that all holy love is implied in univerſal benevolence; ſo that he who has this, certainly has the whole. To ſuppoſe a perſon truly benevolent, &amp; not to exerciſe holy love of eſteem, compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence &amp; gratitude, in all ſuitable ways, &amp; towards all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects, is a moſt glaring contradiction, and to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a character which never did, nor can exiſt,</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the contrary, where there is no holy love of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, there can be no holy love of any kind. Since benevolence neceſſarily includes all holy love, in its very nature; where this is not, there is not, there cannot be, any holy love.</p>
               <p>The love of gratitude ſuppoſes benevolence, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an exerciſe of this. Gratitude is certainly an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of benevolence, which never takes place in a mind deſtitute of it. And what is gratitude but an exerciſe of friendly affection towards the benevolent? So certain is it that where there is no good will, there is no true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012811_0023_0F8AC01BCB49A218"/>
This is ſo evident at firſt thought, that 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to enlarge.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall be more particular in producing evidence that there can be no holy love of complacence, where there is no benevolence. Holy complacence is the love of holineſs for holineſs ſake; or the approbation of a holy character, for its intrinſic beauty and excellence. That there can be no holy complacence, independent of benevolence, is evident from the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p>The mind cannot have any holy complacence in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal goodneſs, while itſelf is wholly deſtitute of it. The mind which is wholly devoid of kind affection, has no true, ſenſible idea of benevolence, and conſequently can have no delight in it. Delight or complacence is a <hi>ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the mind, which cannot be exerciſed towards that object of which it has no true ſenſe; but the mind which has no benevolence, has no ſenſation of it; for ſuch a ſenſation implies benevolence; and therefore can have no complacence in it. As the love of holineſs, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of holineſs; ſo the love of holy benevolence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the exerciſe of benevolence. Therefore he who hath no benevolence, hath no complacence in it.—But that affection of the mind which is not the love of <hi>all</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in whatever it may conſiſt, is not a true holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence; but ſomething of a different nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no holy complacence in holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exerciſe of benevolence: Conſequently where there is no benevolence, there is no holy exerciſe of mind.</p>
               <p>But this will be more evident, if poſſible, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of complacence, as exerciſed towards God. It will appear, on due conſideration, that the perſon who has no univerſal benevolence, does not heartily approve of the benevolence of God; and therefore does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God's holineſs or moral character, ſo far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in benevolence.—But he who is not a friend to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benevolence of God, is certainly not a friend to holineſs in general, and ſo has no complacency in any true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012811_0024_0F8AC01C901BDEF0"/>
Yea, he who has no benevolence in his heart, is an enemy to benevolence: For the heart of man is in no ſuch inſtance indifferent, neither friendly, nor oppoſed to any thing in God's moral character; is never in ſuch a ſtate, as neither to approve nor diſapprove. Therefore ſuch an one is an enemy to univerſal benevolence in God: Whence it follows that he has no true love to God's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character. For he who is diſpleaſed with any thing in the moral character of God, is certainly diſpleaſed with the whole, as the holineſs of God is not inconſiſtent with itſelf; but is one moſt ſimple thing.</p>
               <p>The holineſs of God, which is expreſſed in his law, and in the goſpel (for the ſame character and the ſame holineſs is expreſſed in both) conſiſts, in a great meaſure at leaſt, in ſuch ſupreme regard to himſelf, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs and glory of his kingdom, that he holds every one who oppoſes him and his kingdom, or has the leaſt diſreſpect, or even indifference towards him and his glory, juſtly expoſed to eternal damnation; and is diſpoſed to inflict it on all ſuch who cannot be delivered from it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his own higheſt honor, and the greateſt good of the whole.</p>
               <p>Now, it is in the nature of things impoſſible, that he who has no regard to God and his glory, and no univerſal good-will, ſhould in the leaſt approve of ſuch a character. Yea, he muſt be at enmity with it, as there is no medium. He who is not for it, is againſt it. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The mind thus eſtranged from univerſal good will, is 'The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, which is enmity againſt God." Rom. viii. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This will appear ſtill more glaring, by obſerving, what will be more particularly conſidered hereafter, that the holy love of God, which is moſt celebrated in the divine oracles, as worthy of our love and imitation, is the love of benevolence, which God exerciſes and manifeſts towards fallen man, who has become his enemy. This is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a love, not of complacence, but of benevolence, as all love to enemies muſt be. Now he who has not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012811_0025_0F8AC01D486D0B20"/>
which diſpoſes him to love his enemies, will not be pleaſed with this love of God; but diſpleaſed. He who has no love to his enemies, but cheriſhes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary affection, will not be pleaſed with that good will which is equally extended to his enemies, and to himſelf; but ſuch love muſt be the object of his averſion.</p>
               <p>Thus evident is it, that they who have no benevolence, do not approve of God's holineſs or moral character, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his word; ſince univerſal benevolence muſt be the object, not of their delight, but of their averſion: And conſequently, that the holy love of complacence cannot exiſt independent of benevolence; which was the point to be proved. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. Hart ſays, men are drawn to God 'by his giving them to feel in themſelves his attracting love and virtue, and paternal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and propenſity of heart towards them; by a realizing belief of which, their hearts are put in motion towards him, that all true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and virtuous love begins thus.' That this being 'perceived, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized, and felt, as extended to them, is the true cauſe, ground and ſource of the firſt exiſtence of ſuch a thing in them as a truly virtuous propenſity of heart to him,' (remarks on preſident Edwards, p. 23, 24.)</p>
                     <p>Upon this it may be obſerved, that the love of God, which Mr. Hart here ſpeaks of, is the love of benevolence, God's paternal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.' It is the love of benevolence, not only as it is love to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but as it is love and grace, in and through Jeſus Chriſt; in which God is repreſented in the moſt clear and ſtriking light, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a regard to himſelf and the general good (which is nothing but univerſal benevolence) that he will not ſhew any favour to ſinners, unleſs his glory and the general good be effectually ſecured by Chriſt the mediator. And he who ſees not God's grace and love to men in this light, knows not what is the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenſe of this love of God, in which their hearts are drawn to him, is itſelf of the nature of benevolence, and the exerciſe of it: For, as has been ſhewn, it is impoſſible that be who has no holy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, ſhould heartily approve of ſuch benevolence, and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it. Therefore, according to Mr. H. the firſt exerciſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in men cannot be an exerciſe of love, in which there is no benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but this muſt be the very eſſence of the firſt holy act, in which the ſoul is attracted to God, as the fountain and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of benevolence, or univerſal goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>If Mr. H. will ſhew how a ſinner, while wholly deſtitute of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and wholly inclined to contrary exerciſes, can feel the attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence of God's benevolence; and take complacence in his univerſal goodneſs; and, under this attracting influence, return to God, and become his true friend, without any good-will to God, or any other being: We will then grant that univerſal benevolence is not neceſſarily implied in the <hi>firſt,</hi> nor in any ſubſequent motion of the ſinner's heart towards God, and his neighbour.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that when ſinners have a realizing belief of God's 'paternal benevolence and propenſity of heart towards them,' they do not conſider it as univerſal benevolence; but only as love <hi>to themſelves</hi> in particular, and that this attracts their hearts to God, while yet they have no approbation of general benevolence, or the leaſt apprehenſion of it:—Upon this I would obſerve, that this may be Mr. H.'s meaning, and he may expreſs himſelf thus, through inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the true notion of general benevolence, as many doubtleſs have done. But if the matter is viewed in this light, there is nothing of the nature of holineſs in the attraction of their hearts to God, meerly becauſe they think he loves them. As they may exerciſe this love without any benevolence, ſo they may, and muſt do it, without the leaſt degree of holineſs. It has been ſhewn that this is not a true fight and belief of the love of God; and it will appear, I hope, in the ſequel, that this has nothing of the nature of holineſs; but is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the reigning power of every luſt. I ſhall <hi>here</hi> only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the moſt expreſs deciſion of our ſaviour himſelf. 'If ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? For ſinners love thoſe that love them.' (Luk. vi. 32.) Men may be eaſily converted upon this plan, without having new hearts given them, or any change of heart for the better. They want this light only, i. e. a belief that God loves them (which is not light indeed, but deluſion) and they will love him, in this view, and on this ground only, without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to love their enemies, and conſiſtent with their continuing to hate the holineſs of God.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION IV.</hi> Wherein ſelf-love is ſhewn to be no part of that love in which holineſs conſiſts; but of a nature quite different and oppoſite.</head>
               <p>SELF-LOVE has been repreſented by many, not only as a branch of holineſs; but that in which it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically conſiſts, making it the ſpring of all our actions. Some have thought it not only no part of holineſs, but oppoſed to it. Others have taken a medium between theſe two, &amp; repreſented ſelf-love to be in its nature inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and good; but not holy love, unleſs love to God and our neighbour be joined with it, to regulate and govern it.—In order to determine which of theſe opinions is right, we muſt underſtand what is intended by ſelf-love. By this very different things are meant by different, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the ſame perſons. There are three things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, often called by that name, and their not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, has occaſioned great confuſion and error in treating this ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> A general appetite to good, and averſion to evil, conſidered meerly as ſuch, or a perception of pain or pleaſure, is called ſelf love. This is eſſential to all moral agents, being implied in every act of will. If nothing was good or evil to us, we could have no choice or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of will, more than a tree or rock; for by the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhould be perfectly indifferent to every thing We could neither love nor hate, chooſe nor refuſe. This general appetite is therefore common to all moral agents, holy and ſinful, and is eſſential to every act, both of ſin and holineſs. It is properly a natural capacity; as much ſo as the faculty of underſtanding, or power of will; and is the very ſame thing, indeed, with the latter, or at leaſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012811_0028_0F8AC01F8919E908"/>
implied in it. It is therefore, in itſelf, neither ſinful nor holy; but a foundation or capacity for either. Should this ceaſe in angels and devils, they would no longer be holy or ſinful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> By ſelf-love is ſometimes meant <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> or thoſe exerciſes in which a perſon loves himſelf only, which wholly confine him to his own perſonal intereſt; he taking no pleaſure in any thing elſe, but placing all his good and happineſs here. This is moſt properly called ſelf-love; as it is a man's love of his own ſelf <hi>as ſelf,</hi> and of nothing elſe; and therefore is oppoſed to the love of others, or univerſal benevolence. This is wholly an intereſted, ſelfiſh affection, by which a perſon ſets up himſelf as ſupreme, and the only object of regard; and nothing is good or lovely in his view, unleſs it coincide with his ſelfiſhneſs, and be ſuited to promote his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt: All other beings are by him ſubordinated to himſelf, and loved for his own ſake only; and ſo far as they oppoſe, or do not ſerve this contracted, partial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in which he places all his good and happineſs, are either hated, or totally diſregarded.—In a word, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and language of his heart is,
<q>There is nothing in the whole univerſe of any worth to me, but my own ſelf; if I may be happy, it is enough.</q>
There is no need of any laboured proof to ſhew that ſuch exerciſes of heart are, in their nature, oppoſition to univerſal good-will: This appears at firſt view. Therefore, if the latter has any thing of the nature of holineſs, the former muſt ſtand directly oppoſed to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> By ſelf-love may be underſtood the love a perſon has for himſelf as part of the whole, which is implied in univerſal benevolence. He who loves the whole, loves every part of the whole; therefore muſt love himſelf, and ſeek his own happineſs, as he is included in general being. 'Tis a contradiction to ſuppoſe that a perſon has univerſal good-will, and yet has no regard to himſelf.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012811_0029_0F8AC020479A74F8"/>
This love of ourſelves is therefore neceſſarily implied in that univerſal benevolence which is oppoſed to the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs deſcribed above. That is altogether ſelfiſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a man's loving himſelf, <hi>as ſelf,</hi> or meerly becauſe he is himſelf, but this love of himſelf of which I am now ſpeaking, is not love of ſelf, <hi>as ſelf,</hi> but as implied in the general object of love; and therefore is no other than love, love to being in general, or univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It is the ſame kind of affection with which he loves his neighbour; in loving his neighbour, he loves himſelf alſo, becauſe he cannot love his neighbour as part of the whole, and not love himſelf alſo as ſuch; his own happineſs, as an individual, being worth as much in itſelf, and to the whole, as that of his neighbour, and as much included in the general good, ſince it equally conduces to the happineſs of the whole.</p>
               <p>And it may be further obſerved, that this love, in which a man regards himſelf as part of the whole, and his intereſt and happineſs, for the ſame reaſon he regards that of his neighbour, may be exerciſed with greater ſtrength, and more ſenſibly, with reſpect to his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and welfare, than towards that of his neighbour, who is as worthy of regard as himſelf; &amp; yet there be nothing ſelfiſh in his affection, but it may be wholly of the nature of general benevolence.—And that for two reaſons—</p>
               <p n="1">1. He has a more clear, full and conſtant view of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his intereſt, than he can have of his neighbour's; therefore he muſt be more affected with the former, and it will be more the object of his concern, than the latter. As man is not omniſcient, and his mind cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend univerſal being; but is limited in his views and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, he muſt be moſt affected with thoſe objects which are moſt in his view. This is right, and his duty: And not to be thus affected is inconſiſtent with general bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012811_0030_0F8AC02297A14930"/>2. Every perſon has a more particular and immediate care of himſelf committed to him by God, than of his neighbour. As he is under greater advantages to know his own ſtate and circumſtances, wants and enjoyments, and promote his own intereſt, in general, than another can be; ſo this concern is more eſpecially committed to him; which is a further reaſon why he ſhould pay a greater regard to it, than to that of his neighbour, though in itſelf as great and important as his own. This is not ſelfiſhneſs; but the genuine exerciſe of diſintereſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</p>
               <p>Thus a man who has a benevolent regard for a whole community or kingdom, and is equally a friend to every part and each perſon of that community, and equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts himſelf for the welfare of each, ſo far they come under his notice; when he is fixed in a particular town, and thereby obtains a clearer knowledge of their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, both good and evil, and of the beſt means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their greateſt happineſs, he will neceſſarily turn his attention to them more conſtantly and in a greater degree, and be more ſenſibly affected with their miſeries and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, than with thoſe of the neighbouring towns. And of the inhabitants of this town, they whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and intereſt are moſt in his view; and who by their particular ſituation and connexion, are moſt under his care, will have the firſt and greateſt ſhare of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and benevolent regards. This is no evidence, that he is ſelfiſh; it is the natural, genuine exerciſe of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benevolence.</p>
               <p>This view may ſerve to ſhew us one reaſon why, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes, 'tis ſo difficult to diſtinguiſh that ſelf-love which conſiſts in ſelfiſhneſs, from the benevolence which is its contrary; and why theſe are often confounded, and taken for the ſame thing. That ſelf-love which conſiſts in ſelfiſhneſs, has ſelf for its firſt and ſupreme object, and is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012811_0031_0F8AC02391A8E790"/>
extended to others, only as they are viewed as more or leſs favourable to the intereſt of ſelf, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Thus ſelfiſhneſs may extend to a whole community, and each individual member of it; becauſe the ſelfiſh man conſiders their welfare as connected with his own. And as his welfare is commonly in a higher degree, and more ſenſibly connected with the welfare of thoſe who are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to him, eſpecially thoſe who love him; he will have a greater regard ſtill for them and their welfare, purely from ſelfiſhneſs, or for his own ſake. And ſince his near relations, his own family and children, are in a ſenſe a part of himſelf; and his intereſt and happineſs is in a peculiar manner dependent on their's, his ſelfiſh regards will be more particularly extended to them. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect there is in ſelfiſhneſs a reſemblance to what is found in benevolence; which, though it conſiſts in diſintereſted good-will to the whole, is, as obſerved above, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs exerciſed by the benevolent perſon to individuals; and more ſtrongly to thoſe who are more nearly connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and more particularly to himſelf.</p>
               <p>There is, however, a great difference, and oppoſition in theſe two kinds of affection; which appears from what has been already ſaid. This ſelfiſh affection, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the whole community with which the ſelfiſh man is connected, is at bottom nothing but love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This is the foundation and center of his love. He in reality loves nothing but himſelf, and regards others wholly for his own ſake. Therefore, when he conſiders their welfare as inconſiſtent with his own; or any way oppoſing or impeding his intereſt, his heart will turn againſt them, and hate them, whatever be their connexion or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the other hand, the regard to a man's own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which is included in general good-will, is not love of himſelf, as ſuch: There is nothing contracted and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh in this affection, which is founded on his good-will to the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:012811_0032_0F8AC02596C1D228"/>This brings into view another thing, in which theſe two ſorts of love of ſelf differ, and oppoſe each other. He whoſe regard to himſelf and his own intereſt does not ariſe from ſelfiſhneſs, but general benevolence, is ready to give up his own perſonal good, for the ſake of the whole: He deſires no good for himſelf, unleſs conſiſtent with the common good. Whatever ſuppoſed good of his own, or of another, interferes with the greateſt general good, is no good to him, but the object of his averſion, in this view of it: So that all his own particular intereſt is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to that of the whole. This is neceſſary, when regard to ourſelves is but a branch of general good-will. Thus the intereſt of the benevolent man is the common intereſt, and he has no other. In a word, he ſubjects and devotes himſelf, and all things, to the glory of God, and the happineſs and glory of his church and kingdom; which is the greateſt univerſal good, and includes the higheſt good of the creature; he having no other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt but this.</p>
               <p>But that ſelf-love which conſiſts in ſelfiſhneſs, is, in this reſpect, moſt oppoſite to this. So far as the heart is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by this, it does not, it cannot give up its own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate good, for the ſake of the greateſt public good; ſince, by the ſuppoſition, he knows no good but the former, and every thing is by him ſubordinated to that.—But enough has been ſaid to ſhew the difference and oppoſition there is between ſelfiſhneſs, and that regard and concern a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent perſon has for his own intereſt, as a part of the whole, which is neceſſarily implied in general benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, though <hi>inordinate</hi> ſelf-love is ſinful, it is not ſo in itſelf; but when joined with love to God and our neighbour, and ſubordinate to the general good, it is a virtuous, holy affection: And to confirm this, the divine command has been alledged,
<q>Thou ſhalt love thy
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012811_0033_0F8AC02648A7D5E8"/>
neighbour, <hi>as thyſelf.</hi>
                  </q>
Here, it is ſaid, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love ourſelves, as much as our neighbour. Self love is therefore not a ſin, but a duty, ſo long as it does not exceed due bounds.</p>
               <p>Upon this the following things may be obſerved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is utterly unaccountable, and carries in it a direct contradiction, that the ſame affection, when exerciſed in a certain limited degree, ſhould be holineſs; but when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in a higher and ſtronger degree, ſhould not only have leſs holineſs, but change its nature, and become ſin. This none will aſſert, after due attention: Yet this is aſſerted in the propoſition under conſideration. However ſelf-love may be reſtrained, it is ſtill ſelf-love, and of the ſame nature with that which is under no reſtraint; and therefore as oppoſite to holineſs, though not to ſo great a degree, and the bad effects of it may not be ſo great, or ſo manifeſt. A devouring beaſt of prey, when confined in a cage, may not be ſo miſchievous, or appear ſo dreadful, as when let looſe, and deſtroying all before him: But his nature is not changed by his confinement; he is ſtill, in his nature, not a harmleſs creature, but a beaſt of prey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſelf-love cannot be ſubordinate to the good of the whole; it is contrary to the very nature of it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction. It ſeeks to advance ſelf only, and ſubordinates every thing to this; and therefore will not conſent that ſelf ſhould be ſubordinated to any thing elſe, or have any rival. Whenever it conſents to this, it is no longer ſelf-love, but generous, diſintereſted affection; as contrary to ſelfiſhneſs, as mercy is to injuſtice and cruelty. Such a conſent and change is, however, impoſſible, being a contradiction. This affection muſt be rooted out, or counteracted; and a directly oppoſite affection muſt take place, in order to a perſon's ſubordinating his own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt to any other intereſt whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if they who ſpeak of ſelf-love, ſo regulated as to be ſubordinate to a proper regard to others, and to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012811_0034_0F8AC02C1ABE2930"/>
the general good, mean any thing which is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and agreeable to the truth, they, muſt intend that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ourſelves, which is not ſelf-love, but real benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the whole, and reſpects ourſelves as part of the whole only. This regard to ourſelves, as has been ſhewn, is always, of neceſſity, ſubordinate to the good of the whole.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Self-love is ſo far from being enjoined or approved in the command, 'Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf,' that it is utterly forbidden. Self-love is wholly a partial affection, giving all to ourſelves, and nothing to our neighbour, and is therefore oppoſed to love to him; eſpecially to loving him as ourſelves.</p>
               <p>Nothing but univerſal benevolence can be obedience to this command; and ſo far as this takes place it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and ſelf-love is oppoſed and mortified. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, as has been ſhewn, implies a proper regard to ourſelves, and an equal regard to our neighbour; having all that impartiality, and love to our neighbour and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which this law requires.—And, by the way, this is a clear evidence that univerſal benevolence, with the affection implied in it, is that in which all holineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, ſince no other kind of love is obedience to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but he who has this, does of neceſſity love his neighbour as himſelf.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, it appears that three different kinds of affection have been called ſelf-love. The firſt is neither ſin nor holineſs, but is equally implied in both. The two laſt are directly oppoſed to each other; the latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general, diſintereſted benevolence, extended to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as included in the whole; and is the ſame holy love which has God and our neighbour for its object. The other is contracted ſelfiſhneſs, by which ſelf only is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and exalted above God and our neighbour, and in oppoſition to the general good; and is, in every degree of it, ſinful—This ſelfiſhneſs is properly called ſelf-love; and in this ſenſe the word will be uſed in the following inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:012811_0035_0F8AC02E120C1A18"/>That univerſal benevolence is the whole of holineſs; and, on the other hand, all ſin conſiſts in ſelf-love, will more fully appear by the following conſideration of each, in its exerciſes and fruits.</p>
               <p>Univerſal good will comprehends all the love to God, our neighbour, and ourſelves, required in the law of God; and therefore muſt be the whole of holy obedience.— Every pious ſentiment and affection is compriſed in this; and all piety in words and practice is but an expreſſion of this love: Where this love is not, all outward expreſſions of piety, in words and actions, are emptineſs and hypocriſy. Let any ſerious perſon think what are the particular branches of true piety: Let him view each one by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and when he has diſcovered the nature and eſſence of it, he will find that diſintereſted, friendly affection is its diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic. For inſtance, let fear and reverence of the divine majeſty be conſidered in this view. What but love and friendly affection diſtinguiſhes this from the fear and dread of devils? All the holineſs in pious fear, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from the fear of the wicked, conſiſts in love. Leave all diſintereſted, friendly affection to the divine being out of fear, and all holineſs is excluded.—</p>
               <p>Again, if we conſider what is contained in true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to God, we ſhall find diſintereſted, kind affection, the only thing wherein it differs from the affection of the moſt wicked creature. Where there is no good will, there is nothing in what is called gratitude, better than that which the legion of devils exerciſed, when they were ſo far gratified by Chriſt, as to be ſuffered to deſtroy the herd of ſwine. But ſo far as good-will is exerciſed, the goodneſs of God to us and others, will excite holy grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which is nothing elſe but good-will to God and our neighbour, in which we ourſelves are included, and correſpondent affection, excited and acted out in the view of the good will and kindneſs of God.</p>
               <p>And univerſal good will implies the whole of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012811_0036_0F8AC02E8A334078"/>
and duty we owe to our neighbour. It all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the exerciſe and expreſſion of this, and thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that are implied in it. The exerciſe and practice of righteouſneſs or juſtice towards our neighbour, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a benevolent regard to him and his intereſt. Where this is not, there is no exerciſe and practice of juſtice in the heart, whatever is the external conduct; for juſtice conſiſts in doing to our neighbour, as we would he ſhould do to us; or, in other words, loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ourſelves. And where this benevolent regard to our neighbour is, there is juſtice; for this love worketh no ill to our neighbour.—And as righteouſneſs, truth and faithfulneſs are implied in univerſal benevolence, ſo are temperance and chaſtity, or ſobriety in the proper reſtraint and government of our own appetites and paſſions: For 'tis eaſy to ſee that the undue indulgence of theſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to benevolence, as tending to hurt others, or our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or both; and ſo is oppoſite to the general good, and the divine command, in which all the crime of ſuch indulgence conſiſts. In ſhort, there is not any one virtue, or branch of godlineſs, humanity or ſobriety; not any duty we owe to God, our neighbour, or ourſelves, that is not comprehended in univerſal benevolence; and is not neceſſarily exerciſed and practiſed, ſo far as this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection takes place in the heart: And where there is no defect in the latter, the former are found in their fulneſs and perfection: For the whole is nothing but benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence acted out in its proper nature, and perfection; or love to God and our neighbour made perfect in all its genuine exerciſes and expreſſions.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, all ſin conſiſts in ſelf-love, and what is implied in this.</p>
               <p>Self-love is, in its whole nature, and in every degree of it, enmity againſt God. It is not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be; and is the only affection that can oppoſe it. It cannot be reconciled to any of God's conduct, rightly underſtood; but is in its very nature
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012811_0037_0F8AC02F52175CE8"/>
rebellion againſt it; which is all an expreſſion of that love which is moſt contrary to ſelf-love. This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fruitful ſource of every exerciſe and act of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rebellion againſt God, and contempt of him, that ever was, or can be.—Self-love exerciſed and indulged, blinds the heart to every true moral excellence and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This does not ſuit the taſte of the ſelfiſh heart, but gives it diſguſt. Self-love is the foundation and reaſon of all that blindneſs to ſpiritual things, to God, his glorious character, works and kingdom, which the ſcripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents wicked men to have; and is therefore the ſource of all the errors which men imbibe, as well as all the open idolatry in the heathen world, and falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under the light of the goſpel. All this is agreeable to that ſelf-love which oppoſes God's true character; and under the influence of this, men go off from the truth, and believe, love and practice a lie; it being itſelf the greateſt practical lie in nature, as it ſets up that which is comparatively nothing, above univerſal exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Self-love is the ſource of all the profaneneſs and impiety in the world; and of all pride and ambition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; which is nothing but ſelfiſhneſs acted out in this particular way. This is at the bottom of all the worldlineſs and ſenſuality that men run into; as it blinds their eyes to all true good, contracts their hearts, and ſinks them down, ſo that they look upon worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be the greateſt good, and that in which their true intereſt lies. This is the ſpring of all the hatred and ill-will, ſtrife and contention among men; for this leads men to hate and oppoſe all thoſe whom they view in the way of their own ſelfiſh intereſt. This is the ſource of all falſehood, injuſtice and oppreſſion under the ſun; in which men are, through their ſelfiſhneſs, ſeeking, by undue methods, to invade the right and property of others. Self-love produces all the violent paſſions, envy, wrath, clamour and evil ſpeaking, of which men are guilty. Take away ſelfiſhneſs, and all theſe would ceaſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012811_0038_0F8AC0300DCFCFF8"/>
And if there be any other ſin, any thing which is contrary to the divine law, it is briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this fruitful ſource of all iniquity, SELF-LOVE.</p>
               <p>And hence we may ſee that holy love is wholly a <hi>diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted</hi> affection, and in what ſenſe it is ſo. Self-love is wholly an intereſted affection, as ſelf is the only object of it. Holy love has no regard to ſelf, as ſelf; but is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the greateſt general good and intereſt; the glory of God in the higheſt glory of his kingdom, and the greateſt good of the creation. So far as a man exerciſes holy love, he has no other intereſt but this; as all is devoted to this, and given up for the ſake of it. And in this ſenſe all his love is diſintereſted, as it ſeeks not any ſelf intereſt, but the contrary. He who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes this diſintereſted love, has pleaſure indeed, and is purſuing an intereſt and happineſs; though 'tis not a ſelfiſh intereſt, but that in the purſuit of which he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces what ſelf-love ſeeks.</p>
               <p>A judge is ſaid to be intereſted in a cauſe he is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, ſo far as his own perſonal intereſt is concerned in it, and his ſelf-love will influence him to take one ſide, rather than the other; which renders him unfit to judge the cauſe. But if his own perſonal intereſt is not concerned in the caſe, and there be nothing to bias him to one ſide rather than the other, he is ſaid to be diſintereſted. And though he may be bribed, or ſome way intereſted in the matter; yet if he is not at all influenced by this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the cauſe contrary to the dictates of ſelf-love, he is ſaid to act diſintereſtedly. In ſuch a ſenſe as this, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection is diſintereſted. Such a judge, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces all ſelfiſh conſiderations, and eſpouſes the cauſe of the widow and fatherleſs, and delivers them from the hand of oppreſſors, has an intereſt which he ſeeks; but not an intereſt, which ſelfiſhneſs prompts him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: And the more he intereſts himſelf in the cauſe of the poor, helpleſs widow, and the greater pleaſure he takes in helping her, the more diſintereſted are his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012811_0039_0F8AC030D67A8C10"/>
and conduct, and the more is ſelf-love counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted and mortified.</p>
               <p>So, he who, in the exerciſe of holy love, purſues the glory of God, and the higheſt intereſt and happineſs of his kingdom, which includes the greateſt good of his fellow creatures; purſues the beſt, the moſt important intereſt, and has the moſt noble, refined pleaſure in the exerciſe of this affection; yet in all this he is wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, as he oppoſes ſelfiſhneſs, and all regard to ſelf, which is not implied in being thus devoted to the greateſt general good; and forſakes the whole intereſt which ſelf-love ſeeks, for the kingdom of God's ſake.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION V.</hi> In which the foregoing account of ſin and holineſs is ſhewn to be agreeable to reaſon.</head>
               <p n="1">I. IT is moſt reaſonable that the common and greateſt good of the whole ſhould be ſought by every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of it: That every one ſhould be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the good of the whole, as to give up the leſs good of individuals, and conſequently his own perſonal intereſt, whenever inconſiſtent herewith. Thus, it is highly reaſonable that a particular member of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould cheerfully give up all his perſonal intereſt, his whole eſtate, and even his life, when this is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to ſave the whole nation from ruin. If a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is on fire, and in order to ſtop its progreſs, and ſave the city, 'tis neceſſary that the houſe of a particular perſon ſhould be totally demoliſhed; he ſhould with pleaſure give up his houſe to be deſtroyed, however magnificent and coſtly, and though it contains all he has in the world. If in this caſe a man ſhould heſitate a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be inclined to ſave his own houſe, to the utter deſtruction of the whole city; every one would condemn him as acting a moſt unreaſonable, ſordid part. But if
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012811_0040_0F8AC0318D4EB148"/>
he is ſuch a friend to the city, and intereſts himſelf ſo much in its welfare, as to take more pleaſure in ſaving it, even at the expence of all he has in the world, than a ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh man can have in whatever he poſſeſſes, he will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded as one of an excellent ſpirit. And every one muſt grant he ought to be imitated by all. And it is reaſonable that every one of the ſociety ſhould be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſt, according to his importance and worth; his diſpoſition and ability to promote the greateſt good of the whole community.</p>
               <p>But this is univerſal, diſintereſted benevolence. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this will form men to ſuch exerciſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. But where this benevolence reigns in every heart, each one will be thus a friend to all. He who has this benevolence, will, by it, be united to the grand commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the univerſe, including all exiſtence, and be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the good of the whole: And as this is compriſed in the glory of God, and the perfection and happineſs of his kingdom, this will be the object of his affection, and he will ſubordinate all to this; and in ſo doing will act a moſt reaſonable part.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, nothing can be more unreaſonable than that every individual ſhould be altogether ſelfiſh, and ſeek his own perſonal intereſt only; not caring what becomes of the community, or any belonging to it, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his ſelfiſhneſs prompts him to it; being ready at any time to ſacrifice the public, and the greateſt good of every individual to his own private advantage, however important and worthy he is, and whatever obligation he is under to him.</p>
               <p>This carries in it every thing mean, miſchievous and perverſe. But <hi>this</hi> is ſelf-love. This is the nature and tendency of every degree of it, though it may be many ways under reſtraints, and often put on the appearance of benevolence and friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This univerſal benevolence alone, can produce the ſtrong, happy union of intelligences, which reaſon
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012811_0041_0F8AC0324B075958"/>
teaches muſt be the attendant of holineſs. It fixes each in his proper place, and effects the higheſt and moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful harmony conceivable.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Reaſon teaches that univerſal benevolence is the higheſt good of intelligences. This makes every one a wiſe, hearty friend to all the reſt, and devotes him to the public good: By which the higheſt common good has the greateſt poſſible ſecurity, and is advanced to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Should a king and his ſubjects be thus united in the moſt perfect friendſhip to each other, and entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the higheſt general good; each one knowing wherein it conſiſts: And the community having wiſdom to contrive, and power to execute the beſt means to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it; there would be no evil in this kingdom, but what is neceſſary to promote the general good; which would be advanced to the higheſt degree; and it muſt be, in this reſpect, the moſt happy community imaginable.</p>
               <p>And this raiſes the happineſs of each individual to the higheſt pitch his capacity will admit. For his univerſal benevolence will neceſſarily put him in poſſeſſion of the good of the whole, and of every particular, ſo far as he perceives it, and in proportion to the degree of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. By his diſintereſted good will, this is become his good; or he enjoys it as much as if it were his own perſonal good; whereby he has immenſely more happineſs than in any other poſſible way: And, in proportion to his good will to the whole, he takes pleaſure in others who are friends to the ſame; and muſt be filled with a peculiar ſatisfaction and delight, while he ſees all around him, not only delighting in himſelf, as a friend to the whole, but devoted to the general good.</p>
               <p>This may be applied to the grand community, THE KINGDOM OF GOD; which comprehends GOD, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme king, and all who are voluntarily united in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. The reaſon of man cannot invent any way to ſecure and promote the happineſs of this community, unleſs univerſal benevolence be introduced. And no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012811_0042_0F8AC03311D239B0"/>
kind of virtue is neceſſary to the higheſt conceivable good of the whole, and every individual. <note n="*" place="bottom">This might be more particularly illuſtrated; but is left to the pleaſing contemplation of the benevolent friends of Chriſt and his kingdom.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But ſelf-love, when it has its genuine, unreſtrained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, deſtroys all public good. This is the mother of all the luſts which bring evil into the univerſe. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents individuals enjoying the good of others; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed blinds them to all true happineſs. It contracts the the mind, and degrades it below the proper purſuits of a rational creature, and entails miſery on its unhappy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The natural world, we know, was created for the moral; and 'tis generally granted that the former is an emblem of the latter. We may hence expect to find <hi>that</hi> in the former, which bears a conſpicuous analogy to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the perfection and glory of the intellectual ſyſtem: And this muſt be the general law of attraction, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bond of union in our material ſyſtem; by which all bodies are mutually attracted, and tend to one center: Every part, while it attracts, being alſo attracted by the whole, is fixed in its ſtation, and extends its influence to all; ſo that each particle has, in a ſenſe, a regard to the whole, and contributes to the general good. This is the ſource or the order and beauty ſo obvious in our world. The ſun, the center of all, ſpreads his kind influence over the whole; and each inferior body, at the ſame time it pays a due regard to all other bodies, pays him a ſupreme regard. This is one moſt ſimple affection, univerſal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: A moſt clear, ſtriking reſemblance of univerſal benevolence in the moral world, in which all its union and glory conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Further, the repulſive quality found in ſome bodies, by which they reſiſt others, and which, ſhould it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obtain, without control, would iſſue in the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the material world, is an apt repreſentation of ſelf-love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:012811_0043_0F8AC033C7A53EB0"/>Thus reaſon, nature, and, I may add, general experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, join to point out univerſal benevolence as the ſum of all holineſs.—Hence almoſt all writers on morality have made virtue to conſiſt chiefly, if not altogether, in what they call univerſal benevolence; though many of them have left GOD and his kingdom, the great object of true benevolence, out of their ſyſtem: Nor have they diſtinguiſhed properly between benevolence and ſelf-love.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> In which is ſhewn that holineſs, as taught in divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſts in univerſal benevolence, agreeable to the foregoing account.</head>
               <p>THE holy ſcripture is the beſt and only ſure guide in determining the queſtion before us; which has therefore been kept in view in what has been already ſaid: But we ſhall now conſult it more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The revealed law of God teaches what true holineſs is. This is the only ſtandard of all moral excellence and perfection. It is not only the ſtandard of all holineſs in the creature; but is a tranſcript of God's moral perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nothing more is neceſſary then, in order to know what holineſs is, in God and the creature, but to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this law.</p>
               <p>Our ſaviour has taught us, as has been before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that all the law requires is love: Conſequently holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt conſiſt wholly in love. We have conſidered what kind of love this muſt be; and arguments have been offered to prove it conſiſts in univerſal, diſintereſted bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence: At the ſame time, what is meant by this, has been explained. Our preſent inquiry is, Whether this
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012811_0044_0F8AC034865093C0"/>
is the love required in the divine law? The anſwer is not difficult to him who will attend.</p>
               <p>The law does not require ſelf-love; but love to God and our neighbour; not from ſelfiſh motives, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſelf-love extended to them, meerly becauſe of our connexion with them, or the benefit we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or hope to receive from them, or becauſe they love us. Our ſaviour tells us this is not holineſs, but conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with being wholly ſinful. 'For if ye love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans the ſame?'<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. v. 46.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let any one conſult his own ſenſe, whether he accepts that as true reſpect and love from any one, which appears to be wholly ſelfiſh; being nothing but a regard to the benefit to himſelf which he hopes to receive from him. He will at once feel that this has nothing of the nature of true love; but is a mean, ſordid affection, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſpiſe. And this is the ſenſe of all mankind, in their own caſe; however they may put off their maker with ſuch ſelfiſh affection, and think he will accept it at their hands as true love and holineſs. Thus the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate prieſts in Iſrael offered that to God, which would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front their governor, had they offered it to him; nor would they accept it from their neighbour.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mal. 1.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The love to our neighbour, which God's law requires, is certainly univerſal, diſintereſted good will, ſince it is a love which will diſpoſe us to do good unto <hi>all men,</hi> and muſt extend to our greateſt enemies: For no love but this will do ſo. Therefore when Chriſt himſelf gave an inſtance of this love, he produced one in which there is nothing but the moſt diſintereſted goodneſs; benevolence towards an enemy in diſtreſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. x. 25,—37.</note> This we are ſure he would not have done, if this were not the very love required in the command. And he expreſsly declares that the command does not mean a love to our neighbour, as diſtinguiſhed from our enemy, as it was then underſtood by the Jews;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012811_0045_0F8AC035479EA730"/>
but love to enemies, which wiſhes them well, and will lead us to do them good, however injuriouſly they treat us. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. v. 43 44.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And is it not very unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the ſecond command, which our Lord ſays is like unto the firſt, requires ſomething of a different kind, though it is called by the ſame name, <hi>love?</hi> There can be no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but what ariſes from the very different objects of this ſame love.</p>
               <p>St. John teaches us that love to God, and to our brother or neighbour, is inſeparable; that he who loves one of theſe, certainly and neceſſarily loves the other; which could not be, if love to God was different in kind from love to our neighbour. 'If any man ſay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. Whoſo hath this world's good, and ſeeth his brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?' <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Joh. iii. 17. iv. 20.</note> It is to be obſerved, that the love to our brother, here ſpoken of, is the love of good will, expreſſed in ſhewing kindneſs to him; and indeed the apoſtle ſpeaks of no other kind of love in this epiſtle, as every inſtance of love which he mentions, is love of benevolence. Now, if love to God is not diſintereſted good will, how can this imply good will to our brother, or lead to it, ſo as to form an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connexion?</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that he who loves God, is hence led to love his neighbour, in obedience to God's command, and from his example, who is good to all; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe love to God, and kind affection to our neighbour, is the ſame kind of love. To this it may be anſwered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That love to God, which is not diſintereſted good will, nor implies it, is no principle of obedience to the divine command, and can have no tendency to it. No love will diſpoſe men to obey God, but the love of 'good will;' <note n="‖" place="bottom">Eph. vi. 7.</note> or the love by which they are true friends of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012811_0046_0F8AC037AA0216E0"/>
God. He who does not obey God from this motive, does not obey him at all: He is influenced only by fear, which none will ſay is true obedience. Therefore they who aſſert we are led to love our neighbour, purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commands it, and from love to him, if they attend to their own ideas, will find they ſuppoſe this to be love of good will, which is the very thing they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to oppoſe; and ſo contradict themſelves in the ſuppoſition they make, and really grant all we aſſert.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If love to God, which implies no good will to him, could induce to obedience in any inſtance, it would not diſpoſe him to obey this command, and exerciſe good will to his neighbour, and ſuch command will not in the leaſt influence him to it. If his inducement to love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is wholly from ſelfiſh principles, which is always the caſe, where there is no diſintereſted good will, it is, by the ſuppoſition, not love of his neighbour, but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only; and is ſo far from obedience to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that it is rebellion againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God's univerſal, diſintereſted good will cannot be a motive to love our neighbour, with the ſame good will, any further than we are pleaſed with it; for we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſpoſed to imitate what we diſlike. But to be pleaſed with this goodneſs of God, ſuppoſes our hearts to be in the exerciſe of the ſame; for benevolence is implied in taking pleaſure in benevolence, as has been ſhewn. This therefore ſuppoſes that good will is implied in that love to God, which leads us to the love of good will to our neighbour; ſo ſuppoſes the very thing it is adduced to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Thus impoſſible is it to account for that inſeparable connexion of love to God, with good will to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which the ſcripture aſſerts, unleſs this love, in theſe two branches of it, is the ſame in kind. But if love to God is, in its nature, univerſal, diſintereſted good will, the ſcripture repreſentation appears conſiſtent and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:012811_0047_0F8AC038A0324F40"/>Thus it appears that the love required in the law of God is univerſal, diſintereſted goodneſs in all its branches, attendants and fruits: Therefore this is holineſs. But it muſt be further obſerved,</p>
               <p>God in giving ſuch a law, requiring ſuch love, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his univerſal, diſintereſted goodneſs, and ſhewed that his moral character conſiſts in love. We have good authority therefore, even from the divine law, to ſay, that GOD IS LOVE. His love is as really expreſſed in the law, as in the goſpel. In the latter, this diſintereſted love and goodneſs, which appears in the law, is expreſſed and acted out in a more full and glorious manner and degree, and ſet in a more affecting and ſtriking light. In this ſenſe the law is good, it is love and goodneſs, as really as the goſpel. And as the divine holineſs is expreſſed in the law, in requiring love; ſo the creature, by exerciſing this ſame love, is a partaker of God's holineſs, or of the divine nature, as the ſcripture repreſents the matter: He is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the image of God; or, as St. John expreſſes it, 'God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.' <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Joh. iv. 16. It is obſervable, that as the apoſtle ſays here, 'He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,' he alſo ſays, chap. iii. ver. 24. 'He that keepeth his commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him.' Whence it appears, that <hi>dwelling in love,</hi> and <hi>keeping God's commandments,</hi> is the ſame thing: Conſequently love compriſes all the obedience required; or, as St. Paul ſays, 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.'</note>
               </p>
               <p>OBJ. The law is not all love and goodneſs. It requires love indeed, but it is guarded with the moſt awful ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and curſes him who does not obey it perfectly. This is not an expreſſion of love, but ſtrict and awful juſtice. What love can there be in curſing a ſinner, and puniſhing him forever? Love is exerciſed in <hi>ſaving</hi> ſinners, but not in <hi>damning</hi> them.</p>
               <p>ANS. He who is infinitely good, is in the ſame degree an enemy to all oppoſition to the higheſt good. This will be the greateſt, the only crime in his view; and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012811_0048_0F8AC03AB83CC638"/>
from this love, he will be diſpoſed to maintain his law, which requires love, in the puniſhment of all ſuch who turn enemies to the greateſt good of being, according to their deſert. This is the only way in which this love can properly expreſs itſelf in the divine law. Had God commanded love, and not threatened the contrary with the moſt dreadful puniſhment, he would not have expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his love and goodneſs, as he has done by this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening. In this view, divine juſtice is nothing but the moſt perfect love and goodneſs, exerciſed in a proper way againſt the enemies of this goodneſs, and manifeſted in hating and puniſhing ſuch. And the ſufferings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the ſon of God, when he ſtood in the place of ſinners; and the eternal puniſhment of the wicked in hell, are the neceſſary effect and proper expreſſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love; even that ſame love which is expreſſed in the precepts of God's law, or by any other medium. This is nothing but univerſal benevolence, which ſeeks the greateſt good of the whole, properly expreſſed in this way.</p>
               <p>Divine love comprehends wiſdom, juſtice, truth and faithfulneſs, and every moral perfection and excellence whatſoever. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Wiſdom conſiſts in propoſing the wiſeſt and beſt end, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing it by the moſt proper means. This is compriſed in univerſal benevolence, which fixes on the greateſt good of the whole, and ſeeks it as the ſupreme, ultimate end. He who has not univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, does not propoſe and purſue the wiſeſt and beſt end; but is wholly blind to it. Thus, univerſal, diſintereſted goodneſs appears to be that in which all true wiſdom conſiſts. This therefore muſt be the holineſs which is called wiſdom in ſcripture: And its oppoſite, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, is the fooliſhneſs, which is there oppoſed to wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>It may be alſo obſerved here, that <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> often mean the ſame thing in ſcripture; and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> frequently intends ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and is often uſed to expreſs the whole of God's moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; though 'tis many times uſed in a more limited ſenſe, and intends holineſs as exerciſed with regard to ſome particular object. But it never ſignifies any thing which is not holineſs, and does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe love; and the whole is comprehended in univerſal, diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed benevolence. He who has this, is <hi>righteous</hi>; his heart is <hi>right</hi> towards all beings, and diſpoſed to give every one his due. This is righteouſneſs, in the moſt proper and comprehenſive ſenſe of the word; and without this love there is no righteouſneſs. Hence righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſeems to be put ſometimes for goodneſs and mercy. See Pſalm. 36.10.89.16.103.17.143.11, 12.145.7.—So holineſs evidently means the divine goodneſs. See Pſal. 30.4.97.12.</p>
                  </note> What is called by theſe different names,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012811_0049_0F8AC03B462EBBB0"/>
is but one moſt ſimple thing, even divine LOVE; for God in his whole moral character is <hi>love.</hi> Take away love and goodneſs, and there will be neither wiſdom, truth, faithfulneſs, nor juſtice; for they have no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but in the exerciſe of love; and love implies all theſe, and neceſſarily acts out, ſo as to form a character, properly denoted by theſe names, as it appears to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in different relations, and reſpects different objects.</p>
               <p>The law of God then leads us to conſider holineſs as conſiſting in univerſal, diſintereſted good will, conſidered in all its genuine exerciſes and fruits, and acted out in all its branches towards God, and our neighbour. This holineſs is exerciſed towards God, in ſuch a regard and kind affection for him, as to be wholly devoted to his honor and intereſt, and the honor and glory of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſeek it, as the higheſt and ultimate end. This good will exerciſed towards God, his kingdom and intereſt, with all thoſe affections it compriſes, is to love God with all the heart.—This ſame holineſs or love is exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour, in wiſhing and purſuing the greateſt good of all, and of ourſelves as included in the whole; and in all that diſintereſted affection which is neceſſarily implied in this.</p>
               <p>And let it be obſerved here, that this love to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as it regards the greateſt good of the whole, as its chief object, and reſpects the good of individuals, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this; and as the greateſt good of mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in being the voluntary ſubjects and ſervants of Chriſt, in belonging to his kingdom, and promoting the higheſt intereſt of that: This love, I ſay, is not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a diſtinct thing from ſeeking the glory and kingdom
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012811_0050_0F8AC03F5C7625E8"/>
of God; as theſe perfectly coincide. In ſeeking the glory of God, and intereſt of his kingdom, we neceſſarily ſeek the greateſt good of mankind; and ſo far as we are devoted to their beſt intereſt, we act as friends to God, and ſeek his honor, and the intereſt of his kingdom. The whole therefore is ſummed up in <hi>ſeeking firſt the kingdom of God,</hi> or making this our ſupreme and ultimate end; ſo as to be willing to do or ſuffer any thing that ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or proper to promote this. In this the love of God and our neighbour center in one point, ſo that they cannot be divided; and this affection in which all holineſs conſiſts, really has but one object, viz. THE KINGDOM OF GOD. Our divine teacher ſets the matter in this light, and ſpeaks as no man would have ſpoke, when he directs men to ſeek the kingdom of God, as the only object of their purſuit, for the ſake of which he commands them to forſake every other intereſt. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>See Matt. vi. 33. Luk. xii. 31. xviii. 29.—In Matthew the words are, "Seek firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs." The kingdom of God is the kingdom which Chriſt is erecting, and bringing to its higheſt perfection and glory; and comprehends God's moral kingdom, in its whole extent; in which is the full and moſt complete diſplay of the divine perfections, or glory; and all the good and happineſs of the creation. This is 'that great city, the holy Jeruſalem,' which St. John ſaw, 'deſcending out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from God, <hi>having the glory of God,</hi>' Rev. xxi. 10.11. To ſeek this kingdom <hi>firſt,</hi> is to make the intereſt, happineſs and glory of it our ultimate end, ſo as to do all for its ſake, and ſubordinate every thing to this. This kingdom, conſidered in its full extent, and all its appendages, is the firſt, the only object of the deſires and purſuit of Chriſt himſelf: So that in theſe words he directs his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to imitate him, and be holy, as he is holy.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>his righteouſneſs</hi> is not meant any thing diſtinct from the kingdom of God. It intends the divine perfections diſplayed in this kingdom, in the glorious work of redemption, including the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the redeemed, and the complete overthrow of all his enemies. In this ſenſe the word is uſed in the following paſſages. 'The Lord God will cauſe <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> to ſpring forth before all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—And the Gentiles ſhall ſee <hi>thy righteouſneſs,</hi> and all kings <hi>thy glory.</hi>' Iſai. 61.11.62.2. 'Hearken to me, ye that follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteouſneſs, ye that ſeek the Lord—For the Lord ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Zion, &amp;c.—<hi>My ſalvation</hi> ſhall be forever, and <hi>my righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall not be aboliſhed. Hearken unto me, ye that know <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> the people in whoſe heart is my law, fear ye not the reproach of men— For the moth ſhall eat them up like a garment, and the worm ſhall eat them like wool: But <hi>my righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall be forever, and <hi>my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> from generation to generation chap. 51.1,—8. Here, to follow after righteouſneſs and ſeek the Lord, is to ſeek firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his righteouſneſs. And God's <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and his <hi>ſalvation,</hi> mean the ſame thing. This being ſo, when St. Luke mentions this injunction of our Lord, he puts it in the following words, 'But rather ſeek ye <hi>the kingdom of God</hi>'; this including the whole: For if <hi>his righteouſneſs</hi> was not included in this, it would not be omitted.</p>
                     <p>The ſame thing is inculcated by Chriſt, when he directs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages all to ſubordinate every thing, however dear to them, to this grand intereſt, and forſake all 'for the kingdom of God's ſake,' Luk. 18.29. It is obſervable that in a parallel text (Mark 10.29) inſtead of <hi>the kingdom of God's ſake,</hi> the words are '<hi>for my ſake, and the goſpel's,</hi>' becauſe theſe words expreſs the very ſame thing. The kingdom of God and the goſpel are the ſame: Therefore to preach the goſpel, is to preach the kingdom of God. Luk. 4.43.9.2, 60. Act. 20.25. And 'tis called the goſpel of the kingdom of God, Mark 1.14. And as this is Chriſt's kingdom and intereſt, compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, and the whole which he ſeeks; whatever is done for the ſake of the kingdom of God, is done for his ſake.</p>
                     <p>The holineſs of the mediator is wholly exerciſed in ſeeking this kingdom: His righteouſneſs, by which ſinners are juſtified, conſiſts in what he did and ſuffered for its ſake. And the holineſs of men conſiſts wholly in ſeeking this kingdom, which is love to God and their neighbour, or univerſal, diſintereſted benevolence.—</p>

               <p n="2">II. It will ſerve to confirm what has been obſerved concerning the law of God, and further ſhew what true holineſs is, according to ſcripture, if we conſider what is that divine love which is there repreſented as the holineſs of God, or that in which his moral character and glory is revealed; in conformity to which the holineſs of man conſiſts.</p>
               <p>St. John ſays, 'God is love.' By which 'tis evident he means to expreſs the whole of God's moral character. And we have a good warrant to take his words in this ſenſe from the divine law, which is a tranſcript of God's moral character, and requires nothing but <hi>love.</hi> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us how this love appears, and wherein is the greateſt manifeſtation of it to man, viz. in giving his ſon to die for the redemption of man, and accompliſhing all that good which is compriſed in it. 'In this was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten ſon into the world, that we might live through him.'<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Joh. iv. 8, 9.</note> This is wholly love of good will, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the higheſt act of kindneſs, and is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſintereſted love, as 'tis exerciſed towards enemies. This is elſewhere ſpoken of as that in which the love of God appears in its greatneſs, excellence and glory. 'But God <hi>commendeth</hi> his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.' <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. v. 8.</note> This higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the moſt diſintereſted benevolence is thus ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as that in which the divine character, or God's holy love, is acted out and ſet forth to our view. It hence appears, that diſintereſted benevolence is the love in which God's holineſs conſiſts. Therefore we are called upon to imitate this love of God, as that by which we may be like him, partakers of his holineſs. St. John ſays, when ſpeaking of this love of God, 'Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another. If we love
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012811_0053_0F8AC0420EF88500"/>
one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.' If we love one another with that love which God exerciſed and manifeſted in giving his ſon to die for us, we by this are conformed to God, his image is in us, and his love, which is his holineſs, is complete and perfect in us. What words could more expreſsly declare that the divine holineſs conſiſts moſt eſſentially in diſintereſted goodneſs; and that in the exerciſe of this, we are holy, as God is holy? To the like purpoſe is what Chriſt ſays to his diſciples. When he is recommending to them the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exerciſe of diſintereſted benevolence, in love to their enemies; he tells them that they would hereby imitate God, who is good to his enemies; and then ſays, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.' <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. v. 44, 48.</note> According to this, the holineſs and perfection of God and his people, conſiſts, ſo much at leaſt, in diſinterered benevolence, that there is no moral perfection without it, in God or the creature. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will obſerve how exactly parallel theſe words of Chriſt are to thoſe of St. John, we have been conſidering. He ſays, if we love one another, with a love of pure bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, like that which God exerciſed in giving his ſon to die for ſinners, 'God dwelleth in us, and <hi>his love is perfected in us.</hi>' Chriſt ſays, that in the exerciſe of this love, his diſciples ſhall be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect.—</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is declared by St. Paul. When ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's love and mercy to ſinners in forgiving ſin, and of the love of Chriſt in dying for ſinners, which are inſtances of diſintereſted goodneſs, he ſays to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian chriſtians, 'Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love:' <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 32. v. 1.2.</note> Here he directs chriſtians to diſintereſted benevolence, by which they would imitate God's holineſs, exerciſed in love to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the holy love of God is repreſented
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012811_0054_0F8AC042CD23D0B8"/>
as conſiſting in diſintereſted benevolence and goodneſs, the higheſt and moſt remarkable exerciſe of which appears in redemption; in giving his ſon to die for ſinners, that they might live through him; and that the holineſs of men conſiſts in imitating this benevolent love. Hence it appears that, according to ſcripture, holineſs conſiſts in benevolence, and what is implied in it, and in nothing elſe.—</p>
               <p>OBJ. 'Tis granted that holineſs conſiſts in part in love of benevolence; eſpecially as it reſpects indigent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But God's holineſs does not conſiſt wholly, or chiefly, in good will to men; but in love to himſelf; and the holineſs of men conſiſts principally in love to God: And it does not appear from theſe ſcriptures that this love to God, either in God or the creature, is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of benevolence; but may be ſomething elſe; and ſo holineſs may not conſiſt principally in benevolent, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted affection.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1ſt. According to theſe ſcriptures, God's love of benevolence is ſpoken of as the moſt bright and ſtriking expreſſion of the excellence of his nature and character, or his holineſs; and that love in us which is an imitation of this love of God, is repreſented as that in which our conformity to God conſiſts; which could not be true, or a proper repreſentation, if holineſs conſiſted chiefly in ſomething of another kind, not included in this. We have therefore good ground to conclude from theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that this is the leading excellence, and the ſum of all holineſs in God and the creature; eſpecially as holineſs exerciſed toward the creature muſt be of the ſame nature with that of which God is the object. But more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as the object of holy love, God and the creation, is, in a ſenſe, one and the ſame, or are united in one object, the kingdom of God, as has been ſhewn. According to this, loving our neighbour is really loving God, as love to God is implied in it. This ſeems to be expreſſed by St. John in the paſſage we have been conſidering. 'No
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012811_0055_0F8AC04387D97DB0"/>
man hath ſeen God at any time, if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us,' i. e. by loving one another, while we ſee and converſe with each other, with the love of benevolence and kindneſs, in doing good to others, our love to God is expreſſed in the beſt and moſt perfect manner; eſpecially as we herein imitate God, and follow him as his dear children. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Doddridge has, I think, given the true ſenſe of this text, in his paraphraſe, in the following words, 'But as he [God] is the great fountain of benevolence, if we love one another, it appears that God dwelleth in us, and that his love is perfected in us; for this is the beſt proof we can give of our love to him, and of the prevalence of his grace in our hearts, transforming us into his image.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. 2d. If this love of benevolence, this amazing goodneſs of God's nature, expreſſed in redeeming ſinners, and giving them eternal life through Chriſt, is ſo much the glory of the divine character, and ſuch a clear and bright expreſſion of his perfection and holineſs, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in ſcripture, this gives us reaſon to conclude that the love of which he himſelf is the object, is of the ſame nature and kind with this, viz. an infinite benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent regard to himſelf; and that his love to man, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in giving his ſon for his ſalvation, is a ſtream, and the brighteſt emanation from this fountain of love; and ſo ſhews the nature of the infinite divine love and holineſs. Therefore creatures have no need of any thing but this love, in order to be like God, little images of his infinite benevolence.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3d. God's love and regard to himſelf is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but neceſſarily included in this inſtance of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to ſinners, in giving his ſon to die, that they, through him, might live. This love to himſelf muſt be kept in view, in order to ſee his benevolence in giving his ſon to die for ſinners; for had God no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent regard to himſelf, and care for his own honor, there would have been no need of giving his ſon, that ſinners might live; as a mediator would have been needleſs, in
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012811_0056_0F8AC0444F8E2998"/>
order to his being reconciled to ſinners. So that God's ſupreme regard to himſelf is ſuppoſed, yea expreſſed and brought clearly into view, in giving his ſon to the world. And it is that regard to himſelf, and his own honor, which conſiſts in benevolence and its attendants and fruits, of which his benevolence to man is an emanation and fruit; or rather they are one and the ſame thing, acted out in the work of redemption. In this view, we may ſee how God's love in giving his ſon to die for ſinners is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and moſt clear diſplay of his holineſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in benevolence, and why men are repreſented as imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating God in the exerciſe of the love of benevolence; their love to God and one another, being one and the ſame undivided affection.</p>
               <p>WHAT God ſays to Moſes, when he beſought him to ſhew him his glory, ſerves to confirm what has been ſaid on the above paſſages of ſcripture. In anſwer to Moſes's petition, God ſays to him, 'I will make all my <hi>goodneſs</hi> paſs before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 33.19.</note> God here tells Moſes how he would ſhew his glory, and what it conſiſted in, viz. GOODNESS; ſovran goodneſs and mercy, which is the moſt diſintereſted bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence poſſible. If God ſhewed Moſes his glory, by cauſing <hi>all his goodneſs</hi> to paſs before him then God's holineſs, or his moral character, conſiſts in goodneſs; for holineſs is his glory.—And we are told how he did this; 'The Lord paſſed by before him, &amp; proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful &amp; gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth; <note n="§" place="bottom">By <hi>truth</hi> nothing diſtinct from goodneſs is intended: It denotes the immutability of divine goodneſs: It is goodneſs that never fails, and may be depended upon with the greateſt ſafety. Where there is no goodneſs, there is no truth and faithfulneſs; and theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties eſſential to the goodneſs of God.</note> keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſin,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012811_0057_0F8AC0451B86D060"/>
and that will by no means clear the guilty.' <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.</note> Here there is nothing expreſſed but the higheſt, God-like benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or diſintereſted goodneſs. This therefore is that in which God's glory conſiſts; conſequently this is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine holineſs; and this is the glory into which men are changed by the ſpirit of God, when they are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holineſs.</p>
               <p>When it is added, 'And that will by no means clear the guilty,' nothing is expreſſed contrary to goodneſs, or different from it; but it expreſſes the peculiar excellence and perfection of God's goodneſs. It is a goodneſs which regards the greateſt good of the whole; a goodneſs which regards the intereſt and honor of the divine being; ſo that none of his rights ſhall be given up, or his law ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in favour of man, that mercy may be ſhewed to him. This is the thing meant by his not clearing or acquitting the guilty. This is the ſame goodneſs which is opened and celebrated in the goſpel, manifeſted in God's giving his ſon to die for the redemption of ſinners, and granting them pardon and life through him. In this, God's love and regard to himſelf, and goodneſs and mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are joined together, as one and the ſame undivided thing: It is all divine benevolence; and it is the ſame goodneſs when it condemns and puniſhes the guilty, as when it pardons and ſaves the believer in Chriſt.—This goodneſs, this diſintereſted good will, is the glory of God: In this divine holineſs, the glory of God's moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſiſts; and ſo far as men exerciſe this goodneſs, they are holy as God is holy.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We are under great advantages to know what is true holineſs, by the character and example of Chriſt. He is the great pattern of holineſs, as it reſpects God and the creature; and the moſt bright and perfect inſtance of it, that ever was, or will be, on earth: He has acted it out to the life. He is both God and man; and if we can find what is the true moral excellence of his
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012811_0058_0F8AC045F50C9CB8"/>
character, we ſhall at the ſame time learn what divine and creature holineſs is, as it reſpects both God and man. It wholly conſiſted in conformity to that law, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid was fulfilled by love to God and our neighbour: Therefore it all conſiſted in love: And if we properly attend to what he has ſaid &amp; done, we may, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt certainty, determine the nature and kind of this love. His love to men was, in the higheſt degree, diſintereſted benevolence, as it was love to enemies; and ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for their good, as to lead him to be willing to take their miſery on himſelf, and bear it all, that they might eſcape, and live forever. This is the higheſt inſtance of pure, diſintereſted benevolence that ever was known; and it is commonly ſpoken of as ſuch, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it is owned to conſiſt very much in its being in ſuch a ſtriking degree <hi>diſintereſted</hi> love and goodneſs. Thus Chriſt's example of love to men conſiſts wholly in diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted goodneſs: If this is left out, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing holy and excellent.</p>
               <p>His love to God was alſo a diſintereſted, benevolent love, as it was acted out in ſeeking and promoting the glory of God. He ſought not his own glory, but the glory of him that ſent him. And this he himſelf ſpeaks of as that in which the diſtinguiſhing excellence of his character conſiſted. <note n="§" place="bottom">Joh. vii. 13. viii 50.</note> This was the great thing he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, as the work he had to do. 'I have glorified thee on earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. xvii. 4.</note> He ſubordinated every thing to this; and for its ſake, he gave up his own eaſe, and willingly endured the greateſt ſufferings. When in the view of his terrible ſufferings, he was reconciled to them, and willing to go through them, it was from a zeal for God's glory; and he expreſſed his whole heart in this matter, when he ſaid, 'Father glorify thy name.' <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh.</note> As if he had ſaid, 'Let God be glorified, and all my ends are anſwered; for the ſake of this, I have undertaken this work, and am willing to go
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012811_0059_0F8AC04689261638"/>
through the dreadful ſcene of ſufferings that is before me.' Thus, 'Chriſt PLEASED NOT HIMSELF, but, as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.' <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. xv. 31.</note> He pleaſed not himſelf, i. e. he ſought not himſelf, was not in the leaſt degree ſelfiſh; but at the greateſt diſtance from it. He had ſuch a ſtrong, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, benevolent regard to the glory of God, in the advancement of his kingdom, in the ſalvation of men, that all the reproach caſt upon God by ſin, fell with its full weight on him; and that he might vindicate the divine character, and take away the reproach that would come on God and his law, if ſinners were ſaved without a complete atonement, he took the reproach and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin on himſelf; that hereby God might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored in the ſalvation of ſinners. Thus <hi>he pleaſed not himſelf,</hi> but practiſed the greateſt ſelf-denial; and took all the evil on himſelf, that God might be glorified, and ſinners be ſaved: This St. Paul mentions as an example to his diſciples, in following which, they muſt not pleaſe themſelves, muſt not be ſelfiſh, and ſeek themſelves; but the good of others, in the exerciſe of diſintereſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. <note n="*" place="bottom">ver. 1, 2.</note> Thus he himſelf followed Chriſt, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his holineſs, which he ſought not his own profit, but the profit of many, that they might be ſaved. <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <p>1 Cor. x. 33. xi. 1. When the apoſtle ſays, 'I ſeek not mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved;' he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the moſt diſintereſted benevolence; and a diſpoſition to give up every thing that could be called his own, to promote the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many. In this he followed Chriſt, who pleaſed not himſelf, and ſought not his own profit, but gave himſelf away, delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to infinite evil, for the ſake of others, that they might be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe words lead us to the true ſenſe of that paſſage, which has been ſo difficult to many. 'For I could wiſh that myſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the fleſh.' Rom. ix. 3. The plain meaning of theſe words is, that he intereſted himſelf ſo much in the ſalvation of his brethren, that he was willing to give up all his own perſonal intereſt in Chriſt, for their ſakes, if by this means they might be ſaved. This is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine expreſſion of diſintereſted benevolence, which always gives up a leſs good for a greater, and the private good of individuals for the ſake of the public good, or the ſalvation of many. Therefore, if the apoſtle could ſave all his brethren by giving up his own perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, he ought to be ready to do it; for not to do it, in this caſe, would be to ſeek his own profit, in oppoſition to the profit of many, and to act moſt contrary to benevolence; and to the example of Chriſt, who gave himſelf a ranſom for many, and was willingly <hi>made a curſe,</hi> that men might be ſaved from it.</p>
                     <p>I know there have been many objections made to this ſenſe of the words. It is ſaid, this repreſents the apoſtle as willing to be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Chriſt, and to be damned forever, which is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. It is indeed a contradiction, that he ſhould be willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an enemy to Chriſt, in the exerciſe of that benevolence in which he imitated him, and acted as his friend: eſpecially that this benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhould <hi>make him willing</hi> to be Chriſt's enemy. But no ſuch thing is expreſſed in the words. The apoſtle might be willing to give up his own perſonal intereſt in Chriſt for the ſake of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of millions &amp; yet not be willing to be an enemy to Chriſt: And indeed it was impoſſible he ſhould be an enemy to him, while in the exerciſe of ſuch benevolence; juſt as impoſſible as it was that he ſhould be willing his brethren ſhould all be loſt, while he was ardently wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſalvation, tho' it were at the expence of his own.</p>
                     <p>As to his being willing to be damned; he was willing to give up all the happineſs, and ſuffer all the evil which was conſiſtent with his benevolence to his brethren, and the love to Chriſt implied in this: But this benevolence was inconſiſtent with his being really miſerable; for he would be ſo gratified in their ſalvation by his means, and he ſo placed his happineſs in this, that he muſt be in a great degree hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, much more ſo than he could be in any poſſible enjoyment, which he ſhould have, at the expence of their ſalvation, or while deſtitute of this benevolence.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible this ſenſe of the words is moſt contrary to all <hi>ſelfiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; but it is perfectly conſiſtent with that charity, that diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted benevolence, which 'ſeeketh not her own,' but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved; without which it is impoſſible to be a true follower of Chriſt,</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:012811_0060_0F8AC0474B23E208"/>And here, by the way, we may ſee how Chriſt ſought one undivided intereſt in the exerciſe of diſintereſted benevolence. He was devoted to the greateſt general good, the glory of God in the ſalvation of ſinners; or that kingdom of God in which God is glorified in the higheſt degree, and all the good of the creature is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. So that his being wholly devoted to the glory of God in all he did and ſuffered, was not in the leaſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012811_0061_0F8AC049B536AA58"/>
with his benevolence to man, nor did in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree exclude it; but the latter is implied in the former, and the more benevolence he exerciſed towards God in ſeeking his glory, the more love did he exerciſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to man: So that Chriſt did not only ſeek the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the ſalvation of men, and expreſs his love to God and man, in the ſame actions; but this was one and the ſame undivided affection, which centered in one and the ſame thing, the greateſt happineſs and glory of God's kingdom, or the greateſt good of the whole; ſo that he really ſought but one thing, which is all compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the glory of God. And this may ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a difficulty which has riſen in the minds of ſome perſons, with reſpect to this. They have aſked, 'If the ultimate end of Chriſt in what he did and ſuffered was the glory of God, ſo that this was the greateſt, and in a ſenſe, the only thing he had in view, and this induced him to be willing to ſuffer unto death; how can he be ſaid to lay down his life for man, out of pure benevolence to him? He never would have done this, had it not been for the love he had to God, and regard for his glory. What reaſon then has the ſinner to thank him, for doing it out of love to him? Certainly if he was chiefly influenced in this by love to God, his regard to man had but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ſmall influence in this affair.'</p>
               <p>The ſolution is, the benevolence which Chriſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards God, and towards men, is one undivided af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The glory of God, and the ſalvation of men by Chriſt, are not to be diſtinguiſhed, as different objects of purſuit. Therefore in ſeeking the glory of God, he ſought the ſalvation of men, and in ſeeking the ſalvation of men, he ſought the glory of God, the one being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily included in the other. And in this does the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the moral excellence of Chriſt conſiſt, according to ſcripture. Therefore we are left at no loſs about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true holineſs in God and in the creature. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in diſintereſted benevolence, and all that affection
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012811_0062_0F8AC04A8571B128"/>
which is included in this, in oppoſition to ſelf-love.</p>
               <p>OBJ. But Chriſt himſelf ſought his own intereſt and glory, and had reſpect to the recompence of reward; 'who <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him,</hi> endured the croſs,' &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. 1. Jeſus Chriſt, in the exerciſe of diſintereſted benevolence, ſought the glory of God, and the higheſt happineſs and glory of his kingdom in the ſalvation of men, as the greateſt good. In this he placed his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and joy. This was the great end he ſought in endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the croſs, this was the joy that was ſet before him. Therefore he was ſo far from pleaſing or ſeeking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this, that the reward he ſought was the object of diſintereſted affection, and nothing elſe. His benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſet this up as a good, for the ſake of which he was willing to give up his life, and ſuffer an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. Chriſt's own honor and intereſt is included in the glory of God, and the greateſt good of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As God, his own glory is the ſame with the glory of the Father: As man, his intereſt is great, as well as of infinite importance to the good of the whole. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as has been ſhewn, diſintereſted benevolence, or love to God and men, implies a regard to himſelf, and a joy in his own happineſs and glory. There is not the leaſt degree of ſelfiſhneſs in this; but 'tis eſſential to diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted benevolence.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. We may learn what is the nature of true holineſs from what Chriſt ſays to his diſciples: 'Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy; but I ſay unto you, love your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you,—that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good.—For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the Publicans
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012811_0063_0F8AC04C925C0708"/>
the ſame?—Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.' <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. v. 43—48.</note>
               </p>
               <p>On this paſſage of ſcripture we may obſerve the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. What our Saviour here condemns is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> which had been, by the Jewiſh teachers, juſtified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, as true holineſs, and obedience to the divine law, requiring us to love our neighbour as ourſelves. By our neighbour, they underſtood one who is kind to us, and our hearty friend. And our enemy they diſtinguiſhed from neighbour, and put in oppoſition to him, and taught that the latter is to be hated, that it is our duty to do ſo, and the former loved. This interpretation made the command very eaſy indeed, and brought it down to ſuit the heart of the moſt wicked man on earth. And all the ſelfiſh religion that is taught now is as agreeable to corrupt nature, as this was then; which leads me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt condemns this, and enjoins directly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, even the moſt diſintereſted good will, in loving our worſt enemy, with that kind, benevolent affection, which will lead us to do him all the good in our power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſhews that this ſelfiſh love has nothing of the nature of true holineſs, by obſerving that ſinners, even the worſt of them, exerciſed ſuch love. They love thoſe that love them; for ſelfiſhneſs itſelf will do this. And by the way, Chriſt not only condemns ſelfiſhneſs here, as no part of holineſs, and in oppoſition to it; but his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuppoſes that Publicans and ſinners, yea, all that are not the children of God, are wholly deſtitute of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for if they were not, his argument would not be concluſive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore love to enemies is here enjoined as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the character of a diſciple of Chriſt; ſo that no love which does not imply this diſintereſted benevolence, or love to enemies, is the love in which holineſs conſiſts,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012811_0064_0F8AC04D469F05C8"/>
by which the true diſciples of Chriſt are diſtinguiſhed from others; every thing elſe, which does not imply this, being found with ſinners. According to this, diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted benevolence, or that love which will extend to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is the holy love which diſtinguiſhes the true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt from all others, and nothing will paſs for true holineſs in Chriſt's account, but ſuch love, and what is implied in it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is by ſuch love alone that they are conformed to God, and formed after the likeneſs of his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or holineſs. When Chriſt tells his diſciples, that by loving their enemies, they ſhould be the children of their Father which is in heaven, i. e, imitators or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God as dear children, it is implied that they could become ſo by nothing elſe. So that in this view, this kind of love is repreſented as the only holy love, as 'tis the only love by which they imitate God. And it hence follows alſo, that this is the love in which the divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs conſiſts: For if it conſiſted in any thing of another kind, which this did not imply, they might be like God without love to their enemies. According to this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, God's holineſs, which conſiſts in love to himſelf and his creatures, is ſuch, that it carries in its nature love to enemies; and therefore that love which is not of ſuch a nature, is not true holineſs. Therefore the chriſtian's love to God and Chriſt is of the ſame nature with love to enemies, which is diſintereſted benevolence; and in this his holineſs conſiſts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may alſo obſerve from this paſſage, though 'tis not immediately to the point we are upon, that the holy love by which chriſtians are diſtinguiſhed from others, will love God even though he were our enemy; therefore it is not neceſſary we ſhould ſee him to be our friend, or that he loves us, in order to our loving him. They who hold this, and that all true love to God is of this kind, teach a ſelfiſh religion, directly contrary to what Chriſt taught, and which he ſaid publicans and ſinners might
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012811_0065_0F8AC05136C80C40"/>
have as well as chriſtians. If we cannot be Chriſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, unleſs we have a heart to love our enemies, even ſuch as are ſo unjuſtly, and are doing us all the injury they can; then none are his diſciples who have not a heart to love God, even though he is their enemy, and diſpoſed to curſe and deſtroy them; who cannot be an unjuſt and injurious enemy. Surely that diſpoſition which will love an enemy, who is unjuſtly and injuriouſly ſo, will not find it hard to love an enemy, who is ſo with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon and juſtice. And all true love to God is of this kind; it is ſuch a generous, diſintereſted, benevolent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that it is ſo far from originating from a belief of his love to us, that we ſhould continue to love him, even though he appeared to be our enemy; and that love which would fail in this caſe, is not true holineſs. Therefore it is certain, that he who does not love his enemies, does not love God with a true holy love. This is, at leaſt, implicitly aſſerted here by our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That all true holineſs conſiſts in diſintereſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent affection, and what is implied in this, is evident from what St. Paul ſays, 1 Cor. xiii. Here the apoſtle ſpeaks of charity as compriſing all real holineſs, or true religion; by which he means that love to God and our neighbour, which the law of God requires. <note n="*" place="bottom">The word in the original ſignifies <hi>love,</hi> and ought to have been ſo tranſlated here, as it is above an hundred times in the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He ſays, whatever gifts and attainments a man may have, which may be without this love, he is ſtill nothing, and they will be no profit to him. And whatever exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes he has, and whatever he may do or ſuffer, and not have this love, he is yet nothing; by which it is very ſtrongly aſſerted, that love is true holineſs, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe has any thing of this nature. In giving the character of this holy love in its exerciſes, he ſays, IT SEEKETH NOT HER OWN. <note n="§" place="bottom">Ver. 5.</note> This aſcertains the nature of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012811_0066_0F8AC052D53C6AA8"/>
this love beyond diſpute. It is not ſelf-love, in whole or in part; for this always ſeeks it's own, and nothing elſe. Yea, 'tis ſet in oppoſition to ſelf-love, it SEEKETH NOT her own. Nothing can anſwer to this deſcription but that diſintereſted affection which conſiſts in benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and what is implied in it; and this anſwers to it exactly. It is ſo deſcribed here, that nothing elſe can be meant. Therefore the apoſtle exhorts chriſtians to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this ſame holy love in the following words, 'Let no man ſeek his own: But every man another's wealth.' <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. x. 24.</note> Let no man ſeek his own, i. e. <hi>as his own,</hi> in a ſelfiſh way. All ſelfiſhneſs is wholly forbidden. Let him put on that holy love which ſeeketh not her own; but ſomething elſe, viz. the general good of all. This charity, this benevolent, diſintereſted affection, is the only bond of holy union among intelligent beings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called the bond of perfectneſs,' i. e. the moſt perfect bond. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Col. iii. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The words of St. Paul, 'Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,' <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. x. 31.</note> might he mentioned here as pointing out the nature of holineſs, as exerciſed towards God. It is ſuch a love to God, which implies and conſiſts in ſeeking his glory conſtantly in every action. But nothing but benevolence will do this. It is ſtrange that any ſhould think good will is not to be exerciſed towards God, when we are in every thing to ſeek his glory; for the leaſt reflection on the matter, muſt convince every one, that nothing but good will, or friendly affection towards God, will ſeek his glory, or care any thing about it. This is to be conſtantly exerciſed towards God; ſo as in the ſtrength of it to devote our ſelves, every action, all we are, and all we have, to his intereſt and glory. And this is to exerciſe kind, diſintereſted affection towards God; in which we give up every other intereſt, for the ſake of his glory.</p>

                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:012811_0067_0F8AC053493BE440"/>VII. Chriſtians are expreſsly ſaid to live not unto themſelves, but unto Chriſt. 'And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth <hi>live unto themſelves</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but unto him which died for them, and roſe again. For none of us liveth to himſelf, and no man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto himſelf. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord.' <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 15. Rom. xiv. 7, 8.</note> Here the chriſtian's life of holineſs, is ſet in oppoſition to ſelf-love, in which men live unto themſelves; which was their caſe before their converſion, and denotes a ſtate of total corruption: I ſay, chriſtian holineſs is oppoſed to this, and therefore muſt be diſintereſted affection; a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent regard to Chriſt, by which men devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to him, living to his glory, and ſeeking the advancement of his kingdom; which implies love to men, and ſeeking the greateſt general good.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Scripture holineſs is that by which men devote and conſecrate themſelves to God, to be wholly for his uſe and ſervice. This is expreſſed by being holy <hi>unto God</hi>; it is therefore called, <hi>holineſs to the Lord.</hi> It is with reference to this that all men &amp; things, which were in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner conſecrated to the ſervice of God by the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ritual, were called <hi>holy</hi>; as there was in this conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an outward image and reſemblance of true holineſs; which is a voluntary conſecration to God, and devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his ſervice. This is the ſame with <hi>giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Lord.</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Cor. viii. 5</note>
               </p>
               <p>This will lead us to place holineſs in that univerſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, which has the kingdom of God for its object, and ſubordinates all to this. This conſecrates a man to God, his honor, intereſt and kingdom, in the ſtrongeſt manner; and effectually draws him off from every other intereſt: and no other kind of affection will do this.— Therefore this is holineſs, according to ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Who can attend to this ſcripture account of holineſs, and not be ſenſible that univerſal, diſintereſted goodneſs
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012811_0068_0F8AC0540805B600"/>
is the leading and moſt eſſential thing in it; and that where this is wanting, there is no holineſs; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the whole? The word <hi>love</hi> is ſeldom, if ever, uſed in any other ſenſe in the bible, where a holy affection is meant. And this is perfectly agreeable to the account that has been given of true holineſs, which is the only reaſonable, conſiſtent idea that can be given of it, viz. That it is univerſal benevolence, and all that love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and delight, and every diſintereſted affection which is implied in this; and cannot take place without it.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION VII.</hi> Anſwers to ſeveral objections againſt the foregoing account of true holineſs.</head>
               <p>OBJ. I. TRUE chriſtians ought to have reſpect to the reward they ſhall receive in heaven, for what they do &amp; ſuffer in this world. It is expreſsly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Moſes had; &amp; is ſpoken of as part of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his character. This is contrary to the <hi>diſintereſted</hi> affection, in which it is ſaid all true religion conſiſts.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. If the recompence of reward, that Moſes had reſpect to, conſiſted in being confirmed in God's ſervice and favour forever, and put under the greateſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to glorify God, and promote the intereſt of his church, and in ſeeing this accompliſhed to the higheſt degree; then there was nothing ſelfiſh in this, but it was the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine exerciſe of that diſintereſted religion, which conſiſts in love to God and our neighbour. The diſintereſted, benevolent perſon ſeeks a recompence of reward, as much as any other perſon can, and more; but 'tis a reward with which benevolence itſelf is well pleaſed, and not ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs. Selfiſhneſs never ſeeks the reward which God gives his people; this is ſuited to gratify benevolence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012811_0069_0F8AC054D2D59820"/>
Therefore it is reſpected and ſought only in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of benevolence.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. It has been obſerved, that the benevolent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeeks his own higheſt good, as this is included in the higheſt good of the whole; and that his attention and concern is more particularly turned to this intereſt, as 'tis more in his view, and is more eſpecially under his care, and he is under better advantages to promote it, than the intereſt of another. Therefore it is no argument of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Moſes, or any other man, that he has reſpect to his own future happineſs.</p>
               <p>OBJ. II. The promiſes and threatenings in God's word are all directed to ſelf-love. They ſuppoſe that all men have ſelf-love, and are ſuited to influence this, and nothing elſe. If a perſon has nothing but diſintereſted affection, promiſes &amp; threatenings will be of no uſe to him. If men ought not to have any ſelf-love, why does God addreſs himſelf to that in his word, and ſeek to lead men to avoid ſin, and practiſe holineſs, in the exerciſe of ſelf-love?</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. The promiſes and threatenings in the word of God, ſuppoſe men poſſeſſed of a deſire after happineſs, with an averſion to evil, and a regard for their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, anſwerable to its worth. This is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with the moſt diſintereſted affection, that it is implied in it, as has been proved at large.<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 19, 20, 21.</note> Therefore promiſes of good, and threatenings of evil, are as much ſuited to influence the benevolent perſon, as him that is ſelfiſh.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. The good promiſed is a good which benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſeeks, and it has the moſt perfect averſion to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil threatened; and the benevolent perſon has a much more clear and realizing view and ſenſe of the greatneſs and deſirableneſs of the good, and the dreadfulneſs of the evil, than the ſelfiſh perſon can have. This being ſo, the promiſes and threatenings in the bible are ſo far from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that men ought to regard them from ſelf-love, or
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012811_0070_0F8AC055895D0C88"/>
that there is any ſelfiſhneſs in true religion, that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end is anſwered only in them who are influenced by diſintereſted benevolence; and ſuch only pay a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them. The ſelfiſh perſon may be influenced many ways, and to a great degree, by the threatenings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in God's word: They may excite high hopes and great fears, and reſtrain him from many things he would otherwiſe practice, and lead him to do many things; but they will not influence him to forſake ſin, and practice ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or to love God and his neighbour; but after all, he is as much under the power of ſin as ever.</p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerved, that the promiſes are not made to ſelfiſh exerciſes and doings; and therefore, rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, are not ſuited to encourage ſelf-love, but bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. All the promiſes &amp; threatenings in the bible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſelfiſhneſs, &amp; are calculated to deſtroy it, &amp; encourage diſintereſted affection, love to God and our neighbour, ſo far are they from encouraging ſelf-love.</p>
               <p>Chriſt promiſes honor and exaltation to them who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves. Should any one hence infer, that this promiſe was deſigned to encourage pride in ſeeking exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and honor, and that pride is a duty, he would be guilty of great abſurdity and ſelf-contradiction; for this would be ſaying, a man ought to exerciſe pride in ſeeking humility; and that Chriſt has ſet before us a motive to excite pride, in order to induce us to be humble. This promiſe is ſo far from encouraging pride, that it tends to deſtroy it. The honor and exaltation promiſed, is not that which pride ſeeks, but that which is moſt oppoſite to it. And ſhould a proud man be hence influenced by his pride, to ſeek humility, he might put on ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearances of it; but he would be as far as ever from real humility, for by the ſuppoſition, all his exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are exerciſes of pride; and humility is not the object of his deſire, but of his averſion. This may ſerve to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the caſe before us, and ſhew how far the divine promiſes are from being ſuited to encourage pride and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012811_0071_0F8AC056479AF9C8"/>
ſelfiſhneſs; and that they encourage nothing but benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And it alſo leads to another anſwer.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. The great and chief good which is promiſed in the word of God, is not a good that pleaſes ſelfiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and therefore is not deſigned nor ſuited to excite ſelf-love. As the duties to which the promiſes are made, are contrary to ſelf-love; ſo is the chief good that is promiſed. The honor and exaltation promiſed to humility, are as contrary to pride, as is humility itſelf. The honor which the proud man ſeeks, is not the ſame which Chriſt promiſes to him who humbleth himſelf; but entirely of a different nature, and contrary to it. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who humbles himſelf, renounces that ſelf-exaltation and honor, in compariſon with other beings, which pride and ſelfiſhneſs ſeek; and places his honor and happineſs in abaſing himſelf, &amp; becoming the ſervant of all, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting God, and promoting his glory, and ſerving his fellow-creatures; miniſtring to their greateſt good, in the exerciſe of univerſal benevolence; and ſo obtains true exaltation and honor, which is moſt contrary to ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pride. So the happineſs in general, which is the ſubject of divine promiſes, is not a happineſs which ſuits ſelf-love, nor can it be induced to deſire and ſeek it. This is a happineſs which conſiſts in glorifying God and promoting the intereſt of his kingdom: In devoting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to this; and ſeeing it promoted to the higheſt degree. This good is therefore juſt as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſelf-love, as is univerſal, diſintereſted benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. This good is ſuited to pleaſe the benevolent, and excite them to purſue the practice of holineſs, and ſeek this glory, honor and happineſs; but to ſelf-love, is the object of averſion.</p>
               <p>If theſe things are well conſidered, it will appear how groundleſs this objection is. If the benevolent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is as capable of being influenced by promiſes and threatenings, as any one elſe, and much more; and theſe are ſuited to animate him in the practice
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012811_0072_0F8AC0571A7F2078"/>
of diſintereſted, univerſal benevolence and goodneſs.— If the promiſes and threatenings in the bible are, in a peculiar manner, ſuited to encourage and promote benevolence.—If neither the duty to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made, nor the chief good promiſed, is agreeable to ſelf-love, nor can be choſen and embraced by it: Then there being ſo many promiſes &amp; threatenings in the bible, is not the leaſt evidence that true religion does not conſiſt in diſintereſted affection, or that ſelf-love is any part of it. But the contrary appears with ſtrong and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible evidence, even from theſe conſiderations,—</p>
               <p>OBJ. III. There is not ſuch a difference and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between what is called benevolence and ſelf-love, as has been ſuppoſed; nor is there any ſuch thing as <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted</hi> benevolence; men are ſeeking their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all their affections and exerciſes. He that ſeeks the good of another, does it becauſe he takes pleaſure in it; and he ſeeks his own pleaſure and happineſs as much as he who ſeeks his own perſonal good only; and the one is as much ſelf-love as the other, And men are friendly to one thing rather than another, becauſe one gives them pleaſure, and the other does not: So that ſelf-love is at the bottom of all; and one man is really as ſelf-fiſh as another; all the difference is, one man's ſelfiſhneſs operates in a different way from that of another man: All love ſprings from ſelf-love, and cannot be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from it.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. If by ſelf-love the objector means a general appetite to happineſs, and averſion to miſery, or a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of pleaſure and pain; 'tis granted that this takes place in benevolence, as much as in ſelf-love. But, as has been ſhewn, this is in itſelf neither ſelfiſhneſs, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted affection; but only a capacity for either.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. 'Tis true that diſintereſted affection gives a higher pleaſure and enjoyment than ſelf-love; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis greatly for a perſon's intereſt to place his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the glory of God, and the intereſt of his kingdom,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012811_0073_0F8AC057C74753B8"/>
and the greateſt good of mankind: But it does not hence follow, that the pleaſure to be enjoyed in loving God and our neighbour is the cauſe of this love, or the inducement to a ſelfiſh perſon to love God, in order to anſwer a ſelfiſh end, and make himſelf happy. I ſay, this does not follow, for two reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is to put the cauſe for the effect, and the effect for the cauſe. The ground and reaſon of a perſon's tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure in the happineſs of his neighbour, is his diſintereſted good will to him; and not this pleaſure the cauſe of his good will to his neighbour. But the objector ſuppoſes the latter, viz. that the pleaſure a perſon has in benevolence is the cauſe of his loving his neighbour, which is abſurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a contradiction in ſuppoſing that ſelf-love will lead a perſon to place his happineſs in his neighbour's good; for the latter ſtands in direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the former. Selfiſhneſs is directly oppoſed to a perſon's placing his happineſs in the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This conſiſts in an oppoſite affection, which ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be reconciled to. Nor can the ſelfiſh perſon ſo much as have an idea of the enjoyment which attends benevolence; and therefore 'tis impoſſible that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs benevolence gives, ſhould be a prevailing motive with him, to love and ſeek the happineſs of another, that he may hereby make himſelf happy.</p>
               <p>If one ſhould ſuppoſe that becauſe exaltation and honor is the certain attendant of humility, this will induce a proud man, in the exerciſe of his pride, to be humble, for the ſake of the honor he will obtain by it; and therefore that pride &amp; humility are at bottom the ſame thing, &amp; ſeek the ſame honor, the ſuppoſition would be as conſiſtent and rational, as that we are conſidering.</p>
               <p>If a perſon places his happineſ in the good of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it may be aſked, how came he to do this, rather than another; &amp; by what medium does he enjoy this pleaſure? The anſwer muſt be this; the former is a friend to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012811_0074_0F8AC05891B29BF0"/>
and this gives him pleaſure in his happineſs: Whereas the latter is not his friend, and bears no good will to him, but regards his own intereſt only, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot take pleaſure in his neighbour's good. The character of theſe two men are eſſentially different; their exerciſes are of a different and oppoſite nature; the latter is a lover of his own ſelf only; the former loves his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf, and is ſo united to him, in diſintereſted good will, that he neceſſarily ſhares in his happineſs. In this caſe he does not love his neighbour, in order to get poſſeſſion of his happineſs, this is not the motive of his benevolence; for this is a contradiction. It is impoſſible he ſhould get poſſeſſion of his neighbour's happineſs in this way, &amp; from this motive, for ſo far as he acts from ſuch a motive, he, by the ſuppoſition, cares nothing about it, and it is no happineſs to him. Nothing but diſintereſted benevolence will give him a ſhare in his neighbour's good; this is the ground and cauſe of his enjoying it, and not a deſire of enjoying this happineſs the ground of his benevolence. So far as a man deſires to enjoy his neighbour's happineſs from ſelf-love, juſt ſo far he is incapable of enjoying it. The more he deſires it therefore, in this ſenſe, the further he is from it.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. Diſintereſted good will, which puts a man in poſſeſſion of his neighbour's happineſs, alſo makes him ſhare in his miſery, if he is miſerable, and bear his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. But this is moſt contrary to ſelf-love; therefore it is oppoſed to benevolence. If ſelf-love would lead a perſon to take pleaſure in his neighbour's happineſs, and ſhare in his good, and this were poſſible; it would not certainly, deſire to ſhare in his miſery, and ſo put him in poſſeſſion of that too. But benevolence does this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not ſelf-love, nor the fruit and offspring of it; but an affection of a different and oppoſite nature.</p>
               <p>OBJ. IV. Holineſs conſiſts, in part, in hatred of ſin; therefore it does not wholly conſiſt in love; for hatred is oppoſite to love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:012811_0075_0F8AC05947BB3B98"/>ANS. Hatred of ſin is not oppoſed to the love of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence; for we may love them who are moſt vile and odious, with a love of good will, and are commanded to do it. And God loved ſinners with the greateſt benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, while they were moſt odious to him, and hated them with a perfect hatred of diſapprobation and diſplicence. Thus we may, and are obliged to love and hate the ſame perſons at the ſame time, in many inſtances, to love them with a love of good will, and yet hate them with a hatred of diſplicence.</p>
               <p>Nor is this diſplicence, and hatred of ſin, oppoſed to the love of complacence, ſo as to imply any thing of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature. Hatred of ſin is implied in all holy love; and that affection which takes complacence in holineſs, is exerciſed in the hatred of ſin; it being in its nature one and the ſame thing, exerciſed towards different objects. Love to God is, in its nature, diſpleaſure at enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and neceſſarily hates thoſe who hate him; not with the hatred of ill will, but of diſapprobation and diſplicence.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION VIII.</hi> Inferences from the foregoing account of the nature of true holineſs.</head>
               <p n="1">I. FROM the view that has been given of holineſs, we are led to obſerve the impropriety many have been guilty of in ſpeaking of holy, chriſtian love, as conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly, if not wholly, in love of complacence. It has been very common, where love to God, and love to our brother is ſpoken of and explained, very much, if not wholly, to overlook the love of benevolence, and keep the love of complacence chiefly or altogether in view. This is not agreeable to ſcripture, which I truſt appears
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012811_0076_0F8AC05A08E8F1E0"/>
from what has been ſaid. The love of benevolence is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept in view there, as what comprehends the whole of holy love; and we cannot have, or communicate a proper notion of holineſs, if we depart from the holy ſcripture in this particular. This has doubtleſs been the occaſion of great confuſion, and many miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We may hence learn what true <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is, and in what it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Our Lord teaches us, that in becoming his diſciple, a man muſt deny himſelf: That there is no other way to be a chriſtian; and this muſt be practiſed in every ſtep in which men follow him, 'If any man will come after me, let him <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> and take up his croſs daily, and follow me.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. ix. 23.</note> This ſelf-denial conſiſts, moſt eſſentially in acting contrary to ſelf-love, in croſſing that, &amp; giving up the intereſt that it ſeeks, for the ſake of ſome other intereſt; or in giving up our own private, perſonal intereſt, for the ſake of the glory of God, &amp; the greateſt good of mankind; which is the ſame with exerciſing diſintereſted affection; or to love God with all our heart, &amp; our neighbour as ourſelves. Self-denial conſiſts in the exerciſe and practice of true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as it has been deſcribed above, and in nothing elſe; in which ſelf is renounced, &amp; men forſake the whole intereſt which ſelf-love ſeeks, for the ſake of the kingdom of God. Whatever men do or ſuffer, whatever they give up, for the ſake of this, they deny themſelves; and where there is no thing of this diſintereſted love exerciſed, there is no ſelf-denial, whatever is done or ſuffered; as ſelf is not in the leaſt renounced. Chriſt himſelf is the moſt perfect example of ſelf-denial; which conſiſted in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not his own glory, but the glory of the Father, and the greateſt good of the creation, in promoting the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the whole of which is expreſſed by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the following words, 'For even Chriſt <hi>pleaſed not himſelf.</hi>'</p>
               <p>Self-denial does not therefore conſiſt meerly in croſſing
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012811_0077_0F8AC05C0DD8EFE8"/>
our natural inclinations, in parting with that which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dear to us, or going through great toil and ſufferings, to obtain ſome end. When this is done, not for our own ſake, or from ſelf-love; but for Chriſt's ſake, or for the ſake of the kingdom of God, it is true ſelf-denial. But when it is done for our own ſakes wholly, there is no ſelf-denial in it. The moſt ſelfiſh creature in the world may part with one good for the ſake of another, by which he greatly croſſes ſome of his inclinations and appetites; and may go through great labour and ſufferings, purely to pleaſe himſelf, or gratify his ſelf-love. Thus a man may give up his eaſe, and practice hard ſervice and toil, throughout a whole year, for the ſake of the wages he is to receive, while he is wholly ſelfiſh in what he does and ſuffers, having no regard to any other intereſt but his own. So a man may be willing to do and ſuffer many things, and croſs many of his own natural inclinations to a great degree, for the ſake of his eternal intereſt, that he may obtain ſalvation, purely from ſelf-love. In this there is no ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>A man may give all his goods to the poor, and devote his whole life to the moſt ſevere diſcipline, and practice the greateſt auſterities imaginable; and then give his body to be burned, with a view to eſcape hell, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heaven; and yet if he has not that charity which ſeeketh not her own, but does and ſuffers all wholly under the influence of ſelf-love, there is no true ſelf-denial in it; but it is as really ſelf-gratification, and pleaſing himſelf, as if he indulged his ſenſual appetites in riot and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and there is really no more true religion in it. For there is no more true holineſs in deſiring and ſeeking eternal happineſs in a ſelfiſh way, and from ſelf-love, than there is in deſiring any temporal, worldly enjoyment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Of this ſort, we have reaſon to think, are all the abſtinences, faſtings, prayers, whippings and auſterities, as well as giving large ſums of money, practiſed by multitudes in the popiſh world, for the ſake of obtaining the heaven they have in view. And of the ſame kind are all the labours and painful doings and ſufferings; all the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and abſtinences; yea, every thing elſe that men do or ſuffer is the practice of religion, and with a view to obtain ſalvation, in the proteſtant world, or any where elſe, who act wholly from ſelf-love, and have no diſintereſted regard to Chriſt and his kingdom. There is no ſelf-denial in all this.—But, by the way, the heaven and happineſs which theſe ſelfiſh perſons are ſeeking by all their pains, whether in popiſh or proteſtant countries, is no more like the true happineſs and haven, than is the mahometan paradiſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:012811_0078_0F8AC05CDAE33D60"/>But here two queſtions ariſe, which may be worthy of particular conſideration, as it may ſerve to throw ſome further light on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>QUEST. I. Do perſons give up their <hi>eternal intereſt</hi> in ſelf-denial, ſo as not to have a ſelfiſh regard to this in their religious exerciſes? 'Tis eaſy to ſee that perſons may and ought to give up their own private, temporal intereſt, in many inſtances, at leaſt, and to a great degree, for the ſake of others, and to promote the greater general good. —But is it not unreaſonable, and even impoſſible, for them to diſregard and give up their own <hi>eternal intereſt,</hi> for the ſake of others, or for any thing whatſoever?—</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. Whatever temporal good any one gives up for the ſake of his own eternal intereſt, and wholly from ſelf-love, he is, by the ſuppoſition, as ſelfiſh in this, as he can be in any thing whatſoever; and therefore there is no ſelf-denial in it, if ſelf-denial is acting contrary to ſelf, or denying ourſelves. So that he who does not know how to deny himſelf with reſpect to his eternal intereſt, is really a ſtranger to ſelf-denial. To give up our temporal, worldly intereſt, for the ſake of eternal happineſs, wholly under the influence of ſelf-love, is as real an inſtance of ſelfiſhneſs, as parting with all we have now, to poſſeſs a large eſtate the next year. Therefore, if no perſon can renounce his eternal intereſt, in opppoſition to a ſelfiſh regard to it, there is no ſuch thing in nature as ſelf-denial, or public, diſintereſted affection. But let it be kept in mind, that in the practice of the greateſt ſelf-denial, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon does not diveſt himſelf of a love of happineſs; for this is impoſſible, as has been ſhewn, as well as contrary
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012811_0079_0F8AC05EE013C6D8"/>
to the ſuppoſition. But he places his happineſs, not in his own private intereſt; but in a good more worthy to be ſought, viz. the glory of God, and the proſperity of his church and kingdom. For the ſake of this, he gives up the former, and forgets himſelf.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. There is the ſame reaſon why ſelf-love ſhould be wholly croſſed, in every inſtance, as there is that it ſhould be croſſed at all; ſo the ſame reaſon that our whole intereſt, ſo far as 'tis the object of ſelf-love, ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up, for the ſake of an intereſt of unſpeakable more worth.</p>
               <p>True benevolence always ſeeks the greateſt good of the whole; and is a diſpoſition to give up the leſs good for the greater. That affection which heſitates at this, and makes any ſelfiſh conditions, is private affection, not public love. If benevolence will lead us to forſake our perſonal intereſt, in any degree, it will lead us to forſake it <hi>wholly,</hi> for the greater good of others, if it is exerciſed to a ſufficient degree, and there is nothing ſelfiſh in us to counter-act and oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>If we conſider what GOD is, how infinitely great, important and deſirable, and of what infinite worth are his being, happineſs and glory; and how infinitely worthy and excellent he is: What an abſolute and infinite right he has to us, and to all creatures, to diſpoſe of them as he ſees fit, in his infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, for his own happineſs and glory, and for the greateſt glory and happineſs of his kingdom: I ſay, if we well conſider this, it muſt appear moſt fit and reaſonable, that we ſhould love him above all, and without any reſerve, i. e. with all our hearts, &amp;c. and give up ourſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to him, to be for his uſe, that his ends may be anſwered by us; and he be, in the higheſt degree, bleſſed, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and his kingdom moſt happy and glorious forever, let what will become of us, and without making any conditions with regard to ourſelves. Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us always to feel ſo towards GOD, and place our
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012811_0080_0F8AC05F45C5D820"/>
whole happineſs in his felicity and glory; having in this ſenſe, no will of our own. But this is denying ourſelves, and giving up the whole of our own intereſt for his ſake. A chooſing to be wholly devoted to him, and to be and do every thing wholly for his ſake, is to chooſe to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our own ſakes; which is to give up the whole that ſelf-love ſeeks.</p>
               <p>If we make conditions in this caſe, and are willing that God ſhould be ſupreme, and have the whole diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of us, and glorify himſelf by us, IF he will ſecure our higheſt perſonal intereſt, and employ all his wiſdom and goodneſs in our behalf; but are diſpoſed to oppoſe this, on any other condition; there is no diſintereſted affection to God in this, nor indeed any true love to him; nor is there any ſelf-denial in it: Yea, it is itſelf real oppoſition to God; and the moſt ſelfiſh creature, and the greateſt enemy to God in the univerſe, may be brought to this, conſiſtent with all his ſelfiſhneſs and enmity.</p>
               <p>It is true, indeed, as has been ſhewn, that the moſt diſintereſted affection does not exclude proper regard to our own being and intereſt; but neceſſarily includes it: But it muſt be obſerved, that if our own perſonal intereſt is inconſiſtent with the general good; univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will give it all up, for the ſake of this greater good; for to be unwilling to give up our own intereſt, when the public good requires it, is criminal ſelfiſhneſs, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to being in general; and therefore enmity againſt God.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon for which I ſhall be willing that the intereſt of any individual in the univerſe ſhould not be regarded, but given up, when inconſiſtent with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good, I ſhall be willing to give up my own intereſt, on the ſame ſuppoſition, if I am governed by benevolence. Therefore, however great and important is our whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, temporal and eternal, we ought to be willing to give it all up, if it is inconſiſtent with the higheſt intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the greateſt glory of HIM who is at the head of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012811_0081_0F8AC064DA4EF470"/>
and the ſum of all being and perfection; and true benevolence will do this; ſince the latter intereſt is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater, and more important than the former, and that not worthy of any regard, in compariſon with this.</p>
               <p>But this leads to another queſtion.</p>
               <p>QUEST. II. How can our eternal intereſt be inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the greateſt diſplay of God's glory, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſt of his kingdom? Are not theſe ſo united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they cannot be ſeparated; how than can the former be given up, for the ſake of the latter?—</p>
               <p>ANS. If we know that we are true chriſtians, we may be ſure that 'tis for the glory of God, and good of the whole, that we ſhould be eternally happy in his kingdom. But even in this caſe, we are capable of making the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it would not be ſo; and, on this ſuppoſition, we ſhall be diſpoſed to give up all our perſonal intereſt, ſo far as we are in the exerciſe of diſintereſted affection, and willing to deny ourſelves.—But if we do not know that we have embraced the goſpel, we cannot be ſure that 'tis, on the whole, moſt for the honor of God, and the glory and happineſs of his kingdom, that our eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſhould be ſecured: So we have opportunity to try how we ſhall feel, and be diſpoſed, on ſuch a ſuppoſition. In this caſe, the language of ſupreme love to God will be to this purpoſe: 'Let infinite wiſdom dictate. Let GOD reign, and diſpoſe of me and all creatures, ſo as ſhall be moſt for his own glory, and the greateſt good of the whole, whatever becomes of me, and my intereſt.' In this caſe, not to have infinite wiſdom order; not to have GOD ſupreme, and diſpoſe as pleaſes him, ſo as to glorify himſelf in the higheſt degree, and make his kingdom moſt perfect and happy, would be a greater evil, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater, to the true friend of God and his kingdom, than the giving up his own perſonal intereſt: Yea, on ſuppoſition his own intereſt and higheſt happineſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the glory of God, it will be worth nothing, and worſe than nothing to him. He will therefore ſay
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012811_0082_0F8AC0669B88C848"/>
with Moſes, 'Blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book.' If God may not be God, and order all things for his own glory, and the greateſt good of his kingdom; and if my ſalvation is inconſiſtent with this, I give all up, I have no intereſt of my own to ſeek or deſire.</p>
               <p>It is true, he who has ſuch diſintereſted, benevolent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, muſt be happy ſo long as God reigns, and is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and his kingdom is in the higheſt degree advanced; beauſe this, by the ſuppoſition, is become his good, or he places his happineſs in this. And when he comes to know, that he is thus devoted to God, he may be ſure of his own eternal ſalvation. But let it be obſerved, he muſt <hi>firſt</hi> have ſuch exerciſes of diſintereſted affection as theſe, before he can have any evidence that he ſhall be ſaved; for he muſt become a friend to God, before he can have any evidence that he is intereſted in his favour and ſhall inherit eternal life.</p>
               <p>QUEST. III. How can we in any caſe give up our own eternal intereſt for God's ſake, and for the intereſt of his kingdom, ſince by devoting ourſelves to God, we take the moſt ſure and the only way to ſecure and promote our own higheſt good, in our eternal ſalvation: Is there not an inconſiſtence in this?</p>
               <p>ANS. Though a perſon by giving himſelf to God is the exerciſe of diſintereſted affection, in this way denying himſelf for God's ſake, does indeed take the moſt direct and effectual way to true happineſs, and to ſecure and promote his higheſt intereſt: Yet he as really gives it up for God's ſake, as if he did not ſecure and promote it in this way. And he does as truly deny himſelf, as if he did really and eternally looſe his whole intereſt.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it does not hence follow that he is ſelfiſh, and ſeek his own private intereſt in giving himſelf to God, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God more than himſelf: For this is a contradiction being the ſame as to ſay, he is ſelfiſh, and loves himſelf more than God, in renouncing ſelf, and loving God more than himſelf, and doing all for God's ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:012811_0083_0F8AC066EEB0C240"/>Chriſt, when ſpeaking of ſelf-denial, ſays, 'Whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall looſe it; but whoſoever ſhall looſe his life for my ſake and the goſpel's, the ſame ſhall ſave it.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark, viii. 35.</note> That is, he who is ſo ſelfiſh, as not to be willing to deny himſelf, and give up his own intereſt, even all of it, for my ſake, out of a diſintereſted regard to me, and my kingdom, he ſhall miſs of all true happineſs, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily looſe it forever. But he, who in the exerciſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted affection, denies himſelf for Chriſt's ſake and the goſpel's, &amp; places his happineſs in Chriſt's honor and intereſt, ſhall be really happy, and ſecure his higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt forever. But it does not follow from this, that a man ſeeks his own life and happineſs in a ſelfiſh way, and ſo does all for his own ſake, in looſing his life for Chriſt's ſake and the goſpel's; for this involves a contradiction. And if this could be, it would not be ſelf-denial, but ſelf-gratification.</p>
               <p n="3">III. What has been ſaid of the nature of holineſs, will help us to diſtinguiſh between true religion, and that which is falſe. The leading and moſt eſſential difference lies here: True religion conſiſts in diſintereſted affection, and 'ſeeketh not her own:' Falſe religion wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſelfiſh affections and exerciſes. The former is true holineſs; the latter is nothing but ſin.</p>
               <p>This will ſerve as a touch-ſtone, by which we may try the various doctrines and ſchemes of religion, which are embraced and contended for by profeſſed chriſtians. If they are the dictates of univerſal, diſintereſted benevolence, and ſuited to pleaſe and promote this, they are doctrines according to godlineſs. But if they are ſuited to gratify ſelf-love only, and formed on a ſelfiſh plan, they have no foundation in ſcripture.</p>
               <p>There are many who profeſſedly make ſelf-love the foundation of all religion, &amp; repreſent it as wholly a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh thing, from beginning to end. They do ſo, who teach that love to God, and all practical religion has its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012811_0084_0F8AC06788431108"/>
wholly in a belief that God loves us, and has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given our ſins; and that the faith by which the juſt do live, conſiſts moſt eſſentially in this belief. And this ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs is involved in the ſcheme of religion that many others embrace. The <hi>five points,</hi> ſo long diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween calviniſts and arminians, being examined by this criterion, it will appear, I doubt not, on which ſide the truth lies. The latter form a ſcheme of doctrines exactly ſuited to gratify the ſelfiſhneſs and pride of man; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt men, at the expence of the honor of God, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory of his kingdom. That of the former is ſuited to exalt God, and diſplay the glory of his grace, in the happineſs and glory of his moral kingdom; and therefore is moſt agreeable to the dictates of univerſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. <note n="§" place="bottom">The doctrines here referred to are, 1. God's decrees. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſin. 3. Man's moral impotency. 4. Juſtification by faith through imputed righteouſneſs. 5. The perſeverance of the ſaints. Calviniſts take the poſitive ſide. Arminians the negative.</note> He whoſe head and heart are truly formed upon this diſintereſted, benevolent plan, will not find it difficult to diſtinguiſh between thoſe doctrines which are the dictates of ſelfiſhneſs and pride; and ſuch as are ſuited to exalt God, and abaſe man, and ſet up the glory of God, and his kingdom, as the ſupreme end of all: And will cordially embrace the latter, and renounce the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>And this will help us to a rule to <hi>try the ſpirits</hi> of men, ſo far as we are to judge of their hearts by their practice. A man appears to have true religion, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the doctrines which are <hi>according to godlineſs,</hi> and appears to be devoted to the honor of God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the advancement of his intereſt and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the world; for which he is at all times ready to ſpend, and be ſpent. And he is kind to his fellow men, doing good to all as he has opportunity; and eſpecially good to the profeſſed friends of Chriſt and his kingdom. He puts on 'bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012811_0085_0F8AC068473ED3F0"/>
mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">Col. iii. 12. It is worthy of obſervation, that a kind, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit, exerciſed towards men; eſpecially the ſaints, in doing them good, is much ſpoken of in ſcripture, as an evidence of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion And the reaſon of this appears from the foregoing account of true holineſs.</note> And if a perſon appears in his life and converſation to be wholly ſelfiſh and proud; ſeeking his own eaſe, pleaſure and honor, rather than the honor of Chriſt, and the promotion of his kingdom, and the good of mankind; whatever doctrines he proſeſſes to embrace, and however full of religious zeal and devotion, he may appear to be at times, we have reaſon to conclude he is a ſtranger to true religion.</p>
               <p>And by this rule every one may try his own religion. If it began in a belief that God loved him, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſalvation upon him, &amp;c. and all his religious joy and ſorrow, and darkneſs and light, reſpect his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God's favour, &amp;c. it has the appearance of falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>OBJ. St. John taught this religion. He ſays, 'We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us,' 1 Joh. iv. 19.</p>
                     <p>ANS. What is aſſerted here is, that God's love is firſt in the affair. Had he not firſt loved us, and given his ſon to die for us, and then called us by his grace, and given us a heart to love him, we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued enemies to him. This is the plain ſenſe of the words, and is agreeable to innumerable other paſſages of ſcripture. Whereas the other ſenſe is quite forced, and makes the words ſay what they do not. They are not, we love him becauſe <hi>we firſt believed</hi> he loved us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuch a ſenſe is contrary to the whole run of ſcripture, and the expreſs declaration of our Lord, who ſays, there is no true religion in ſuch love. See page 55, 56, 57, of the inquiry. And it is contrary to the whole bible, in another view. According to ſcripture, we can have no evidence of our intereſt in God's ſpecial love, and pardoning mercy, until we believe and embrace the goſpel; and love to God or what implies it, is the only evidence we can have that God loves us. It is therefore impoſſible, on good grounds, to believe God loves us with a deſign to ſave us, before we love him. We muſt <hi>firſt</hi> love him, before we can have the lead evidence that God loves us. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who believed God loved them, while they had no love to him, and have begun to love God wholly upon this belief, have believed a lie, in the face of the whole bible: And all their religion is nothing but deluſion.</p>

fixes on ſomething infinitely more important than <hi>ſelf,</hi> and his own perſonal intereſt, as the object of his regard and purſuit. He from that moment devotes himſelf to the glory of God, and the greateſt general good, in the advancement of his kingdom. From this time he begins to pray, and ſay, 'Hallowed be thy name. Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come. Thy will be done in earth as in heaven.' And it now becomes his ſtudy and labour, to promote this grand intereſt, by ſerving God &amp; his generation; and thus he ſeeks firſt the kingdom of God. He whoſe religious diſcoveries, views and exerciſes are not of this kind, and do not iſſue in this, may ſafely conclude himſelf a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to true religion.</p>
               <p>IF this moſt fundamental difference between true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and falſe, was attended to by public teachers; and they laboured to keep it in view, in all their deſcriptions of the chriſtian's character and exerciſes, and ſet the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and precepts of the goſpel in this light; it would tend to kill the falſe comfort and confidence of thoſe who have a ſelfiſh religion, and undeceive them. And on the contrary, it would tend greatly to the inſtruction, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement and joy of the true friends of God, and his kingdom.</p>
               <p>But, inſtead of this, how common is it to hear the preacher ſpeak of religion, as if it conſiſted altogether in ſelfiſhneſs! To repreſent the hopes and fears, the joys and ſorrows, and all the exerciſes of the chriſtian, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſelfiſh; and treat of all the doctrines and duties of chriſtianity in this light! How common to find arminians, neonominians, profeſſed calviniſts, antinomians, or whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other name they may bear, &amp; however they may differ in other things, all agreeing in this! This is to ſtun and ſtarve the true chriſtian; and feed and ſtrengthen ſuch as have a lie in their right hand.</p>

            <p>MR. Hart, in his dialogues, aſſerted concerning the moral taſte, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, what was thought to be inconſiſtent with the total corruption of man, deſcribed in the holy ſcripture; and of a very bad tendency. He was publicly told that Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in his diſſertation on the nature of true virtue, had conſidered and confuted his notion of moral taſte: And it was ſuggeſted that he ought firſt to anſwer Mr. Edwards, before he advanced ſo much on a tenet, which, it was thought, had been ſufficiently expoſed. <note n="*" place="bottom">See animadverſions on Mr. <hi>Hart</hi>'s dialogues, p. 17.</note> This led Mr. Hart to read that diſſertation; and be has ſince publiſhed '<hi>Remarks</hi> on it, ſhewing that he has given a wrong idea and definition of virtue, and is inconſiſtent with himſelf.'

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Mr. Hart's objections againſt Mr. Edwards's making true virtue to conſiſt <hi>primarily</hi> in benevolence, which has uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal being for its <hi>primary</hi> object, conſidered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</head>
               <p>MR. Edwards, in his diſſertation on the nature of true virtue, has ſaid it conſiſts <hi>primarily</hi> in benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and that the <hi>primary</hi> or firſt object of univerſal benevolence is being ſimply conſidered, or being in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, agreeable to the repreſentation in the foregoing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.—To this Mr. Hart objects two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſays, that as being ſimply conſidered, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, is neither God nor the creature, but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract idea, love to this object is not commanded; for we are commanded to love God and our neighbour only. According to Mr. Edwards, there ought to be another, and a firſt command to love being in general. But as we find no ſuch command, we may be ſure there is no ſuch duty, and that holineſs does not at all conſiſt in ſuch love. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Remarks on Edwards, p. 5, 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:012811_0090_0F8AC06C05B964A0"/>ANS. Love to being in general, is obedience to the law of God, commanding us to love God and our fellow-creatures; for theſe are being in general, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole of being. He who does not exerciſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, does not obey the firſt, nor the ſecond command: But he who loves being, as ſuch, or ſimply conſidered, which is the ſame as being in general, (and 'tis evident Mr Edwards uſes theſe terms as ſynonimous) I ſay, he who loves being in general, loves God and his fellow creatures; and therefore obeys the two great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>OBJ. 'This is no anſwer,' ſays Mr. H. 'According to this notion of the root, or firſt principle of true virtue, love to God, as well as to our neighbour, is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of this general, indeterminate benevolence.' And if it is fit to command or require the daughter affection, much more the mother love. p. 6.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. If being in general was ſomething diſtinct from God and the creature, and more than theſe, and not included in them, the objection would appear to have ſome foundation: But as the caſe is, it is wholly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. If a particular member of a community or nation, ſhould be commanded to love the king, and all his fellow-ſubjects; and he ſhould be told, this love muſt be primarily, good will to all in general, and not to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, excluſive of the reſt; would he have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, this was not included in the command he had received; and that he was not by this bound to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this good will to the whole nation, as ſuch: Becauſe he was to love only the king and his fellow-ſubjects? That the whole nation, ſimply conſidered as ſuch, or the nation in general, including king and ſubjects, was only 'an abſtract idea,' including neither king, nor his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but ſomething elſe, which he muſt love <hi>firſt</hi>; and then from this 'mother affection' 'the daughter love' muſt ſlow, viz. love to the king and to his fellow-ſubjects?
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012811_0091_0F8AC06CD8326988"/>
If not, what Mr. Hart has ſaid, is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. It will more fully appear how frivolous this objection is, if we conſider <hi>in what ſenſe</hi> being in general is the primary object of true benevolence. It means no more than that true benevolence is of the nature of love to being in general. This is fundamental and original in its nature; ſo that it cannot, from its very nature, be limited to any particular ſort or circle of beings; but for the ſame reaſon it loves one, it loves all. Therefore it regards individuals, and is exerciſed toward them, not in a limited, confined ſenſe, but as part of the whole. In this view, it appears that love to God may be an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has being in general for its object; and its true nature, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from every thing elſe, may conſiſt in this; and yet there be no exerciſe of heart towards being in general, antecedent to love to God, of which love to God is the fruit and offspring. All that is aſſerted is, that this true love to God, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to love being in general; and carries this in its very nature, elſe it would not be true benevolence. <note n="†" place="bottom">See the preceding inquiry, p. 11, 12.</note> And where is the ground of repreſenting love to being in general, as the 'mother affection,' and love to God and our neighbour as 'the daughter love,' when the matter is viewed in this light?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mr. Hart objects, that Mr. Edwards, by making being in general the primary object of holy love, ſets this up as ſupreme, and makes an idol of it, to which the firſt and ſupreme regard is to be paid; while nothing but a ſecondary, ſubordinate, inferior affection is left for God.</p>
               <p>ANS. When it is ſaid that being in general is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary or firſt object of benevolent love, the meaning is, that this affection in its primary quality and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature has being in general, as ſuch, for its object; and is a diſpoſition to regard all, and not a part only;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012811_0092_0F8AC06D87E77000"/>
and that being in general is its <hi>firſt</hi> object, in diſtinction from benevolent being, which is a <hi>ſecondary</hi> object of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and the primary object of complacence. This is not only conſiſtent with God's being the chief and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme object of this affection; but he is ſo <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> as Mr. Edwards has obſerved and proved in his ſecond chapter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards took care to guard againſt both theſe objections of Mr. Hart's in the following words.
<q>When I ſay, true virtue conſiſts in love to being in general, I ſhall not be likely to be underſtood, that no one act of the mind, or exerciſe of love, is of the nature of true virtue, but what has being in general, or the great ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of univerſal exiſtence for its direct and immediate object; ſo that no exerciſe of love, or kind affection to any one particular being, that is but a ſmall part of the whole, has any thing of the nature of true virtue: But that the <hi>nature</hi> of true virtue conſiſts in a <hi>diſpoſition to benevolence</hi> towards being in general.</q>
                  <q>My meaning is, that no affections towards particular perſons or beings is of the nature of true virtue, but ſuch as ariſes from a generally benevolent temper, or from that habit or frame of mind, wherein conſiſts a diſpoſition to love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general.</q>
p. 118, 119.</p>
               <p>What can be plainer than this? According to this a perſon may love God ſupremely, with a love which has not univerſal exiſtence for its direct and immediate object (only as God is in a ſenſe univerſal exiſtence) but God may be as much the firſt, direct, and immediate object, in all reſpects, as if there were no other exiſtence; and yet this love carry in its nature, love to being, as ſuch, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal exiſtence, and this be the ground and reaſon why it fixes on God, as the ſupreme object; and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from every thing which is not holy love; for if it were not a love, which in its nature is love to being in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it would not be true, holy love to God.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems Mr. Hart has underſtood Mr. Edwards,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012811_0093_0F8AC06E5453CBE0"/>
as he thought he ſhould not be likely to be underſtood; and as he expreſsly declared he would not be underſtood. With how much reaſon and juſtice, the reader muſt judge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart allows, that according to Mr. Edwards's ſcheme, GOD may be the primary, chief and ſupreme object of the love of complacence, p. 5, 8.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider whether there are not as many and great difficulties in this, as there are in making God the ſupreme object of benevolence to being in general. This perhaps may give us ſome further light in this matter.</p>
               <p>The love of complacence has beauty, or beautiful, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent being for its object. Hloy complacence has moral beauty in general, moral beauty as ſuch, ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, for its object; and not any particular beauty or the beauty of any particular being, as confined and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that, and excluſive of moral beauty in general. It is exerciſed towards particular beautiful beings, as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the beauty common to all holy beings, &amp; is love to moral beauty in general, as ſuch: Or, in other words, it is love of holineſs, <hi>for holineſs ſake,</hi> ſimply conſidered, as being what it is, in its own nature. Therefore love to particular holy beings, has its firſt original and primary ground in love of holineſs in general, and is really in its own nature love of holineſs, as ſuch, which diſtinguiſhes it from all affection, which is not true love of holineſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart's objection againſt benevolence, as Mr. Edwards has repreſented it, may be applied to this view of complacence, in the following manner, 'According to this doctrine, there ought to have been <hi>three</hi> great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. The firſt, greateſt, and moſt fundamental of all, ſhould have been thus, viz. 'Thou ſhalt love <hi>holineſs</hi> in general, ſimply conſidered; for <hi>complacence</hi> in this is the root and mother of all <hi>complacential love</hi>; and all <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complacence</hi> primarily and moſt eſſentially conſiſts in it. Secondly, ſubordinate to this, and as the firſt great branch
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012811_0094_0F8AC070912071F8"/>
of this root, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c.—<note n="†" place="bottom">See remarks, p. 5, 6.</note> Is not this argument, in all reſpects, as ſtrong and concluſive, as when uſed by Mr. Hart, againſt what Mr. Edwards has ſaid of benevolence?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. will doubtleſs acknowledge that God may be the ſupreme object of the love of holineſs, as he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely holy, and the fountain and ſum of all holineſs; and that he muſt be ſo, to him who loves holineſs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or for its own ſake, ſimply conſidered: Though he might not be the ſupreme object of any other kind of love which has not holineſs, as ſuch, for its primary object. And why muſt not this be as true of the love of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as Mr. Edwards has defined it?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. uſes the following argument to prove that God cannot be the ſupreme object of the benevolence Mr. Edwards deſcribes. p. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon Mr. Edwards's principles, the abſolutely great being muſt have an incomparably greater ſhare of the primary benevolence to being, ſimply conſidered, than all other particular beings. Compared with them, he has chief and ſupreme benevolent regard: But not ſo, compared with the primary object of virtuous love, viz. being in general. That muſt be the chief object; for the great being does not exhauſt all being, ſo as to reduce all others to non-exiſtence, or no degree of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He infinitely outweighs all other beings, as put in the ſcale againſt him. But if his infinite degree of being is put into one ſcale, and the ſame be put into the oppoſite ſcale, and together with that, the degrees of exiſtence of all other beings, 'tis obvious this great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's weight, in the oppoſite ſcales, will balance itſelf, and the whole weight of the other beings will remain clear, and turn the ſcale. This ſcale has in it the whole of the primary object of virtuous love, the other not; and the virtuous attraction, or tendency of primary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to being, ſimply conſidered, is in proportion to the quantity of being.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:012811_0095_0F8AC0716D471080"/>Every one muſt ſee, at firſt view, that if this argument proves God cannot be the ſupreme object of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benevolence, it equally proves he cannot be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme object of any love and regard, in which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has the leaſt ſhare: And that the heart which has any regard to the creation, cannot pay ſupreme regard to God. But I will now apply it to the love of complacence in particular, by ſubſtituting that in room of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; by which it will appear this argument will prove, if it proves any thing, that God cannot be the ſupreme object of complacence.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon Mr. Edward's principles, (and in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we may ſay, upon Mr. Hart's too) 'the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely great being muſt have an incomparably greater ſhare of the <hi>love of holineſs for holineſs ſake, or the love of moral beauty in general,</hi> ſimply conſidered; than all other particular beings. Compared with them, he has the chief and ſupreme, <hi>complacential love</hi>; but not ſo, compared with the primary object of holy love, viz. <hi>holineſs</hi> in general, <hi>or moral beauty, as ſuch. That</hi> muſt be the chief object; for the great <hi>and moſt holy</hi> being does not exhauſt all <hi>holineſs,</hi> ſo as to reduce all others to <hi>no degree of moral beauty. His holineſs</hi> infinitely outweighs <hi>the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of</hi> all other beings, as put in the ſcale againſt him. But if his infinite degree <hi>of holineſs,</hi> is put into one ſcale, and the ſame be put into the oppoſite ſcale, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that, <hi>the holineſs</hi> of all other <hi>holy</hi> beings, 'tis obvious this great being's <hi>holineſs</hi> in the oppoſite ſcales, will balance itſelf, and the whole weight <hi>of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of other beings will remain clear, and turn the ſcale. This ſcale has in it the whole of the primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>the love of complacence,</hi> the other not; and the holy attraction, or tendency of primary <hi>complacential love</hi> to <hi>holineſs</hi> in general, ſimply conſidered, is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the quantity of <hi>holineſs.</hi>
                  </q>
—Mr. H. ſubjoins to this argument the following words, 'How do <hi>falſe meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:012811_0096_0F8AC073726AE410"/>
entangle and miſlead, the greateſt and beſt men, when they wander in them!' To whoſe metaphyſics, Mr. Edwards's or Mr. Hart's, this exclamation is moſt properly applicable, the judicious reader, I ſuppoſe, will be at no loſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It may not be uſeleſs, perhaps, to obſerve here, that as being in general is the primary object of general benevolence, &amp; benevolent being a ſecondary object, as has been obſerved; ſo there is a diſtinction to be made in the object of complacential love, into primary and ſecondary, in ſome meaſure analogus to that of benevolence. The primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of complacence, is that holineſs and beauty which conſiſts in pure benevolence, and a ſecondary object is the holy complacence it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It muſt be evident to any one who will attend, that this muſt be the caſe; for there muſt be complacence, before there can be any delight in complacence, or complacential love of complacence; therefore the <hi>firſt</hi> complacence cannot have complacence, or love of holineſs for its object; but the <hi>firſt</hi> love of holineſs muſt be the love of holy benevolence. And when this complacence in benevolence once exiſts, it does itſelf become an object of complacence, and in this ſenſe is a ſecondary object of complacential love; it being a ſecondary beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, implied in benevolence and flowing from it. And indeed, the mind cannot have any true conception of the love of holineſs, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complacential love, until it actually takes place in the mind; and therefore the <hi>firſt</hi> exerciſe of it in every mind, cannot have the love of complacence for its object; but it muſt be the beauty of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. The mind in this way getting an idea of the beauty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential love, immediately takes delight in it, or approves of it as an excellence, which is a ſecondary and conſequential exerciſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence towards this ſecondary object. The caſe ſeems to be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this. The firſt exerciſe of holineſs is benevolence to being, as ſuch; in which the heart is diſpoſed to unite itſelf to being in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in ſeeking the higheſt univerſal good. And this general bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence implies in it benevolence to benevolent beings, and a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> benevolence, with a love of complacence. And the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent mind, being thus pleaſed with benevolence as the greateſt beauty and excellence, is of courſe in the next place pleaſed with this beautiful complacence in benevolence.</p>
                     <p>Of this holy love, in all its branches, and exerciſes, GOD is in a true ſenſe the firſt and ſupreme object, as he is the ſum of all being; ſo that all created exiſtence, in compariſon with him, ſinks into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And he is the ſum and fountain of all benevolent being, and of complacence in moral beauty; or of all excellence and moral beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection And his exiſtence and relations to his creatures, in which he is infinitely diſtinguiſhed from all other beings, are the ground of peculiar exerciſes of the benevolent mind towards him: ſuch as holy fear and reverence; a humble truſt and reſt and joy in him, as the ſupreme good, &amp; a ſweet acquieſcence in him, &amp; in his government and works, and reſignation to him &amp;c all which is implied in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, even in its very nature; and is nothing but univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence acting according to its nature, towards this infinitely great and glorious object.</p>

                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:012811_0097_0F8AC073972819C0"/>Mr. Edwards ſays 'true virtue muſt chiefly conſiſt in love to God, the being of beings, infinitely the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt of beings,' and that 'it may be aſſerted in general, that nothing is of the nature of true virtue, in which God is not the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi>' &amp;c. p. 125, 134. And he thought this was evident from what he had ſaid upon the nature of true virtue; which he has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly proved in his ſecond chapter. Mr. Hart ſays, herein 'he is very inconſiſtent with himſelf;' and that 'there is indeed a ſtrange confuſion and inconſiſtence in this great man's ideas and reaſonings upon this ſubject.' p. 9, 11.</p>
               <p>But enough has been ſaid, to ſhew how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this charge is, and that Mr. Edwards is perfectly conſiſtent in this matter; and I truſt that whoever will conſider the ſubject with proper attention and candor, will find it the only conſiſtent notion of true virtue, that has ever been propoſed; and that can be ſupported by ſcripture. This, I hope, has been made evident in the preceding inquiry.</p>
               <p>IT may not be improper to take notice here, of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection Mr. H. makes againſt Mr. Edwards's ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any affection to God, under the name of BENEVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENCE. He preſents us with an extract of a letter from one, who, he ſays, is 'an ingenious gentleman:' In which Mr. Edwards is ſeverely cenſured for uſing this word thus. He ſays this is 'more than odd; it is quite improper, and ſounds irreverent!' p. 10. margin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards has taken particular notice of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and anſwered it, p. 126, 127. Mr. Hart, or his friend, had no right to renew this very objection againſt
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012811_0098_0F8AC0744997BFE0"/>
Mr. Edwards, without taking notice of his anſwer, and ſhewing wherein his reaſoning fails; which neither of them have attempted.</p>
               <p>I truſt none will deny that any affection exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God has the nature of good will to him; but if we are to exerciſe any good will towards God, and be in any degree his friends, we muſt ſo far exerciſe benevolence towards him; for <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>benevolence</hi> are two names of the ſame thing. And why, of theſe two names, which are uſed for preciſely the ſame thing, one ſhould be 'improper and irreverent,' when uſed to expreſs this ſame affection towards God, and the other not, remains for this <hi>ingenious gentlemen</hi> to ſhew. Why this ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection may not be called by the ſame name, when exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards a ſuperior, and one that is above all depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on us, as well as when exerciſed towards an inferior and dependent, no man, I believe, can ſhew. If benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence implies indigence, and dependence in the object to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which it is exerciſed, it would indeed be improper and irreverent, to call any affection exerciſed towards God by this name. And I conclude this gentleman, and all others who make this objection, have affixed this idea to the word benevolence; and that this is the ground of their diſguſt. But in this they are very arbitrary; in affixing a meaning to the word which it does not expreſs, nor was ever deſigned to ſignify.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. allows that God is the firſt object of his own benevolence, p. 18. If God exerciſes benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, why may not his creatures? Yea, why <hi>muſt</hi> they not? In the exerciſe of holineſs they imitate God as dear children, and are partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Their love to God then muſt be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with God's love of himſelf, and if his is a love of benevolence, theirs muſt be ſo too. And why God's love of himſelf may be called benevolence, which Mr. H. ventures to do, and yet the ſame kind of love of God in the creature may not be called ſo, is quite unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:012811_0099_0F8AC079EA623840"/>Beſides, Mr. H. makes all virtue ſummarily to conſiſt in 'giving up all inconſiſtent intereſts, as loſs <hi>for God's ſake,</hi> &amp; his kingom's.' p. 33. Now, what is this but bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence or good will to God, &amp; his intereſt &amp; kingdom, in ſuch a regard for his honor and intereſt, as to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give up every thing for the ſake of this? If this is not benevolence, of which God is the firſt and chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we may deſpair of ever knowing what is benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>But Mr. H. is more expreſs yet. He ſays, a '<hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> propenſity of minds to minds, is communicated to the hearts of men, by a ſight and feeling ſenſe of God's <hi>benevolence</hi> to them,' in the exerciſe of which they attract to him in the firſt place, &amp;c. p. 23, 24. Surely Mr. H. falls under the 'juſt' reproof of this 'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious gentleman,' if any one does.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Mr. Hart's objections againſt Mr. Edwards's notion of the <hi>ſecondary</hi> or <hi>natural beauty</hi> in virtue, conſidered and obviated.</head>
               <p>MR. Edwards obſerves, there are two kinds of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. One is <hi>moral beauty,</hi> or the beauty of true virtue or holineſs; which is the higheſt kind of beauty, and conſiſts in cordial agreement and harmony, or general benevolence; and is diſcerned and approved of, by ſuch only, who love true holineſs; which love is itſelf the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of holineſs. The other is <hi>natural beauty,</hi> which conſiſts in natural harmony or agreement, &amp;c. and takes place in the natural and material world, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs inſtances. And this ſame kind of beauty is found in things immaterial and mental, as well as in other things; and there is a natural beauty in virtuous exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012811_0100_0F8DE13D454E5A48"/>
of the mind, and the fruit of thoſe exerciſes, which is entirely diſtinct from the moral, holy beauty, and of a different nature; even the ſame kind of beauty which is found in the material world. Thus there is a natural beauty, harmony &amp; agreement, in a man's doing to others as he would think proper they ſhould do to him, of the ſame kind with the beauty and harmony of a building, the different parts of which are harmoniouſly fitted to anſwer each other. Which beauty is diſtinct from that general benevolence, in which the truth of a man's doing to others as he would they ſhould do to him conſiſts, and which is the true moral beauty of the heart. This <hi>natural beauty</hi> is found in all virtuous exerciſes and conduct, eſpecially in relative duties between man and man, according to their different ſtations &amp; relations; which may be reliſhed and delighted in by thoſe who have no virtue, as a taſte for this natural beauty, is natural to all men, and does not imply diſintereſted benevolence, but is conſiſtent with the higheſt degree of ſelfiſhneſs and ſin. Therefore they have run into a great miſtake, who have thought this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for natural beauty, which is found in virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which is common to all men, an evidence that all men have a degree of true virtue. [See Edwards's nature of true virtue, chap. III d. throughout.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart objects againſt all this, as 'very injurious and deſtructive to true virtue.' And in order to expoſe it, he makes the following obſervations. chap. III d.</p>
               <p>'1. If this doctrine is true. God's revealed law,—no where commands, recommends, or once mentions that in which all true virtue primarily and moſt eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; but only enjoins and commands it in regard to its ſecondary beauty.' p. 16.</p>
               <p>ANS. The law of God requires univerſal goodneſs or love, and nothing elſe; in which Mr. Edwards ſays all true virtue conſiſts. This is ſufficiently illuſtrated in the preceding inquiry; from which it appears this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very ill choſen indeed, to be uſed againſt Mr.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012811_0101_0F8ABF8F9B953BC8"/>
Edwards's notion of virtue; and is nothing but begging the queſtion. Mr. H. ſays, 'If I miſtake not, Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards does implicitly acknowledge this in what has been tranſcribed above.' <hi>Anſ.</hi> he is doubtleſs <hi>greatly miſtaken,</hi> and muſt lie under this imputation, till he has particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn where and how this is implied in what Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards has ſaid. Mr. H. goes on,</p>
               <p>'2. If this doctrine is true, it may be ſuſpected that the holy men of old, prophets and apoſtles, never knew or practiſed true virtue.'</p>
               <p>ANS. Our Lord has told us that love to God and our neighbour is the whole of what the law and the prophets inculcated; even that ſame univerſal benevolence in which Mr. Edwards ſays all true virtue conſiſts. We have therefore no more reaſon to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> the prophets never knew or practiſed this virtue, than we have to ſuſpect that Chriſt was not a teacher come from God. And one of the chief apoſtles ſaid, 'love is the fulfilling of the law;' and that all true religion and holineſs conſiſts in this, and nothing elſe, 1 Cor. xiii. 2. He is therefore ſo far from placing virtue in this <hi>ſecondary beauty,</hi> that he expreſsly places it in ſomething elſe, even in univerſal love and benevolence.</p>
               <p>The inſtances in ſcripture Mr. H. brings to ſupport this obſervation, are not to his purpoſe, Pſal. 18, 25.26. Rev. 16.5, 6. There is a true moral beauty in the righteouſneſs of God here celebrated, which conſiſts in univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Take this from that conduct which is called righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in God or man, and no moral goodneſs remains; ſo nothing worthy of holy admiration and praiſe. There being a ſecondary beauty, a natural fitneſs, in juſtice, does not prove, or ſuppoſe, there is no higher beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in it. If Mr. H. would prove the point he has ſet up here, he muſt produce an inſtance of virtue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended and celebrated, as ſuch, which has nothing in it of the nature of univerſal benevolence. In what he has yet ſaid, he has only begged the queſtion. He proceeds,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:012811_0102_0F8ABF904D9B3B08"/>'3. Let it be obſerved that there is no ſuch object of God's attention and regard, as being <hi>ſimply conſidered.</hi>' p. 18.</p>
               <p>ANS. There is ſuch an object as being in general, or univerſal being, which is the ſame with <hi>being ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> as Mr. Edwards uſes the terms. And univerſal benevolence has this for its object; &amp; that is not virtuous love which will not extend to being in general, as ſuch, or ſimply conſidered. This has been ſufficiently explained and evinced by Mr. Edwards, p. 129, 130, 131. and in the preceding inquiry, p. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. to ſupport his aſſertion, goes on to ſay,
<q>God is his own firſt object. He ſees himſelf as he is, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of an abſolute fulneſs of being, enriched and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with all poſſible mental perfections. <hi>As ſuch,</hi> he is the primary object of his <hi>firſt</hi> and chief love, both of benevolence and complacence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this paſſage I would obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is granted that 'God is his own firſt object.' This Mr. Edwards grants, and has proved: And it has been ſhewn in the foregoing ſection, that this is conſiſtent with virtue's conſiſting in love to being in general; not only as God is, in effect, being in general; but his love of himſelf is, in its nature, love to being, as ſuch, or being ſimply conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. According to Mr. H's account of the matter here, God's love of benevolence and complacency, is no part of his excellence and perfections. God is 'enriched and adorned with ALL POSSIBLE mental perfections,' independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his love; and as thus poſſeſſed of <hi>all poſſible</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, 'he is the primary object of his <hi>firſt</hi> love.' This is a bold ſtroke indeed! It ſtrikes out all love of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence or complacence from being any part of holineſs. The ſcripture ſays, 'God is love;' but according to Mr. H. no part of his perfection is expreſſed in this, nor any thing worthy or excellent. And the law of God, which requires love, is no tranſcript or expreſſion of the divine
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012811_0103_0F8ABF911BCC60F8"/>
perfections; for theſe do not conſiſt, in the leaſt degree, in love, but in ſomething entirely different from this. And if God's love to himſelf is no part of 'all poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,' he having all poſſible perfection antecedent to this; then his love of benevolence and complacence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his creatures is no part of his holineſs and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And it will alſo follow, that love of benevolence and complacence in creatures, the angels for inſtance, is no part of their moral excellence. Thus we ſee where Mr. H. is carried in his oppoſition to Mr. Edwards's account of true virtue. This was no inadvertence in Mr. H. No one can do better than he has done on this head, if he ſets up to oppoſe general benevolence to being, as ſuch, as the foundation and ſum of all holineſs: It will neceſſarily land him in this firſt-born of abſurdities, and he can give no better account of the divine holineſs and perfections than Mr H. has here given. M. H. has the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the following extraordinary ſentence, p. 12.
<q>He [GOD] is not virtuous and holy <hi>becauſe</hi> he loves himſelf; but he loves himſelf <hi>becauſe he is holy.</hi>
                  </q>
That is, God's holineſs does not conſiſt in love, but ſomething which is antecedent to all love, and the ground and object of it; and is therefore quite a diſtinct thing from love.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. may be aſked, what this holineſs is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it it conſiſts? What are '<hi>all poſſible</hi> mental perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,' in which there is no degree, no kind of love? Doubtleſs he will be as much puzzled for an anſwer, as the Indian he mentions, who aſſerted the earth ſtood on a tortoiſe; and being aſked what the tortoiſe ſtood upon? 'He cried out, with ſurpriſe, <hi>Me don't know</hi>!' p. 23.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Mr. H. thinks he has anſwered this queſtion, in his chap. <hi>of the eſſential nature of true virtue.</hi> but if I can underſtand him there, what he ſays of the divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and perfection is in direct oppoſition to this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary aſſertion, and very conſiſtent with Mr. Edwards. He repreſents God's holineſs as conſiſting in <hi>an equitable regard to himſelf, and his creatures.</hi> This may be benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012811_0104_0F8ABF91CFDD10D0"/>
to being in general, notwithſtanding any thing he ſays. Yea, I think it muſt be this, according to his own account of the matter, when all he ſays upon it is put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. He ſpeaks of 'an eſtabliſhed virtuouſneſs of character' in the creature, as conformity to God himſelf; and he ſays this conſiſts in love; p. 43. and that it is in effect <hi>univerſal love.</hi> p. 47. Now what can univerſal love be, but love to being in general? And if this is virtue in the creature, by which he is conformed to God's moral character, then God's holineſs conſiſts in this ſame <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal love,</hi> or love to being in general. But, be this as it may, it is certain Mr. H. makes the holineſs of God to conſiſt in part, if not wholly, in <hi>love.</hi> What can God's equitable regard to himſelf be, but love to himſelf? Let him tell who can.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he ſpeaks of the love &amp; goodneſs of God, as a 'moſt virtuous' [or holy] propenſity; p. 43. and as that which is <hi>his glory.</hi> p. 44, 45. Now, if God's love, his benevolence and goodneſs, are his holineſs, and his glory, how can it be that he is 'enriched and adorned with <hi>all poſſible</hi> mental perfections,' antecedent to his love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; as the ground of it; and antecedent to his love to his creatures? This love cannot be any part of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, holineſs and glory, if he is 'adorned with <hi>all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible perfections</hi>' antecedent to it. Thus we ſee Mr. Hart has been ſo far from telling us what <hi>all poſſible perfection</hi> is, conſidered as aſide from love, and the ground and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, that he has contradicted this his poſition, and placed the moral perfection and holineſs of God in love, and nothing elſe. 'Error is fated to run crooked!'</p>
               <p>Mr. H. proceeds to ſay, p. 19.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <q>4. Let us next conſider the deſtructive influence of this notion of virtue, upon virtue itſelf. All relative duties which we owe to God, to Jeſus Chriſt, and our fellow-ſervants,—partake of the nature of juſtice: They are equitable, fit and right in their own nature: They have a natural agreement and harmonious propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableneſs
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012811_0105_0F8ABF92D2039E38"/>
to the nature and characters of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive objects.—All this you ſee and approve, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and exerciſes of your mind or heart towards all theſe relative duties, are natural, harmoniouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to them, and in concord with them, equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuited to them. Your heart then is very beautiful, but not at all virtuous, if theſe harmonious and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſitions and exerciſes of your mind do not ariſe from pure benevolence to being, ſimply conſidered. So then the beauty of your mind, as adorned with all theſe relative, equitable and harmonious diſpoſitions <hi>only,</hi> is of the ſame ſort with that of bodies. Your heart is as beautiful as a ſquare or a cube, and no more virtuous than they.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this the following things may be obſerved, 1. There is, in things of a moral nature, a natural beauty, which conſiſts in harmony and agreement, &amp;c. which is diſtinct from any thing properly moral in them; and therefore a beauty which is diſtinct from moral beauty, and of a different nature. This Mr. Edwards has aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, illuſtrated and proved: And I do not find that Mr. Hart has ſo much as attempted to ſhew wherein his proof fails, and how what he ſays is not to the purpoſe. All Mr. H. attempts to do, is to draw abſurd conſequences from this notion of ſecondary, natural beauty in moral things; which conſiſt in begging the queſtion, or aſſertions without any manner of proof. Some of which have been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or in miſrepreſenting Mr. Edwards' doctrine on this head: Of which the words before us are an inſtance, as I ſhall ſhew before I have done.</p>
               <p>There is a uniformity and proportion and an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of one thing to another, in moral things or true virtue, which is of the ſame kind with the uniformity, &amp;c. which takes place in the material world, and the ſame taſte which diſcerns and takes pleaſure in the latter, will do the ſame with reſpect to the former. And therefore this taſte and pleaſure don't imply love of virtue; for it
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012811_0106_0F8ABF93560CAF10"/>
is not the virtue itſelf that is diſcerned and reliſhed; and if there was nothing there but what is diſcerned and reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this taſte, there would be no virtue in it. This is what Mr. Edwards has aſſerted, and Mr. H. has ſaid nothing to prove it is not ſo: Nor will he ever do it, it is preſumed. It is a truth which every conſiderate, judicious perſon muſt diſcern; Mr. H. himſelf not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; for <hi>he</hi> has acknowledged it, as I ſhall ſhew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>A perſon wholly ſelfiſh may be pleaſed with ſome things which attend general benevolence; there is to him a beauty in it, ſo far as he has advantage by it. This may be while he ſees nothing of the true beauty of benevolence. Saul, under the influence of ſelfiſhneſs, ſaw a beauty in David's conduct, in ſparing his life when he was in his hands, and was highly delighted with it, while he wholly overlooked the true beauty of it, and the virtue he exerciſed, and had no pleaſure in it, but would have been diſpleaſed with the ſame conduct in David, had it been towards one of Saul's enemies. It is granted that in this caſe, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeen, and Saul's pleaſure in David's conduct, are not wholly of the ſame kind with that under conſideration, as the former has its foundation chieflly in ſelfiſhneſs, the latter not; yet, I think it ſerves to illuſtrate the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and ſhew that men may ſee a beauty in virtuous conduct, and be pleaſed with it; and yet not ſee the true beauty of virtue, or have any regard to the true virtue which is exerciſed; but be diſpoſed to be diſpleaſed with that, and hate it.</p>
               <p>The juſt proportion and ſymmetry of a beautiful pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is adjuſted and marked out by a number of exactly proportioned lines, drawn ſo as in a certain manner to agree with each other, and form a proper uniformity. Now theſe lines, thus exactly drawn and proportioned, form a beauty different from that which we call the beauty of a picture, or a human face, which conſiſts in a certain ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and juſt proportion. An accurate mathematician,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012811_0107_0F8ABF95678A15E8"/>
who has no taſte or diſcerning of what is meant by the beauty of a picture, which is formed by certain colours and ſhades, proportioned to theſe lines; yet might diſcern the juſt proportion of theſe lines, exactly drawn to ſuit and anſwer each other, ſee a beauty in it, and be pleaſed. Here we ſee there are two diſtinct beauties, the one inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, the other higher, the latter the true beauty of a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet the former is diſcerned, and not the latter. And why may it not be ſo in the caſe before us; tho' the beauties, one of an inferior, the other of a higher kind, have a different and greater diſtinction, than in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? The exact proportion and harmony in the vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the chords of a muſical inſtrument, have a beauty in them that would give pleaſure, if clearly diſcerned, diſtinct from the harmony of a tune; and he who has no taſte for muſic, might diſcern the harmony and exact proportion of theſe vibrations, and be pleaſed with this beauty.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. inſiſts upon it, that what Mr. Edwards calls the ſecondary beauty that attends true virtue, &amp; ſays is the ſame kind with natural beauty, is true virtue, and all the beauty there is in it. This ſeems to be at the bottom of all he has ſaid againſt Mr. Edwards on this head. He might, ſo far as I can ſee, with juſt as much reaſon ſay, all the beauty of a beautiful picture conſiſts in the exact proportion of a number of lines: Or that the whole of the beauty and ſweet harmony of muſic, conſiſts in the exact, harmonious, correſpondent vibrations of the air, or of the chords of a muſical inſtrument. He ſays,
<q>The truth is, this marvellous ſcheme has changed the natural, moral beauty and glory of true virtue, into an image made like to the beauty of an equilateral triangle, or a cheſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</q>
p· 21.</p>
               <p>That he had no reaſon to bring this charge againſt Mr. Edwards, any one muſt ſee at firſt glance. Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſays virtue does not conſiſt in this ſecondary beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but in ſomething elſe of quite a different nature and kind; that though there is a beauty which conſiſts in
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012811_0108_0F8ABF958CC05FB0"/>
proportion, and the anſwerableneſs of one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that attends true virtue, which is of the ſame kind with the proportion and beauty of a triangle or cheſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; yet this is of a nature entirely different from virtue, and has nothing of its beauty and glory. What more could Mr. Edwards have done utterly to exclude the beauty of a cheſs-board, &amp;c. from the beauty and glory of true virtue? This was the deſign of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on ſecondary beauty. But may not this charge, with great juſtice and propriety, be retorted on Mr. Hart him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? he inſiſts upon it, that this ſecondary beauty, which Mr. Edwards has proved to be like to the beauty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things (and Mr. H. has not ſhewn that it is not ſo) is all the beauty and glory there is in true virtue. This charge muſt lie upon him till he can prove the beauty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending true virtue, which Mr. Edwards calls natural, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary beauty, is not a beauty of the ſame kind with the beauty in material things. This leads me to another obſervation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a miſrepreſentation in this paſſage. Mr. H. here ſuppoſes that all relative duties to God, to Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. may be practiſed from the heart, according to Mr. Edwards, without the exerciſe of true virtue;
<q>and the diſpoſitions and exerciſes of the mind or heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the objects of theſe relative duties be natural, harmoniouſly proportionable to them, &amp; in concord with them, equitably ſuited to them, and <hi>the heart</hi> be thus 'very beautiful; but not at all virtuous.</q>
This is a groſs miſrepreſentation. Mr. Edwards ſpeaks of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary beauty as the attendant of true virtue, which does not take place in the mind that is deſtitute of virtue. He allows of no diſpoſitions and exerciſes of heart, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly proportionable and equitably ſuitable to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of relative duties, in the mind deſtitute of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or general benevolence, and which are not the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of that. And in this miſrepreſentation Mr. H. real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begs the queſtion in diſpute, or takes for granted what
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012811_0109_0F8ABF9646E4DCB0"/>
he had to prove, viz. that a man may <hi>heartily</hi> practice all relative duties towards God and his neighbour, while he has no univerſal benevolence. If he had proved this, which he has taken for granted, and Mr. Edwards had allowed what he ſuppoſes, viz. that the mind may have all the beauty which he ſuppoſes in relative duties, without any true virtue, 'the deſtructive influence of his notion of virtue, upon virtue itſelf,' might have appeared. But as the caſe ſtands, nothing of this kind is made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. goes into the ſame way of arguing (if it can be called arguing) in another paſſage which I will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. After having made a quotation from Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in which he ſuppoſes, what he had abundantly proved, viz. that there is a natural beauty accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true virtue, in which true virtue does not conſiſt, but is of the ſame kind with the natural beauty in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things, he cries out, 'Wonderful!' And then goes on in the following words,
<q>Here an appeal is made to experience, and the argument is built on this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that moral proportion and harmony is a beauty of the ſame kind with that of material things.</q>
Here is a miſrepreſentation. Mr. Edwards does not aſſert this of '<hi>moral proportion and harmony,</hi>' but ſays that beſides the moral proportion and harmony in true virtue, there is alſo a <hi>natural</hi> proportion and harmony, which is the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of true virtue, in which there is a <hi>natural</hi> beauty of the ſame kind with that of material things. And Mr. H. has ſaid nothing to diſprove it, that I can find. And ſurely Mr. Edwards had a right to build an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a premiſe which he thought he had fully prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which, it ſeems, Mr. H. did not think beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and expreſsly to attempt to diſprove, or ſo much as deny. But Mr. H. goes on.
<q>It is not poſſible to conceive of any thing more abſurd. I deſire any one to take a human mind, adorned with all right, relative affections and exerciſes to Jeſus Chriſt, harmoniouſly
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012811_0110_0F8ABF97B278BB08"/>
agreeable, and beautifully proportioned to his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and relations to us (only excluding benevolence to being, ſimply conſidered; and let the faith of him be their ſpring) and carefully compare it with a ſquare, a cube, and a beautiful piece of embroidery, and try if he can diſcover any ſuch likeneſs in their beauties as to lead him to pronounce them beauties of the very ſame ſort or order. He will as ſoon diſcover the actions of a ſpirit to be of the ſame kind with the action or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a clock.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. H. ſuppoſes what is impoſſible, viz. that
<q>a mind may be adorned with all right, relative affections and exerciſes to Jeſus Chriſt,</q>
&amp;c. when benevolence to being in general is excluded; and that a man is a true believer in Chriſt while wholly without this benevolence. He has attempted to form a character here that never exiſted, and never will, becauſe it implies a contradiction. Therefore there is no ſuch character to be conſidered. Mr. H. here introduces the beauties of true virtue, and then aſks if there is any likeneſs between <hi>theſe,</hi> and the beauty of a ſquare, &amp;c. Mr. Edwards does not ſay theſe are beauties of the ſame ſort. What he ſays is, that over and above the true virtuous beauty in theſe relative du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there is alſo a beauty of another kind, which itſelf is not virtue; but only the attendant of it, and is of the ſame kind with the beauty in material things, and may be perceived and delighted in by one who has no virtue, nor any reliſh for it. Now, Mr. H. has not offered the leaſt evidence that this is not ſo, in this paſſage; nor has he ſaid any thing really in oppoſition to Mr. Edwards. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Edwards allows there is a natural beauty in the practice of juſtice, and other virtues, <hi>in external conduct.</hi> And when theſe are the expreſſion of the heart, there is a <hi>moral beauty</hi> in the exerciſes of that, the beauty of holineſs. But when there is no true virtue in the heart, there is no natural beauty in the exerciſes of the mind; all the natural beauty is in the external conduct.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But I proceed to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. H. after all he has ſaid to the contrary,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012811_0111_0F8ABF97D66AB560"/>
allows the very thing he here oppoſes; ſo oppoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, while he thinks he is oppoſing Mr. Edwards. He ſays, men who are deſtitute of true virtue,
<q>are many times determined to do particular equitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to others from a regard to the equity of the caſe, as their true ſpring, and for equity's ſake, &amp;c.</q>
That a man in dealing with his neighbour, may
<q>ſee what is right between them, and from a regard to the equity of the caſe, deal juſtly with him.</q>
p. 50. Here he allows that equitable conduct in relative duty may be approved and practiſed, and yet there be no virtue in it. I would aſk Mr. H. whether there is not a ſort of beauty in this juſtice and equitable conduct, in which there is no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? He muſt anſwer in the affirmative; for what he ſays implies it, as he ſuppoſes it is practiſed from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the juſtice and equity of the caſe, and for equity's ſake. The next queſtion is, whether this beauty is the beauty of true virtue, or a beauty of another kind? This he has alſo anſwered. It cannot be the beauty of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for he expreſsly ſays there is no true virtue in it. And if there is a beauty in <hi>one inſtance</hi> of equitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which is of a different kind from the true beauty of virtue, this may be the caſe, yea certainly muſt be, in <hi>all inſtances.</hi> And this is a <hi>ſecondary beauty,</hi> which conſiſts in a natural harmony and agreement of one thing with another; the very ſame beauty which is found in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things. Thus Mr. Hart allows all that Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards has aſſerted concerning ſecondary beauty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly aſſerts at the latter end of his book, what he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemns in Mr. Edwards towards the beginning.
<q>Error is fated to run crooked. The <hi>greateſt men</hi> can't govern, and keep it ſtraight.</q>
Mr. Hart, p. 28.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards having obſerved that it was evident, from what he has ſaid, that the 'diſpoſition or ſenſe of the mind which conſiſts in a determination of mind to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and be pleaſed with this (ſecondary) beauty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſimply, and by itſelf, has nothing of the nature of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012811_0112_0F8ABF988982E408"/>
true virtue, and is entirely a different thing from a truly virtuous taſte;' there being no more virtue in it than there is in 'a diſpoſition to approve the harmony of good mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,' &amp;c. Mr H. makes the following obſervation upon it.
<q>If this good man had attended to one obvious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, he might have ſaved himſelf from falling into this <hi>grand abſurdity,</hi> viz. The difference there is in the nature of things, between the mind's ſeeing and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the harmonious proportion and juſtneſs of virtuous diſpoſitions and exerciſes of heart, towards God and our neighbour, and having ſuch diſpoſitions and exerciſes himſelf. A man may ſee and approve the beauty and excellence of true virtue, <hi>in ſome degree,</hi> and yet his heart not be in this beautifully harmonious and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table temper and ſtate.</q>
p. 20.21.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. 'This good man' has attended to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and thought he had demonſtrated the
'grand abſurdity'
and impoſſibility of what is ſuppoſed in it, in the following words.
<q>It is impoſſible that any one ſhould truly <hi>reliſh</hi> this beauty, conſiſting in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, who has not that temper himſelf. I have obſerved, that if any being is poſſeſſed of ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he will unavoidably be pleaſed with the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in another. And it may be in like manner demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that 'tis ſuch a ſpirit, and nothing elſe, that will reliſh ſuch a ſpirit. For if a being, deſtitute of benevolence, ſhould love benevolence to being in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it would prize and ſeek that which it had no value for. Becauſe to love an inclination to the good of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, would imply a loving and prizing the good of being in general. For how ſhould one love and value a diſpoſition to a thing, or a tendency to promote a thing, and for that very reaſon, becauſe it tends to promote it, when the thing itſelf is what he is regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of, and has no value for, nor deſires to have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.</q>
p. 125.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. H. well attended to this paſſage, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012811_0113_0F8ABF9969EBBC38"/>
to ſay nothing contrary to it, till he could anſwer it, 'he might have ſaved himſelf from falling into the <hi>grand abſurdity</hi>' contained in the words juſt quoted from him. For,—</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. Nothing can be more abſurd, and imply a greater contradiction, than that which Mr. H. here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, viz. that the heart which is in no degree virtuous, does at the ſame time approve of virtue; and that there is a difference in the nature of things between theſe. Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily to approve of virtue for its own ſake, is to be at heart a friend to virtue, and to love holineſs for holineſs ſake; and can this take place in an unholy heart? A heart that is an enemy to all virtue? It is impoſſible. It is even a ſelf-evident propoſition, <hi>that the love of holineſs, is holineſs</hi>; and therefore has paſſed for an inconteſtible truth, till Mr. H. has riſen and contradicted it. He ſays, 'a man may ſee and <hi>approve</hi> the beauty and excellence of virtue, <hi>in ſome degree,</hi> and yet his heart not be in this beautifully harmonious and equitable temper and ſtate.' But why does he limit this to <hi>ſome degree?</hi> Why may he not <hi>approve</hi> of the beauty and excellence of virtue <hi>in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree,</hi> as well as <hi>in ſome degree?</hi> It is impoſſible for him, or any one elſe to tell, unleſs it be becauſe his heart is <hi>in ſome degree</hi> a friend to virtue, i. e. really virtuous; but not ſo in every degree. All Mr. H's proof of this extraordinary aſſertion, is in the following words.
<q>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common, and nothing more to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than this monſtrous inconſiſtence between the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe or taſte of the mind, and the <hi>ruling</hi> diſpoſitions and exerciſes of the heart of man.</q>
Here is an appeal made to experience; but the whole evidence of the thing to be proved, lies in Mr. H's confident aſſertion. I may ſay, in my turn, If Mr. H. had attended to one obvious diſtinction, he might have ſaved himſelf from falling into this <hi>grand abſurdity,</hi> viz. the difference there is, in the nature of things, between the dictates of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience, and the reliſh and approbation of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012811_0114_0F8ABF9A133E1DF0"/>
the heart. An inconſiſtence between <hi>theſe</hi> is indeed very common; men often love and practice that with their whole hearts, which their reaſon and judgment declare to be wrong and hateful; and their conſcience pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that to be beautiful and excellent, which their hearts do not in any degree approve; but utterly deteſt and hate. Here is an inconſiſtence between the judgment and the heart, which is conſiſtent with the nature of things, and evident from abundant experience: But for the heart to approve of that which at the ſame time it hates and wholly rejects, is indeed a <hi>monſtrous inconſiſtence.</hi> It implies the moſt palpable contradiction; and therefore never did take place, nor ever will, in any one inſtance To ſee beauty, and heartily approve of it, as ſuch, or to taſte and reliſh the beauty of holineſs, as ſuch, is the ſame with the love of holineſs, as ſuch, or for its own ſake. And when Mr. H. will prove that the heart of man may be thus friendly to holineſs, and love it for its own ſake, while deſtitute of all true virtue, he will ſhew that he has not fallen into the grand abſurdity with which he is charged.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. ſays, that according to Mr. E.
<q>the nature and character, or perfections of God, are <hi>no cauſe</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> of the firſt exiſtence of a virtuous or holy principle in the hearts of created, intelligent beings.</q>
And adds,
<q>I ſhould be glad to know how the general attraction or propenſity of mind to being, comes into exiſtence.</q>
p. 22, marg.</p>
               <p>ANS. It comes into exiſtence by the omnipotent ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of God. It is his workmanſhip, by which men are <hi>created</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, who firſt <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi> man in his own image. Gen. 1.27. Eph. 10.4.24 God gives them a new heart; a heart to know him, &amp;c. Jer. 24.7. Ezek. 36.26. Giving a heart to know God, muſt be a work of power, in order to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; and therefore cannot be effected by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, or a true ſight of the perfections of God.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012811_0115_0F8ABF9AD9B57778"/>
A ſight and knowledge of the divine perfections cannot be the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> of that which is done in order to this knowledge taking place, or in giving a heart thus to know God. It is the new heart, the circumciſed, benevolent heart, and not the old, uncircumciſed, ſelfiſh heart, that ſees the divine character, and loves it. It is granted the heart would not ſee and love, were there nothing to be ſeen and loved; and in this ſenſe the character ſeen and loved, is the ground and cauſe, <hi>ſine qua non</hi>; as without this there would be no object of love. But the efficient cauſe, ground and foundation of all, is the divine power and energy, circumciſing the heart to know and love; giving a new heart, or the ſpirit of God taking poſſeſſion of the heart, is a powerful principle of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. And in this way, even by the immediate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine, new-creating power, the heart becomes benevolent.</p>
               <p>Mr. H's repreſentation ſuppoſes divine power and energy to be the cauſe of all virtue in the creature, and that it owes its firſt exiſtence to this; and ſo has really anſwered the queſtion which he puts. He ſuppoſes
'a realizing belief'
of the divine character and love, by which God's excellence and love is 'perceived, realized and <hi>felt,</hi> as extended to them,' is given to them by God: Or that 'tis God who 'gives them to <hi>feel</hi> in themſelves his attracting love,' &amp;c. and that this is the cauſe, ground and reaſon, why one ſees, realizes and <hi>feels</hi> this excellence &amp; love of God, rather than another, &amp; why he does it now, rather than before. p. 23, 24. This realizing belief, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, &amp; <hi>feeling</hi> is given by God, in taking away the heart of ſtone, which would not realize and <hi>feel</hi> this excellence and love, and giving a new heart, a heart of fleſh. This then is the cauſe, ground and ſource of the firſt exiſtence of all true virtue, and muſt be ſo, according to Mr. H. And I conclude Mr. H. will not ſay, this divine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by which it is given to men to ſee and feel God's excellence and love, is by the truth ſeen; becauſe this
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012811_0116_0F8ABF9B88DED7F0"/>
would be to make the effect the means and cauſe of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to ſuppoſe God works by that which is the fruit and conſequence of his own operation. Surely that which God does, in order to make men ſee and feel, is not done <hi>by</hi> their ſeeing and feeling, or by the things ſeen and felt; but by an immediate operation. If Mr. H. will not grant this, he will find himſelf in the caſe of his before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Indian.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. ſays,
<q>This doctrine of Mr. Edwards's ſeems to be the foundation on which ſeveral doctrines, in the <hi>new</hi> ſcheme of divinity, are built. Theſe in particular, viz. That the moral perfections and character of God, as revealed by the goſpel, and ſeen by natural men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the teaching of the word and ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo far as they are capable of ſeeing them, can have no poſſible influence in changing their hearts. Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts in giving or planting in the heart a new, ſpiritual taſte or reliſh. This change is not wrought by the inſtrumentallity of light, or by any means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; the word of God is not a means in the hand of the ſpirit, in working this change; but it is effected by meer, abſolute, and properly creating power, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Hart has not mentioned theſe doctrines exactly in the words of thoſe to whom he imputes them; and when they have uſed any of theſe words, they have explained them, and guarded againſt a wrong ſenſe, which the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be in danger of putting upon them, as they are here uſed by Mr. H. The ſum of the doctrines that have been advanced on this head, ſo far as I can learn, is this, viz. that the human heart is naturally ſo wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſo blind and oppoſite to the beauty and excellence of divine truth and holineſs, that in order to its ſeeing and reliſhing this, a divine power muſt be exerted on the heart, of which divine power and operation, this ſight and reliſh of truth is the effect. The divine operation in this caſe is as much antecedent to this ſight and taſte, as the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes is antecedent to ſeeing; and as much the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012811_0117_0F8ABF9CC1672568"/>
effect and conſequence of this work, as ſeeing is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and conſequence of having the eyes opened: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore light, or the truth ſeen, is not any means of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful operation, which is antecedent to ſeeing the truth, and does produce this ſight, as the cauſe of it: For, by the ſuppoſition, it is the effect, and not the cauſe; and divine truth ſeen and reliſhed, is really that in which the active change conſiſts, which is the effect of the divine power.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. grants this is all true, if Mr. Edwards's notion of true virtue is right: So that, according to him (and I ſuppoſe it is the truth of the caſe) the diſpute is, at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, about the nature of true holineſs, which is the ſame with the nature of God's moral character. If this is rightly ſtated in the preceeding inquiry, what Mr. H. calls 'the <hi>new</hi> ſcheme of divinity,' is as old as the bible, and the only ſcriptural one: If not, his oppoſition may perhaps be juſtified.</p>

               <p>MR. Hart's objections againſt Mr. Edwards's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of natural conſcience and moral ſenſe, are grounded on his excluding from it all reliſh and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of heart, of the beauty and excellence of virtue; and all true ſenſe &amp; diſcerning of that in which it conſiſts. He has formed his obſervations upon this under <hi>five</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. p. 29—39. But the whole of the objections he makes againſt it, may be reduced to the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="1">I. If natural conſcience does not ſee and reliſh true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012811_0118_0F8ABF9D1C47D288"/>
or that very beauty and excellence in which it is diſtinguiſhed from every thing elſe, then the dictates of conſcience, and the ſenſe of deſert which is implied in it, are without foundation, and wrong, and it
<q>unavoidably deceives us; for moral deſert is neceſſarily connected with, and has a natural and direct relation to, this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in moral actions, wherein their virtuouſneſs or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs conſiſts, and to nothing elſe. But (according to Mr. Edwards) natural conſcience has no perception or ſenſe of that quality in moral actions, wherein their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs eſſentially conſiſts; but, as a wrong-headed thing, places it in that wherein it does not at all conſiſt, and ſo connects the ſenſe of deſert wrong, and contrary to the true nature of things.</q>
p. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>ANS. There is in natural conſcience the exerciſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgment, which may be right, and agreeable to the truth, independent of the exerciſes of the heart, and in direct oppoſition to them. Reaſon and judgment may pronounce a thing right, morally good and excellent, while to the reliſh and inclination of the heart, it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ineligible and diſpleaſing. In this caſe, conſcience is not a wrong-headed thing, but dictates the truth. Reaſon and judgment being rightly informed, and free from ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative error, are ſo far from deceiving us, that, by the ſuppoſition, they dictate nothing but the truth, and place virtue and vice, and moral deſert, in that in which they truly conſiſt. There is ſo much evidence of this from fact and experience, that I ſuppoſe it needleſs to attempt to make it more evident by reaſoning upon it.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid, this does not remove the difficulty; for theſe dictates of reaſon ſuppoſe an idea of the thing, of which it judges, and that it is ſeen in a true light. How can the mind judge of that, of which it has no true ſight or conception? It judges of what it ſees, and not of that which it does not ſee.</p>
               <p>ANS. The reaſon &amp; judgment may be convinced of the beauty, excellence &amp; worthineſs of an object, of which beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and excellence the mind has not the leaſt taſte &amp; reliſh; &amp; in this ſenſe there is no idea or ſight of the beauty and excellence of the object. This is certain from fact and experience, as has been juſt obſerved. And this is all that is affirmed in the caſe before us; and therefore the thing that is objected againſt. Conſequently the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be groundleſs. The taſte and ſenſe of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beauty which there is in true virtue, and a deſire to be ſelf-conſiſtent, and oppoſition to the contrary (both which Mr. Edwards obſerves come into natural conſcience, and the moral ſenſe) may be neceſſary to give an idea and ſenſe of any thing moral, and of moral deſert; and yet the judgment and conſcience place true virtue and moral deſert, in that in which it really conſiſts. Reaſon may dictate that the beauty which the mind diſcerns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes, is not the true beauty of virtue; but this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a more noble kind, conſiſting in union of heart to heart, in univerſal benevolence; and that all moral deſert lies in this, and its contrary. I ſay, reaſon and conſcience may dictate all this, without any actual idea, or real perception of that ſweet beauty and excellence there is in virtue, or the leaſt degree of reliſh of it: And will do ſo, if all ſpeculative error is removed. Thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, when duly enlightened, will approve of true virtue, and nothing elſe, as really excellent and praiſe worthy. And if a man does not judge right in this caſe; but is deceived. and judges that true virtue conſiſts in that natural agreement and ſecondary beauty, which he ſees and reliſhes, 'tis his own fault, and an abuſe of his reaſon, through the prejudices and corruption of his heart. Mr. H. ſays, according to Mr. Edwards's notion of virtue, 'natural conſcience is wholly ignorant of it, and uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in it.' But herein he is greatly miſtaken. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgment may be fully convinced that true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſts in benevolence, while the heart is wholly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it, and the moral taſte have no reliſh for it, no ſenſe of its ſweetneſs, beauty and excellence. So a man's
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:012811_0120_0F8ABF9F56F8A938"/>
conſcience may be convinced that he is wholly without all true virtue, and all proper idea and ſenſe of it; and that he is wholly to blame for not exerciſing this virtue.</p>
               <p>A man who never felt in his heart the leaſt degree of love to God, or had any delight in worſhipping him; but the greateſt averſion to i, &amp; is always moſt uneaſy when obliged to be preſent where he is worſhipped: But has the higheſt reliſh for gaming, drinking, and profaneneſs, and places all his happineſs in theſe: Such a man may be convinced in his conſcience, that there is ſuch a thing as true ſupreme love to God, and that there is the higheſt and moſt refined pleaſure in this, and in worſhipping and ſerving God, with ſuch love: That he is under all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable obligations to love God, and delight in him and his ſervice, ſo that 'tis wholly his fault that he does not: And yet go on in his old way, with as ſtrong an inclination as ever. In this caſe, the man, by the ſuppoſition, has no true idea of that about which he reaſons right; but is wholly ignorant of the beauty and excellence of God, and has not the leaſt taſte and reliſh of the pleaſure in worſhipping him with true devotion. He has indeed ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative ideas of theſe, i. e. all the ideas that ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the help of all the ſenſations he has, will give, or is capable of, while his heart is wholly without any taſte and reliſh for moral excellence. In this inſtance and there are many ſuch) his conſcience does not deceive him, but judges right, and his reaſon condemns what his heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes and approves, and pronounces that right, excellent and happy, of which he has not the leaſt taſte or reliſh; and ſo no true idea of the beauty, excellence and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what his conſcience approves, or his reaſon judges to be right and excellent.</p>
               <p>The man who has no diſintereſted benevolence, may have a ſpeculative idea of it, i. e. all the idea that there is, or can be, in meer ſpeculation, and all that is neceſſary in order to <hi>reaſon</hi> about it; but can have nothing of that idea which comes by taſte and reliſh of the thing, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:012811_0121_0F8ABFA00A6D01A0"/>
a ſight and ſenſe of its true beauty and excellence. All the blindneſs and ignorance there is in this caſe, lies wholly in the want of ſuch a taſte and reliſh, and in an inclination to that which is oppoſite to it. The natural moral taſte, which does not reach to true virtue, or imply the leaſt reliſh for it, but is conſiſtent with the greateſt diſreliſh of it, is neceſſary in order to the mind's forming an idea of any thing moral; and therefore is implied in natural conſcience and ſenſe of moral deſert; but is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely a different thing from a reliſh of true virtue, or an idea of it's true beauty and excellence.—</p>
               <p>Mr. H. obſerves that Mr. Edwards ſays,
<q>Natural conſcience will approve of true virtue, without ſeeing the true beauty of it.</q>
And upon it has the following words.
<q>Approve of that which you have no idea of, no reliſh for! Is not this a contradiction?</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. No, by no means. What has been ſaid, I hope, is a ſufficient anſwer to this queſtion. The appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of conſcience in this caſe is entirely a diſtinct thing from any reliſh and approbation of heart. By <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of conſcience here is meant <hi>conviction of conſcience,</hi> or the reaſon and judgment dictating that true virtue is right, excellent, and moſt beautiful, which is a diſtinct thing from reliſhing, or ſeeing the beauty.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Mr. H. objects that 'From Mr. Edwards's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines it does neceſſarily follow, that men are under no natural obligation to be virtuous, and can't equitably be required to be ſo.' p. 34.</p>
               <p>The ſum of what he ſays in ſupport of this is,
<q>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience and the moral ſenſe can't taſte and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this kind of virtue, any more than the white of an egg; and natural reaſon, and common ſenſe ſay there is no worth in it, nor any uſe or occaſion for it in the moral world. Nothing but this preternatural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple itſelf (i. e. a truly virtuous taſte, or a benevolent mind) can taſte the ſweetneſs of this primary beauty, or perceive any moral excellence in this ſort of virtue:
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:012811_0122_0F8ABFA15BCD4388"/>
It lies far beyond the ſphere of natural conſcience and the moral taſte. It is no object to them; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is, by the conſtitution of his nature, as incapable of ſeeing or taſting this primary beauty of moral things, as beaſts are of reliſhing their ſecondary beauty. He is no more made for the one, than they are for the other, and is no more obliged to reliſh the one, than they are to reliſh the other; and cannot equitably be required to do ſo, till a new faculty or taſte is given him, adapted to this object, by a new creating act of power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. 1. When Mr. H. ſays, natural conſcience cannot approve of this kind of virtue, if by <hi>approve</hi> he means conviction of conſcience, that this is true virtue, and that there is a beauty and excellence in it, while the heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves and rejects it, his aſſertion is not true, as has been proved. If by <hi>approve</hi> he means a reliſh and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of heart, 'tis granted, and has been proved that no man, who has nothing of the nature of true virtue, can thus approve of it.</p>
               <p>When he ſays 'natural reaſon and common ſenſe ſay there is no worth in it' (i. e. virtue which conſiſts in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to being in general) 'nor any uſe or occaſion for it in the moral world,' he only begs the queſtion, and aſſerts what is moſt contrary to known fact. There are multitudes, the dictates of whoſe reaſon and common ſenſe are, that all true worth and excellence conſiſt in this; and that this is the life, excellence and happineſs of the moral world. And this is the univerſal dictate of natural reaſon and common ſenſe, when properly enlightened, and impartial.</p>
               <p>And his aſſertion, in which all the ſeeming force of his argument lies, is wholly without foundation, viz. That man is, <hi>by the conſtitution of his nature,</hi> as incapable of ſeeing or taſting this primary beauty of moral things, as the beaſts are of reliſhing their ſecondary beauty. Man is, by the conſtitution of his nature, as capable of ſeeing and taſting this beauty, as he is of exerciſing virtue;
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012811_0123_0F8ABFA1E0F560C0"/>
for this is one and the ſame thing. Man has all the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> faculties which are neceſſary in order to his being vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; and therefore by the <hi>conſtitution of his nature,</hi> is capable of ſeeing and taſting the beauty of moral things, and of being perfectly holy. He wants nothing but an inclination to this, a heart to improve the faculties he has, in order to ſee and taſte this beauty, and be truly virtuous. In ſhort, he is furniſhed with every thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in order to ſee and exerciſe virtue, except it be virtue itſelf. This he has not; but has every thing elſe, which a creature can have, and not be actually virtuous. And if the want of a virtuous diſpoſition, or a heart to diſcern, and exerciſe virtue, and a ſtrong and fixed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite inclination, take off all obligation to virtue; then it is not poſſible that any man ſhould be under any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to exerciſe more virtue than he actually has, and does exerciſe; and conſequently there is no ſuch thing as ſin and blame or ill deſert in nature.</p>
               <p>But Mr. H. ſays,
<q>This is no more than ſaying, if they had this new kind of reliſh, they would have it, and if they had it, they might eaſily exerciſe it. But what is this to the purpoſe, when at the ſame time they confeſs, there is no natural faculty in human nature, by any poſſible application of truth to which, this taſte can be raiſed up in the heart? On theſe principles, we might, with as much reaſon, and as good a grace ſay, the inability a blind man is under to ſee and reliſh the beauty of light, is of the moral kind, and ſolemnly impute it to him as ſin.</q>
p. 35.</p>
               <p>ANS. This is ſaying that this new kind of reliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the will or heart, and conſiſts in the diſpoſition and exerciſe of that: That ſo long as the diſpoſition and choice of the heart is wrong, and in oppoſition to virtue, it has no reliſh for it; but when the mind is diſpoſed and inclined to virtue, it has this taſte and reliſh; for they are one and the ſame thing. Therefore all the defect lies in the heart, being indiſpoſed to love and chooſe
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012811_0124_0F8ABFA24E4BBAA0"/>
that which is in itſelf moſt excellent, and to which it is invited by the ſtrongeſt reaſons and motives.</p>
               <p>If Mr. H's ſervant ſhould utterly refuſe to live in his houſe, or obey him in any one thing, and declare that he ſaw nothing agreeable in his houſe, or any of his ways; but he took his whole delight in gaming, drinking and debauchery, and was determined to ſpend the reſt of his life in theſe. His maſter would doubtleſs tell him, that he had a very falſe and bad taſte indeed, that he was very capable of knowing and doing better, and it was wholly owing to the viciouſneſs of his heart, that he could take no delight in his houſe and ſervice, and had become ſuch a diſobedient ſervant, &amp;c. and ſolemnly impute it to him, as his ſin. If the ſervant ſhould ſay, 'This is no more than ſaying, if I had a reliſh for your ſervice and your ways, I ſhould have it, and if I had it, I could eaſily exerciſe it, and ſhould then be willing to ſtay with you: But as I have not this taſte and turn of mind, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary you have no reaſon to blame me in the leaſt, or think me under any obligation to love or obey you;' his maſter would doubtleſs think he argued very weakly. And if Mr. H. by all experiments in his power, ſhould find nothing in him, 'by any poſſible application of truth, to which' he could raiſe up in his heart the leaſt degree of taſte and reliſh for the beauty and order of his houſe, or any inclination to live with him; but a fixed abhorrence of his ſervice and all his ways, would this excuſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in his eyes? No: If he did not diveſt himſelf of all reaſon and common ſenſe, the further he found his ſervant from all taſte and reliſh for the buſineſs and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his houſe, and the more impoſſible, by any applications to his mind, to raiſe in his heart ſuch a taſte, or eradicate the contrary, the more would he blame, and impute ſin to him.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. We do indeed 'confeſs there is no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculty in human nature, by any poſſible application of truth, to which this taſte can be raiſed up in the heart,'
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012811_0125_0F8ABFA31D0828D0"/>
ſo long as the will remains wholly perverſe, &amp; oppoſes all ſuch applications; &amp; every one muſt confeſs this who will not hold the moſt palpable abſurdity. But this does not ſuppoſe any want of natural faculties, or any natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in them; all the defect lies in the inclination or will; 'tis the perverſe, obſtinate reſiſtance of <hi>that,</hi> to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made, which prevents their efficacy; therefore the perſon is wholly blamable for not having this taſte, if a perverſe inclination is in any caſe blamable. This is illuſtrated in the inſtance of the ſervant above.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. Mr. H. himſelf allows the ſame thing, which he is here condemning. He ſays wicked men, or vicious minds have no virtuous taſte, this being a diſtinct thing, and eſſentially different from any thing which they have; and that their hearts are in oppoſition to it; p. 32.33. and then goes on to ſay,
<q>There is no cure for this evil diſeaſe of the heart, but by the grace and truths of the goſpel, <hi>as ſtrongly impreſſed upon the mind by the ſpirit of Chriſt.</hi> If the perverſeneſs and obſtinacy of wicked minds prevails to that degree, under the enlightening influences and ſtrivings of the ſpirit of truth and grace, as to provoke the Lord to withdraw his gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and give them wholly up to their own hearts luſts, their perverſeneſs becomes <hi>abſolutely incurable,</hi> and they go into perdition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>According to this, men are as far from a virtuous taſte as Mr. Edwards ſuppoſes they are; and they can't be recovered to this by any thing but the ſpirit of Chriſt. And yet he holds they are under obligations to be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to have this virtuous taſte, even while they are under the power of this 'incurable diſeaſe,' incurable by any powers in themſelves, or by any application, unleſs by the ſpirit of Chriſt; and even incurable by him, 'ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incurable', if perverſely and obſtinately reſiſted by them. Let Mr. H. vindicate his own poſitions here, and he will anſwer all his objections againſt Preſident Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and his diſciples, on this head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:012811_0126_0F8ABFA3C7F431A0"/>Mr. H. in his letter to Dr. Whitaker, p. 10. allows, 'That men muſt have theſe things preſented to their view by <hi>God's teaching,</hi> before they <hi>can</hi> perceive their moral excellence.' Mr. H. may be aſked, Why then are they under obligations to ſee this moral excellence, and reliſh it, antecedent to God's teachings, or the impreſſions of the ſpirit of Chriſt? What if the ſpirit does not <hi>ſtrongly impreſs</hi> theſe things on the mind, and they have not God's teachings; will this leave them under no obligations to ſee and reliſh theſe things, and wholly blameleſs in their 'incurable diſeaſe?' It <hi>muſt,</hi> if what Mr. H. ſays on this head againſt Mr. Edwards has any reaſon &amp; weight.—And why is their perverſeneſs blamable, from whom the ſpirit of God withdraws himſelf? Why are they ſent to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince their diſeaſe always was incurable by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they are as far from a virtuous taſte, as a blind man is from ſeeing the light; and it is become <hi>abſolutely incurable</hi> now? As well may you condemn a blind man for not ſeeing and reliſhing the light of the ſun, Mr. H. being judge.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I ſaid above, Mr. H. holds that men who have no virtue, or virtuous taſte, are under obligations to be virtuous; becauſe this is ſuppoſed in his objection againſt Mr. Edwards, which we are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is implied in all he ſays upon it. But I think he has ſaid what is inconſiſtent with this, and a ſufficient ground to conclude he does not hold that unregenerate men are under obligations to be holy. I have reference to what he ſays, when it was urged againſt him, that the repreſentation given in his words juſt quoted, which he had before given, in ſubſtance, in his dialogues, was as inconſiſtent with man's obligations to be holy, &amp;c. as the doctrines he objected againſt. They are the following words.
<q>The goſpel is a miniſtration of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral truth &amp; grace, fitted in its nature to work in the mind as a vital ſeed &amp; ſacred leaven; &amp; the mind of man is naturally capable of being influenced and changed or ſpiritualized by it, <hi>when firmly believed and realized</hi> The holy ſpirit of God accompanies this miniſtration of the word of life, with ſome degree of his influence, <hi>at a common grace.</hi> If ſinners improve this, and the outward helps they have by the goſpel, AS FAR AS THEY ARE IMPROVABLE BY THEM, I <hi>believe</hi> he will crown his common influence with ſpecial and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, leading them on to ſaving faith, and ſo regenerate them If they do not, but continually reſiſt and rebel againſt the motions of the ſpirit, and ſo provoke God to withdraw his ſpirit and give them up to final blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, he grace of the goſpel is vindicated, and they periſh as deſpiſers of it. This belief is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with my doctrine above.</q>
Letter to Dr. Whitaker, p. 32.</p>
                     <p>On theſe words the following things may be noted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When Mr. H. ſays 'the mind of man is <hi>naturally capable</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influenced and changed by the truth of the goſpel, <hi>when firmly believed and realized,</hi>' it is implied that it is not <hi>naturally</hi> capable of this, until this is the caſe; which he ſays is the work of the ſpirit alone; and that none can believe and realize it, unleſs <hi>ſtrongly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> by the ſpirit. According to this, men are not <hi>naturally</hi> capable of holineſs, i. e. have no natural capacity while without the ſpirit cauſing them to realize the truth and ſtrongly impreſſing it on their minds: Therefore cannot be under obligation to be holy. Thus he who, without any reaſon, charges Mr. Edwards with holding that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have no natural capacity of holineſs, does himſelf aſſert it, ſo as to be <hi>juſtly</hi> liable to the charge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He places all the ſinner's duty in improving what he calls <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace,</hi> and the outward helps they have by the goſpel, <hi>as far as they are improvable by them.</hi> This they may do without the exerciſe of the leaſt degree of holineſs; therefore they are not obliged to be holy; they not being capable of it, until they have the <hi>ſpecial and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual</hi> influence of the ſpirit. Thus Mr. H. holds 'that men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no natural obligation to be virtuous at all.' With how poor a grace then does this objection againſt Mr. Edwards's doctrine come from him?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His <hi>belief</hi> that God will <hi>effectually</hi> lead them on to ſaving faith, <hi>and ſo</hi> regenerate them who improve the common influences of the ſpirit, <hi>as far as they are improvable by them,</hi> (i. e. as far as is conſiſtent with reigning luſt, &amp; enmity againſt God) is a belief without any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from ſcripture, or any other quarter; and therefore <hi>this belief</hi> is doubtleſs conſiſtent with <hi>all</hi> his doctrines, as it is with all the doctrines of Arminians and Pelagians; who have as much of this fond belief as Mr. Hart.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:012811_0127_0F8ABFA4A9EEF470"/>But as Mr. H. has undertaken to ſhew parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what inability does not excuſe, we will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that, and ſee if he has given any better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, than they do whom he thinks he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. He ſays,
<q>That kind of moral inability which does not excuſe from blame, but rather aggravates it, is that which our Saviour, and the prophets and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles charge upon the perverſe Jews, when they ſay they have eyes and ſee not, ears and hear not, hearts capable
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012811_0128_0F8ABFA7E814F898"/>
of underſtanding, and yet underſtand not, &amp;c. <hi>It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an indiſpoſition, and perverſe refuſal to exert thoſe moral powers which men have.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He has here given a very good account. The diſeaſe lies wholly in the indiſpoſition and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the will or heart; therefore their not ſeeing, and all their inability to ſee, is their own fault. This account is indeed agreeable to ſcripture, and to reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe; and is the very ſame they give of the matter, whom Mr. H. thinks he is oppoſing. He goes on
<q>But upon the principles of Mr. Edwards's ſcheme, the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of natural men to ſee, or rather taſte the ſweetneſs of what he calls virtue, conſiſts in the want of a <hi>natural faculty,</hi> or taſte ſuited to the object.</q>
This is a moſt ungrounded and injurious aſſertion, directly contrary to the whole tenor of Mr. Edwards's writings. I might on as good ground ſay, that according to Mr. H. in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count above, men's inability to ſee conſiſts in the want of a natural faculty, becauſe they want a diſpoſition or heart to ſee. Men ſhut their own eyes, through an indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perverſe refuſal to exert the powers to have, in ſeeing and reliſhing divine things. The ſpirit of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can cure this evil diſeaſe of the heart, by removing this indiſpoſition and perverſe refuſal to ſee, and ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of the blind. This is a renewing the will, or changing the heart, to diſcern and taſte the ſweetneſs and excellence of true holineſs, and not giving any new natural faculty.</p>
               <p>And now the reader is left to judge whether Mr. H. has in any meaſure ſupported his objection. I proceed to the conſideration of another.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Mr. H. ſays Mr. Edwards is groſsly inconſiſtent with himſelf in what he ſays of natural conſcience.— p. 27.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. obſerves Mr. Edwards ſays that 'natural conſcience, if well informed, will approve of true virtue, and will diſapprove and condemn the want of it; and yet
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012811_0129_0F8ABFA86BE23CD8"/>
without ſeeing the true beauty of it. If men's conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were fully enlightened, as they will be at the day of judgment, they would approve nothing but true virtue." And then remarks upon it, 'Thus natural conſcience does, and does not, can, and can't taſte or approve the true beauty of virtue.'</p>
               <p>ANS. What has been ſaid, in anſwer to the firſt objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may ſerve to ſhew how groundleſs this is, and that Mr. Edwards is perfectly conſiſtent here. Reaſon and conſcience may be truly convinced, and judge, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſts in general benevolence, and in nothing elſe; and therefore that this is the higheſt beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and yet the mind have no taſte for this beauty, and conſequently no true diſcerning of it. Reaſon and conſcience may be ſo enlightened and convinced, as to judge perfectly right in this matter, which will doubtleſs be the caſe at the day of judgment, without any taſte of the beauty of virtue, and conſiſtent with the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte and abhorrence of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. might as eaſily, and with as much reaſon, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a contradiction on our Lord, becauſe he has ſaid of his perſecutors, 'They have both <hi>ſeen,</hi> and hated, both me and my Father,' Joh. xv. 24. and yet at the ſame time, ſaid of the ſame perſons,
<q>They have not known the Father, nor me,</q>
chap. xvi. 3. And with as good reaſon might he charge St. John with expreſsly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting his Lord and maſter, when he ſays,

Whereas Chriſt ſays of ſome of the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, '<hi>they have ſeen</hi> both me, and my Father,' In a word, the bible is ſo expreſs in this, that they who do evil, even all who have no true virtue, whatever advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they are under to know God; and whatever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God they have by natural conſcience and moral ſenſe; yet do not know God, nor have ſeen him, and do not ſee nor know the holy ſpirit, who is the ſum of all holineſs in God and the creature, Joh. xiv. 27, that tis

not a little wonderful, Mr. H. ſhould take ſuch great exceptions againſt Mr. Edwards's ſaying the ſame thing and imagine he had contradicted himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards ſays, natural conſcience, when well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and thoroughly awakened, approves true virtue, and indeed approves nothing that falls ſhort of it. Upon this Mr. H. ſays, 'But the ſecondary beauty falls ſhort of it.' Becauſe Mr. Edwards had ſaid there is in natural conſcience, a taſte for ſecondary or natural beauty, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes he has here contradicted himſelf. But all the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradiction lies in Mr. H's miſtake. Mr. Edwards's plain meaning is, that natural conſcience is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced what true virtue is, ſo as to judge or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that, &amp; nothing which falls ſhort of it, to be virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There may be a taſte for ſecondary beauty, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience not approve of this as true virtue; but pronounce it not to be ſo.</p>
               <p>The following words of Mr. H. are remarkable. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mr. Edwards's ſentiments, he ſays, 'At the day of judgment natural conſcience will be ſo improved' (i.e. according to Mr. Edwards)
<q>as to <hi>ſee the true beauty of virtue,</hi> conſiſting in general benevolence, and wholly approve it; which nothing but virtuous benevolence can do. Will not the wicked then become virtuous, according to this doctrine?</q>
p. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>ANS. The doctrine is not Mr. Edwards's, but Mr. H's. One which he has invented, and palmed on Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards does not ſay that conſcience will at the day of judgment <hi>ſee the true beauty of virtue,</hi> but he ſays di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the contrary in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt terms. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is not eaſy to ſay how Mr. H. could be guilty of this groſs miſrepreſentation and abuſe, who is ſo great an advocate for fairneſs, candour, honeſty and juſtice in controverſial writings. He muſt be very eager to find contradictions, who will take ſuch a method to do it. No one will envy Mr. H the triumph and flouriſh he has made upon this, in the following words
<q>Error is fated to run crooked. The greateſt men cannot govern and keep it ſtraight. It is our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to have nothing to do with it. Since ſo great a man as Mr. Edwards could not alter its crooked nature, but was drawn by its wilely turnings into numberleſs inconſiſtencies, 'tis in vain for others to attempt to manage ſo involved a creature.</q>
The error; the crookedneſs be upon Mr. H. It lies wholly with him. If the great EDWARDS, who wrote with ſo much clearneſs and prec<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:012811_0131_0F8ABFA9C8EB5340"/>WE will now attend to Mr. H's account of natural conſcience or moral ſenſe, and ſee how he diſtinguiſhes it from a virtuous taſte, between which he ſays there is 'a real and eſſential difference.' He ſays,
<q>By the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcernment and taſte, natural to man, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted moral agents. By the exerciſe of this moral faculty the things that are morally good or virtuous are ſeen to be ſo, <hi>as ſuch</hi> are approved, the obligation we are under to chooſe and practiſe them, is felt, <hi>in ſome degree.</hi> This does not render a man virtuous. To render a man truly virtuous or holy his heart muſt agree with his enlightened conſcience or moral ſenſe; or in other words, his will muſt chooſe, with <hi>preferring love,</hi> and a determined reſolution to practiſe what is approved and recommended by the moral ſenſe; and this, not in ſome particular branches of virtue only, but in its whole extent.—This ſenſe, choice and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heart to God, or to virtue and its intereſts, is that wherein a truly virtuous taſte or ſpiritual ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, as diſtinguiſhed from the natural, moral ſenſe of the mind: They are really two diſtinct things, though in perfect harmony, p. 32, 33.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this it may be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Mr. H. here ſays may be underſtood ſo as to be perfectly conſiſtent with Mr. Edwards. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes natural conſcience and moral ſenſe from the heart or will, and ſuppoſes the latter may oppoſe the cleareſt dictates of the former. Mr. Edwards grants that by natural conſcience 'the things that are morally good or virtuous are ſeen to be ſo, as ſuch are approved;'
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012811_0132_0F8ABFAA872B9DF8"/>
ſo far as they can be ſeen and approved, without any taſte or approbation of heart; and the obligation we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to chooſe and practiſe them, is in ſome ſenſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſeen and felt. And that a virtuous taſte conſiſts in quite a different thing, viz. a diſpoſition to love and chooſe what a well enlightened conſcience dictates to be right. And this is all Mr. H. ſeems to ſay here. If we underſtand him as meaning no more, it is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with all that Mr. Edwards ſays of natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a virtuous taſte; but he will be conſiſtent with himſelf, when he ſays. They who
<q>have not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſpirit of God, as their teacher, in his revelation of the hidden things of God to men, and do not give credit to his ſupernatural witneſs to their truth; but act under the biaſing and blinding influence of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of error and worldly luſts, <hi>do not receive theſe things as true and divine, neither can they know them to be ſo,</hi> ſo long as they refuſe the light and witneſs of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</q>
— (Letter to Dr. Wh—r, p. 60.) I do not pretend to underſtand Mr. Hart's laboured explanation of the text which ſpeaks of the natural man's not diſcerning the things of the ſpirit of God. He is to me very dark and confuſed, if not inconſiſtent, and has left the text as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, at leaſt, as he found it. However, I think we may ſafely conclude that in the paſſage now quoted, by them who have not received the ſpirit, and do not give credit to his witneſs, he means all unholy men. And theſe, he ſays, do not receive the things of God as true and divine, neither can they know them to be ſo. Then certainly they do not ſee their true beauty and excellence, their blinding luſts do effectually blind their eyes to this; for if they ſee this, they muſt ſee them to be true and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and know them to be ſo. Now this is all that Mr. Edwards aſſerts. This therefore makes him inconſiſtent with himſelf in oppoſing Mr. Edwards; for he is herein oppoſing himſelf as much.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:012811_0133_0F8ABFAC33C8C660"/>2. But if we underſtand him here as ſaying any thing really in oppoſition to Mr. Edwards, and agreeable to what he elſewhere ſuppoſes and aſſerts viz. that men who have no virtuous taſte, do ſee the true beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of virtue, and <hi>reliſh</hi> it as ſuch, p. 29, he has not only expreſſed himſelf in a very dark, ambiguous manner; ſo that 'tis difficult to know what he means; but is inconſiſtent with the above quoted paſſage of his own, and even with himſelf in this very paſſage: But, what is worſe, he contradicts the bible, as well as plain reaſon and common ſenſe. For,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſee the amiableneſs and excellence of an object, and taſte and reliſh it, as beautiful and excellent, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame with loving that object, with a love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence. Therefore if men naturally ſee God's holineſs as amiable, beautiful and excellent, and have a reliſh for it, as ſuch, they do know God, in the higheſt ſenſe of knowing him, and they do love him; for theſe are one and the ſame thing. To ſay there is no love in this ſweet ſenſe and reliſh of God's amiableneſs, is contrary to reaſon and common ſenſe. And to ſay that men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſuch a knowledge and love of God, is contrary to ſcripture; and is contrary to this very paſſage of Mr. H's; for he ſays this natural conſcience and moral taſte is a different thing from a virtuous taſte; yea there is an <hi>eſſential difference</hi> between them; and does not imply any reliſh or choice of the object, but the choice, or will may be directly oppoſed to it. What then does Mr. H. mean by his <hi>moral taſte?</hi> He gave ſuch a deſcription of it in his dialogue, that it was thought it neceſſarily implied a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true love to God, and to holineſs, or a really vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous taſte: But when he ſaw this conſtruction was put upon it, he complained that he was greatly abuſed, and ſaid he meant no ſuch thing. But has not yet ſhewn his conſiſtence in this, ſo far as I can judge. He aſſerts that 'a perception of beauty is not love' of beauty; but
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012811_0134_0F8ABFAE392B25A8"/>
has offered no proof, nor will he ever do it. <note n="*" place="bottom">He has attempted to ſhew that his moral taſte, and ſenſe of the amiableneſs of holineſs, is not love of holineſs, in his letter to Dr. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker, p. 8 9. to which the reader is referred. I don't ſee any proof of this in all that he has there-ſaid. The moſt that he ſays, is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of natural conſcience and moral taſte, very conſiſtent with that which Mr. Edwards gives, and he makes a proper diſtinction between this and the heart, choice or will, in its judgment in favour of virtue, &amp;c. But he has not ſhewn that there may be a ſight of the beauty and amiableneſs of holineſs, and a taſte and reliſh for it, without any exerciſe of heart or choice in favour of it; and while the heart hates and oppoſes it. Unleſs he can do this, his cauſe cannot be maintained.</note> Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The only way I can think of to make Mr. H. in any meaſure conſiſtent with himſelf in theſe things, is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by moral taſte, by which the true beauty of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſeen and reliſhed, he intends the ſame thing in kind with a virtuous taſte; and that the difference lies wholly in the different degrees of the ſame kind of thing. That when this ſight and reliſh of the beauty and excellence of virtue is in ſo low a degree as not to govern the mind; and ſuppreſs all contrary luſts, it is not true love to God or to holineſs, ſo is not a holy love; that this conſiſts not in this low degree of reliſh &amp; love, but in a 'preferring love, which ſo prevails as to bear down all oppoſite luſts. His way of expreſſing himſelf on this head gives ground to think this is his notion. In the paſſage under conſideration, he ſays this moral ſenſe, common to all men, approves of virtue, and feels the obligation they are under to practiſe it, <hi>in ſome degree</hi>; but does not render them virtuous, while vicious luſts <hi>prevail,</hi> and the <hi>prevailing</hi> reliſh of the heart is in oppoſition to this moral ſenſe. To render a man truly virtuous or holy, his will muſt chooſe with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring love,</hi> and <hi>determined reſolution</hi> to practice what is approved by the moral ſenſe, And he always ſpeaks after this manner, on this ſubject. He ſays, a man may ſee and approve the beauty of virtue, <hi>in ſome degree,</hi> when <hi>the ruling</hi> diſpoſitions and exerciſes of his heart are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this, p. 20, 21. Speaking of men who have
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012811_0135_0F8ABFAE62153070"/>
no virtue, he ſays,
<q>Their hearts in many inſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, <hi>in ſome degree,</hi> with the moral ſenſe of their minds. A ſenſe of equity, moral honor, of gratitude; a ſpirit of benevolence, compaſſion, &amp;c. and ſome kind of regard to God influence them to do many worthy deeds,— when yet they will deny and counteract all theſe for ſome other luſts, and under greater temptations, and have no <hi>effectually governing regard</hi> to God, and to virtue, its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and reward, p. 48. The heart does not embrace the truths believed, <hi>with governing love</hi>
                  </q>
p. 51. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf in the ſame way on this head, in his letter to Dr. Whitaker: He ſays the ſight and taſte of the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of holineſs, and approbation of actions and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters morally good, is not <hi>holy love,</hi> as tis not the ſame with their being choſen and embraced by the will, <hi>in preference to all that ſtands in competition with them.</hi> p. 6. And that it 'is not the ſame thing with a <hi>ſupreme love</hi> and <hi>prferring choice of them,</hi> by the heart; which is eſſential to true virtue,' p. 10. He does not ſay there is <hi>no degree</hi> of real love of holineſs in this ſight and reliſh of the true beauty of it; but he ſays 'tis not <hi>holy love</hi>; i. e. <hi>ſupreme love,</hi> and <hi>preferring choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe expreſſions are ſuited to ſuch a notion of virtue, as conſiſts in a <hi>prevailing, governing degree</hi> of the ſame kind of diſpoſitions and exerciſes which all men have; but are not true virtue till they riſe to ſuch ſtrength and high degree, as to <hi>rule and govern</hi> in the heart: And, I think, they are not conſiſtent with any other notion of it.</p>
               <p>But if this is his notion, he has deſignedly covered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and carefully avoided ſpeaking out plainly, which if he had done, we ſhould better know what to ſay to him. For it might be eaſily proved, that ſuch a notion of virtue is very unreaſonable, and contrary to the bible. And it does not well conſiſt with his ſaying that this ſame taſte &amp; reliſh of the true beauty of virtue is <hi>eſſentially different</hi> from a virtuous taſte; for the things which are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind, and differ only in degree, can't properly be
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012811_0136_0F8ABFAF0B6265F0"/>
ſaid to have an <hi>eſſential difference.</hi> So that even this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition will not make him conſiſtent. I hope, if he ever writes again, he will honeſtly and with all plainneſs tell what he means. <note n="*" place="bottom">This was Dr. Mayhew's ſcheme; though he did not think it beſt to declare it expreſsly in any of his publications. And this is the ſcheme of moſt Arminians; and of many who call themſelves <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Calviniſts.</hi> But none of them, I think, have yet undertaken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to vindicate it before the public.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As a concluſion to this and the foregoing ſection, the following obſervations may be made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The holy ſcripture repreſents all men who are not true believers, and not born of the ſpirit, as in ſuch dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blindneſs that they do not ſee and know God and Jeſus Chriſt, and cannot ſee the things of God's kingdom, Joh. 3.3. do not ſee the ſpirit of God, Joh. 14.17. not can diſcern the things of the ſpirit, 1 Cor 2.14. ſo that the goſpel is HID from them, 2. Cor. 4.3, 4. That they only who have a virtuous taſte and are regenerate, do know God and Jeſus Chriſt, Joh. 17.3. 1 Joh. 4.8. and <hi>taſte</hi> his goodneſs, Plaſ. 34.8. 1 Pet. 2.3. i. e. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and reliſh his moral perfection or holineſs, which is love or goodneſs. And they only have the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 Cor. 4 6. with reſpect to which all the unregenerate are in total darkneſs, which glory can be nothing elſe but holineſs, which is the beauty and glory of the moral world. And yet the ſcripture repreſents theſe perſons, who are thus blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as actually blamable for not having that virtue and holineſs which they do not ſee, and not loving what is hid from them; and that this blindneſs and unbelief is itſelf a very great crime; though they cannot be cured of it, ſo a to ſee the marvellous light of God's beauty and glory, by any thing but the mighty power of God, quickening, and new creating them, making them new creatures, opening their eyes, or giving them eyes to ſee, or a new heart, a heart to perceive and underſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:012811_0137_0F8ABFAFD0EEB398"/>Now, ſince this is the ſcripture account, it is ſufficient to ſupport all that Mr. Edwards has ſaid on this head, and ought to ſilence all Mr. H's objections, until he can ſhew that it is not the ſame with that which Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards has given, and is conſiſtent with unregenerate men ſeeing and reliſhing theſe things in a ſenſe and manner, in which Mr. Edwards ſays they do not: For, as the caſe now ſtands, his objections ſeem to be equally againſt the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Mr. Edwards has ſaid, and Mr. H. objects againſt, is perfectly agreeable to reaſon and experience. That they who have no virtue, and whoſe hearts are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed by contrary inclinations and luſts, cannot, while they remain ſo, ſee and reliſh the beauty of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is, in a ſenſe, a ſelf-evident propoſition, as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry implies a moſt evident contradiction. <note n="*" place="bottom">This is ſo evident, that a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> could ſay.
<q>A mind deſtitute of virtue, cannot ſee the beauty of truth.</q>
Hierocles.</note> Beſides, we know by experience, that we get the idea of all thoſe things which belong to the mind and heart, by what takes place in our own minds and hearts; and cannot obtain it any other way. For inſtance, we obtain the idea of love, by the exerciſe of this in our own hearts. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind had ever taken place in our minds, we could not have any true idea of it. And though men exerciſe a ſort of love, and ſo know what it is; yet, if this is a love which is diſtinct in its nature from diſintereſted benevolence, it will not help them to the true idea of ſuch benevolence; and they never can have it, till this takes place in their hearts. The inclination and luſts of their hearts, which are inconſiſtent with the leaſt degree of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent love and goodneſs, do neceſſarily blind their eyes, and ſhut all true knowledge of this love, all true ſenſe and reliſh of its beauty, out of their minds. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they may from the various taſtes and exerciſes of their hearts, and their mental powers, be able to reaſon well upon the ſubject, and be convinced that benevolence,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012811_0138_0F8ABFB08BDC1A30"/>
and the affections included in this, is true virtue, and that nothing which falls ſhort of it is virtue, or has any moral excellence. And as their eyes are ſhut to the beauty of holineſs, and this is excluded from their hearts by nothing but their luſts, they really cloſe their own eyes, to keep the light from them; and are therefore wholly inexcuſable in their ignorance and luſts: And their conſcience may be convinced of this, and that they are juſtly condemned for their blindneſs and want of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. H. has really acknowledged all this, even all that Mr. Edwards has aſſerted; ſo that all his oppoſition to Mr. Edwards is, in effect, oppoſition to himſelf. This has been evident, I conclude, to every attentive, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reader, from what has been obſerved. He allows that the eyes of all unbelievers are faſt cloſed, and ſhut ſo as not to receive the knowledge of the truth; which cannot be opened, but by the powerful work of the ſpirit of God; and that this blindneſs, is ſo far from excuſing men for not being virtuous, and not ſeeing its beauty, that it rather aggravates their guilt. That all the children of Adam are naturally without the ſpirit of God, and that while they are in this caſe (in which they all are, till they receive the ſpirit of Chriſt, and become true believers in him)
<q>they are led and influenced <hi>in their judgment</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>In their judgment.</hi> If by <hi>judgment</hi> here, Mr H. means reaſon and conſcience judging, he carries the matter much further than Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards does, and further than the truth; for he ſays the judgment, in this ſenſe, may be right and according to the truth, even in men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the ſpirit, and under the dominion of the ſpirit of this world, and their blinding luſts. It is granted that luſt and ſin in the heart does, in many inſtance, blind and pervert the reaſon and conſcience of men; but this is not always ſo. If by judgment, he means the taſte and diſcerning of the heart, he aſſerts the ſame thing which Mr. Edwards does, and which he himſelf objects againſt.—</note> concerning theſe things</q>
(i. e. the things of the goſpel)
<q>by the ſpirit that is of this world; i. e. act under the biaſing and blinding influence of the ſpirit of error, and
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:012811_0139_0F8ABFB146E79BD0"/>
worldly luſts. Such do not receive theſe things as true and divine, neither can they know them to be ſo. They may in ſome meaſure ſee what his doctrine is; and ſee his works and witneſs by the goſpel revelation; <hi>but they don't ſee the ſpirit of God in them.</hi>
                  </q>
(Letter to Dr. W. p. 60, 61.) If they do not ſee the ſpirit of God in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and works of Chriſt, they do not ſee their holineſs; but all the beauty of this is entirely hid from them; for he who is blind to the holy ſpirit, is blind to holineſs it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This needs no proof. Now this is all that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in what Mr. Edwards has ſaid. I know Mr. H. <hi>ſays,</hi> that according to Mr. Edwards's doctrine, men have no natural capacity, by which they may ſee the beauty of virtue, &amp; become holy; and that they can be brought to this only by the immediate, phyſical, miraculous, work of the ſpirit of God, &amp;c. but this might as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be charged on Mr. H's doctrine, and as eaſily prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not only man's blindneſs to the beauty of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which Mr. Edwards ſpeaks of, is conſiſtent with their obligations to holineſs; but they may be obliged, though their reaſon and conſcience be blinded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. 'Tis not neceſſary that natural conſcience and moral taſte ſhould dictate right, and pronounce true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to be ſo, and that it is beautiful and excellent, and the contrary wrong and hateful, in order to the man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under obligations to be holy, and wholly to blame for not being ſo. A man may be ſo deceived as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his conſcience that the higheſt virtue is nothing but a piece of wickedneſs, and that he ought to hate it; and yet be under obligations to love and practice it. This all will grant, I conclude. The reaſon is, becauſe ſuch blindneſs of the judgment and conſcience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the moral taſte, is wholly owing to the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſts of the heart, ſo that if the heart were right, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and conſcience would judge according to truth. And if the heart remains blind, and ſees not the beauty
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012811_0140_0F8ABFB30051B9E0"/>
and excellence of virtue, but hates it, though the dictates of the conſcience are right, and reaſon pronounces it beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and lovely; is not this as blamable, at leaſt, as if reaſon and conſcience agreed with the heart? Shall the blinding luſts of men's hearts take off all obligations to love what they diſreliſh and hate, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tell them, that 'tis excellent and lovely; when this ſame blindneſs of heart, if it blinds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience too, and bribes that to agree with it, would be altogether blamable? How unreaſonable then is Mr. H's objection againſt Mr. Edwards's doctrine of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men's hearts with reſpect to the beauty of virtue; as if, according to this, they were under no obligation to holineſs!

               <head>SECTION IV. <hi>Mr. Hart's account of the</hi> eſſential nature of true virtue, <hi>and of a</hi> defective ſort of virtue, <hi>&amp;c. conſidered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS Mr. H. had oppoſed Mr. Edwards's notion of true virtue, as wrong, and ſubverſive of all religion, and then undertook to ſhew what is the eſſential nature of true virtue, we might reaſonably expect he would fix on ſomething which is in its nature eſſentially different from that which Mr. Edwards deſcribes, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew what it is, and wherein the difference lies. But we are wholly diſappointed! He has not deſcribed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo as to give his readers any clear idea of it, or ſhew wherein it differs from that which Mr. Edwards deſcribes. He ſays true virtue conſiſts in EQUITABLE AFFECTION towards God and our fellow-creatures. This is conſiſtent with what Mr. Edwards has ſaid: According to him, it
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012811_0141_0F8ABFB50EF8B7C8"/>
conſiſts in <hi>equitable affection</hi>; and he has particularly ſhewn what this is; and that nothing is equitable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but benevolence to being in general, and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons included in this.</p>
               <p>And when what Mr. H. ſays about his <hi>equitable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is put together, it will agree to nothing elſe, but the ſame univerſal benevolence, or love to bring in general; which he ſeems to think he is oppoſing. He allows that all equitable affection or holineſs in the creature conſiſts in <hi>love,</hi> p. 43. And ſpeaks of this as a love of kindneſs or benevolence, a 'friendly regard' to the object beloved; and ſays this is 'in effect univerſal love,' p. 47. and that this univerſal friendly love, is a conformity to God's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, p. 43. which muſt therefore conſiſt in this ſame love. And he particularly ſpeaks of this <hi>equitable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in God, as exerciſed in univerſal love or goodneſs; which is the ſame with love to being in general, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſuch; viz. a diſpoſition
<q>to give his family of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures as great a meaſure of happineſs as can be communicated by the exerciſe of a paternal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them.</q>
p. 42. Thus we ſee Mr. H. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents his equitable affection as a <hi>friendly</hi> love, which is really <hi>univerſal</hi> benevolence; which is love to being in general. And he ſay, 'This ſpirit of equitable, FRIEND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY REGARD, will diſpoſe the virtuous mind to behave to every one, in a manner ſuitable to their various characters, offices, and relations.' p. 47. This <hi>friendly regard</hi> is benevolence, and nothing elſe, and it muſt be univerſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, if it will diſpoſe to behave to <hi>every one</hi> in a ſuitable manner. And this muſt be true virtue in its eſſential nature, and comprehend the whole of holineſs, as this will lead to <hi>all</hi> right exerciſes and conduct towards <hi>every one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. H. ſeems indeed to ſuppoſe that he is here oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mr. Edwards's notion of true virtue, as eſſentially wrong, and repeatedly aſſerts it to be ſo, but, as his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions don't ſo much reſpect the eſſential nature of
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012811_0142_0F8ABFB5C8F2D138"/>
true virtue, as the manner in which it takes place and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in men, and the cauſe and medium by which it is produced; and as he ſays nothing here on this head which he had not ſaid before, and has been conſidered; and ſince he does not pretend to argue, but ſeems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reader will believe his bare aſſertions, without any manner of proof, they are not worthy of any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. However, it may be proper to take a little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two paſſages in this chapter.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. having aſſerted
<q>That God himſelf is the ſource and ſupport of virtue in us, which is the attraction and active tendency of our minds towards him, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their being brought under the attractive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his bleſſed character and gracious love to us in Jeſus Chriſt,</q>
goes on to ſay,—
<q>To talk of a moral change in the mind, forming the heart to a virtuous temper, as preceding this attraction of God upon the mind, and as neceſſary to render that effectual, is the ſame abſurdity in divinity or moral philoſophy, as it would be in natural, to aſſert that a body naturally cold, muſt firſt change its nature, &amp; become of a hot nature, like the ſun, before it can be warmed by the action of the ſun's rays upon it, however near the ſun may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards it.</q>
p. 44, 45.</p>
               <p>ANS. a body, naturally cold, muſt be of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſtruction, as to receive the rays of light and heat from the ſun, or imbibe them ſo that they ſhall be in a ſenſe incorporated with it, in order to its being warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. If a body ſhould not be of ſuch a nature and conſtruction, but formed ſo as to repel the rays of the ſun, no degree of heat from the ſun would impart the leaſt heat to that, till the nature of it is changed, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exertion of a power upon it, entirely different from the influence of the heat of the ſun. Mr. H's inſtance is therefore not to the purpoſe; for it does not appear, that 'tis the leaſt abſurdity in natural philoſophy to aſſert, that a body <hi>perfectly</hi> cold, and of ſuch a nature as to repel all
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012811_0143_0F8ABFB688755FF0"/>
heat, cannot be warmed by the action of the ſun's rays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; for, by the ſuppoſition, they cannot act upon it, while it is of ſuch a nature.—</p>
               <p>THE other paſſage I would take notice of, is in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words,
<q>virtue, as it reſpects our neighbour, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily conſiſts in loving him <hi>as ourſelves.</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that there is a love of ourſelves, which is virtuous, and approved of God: Otherwiſe our loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ourſelves, could not be a virtuous love.</q>
p. 46. What Mr. H. here obſerves is doubtleſs true, and his argument juſt and concluſive. There is a love of ourſelves which is virtuous; but this is not ſelf-love; for this is, in every degree of it, ſinful: But 'tis that love of ourſelves, which is implied in univerſal benevolence. This has been already particularly conſidered. <note n="§" place="bottom">See preceding inquiry, Sect. iv. p. 24, 25, 26.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Mr. H. by a love of ourſelves meant ſelfiſhneſs, or any thing different from univerſal benevolence, his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is not true.</p>
               <p>MR. HART has a chapter on 'that defective ſort of virtue which is found in ſome unregenerate men,' to which I ſhall now attend. He ſays,
<q>'Tis undoubtedly true in fact, that many men, who are not truly religious, practice many duties. Their hearts, in many inſtances, concur, <hi>in ſome degree,</hi> with the moral ſenſe of their minds. A ſenſe of equity, of moral honor, of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and a ſpirit of benevolence, compaſſion, &amp;c. and ſome kind of regard to God, influence them to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy deeds, worthy in ſome reſpects: So are in a great degree inconſiſtent with themſelves, in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and conduct:</q>
And he ſays of him who practiſes theſe duties,
<q>The action he does is a right action, in reſpect to what is poſitive in it, commanded by God, and the motive on which he acts is a right motive, one of the motives God wills him to be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by.</q>
p. 48, 49, 50. He ſays this is not true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012811_0144_0F8ABFB746E384F0"/>
not becauſe it is not in itſelf right and duty; but becauſe it is not attended with ſomething elſe, which ought to take place, viz. an effectually governing regard to God</p>
               <p>On this the following obſervations may be made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There ſeems to be a great abſurdity in this; viz. that a man's heart ſhould concur, in ſome degree, with his enlightened conſcience or moral ſenſe, &amp; he have a ſpirit of true benevolence, and ſome kind of regard to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of which he does his duty, what God requires, from the motives which God has commanded him to be influenced by; and yet not exerciſe the leaſt degree of true holineſs. This is indeed a great paradox, and ſeems to be as much of a contradiction as to ſay, a man may be holy, and yet have no holineſs. If a perſon may do his duty, and have his heart conformed to the law of God in the exerciſe of true gratitude, benevolence and compaſſion or mercy, and yet not exerciſe any true virtue, it is doubtleſs impoſſible to tell what virtue is. If it does not conſiſt in benevolence, in duty, and obedience to the law of God, and conformity of heart to it, we may deſpair of ever finding it in any creature.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. ſays, this is not true virtue but 'eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient' becauſe there is no governing, or religious regard to God. But this is ſo far from giving a rational account of the matter, that it ſuppoſes what is impoſſible, viz. that the former may be without the latter. There is no ſuch character in nature as Mr. H. here gives. He whoſe heart is oppoſed to a religious regard to God, is equally oppoſed to every thing which God has commanded. He who is benevolent and merciful, knows God and loves him, and cannot but have a religious regard to him, (See Jer. xxi. 15, 16. Mat. v. 7.) Mr. H. ſays ''Tis unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably true in tact, that there is ſuch a character;' but he has aſſerted this in oppoſition to ſcripture and reaſon. Yea he has herein oppoſed himſelf; for in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter he repreſents love to our fellow men and all
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012811_0145_0F8ABFB9190F3110"/>
equitable regard to them, as the fruit of love to God, and flowing from it, being 'the reſult of a truly pious and filial regard to him.' p. 46, 47. Here he aſſerts that this equitable regard to men, a regard to juſtice, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and compaſſion, takes place, when there is no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regard to God; and that when this <hi>religious regard to God</hi> is added to this benevolence, it is ſanctified by it, and forms a truly virtuous character. <note n="*" place="bottom">This paſſage is agreeable to the notion that all men have <hi>ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of that love to God and their neighbour in which true holineſs conſiſts; but being <hi>defective,</hi> i. e. not <hi>governing love,</hi> it cannot be called holineſs. The whole of this chapter is ſuited to ſuch a notion, as is moſt Mr. H. ſays; elſe where of his <hi>moral</hi> taſte; though he has ſome expreſſions which ſeem to be inconſiſtent with this. See p. 126, 127, of this appendix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Since Mr. H. has only aſſerted theſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attemping any proof of them, I have none of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to anſwer. He has, however, referred to two paſſages of ſcripture, as an illuſtration of what he aſſerts, which perhaps ought to be conſidered. He obſerves, when the Jews had ſet their ſervants free, according to God's command, but ſoon brought them into bondage again; God, reproving them for their laſt conduct, ſays, with reference to their diſmiſſing them, 'ye had done right in my ſight.' Jer. 34.15. This he mentions, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, to prove that wicked men who have no true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, may do that which is <hi>right in God's ſight.</hi> p. 51. marg.</p>
               <p>ANS. God in theſe words has reference to their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conduct, and not to their hearts, and the motives from which they acted; and ſpeaks to them, not as the ſearcher of hearts; but as looking on their outward conduct, and treating them accordingly. Mr. H. allows that all the actions which ſpring from vicious motives, and luſts of heart, are poſitively vicious. p. 52. But 'tis pretty evident the Jews did not let their ſervants go free, from any higher or leſs vicious motive, than that which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced them to bring them into bondage again. The king
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012811_0146_0F8ABFBB13FA45E8"/>
of Babylon had laid cloſe ſiege to the city, and they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſtruction that was threatened. The prophets told them to diſmiſs their ſervants, as one way to obtain deliverance. But when their danger ſeemed to be over, the Chaldeans having raiſed the ſiege, in order to repel Pharaoh's army, which was coming for the relief of the Jews, they brought their ſervants into bondage again. They did not releaſe them, from any regard to juſtice, from benevolence and compaſſion, but from the ſame ſordid, ſelfiſh motive, under the influence of which they forced them into their ſervice again, when they thought the danger of the evil was over, from fears of which they let them go. They acted from the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which induced Pharaoh and the Egyptians to let the Iſraelites go; and therefore when their fears of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were removed, they repented, as Pharaoh did. And I conclude, Mr. H. will not ſay that Pharaoh exerciſed even his <hi>defective ſort of virtue</hi> in letting the people of Iſrael go, and even thruſting them out of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. repreſents this <hi>defective virtue,</hi> which he ſays is <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>doing well,</hi> ſo far as it goes, 'the agent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faulted only for that which is wanting in his work,' by what he ſays is called hiſtorical faith, of which St. James ſays, 'Thou believeſt there is one God, thou <hi>doſt well.</hi> But leſt men ſhould reſt here, he adds, devils alſo believe and tremble.' This he brings as a proof that wicked men may <hi>do well.</hi> And ſuppoſes that to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age them to do better, the apoſtle adds, 'The devils alſo believe and tremble.' p. 52. It is evident at firſt view, that he tells them their doing well was no better than what the devils do: Yea, he repreſents the devils as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further than they did; for they not only believe, but tremble. Can any one ſeriouſly think the apoſtle meant to repreſent the devils as <hi>doing well?</hi> This is ſhocking indeed! As well may we ſuppoſe our Saviour commends the Phariſees and Scribes as doing well, when he ſays '<hi>full well</hi> ye reject the commandment of God,'
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012811_0147_0F8ABFBBC9FCCB10"/>
Mark 7.9. The ſenſe of the apoſtle's words is as plain and natural, as of theſe words of Chriſt, and they are ſpoke in the ſame way. As if he had ſaid, 'You believe there is one God. Well done! A fine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment this! This is to do as well as the devils, except that they not only believe, but tremble alſo.' It is to be obſerved, that the word uſed by Chriſt, tranſlated <hi>full well,</hi> is the ſame that the apoſtle uſes here. If Mr. H's defective ſort of virtue is 'fitly reſembled' to this faith, as he ſays it is, and is found to as great degree, at leaſt, among the devils, as 'in ſome unregenerate men,' it turns out to be a very low, 'defective ſort of virtue' indeed, by which, they who have it are not much diſtinguiſhed from the worſt of men, unleſs <hi>they</hi> are much worſe than devils. <note n="§" place="bottom">Mr. H. complains of Dr. Whitaker for ſaying 'Man is turned devil'; and ſays 'before he gets out of his hands, he makes him look worſe than a devil, Dial. p. 42. But he has now fallen into the ſame wickedneſs himſelf, while he repreſents thoſe men, who do not believe and tremble, as worſe than devils.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. H. ſays,
<q>There are certain middle principles or ſprings of action wrought into the mind of man, by our gracious Creator, which, though they are not virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and do not neceſſary imply a principle of virtue in the heart, yet are friendly to virtue, and eſpouſe its cauſe within us, ſuppoſe the mind duly inſtructed: Such are reaſon, natural conſcience, the moral ſenſe or taſte, &amp;c.</q>
p. 49, 50.</p>
               <p>Remark 1ſt. It ſeems to be a contradiction, that there ſhould be any thing in the mind of man, which is <hi>friendly to virtue,</hi> which is not virtue, nor implies any principle of virtue in the heart. Can there be any thing in the heart <hi>friendly to virtue,</hi> which has nothing of the nature of virtue? If a man is a true friend to virtue, we think we may ſafely pronounce him a virtuous man.</p>
               <p>Remark 2d. What Mr. H. inſtances in here are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the higheſt degree of wickedneſs; as they take place in a higher degree in devils, than in men. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012811_0148_0F8ABFBC8B2512B8"/>
and natural conſcience, if enlightened, do in a ſenſe 'eſpouſe the cauſe of virtue,' i. e. bear teſtimony in its favour. But this is conſiſtent with the greateſt degree of vice; and ſerves to ſet the ſinner further from all virtue, if poſſible, by rendering him more criminal and vile; for the more clear this teſtimony is, the more oppoſition is made to it by the ſinner, and the more criminal he is, in refuſing to comply with the dictates of his conſcience. This Mr. H. himſelf allows. He ſays, 'Theſe have ſome degree of influence in natural men.' I aſk, what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Do they influence them in the leaſt degree to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with that, whoſe cauſe they eſpouſe? This Mr. H. denies; for this would make them virtuous. All the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they can have then, while their hearts oppoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is to render this oppoſition more vile and criminal, as well as ſtronger, and more directly turned againſt that in which true virtue conſiſts. Mr. H. allows that if men reſiſt the call of reaſon and conſcience, and refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their dictates, they hereby become much worſe, and that herein conſiſts the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin: but this they do, ſo long as they refuſe to become truly virtuous, if conſcience eſpouſes the cauſe of virtue in them. What room then is there left for Mr. H's 'de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective ſort of virtue,' by means of the dictates of natural conſcience? It is wholly excluded; or rather is nothing but the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin.</p>
               <p>Remark 3d. If we ſhould grant all Mr. H. ſays here, that
<q>there are principles or ſprings of action, wrought into the mind of man, by our gracious Creator, which are friendly to virtue:</q>
Why may not <hi>a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of true virtue</hi> be wrought into the mind by God, as well as theſe principles, which are friendly to virtue? Theſe principles of action, which are favourable to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are not wrought in the mind by moral power, or the power of divine truth or love; but by creating power, I conclude Mr. H. will allow. Why may not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ſprings of virtuous actions themſelves be
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012811_0149_0F8ABFBD4E1A7170"/>
wrought into the mind in the ſame way, and by the ſame power? The ſame power that can form in the mind prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples friendly to virtue, can doubtleſs create virtuous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples themſelves, in the very ſame way.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. ſpeaking of his defective ſort of virtue, ſays,
<q>There is an eſſential defect in the agent, which renders him <hi>not well accepted.</hi> His action is <hi>eſſentially deficient,</hi> and <hi>can't be accepted,</hi> as an inſtance of true, divine vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</q>
And yet he ſays in the ſame page
<q>There is ſomething in them which is right, and required by God. This is <hi>approved,</hi> not abhorred and thrown back as dung in the faces of the doers of them.</q>
See p. 50, 51. This ſeems to be no leſs than a contradiction. The ſame doings are not well accepted, and can't be accepted; and yet they are <hi>approved,</hi> i. e. are accepted; for I conclude <hi>accepted,</hi> and <hi>approved,</hi> mean the ſame thing. Beſides, is it not very unreaſonable, and even daring preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſay, that the infinitely holy God <hi>approves</hi> of that moral exerciſe and conduct, which is confeſſed not to be of the nature of holineſs?</p>
               <p>On the whole, Mr. H. in this chapter cenſures them who repreſent all the doings of the unregenerate, as having nothing in their nature but ſin, and an abomination to God; and their beſt moral actions as altogether vicious, and in direct oppoſition to the ſpirit and law of God, &amp;c. But has offered no matter of conviction from ſcripture or reaſon. Any judicious perſon who reads this chapter, muſt be ſenſible how empty it is of any ſhadow of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This middle character, this ſort of exerciſes and doings, which are neither ſinful nor holy, are not known in the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and is a meer chimera, full of inconſiſtencies. This, I truſt, will appear to any one, who attends to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given, from the ſcripture, of holineſs and ſin, in the foregoing inquiry. The ſcripture repreſentation of all men by nature is, that there is none that <hi>doth good,</hi> no <hi>not one,</hi> Rom. iii. 12. That the mind, the whole heart of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:012811_0150_0F8ABFBE077B4880"/>
every one who has not the ſpirit of Chriſt, is enmity againſt God, and his law, Rom. viii. 7, 8, 9. And Chriſt ſays, 'He that is not for me, is <hi>againſt me.</hi> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or elſe make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.' Mr. H. has not taken this advice; but has made the fruit of a tree, which he acknowledges to be corrupt, not corrupt, but good, even ſo good as to be <hi>approved</hi> by God!</p>

               <hi>APPENDIX. NUMBER II.</hi> REMARKS on ſome paſſages in the piece entitled,
<q>The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church in covenant with God, further illuſtrated. Containing alſo, a brief repreſentation of ſome other goſpel doctrines, which affect the controverſy. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with remarks upon ſome things advanced by Dr. Bellamy and Mr. Hopkins, in theſe important points. By <hi>MOSES MATHER,</hi> A. M.</q>
            </head>
            <p>MR. Mather's 'repreſentation of ſome other goſpel doctrines,' is founded wholly on the account he gives of SELF-LOVE. If what he ſays of this is true, he has indeed made ſome new diſcoveries; upon which he has built a ſyſtem of doctrines. He ſays, as ſelf-love is eſſential to man, as a moral agent, Adam was poſſeſſed of it in a ſtate of perfect holineſs; and he had this ſame ſelf-love when he had turned rebel againſt God. And as God was now become his enemy, and all the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were againſt him, and ſtood engaged to deſtroy him, to love God in this ſituation, would be the ſame with loving his own miſery, and total deſtruction: Which being contrary to his ſelf-love, which God had implanted in him, it was naturally impoſſible he ſhould love God. Nor was it his duty to love him, in theſe circumſtances, as it was not only impoſſible, but contrary to the divine command; for he was commanded to love himſelf.
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012811_0152_0F8ABFC2D77C8AF0"/>
And all Adam's poſterity are in much the ſame ſtate he was in after the fall; ſo that it is neither poſſible for them, nor their duty, to love God, until they underſtand and believe the goſpel, which ſets the divine character in a new light, and oppoſite to that in which it appears in the law, and declares his love and kindneſs to them. This diſcovery and belief, will reconcile their hearts to God, ſo that they cannot but love him, and embrace the goſpel from this ſame principle of ſelf-love, from which, they, before this, neceſſarily hated God; and therefore need no new principle in their hearts, in order to turn to God, and become real chriſtians. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. M. does not expreſsly ſay it is the duty of men to <hi>hate</hi> God, before they believe the report of the goſpel; but this is neceſſarily implied in what he ſays: For the ſame ſelf love which renders it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to love God, renders it equally impoſſible not to hate him, while he is conſidered as diſpoſed to deſtroy them. And if we are commanded to exerciſe this ſelf-love, which is oppoſed to God, this is the ſame with being commanded to oppoſe and hate him! Mr. M. thinks he has proved this ſelf-love is commanded, from the words of the command, 'Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour <hi>as thyſelf.</hi>' This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument has been confuted in the preceding inquiry. See p. 25.26.</note> All this Mr. H. thinks he has demonſtrated, by the help of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> uſing the word without any fixed, determinate meaning, and in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſes.</p>
            <p>When he ſays ſelf-love is eſſential to man, as a moral agent, he means a general love of happineſs. But when he infers from this, that Adam's ſelf-love, after he had ſinned, rendered it impoſſible for him to love God, he means quite a different thing by ſelf-love, viz. ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is moſt properly called ſelf-love. Nothing is therefore neceſſary, in order to ſee the futility of all he ſays on this head, but to attend to what has been ſaid on this ſubject, in the preceding inquiry, p. 19.—26.</p>
            <p>When Adam ſaw himſelf condemned by the law of God, &amp; all the divine perfections were againſt him, had he been a benevolent friend to the greateſt good of the whole,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012811_0153_0F8ABFC3655488A8"/>
he might, with the greateſt guſt for happineſs, have placed his happineſs in the honor of God, as the greateſt good; and dreaded his diſhonor, and an injury done to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and kingdom, as the greateſt evil; and moſt heartily ſay, 'Let God be glorified; let his government be maintained, and his kingdom flouriſh, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of me, or any other creature!' And he might have been pleaſed with God's perfections and law, as excellent and worthy to be loved and honored, though they were againſt him, and implied his deſtruction; for their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence appeared in this very thing. Nothing was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this but that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> in which all his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion conſiſted. In ſhort, nothing was in the way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's loving God, in this ſtate, but his ſin, conſiſting in a diſpoſition to love himſelf only, and exalt himſelf above God, which was implied and acted out in his firſt rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And it <hi>this</hi> rendered it not his duty to love God, and made hatred of him no crime; then his firſt rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was no ſin; and there never was, nor will be, any ſuch thing as ſin: For every one that rebels againſt God, does it in the exerciſe of that <hi>ſelf-love</hi> which is contrary to loving and obeying him.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. by the help of his <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> alſo undertakes to ſhew that what I have publiſhed concerning the ſtate and character of the unregenerate cannot be true. I have repreſented an unregenerate ſinner, who is awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fearful apprehenſions of the wrath to come, and has a painful ſenſe of his continual expoſedneſs to it; and is convinced in his conſcience that ſalvation is freely offered to him; and that 'tis his duty and higheſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to embrace the offer and return home to God, that in this way and no other, he may eſcape the evil he dreads and be eternally happy; under all this light and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience, yet obſtinately refuſing to embrace the goſpel, and his heart riſing againſt God more directly and with greater ſtrength than it did before he had this conviction, in horrid exerciſes of hatred, enmity and fixed
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:012811_0154_0F8ABFC40A2BA728"/>
oppoſition to God's character and government. Mr. M. ſays this is impoſſible, as 'tis contrary to ſelf-love; that human nature is not capable of acting ſuch a part; as this would be diſintereſted malice; yea more, 'ſuch a fixed, inveterate malice, as overcomes all regard to his own happineſs in the ſinner's heart.' (p. 15)</p>
            <p>ANS. Upon the principle on which Mr. Mather op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes me here, the ſinner always heartily complies with what his judgment and conſcience are convinced is for his intereſt: For if his heart may, in any inſtance, refuſe to embrace what he is convinced in his conſcience would be for his intereſt to embrace, he may do ſo in any inſtance, even in the inſtance before us. And all Mr. M. ſays is againſt the former, as much as the latter.—But that the former is true, none will deny. Is there no inſtance, in our world, of a perſon's refuſing to comply with what he was convinced, in his conſcience was his duty, and for his own intereſt? Are there not innumerable inſtances of this every day? Yea, have we not all a witneſs in our own breaſts, that our hearts, in many inſtances, have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the dictates of our conſciences; but have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to love and embrace that which we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in our conſciences, would be for our higheſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to love and embrace? Mr. M. is not ſuch a ſtranger to mankind, and to himſelf, as to be inſenſible of this, I conclude. And if a man's heart may oppoſe his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telling him what is moſt for his intereſt in one inſtance, it may in another, and in any ſuppoſable caſe whatſoever. Does Mr. M. think that nothing is neceſſary, in order to the converſion of a ſinner, but to convince his judgment and conſcience, that 'tis for his intereſt to embrace the goſpel? And that all who have this conviction are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted and ſaved? Surely he does not. Why then has he ſuppoſed it in his oppoſition to the propoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration?</p>
            <p>And when a ſinner's heart exerciſes itſelf, as in the caſe before us, it ſuppoſes no diſintereſted malice, or any thing
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012811_0155_0F8ABFC4CCD52418"/>
contrary to the greateſt degree of ſelf-love: Yea, 'tis pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſelf-love, and becauſe his heart is under the dominion of this, that he thus oppoſes the dictates of his conſcience, and hates God, his law and government, Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel: And that becauſe all theſe are contrary to ſelf-love. The ſinner's heart muſt ceaſe from loving himſelf wholly, and love God ſupremely, and excerciſe that benevolence which loves and ſeeks the glory of God and the general good, in order to be willing to embrace the goſpel. This the ſelfiſh or unregenerate heart is fixed in oppoſition to; and the more clear conviction he has in his conſcience, that 'tis for his intereſt to love God, &amp;c. and the more his conſcience is convinced of the truths reſpecting the divine character, the nature and true import of the goſpel; the more fully will he find theſe things to be contrary to his heart, or his ſelfiſhneſs; and conſequently the more ſtrong and vigorous will be the oppoſition of his heart to them.</p>
            <p>The pride of a man's heart may oppoſe true humility, and be the only reaſon of his obſtinately refuſing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it; while under a conviction of conſcience, that to be humble is the only way to be truly happy and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The pride of a man's heart, which, at bottom, is nothing but ſelfiſhneſs, ſeeks honor and happineſs which are not the honor and happineſs that attend humility; but of a different and oppoſite kind: And his being convinced in conſcience, that in oppoſing humility he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the greateſt good, will not alter the taſte and bent of his heart, or render the honor and happineſs that attend humility any more agreeable to his pride, than they were before. The proud heart will oppoſe humility at all times, and under all imaginable convictions of conſcience. So the ſelfiſh heart will oppoſe benevolence, and every thing that implies it, whatever conviction of conſcience there may be, that ſelfiſhneſs is the ſource of continual miſery, and that the benevolent are only happy. You may convince the conſcience of the covetous miſer, that 'tis his
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012811_0156_0F8ABFC591D27060"/>
duty, and for his intereſt, to be charitable and liberal; as with ſuch a diſpoſition he would enjoy himſelf more, and have more comfort in what he poſſeſſed, and hereby lay up immenſe, eternal riches. But would this certainly make his ſelfiſh, covetous heart charitable and liberal; or do any thing towards it? It might induce him to give ſomething to the poor; but ſo far as he is influenced to this by meer ſelfiſhneſs, it would be as far from charity, and as really oppoſite to it, as were any of his former exerciſes. How then, it will be aſked, ſhall this ſelfiſh churl become liberal? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not meerly by being convinced, in his judgment, that to be liberal is the only way to become truly rich and happy; and hence from his ſelfiſhneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and attempting to be liberal: For all ſuch deſires are, by ſuppoſition, ſelfiſh deſires and attempts, and as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to liberality as were his former deſires and attempts: But by having a new heart given him, a truly benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, liberal, bountiful heart.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. ſays (p. 14. marg.)
<q>If the enmity of our hearts is really a principle of <hi>diſintereſted malice,</hi> it muſt be owned, that the more it is oppoſed by the light, and convictions of conſcience, it will work in our hearts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner here deſcribed;</q>
[i. e. the more light and conviction the conſcience has, the higher will the fixed hatred and oppoſition of the heart riſe againſt God] and he grants that, on this ſuppoſition, 'no light and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſcience can humble, ſubdue and convert, the heart:' And 'that therefore regeneration is the effect of mere and immediate divine power.'</p>
            <p>I am as confident as Mr. M. or any one elſe can be, that there is no ſuch thing in nature, as <hi>diſintereſted malice.</hi> And if it can be made to appear that any thing I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted concerning the unregenerate, implies any ſuch thing, I am ready to retract it. All ſinful exerciſes are intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſelfiſh: All ſin conſiſts in ſelf-love, and thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that are implied in it, and flow from it. There is properly no diſintereſted affection but that in which holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012811_0157_0F8ABFC64B2C2738"/>
conſiſts. This has been proved in the foregoing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>And why is not the exertion of mere and immediate power, as neceſſary to ſubdue the heart which is under the power of this ſelfiſhneſs, as if it was full of diſintereſted malice? And how will conviction of conſcience remove the former, and turn it into benevolence, any more than the latter? I believe none can give any reaſon for this. I think therefore Mr. M. has really granted the whole I have aſſerted, by his conceſſion under conſideration. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs is as oppoſite to holineſs, or diſintereſted benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in its whole nature, and all its exerciſes, as diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted malice could be, if any ſuch thing were poſſible: And the former is as ſtrong and fixed a principle as the latter could be. Let any one give a good reaſon why diſintereſted malice, were this poſſible, might not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by light, or conviction of conſcience, and that mere and immediate divine power is neceſſary to ſubdue and convert ſuch a heart, and it will be as good a reaſon why all this muſt be true of a heart wholly under the dominion of that ſelf-love which is moſt oppoſite to holineſs of any thing in nature, and indeed the only thing in the heart that can oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>This brings the matter in diſpute to a point; and may lead us to ſee what is the ground of our difference on this head. It has its foundation in different notions of the nature of true holineſs, and ſo, of God's moral character, which is the ſum, and partern of all true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If the true ſcriptural holineſs has been deſcribed in the foregoing inquiry, then all muſt grant, that what I have advanced about the ſtate and character of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and the neceſſity of 'mere and immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power,' to change the ſinner's heart, muſt be true, &amp; agreeable to ſcripture. Mr. Hart acknowledges this (p. 23. marg.) and Mr. M. implicitly acknowledges it in the paſſage now under conſideration. The truth is, if holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts, in whole, or in part, in ſelfiſhneſs, or if this
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:012811_0158_0F8ABFC708E5E4A0"/>
is in any degree friendly to true holineſs, and does not oppoſe it; then he who has all poſſible depravity, may be recovered to holineſs, without any immediate, divine power exerted to change his heart: Nothing is needful in order to this, but to have his conſcience inlightened to ſee what holineſs is, how agreeable it is to his ſelfiſhneſs, and ſuited to gratify it; and what kindneſs and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love God exerciſes towards him; which is ſuited to affect &amp; win his ſelfiſh heart, and draw forth ſtrong exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of love to them that love him; while God requires nothing of him that is not perfectly agreeable to ſelf-love; I ſay, on this ſuppoſition, nothing is needful in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to converſion, but that light and conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which ſhall bring theſe things into clear view.</p>
            <p>But then it muſt be obſerved, ſuch a converſion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally no change of heart at all, 'tis ſuppoſed that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſelfiſh heart is diſpoſed to love God and holineſs, and embrace the goſpel, whenever they are truly and properly ſet before it; and love to God and holineſs, and embracing the goſpel, are nothing but ſelfiſhneſs exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed toward theſe things: And all religion and holineſs is nothing but ſelf-love, and what ſprings from this root: And that diſintereſted affection, which has been ſpoken of, as oppoſite to ſelfiſhneſs, and as that in which all true holineſs conſiſts, is no part of holineſs; but a mere chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera, being as contrary and impoſſible to human nature, as diſintereſted malice. Here lies the great difference between us, even in our different and oppoſite notions of the nature of holineſs, and of the divine, moral character. If we were agreed in this, we ſhould be agreed in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about total depravity; the ſtate and character of the unregenerate, regeneration, &amp;c. Mr. M. makes the total depravity of fallen man, <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>radically,</hi> to conſiſt in his incapacity of loving God, becauſe this was in that ſtate, contrary to ſelf-love, together with the darkneſs that was on his mind. But this cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called depravity, as it is not in the leaſt degree ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012811_0159_0F8ABFCCB7C392E0"/>
it being naturally impoſſible, and ſo not his duty to love God in theſe circumſtances. But if it were allowed to be ſinful depravity in ſome degree, it can't be <hi>total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity,</hi> according to Mr. M. for this his ſelf-love was a good thing, even a duty which was commanded in the divine law; and it was ready to flow out in love to God, whenever he ſhould be revealed in a truly amiable light, even as the kind ſaviour of ſinners. According to this, ſelf-love is itſelf holineſs, and that in which it radically and ſummarily conſiſts.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid (ſermon on regen. p. 42. marg.) that the doctrines of the total corruption of man, and regeneration by light in the underſtanding, were inconſiſtent with each other. And no one has yet proved the contrary: But the evidence of the truth of this aſſertion rather increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in that all who undertake to vindicate this notion of regeneration do, in order to do it, really deny total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity. If ſelf-love is ſo friendly to holineſs, and ſuch an eſſential ingredient in it, that when the conſcience is properly inlightened, this ſame ſelf love, will grow up, and act out, in all the branches of holy love; then man is not totally depraved; for he has this good principle in him, which being cultivated will grow up into all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But if ſelf-love is, in every degree of it, oppoſed to holineſs, and that in which human depravity conſiſts, and fallen man is wholly under the power of this; and the more ſtrongly this is exerted, the more he oppoſes God and holineſs; then no degree of light and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience will change his heart, or produce new and oppoſite principles there: But the more light and conviction is in the conſcience, the more clearly the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object, holineſs, is ſet before the mind; the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and vigorouſly will ſelf-love hate and oppoſe it. This all will grant, on the ſuppoſition made. So that the diſpute really is, whether man is totally depraved; and what true holineſs is: Whether it is oppoſed to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs; or whether ſelfiſhneſs itſelf, is not friendly to it?
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012811_0160_0F8ABFCED1A87260"/>
The diſpute therefore is to be determined by determining what true holineſs is. If the foregoing is a true and ſcriptural account of it, the controverſy is decided, by the confeſſion of all. I hope therefore in all diſputes on this head, for the future, that which at bottom is in queſtion, will be kept in view, viz. What is holineſs? What is the divine character? What is God?—If we can be agreed in this, we ſhall agree in all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. ſays (p. 14. marg.)
<q>But Solomon did not apprehend that natural corruption would riſe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the more it is oppoſed (Prov xx. 15) <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction ſhall drive it far from him.</hi>—If then this corruption does not neceſſarily riſe the higher, the more it is oppoſed; but does ſometimes yield; why may we not ſuppoſe that the father of our ſpirits, through light, powerfully impreſſed on the conſcience by the holy ſpirit, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more complete victory over this corruption, than ever is obtained by human correction; even ſo as that it may be truly mortified?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this it may be obſerved, if theſe words prove any thing againſt the doctrines I have advanced, they prove too much; more than Mr. M. himſelf will grant; or can be true, conſiſtent with the whole current of ſcripture. If fooliſhneſs means natural corruption in general, and the rod of correction will drive it <hi>far</hi> from him; then it is overcome and mortified; and there is no need of any thing elſe, in order to effect it, or to obtain a more complete victory over this corruption, than is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the rod of correction. If the rod of correction will remove, and ſubdue this corruption in any degree, no reaſon can be given why it may not wholly remove and ſubdue it. Therefore, the conſequence from the words is this, 'If then the natural corruption of the heart does yield and will ſubmit under the diſcipline of the rod, why may we not ſuppoſe, yea, be certain, that the rod of correction, properly and powerfully applied, will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012811_0161_0F8ABFD0F0C0F500"/>
a complete victory over it?' If this reaſoning is not juſt, neither is Mr. Mather's.</p>
            <p>Theſe words may be taken in three different ſenſes; and let which will be the right, neither of them are to Mr. Mather's purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the rod of correction, may be meant the whole of parental diſcipline and education. This, when wiſely and faithfully adminiſtered and practiſed, may, by divine conſtitution and promiſe, be connected with the deliverance of the child from ſin; ſo that God's bleſſing and his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new heart to a child, is the certain attendant or fruit of ſuch education and diſcipline. In this ſenſe the words in the 6th verſe of this chap. may be underſtood, 'Train up a child in the way he ſhould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.' And agreeable to this, it is expreſsly ſaid (chap. xxiii. 13, 14.) 'Withhold not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the child. Thou ſhalt beat him with the rod, and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell.' If God has promiſed to the child which is faithfully and wiſely edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, under parental diſcipline, and brought up <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> deliverance from ſin and hell; this does not determine any thing about the manner in which God effects this, whether he gives a new heart by light, or immediate divine influence. And it is conſiſtent with the child's being more perverſe, and his corruption riſing higher and growing ſtronger under diſcipline, if God's bleſſing ſhould be witheld.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If theſe words, with the others juſt mentioned, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import, that this is a proper means, and the likelieſt way to turn a child from ſin, and promote his ſalvation, they determine nothing with regard to the matter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If by <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> is here meant, not corruption of heart in general, but thoſe particular exerciſes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings of it, in which children are ſtubborn and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, and impatient of reſtraint; by which they ſhew their folly, and render themſelves diſagreeable and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012811_0162_0F8ABFD19DA7F6F8"/>
to all who have any ſpecial connexion with them: Children may, by a wiſe parental government, be cured of this folly; it may be driven far from them, and they, as to their external appearance and conduct, be quite different from thoſe who have no education, or a bad one. The many examples of this are ſufficient to confirm this obſervation. But this diſcipline, by which children are thus formed, does not eradicate or ſubdue the corrupt principles of their hearts. The corruption of their hearts is reſtrained from acting out in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way, and is turned into ſome other channel; and may act with as much ſtrength another way, and more. It will do ſo, unleſs the heart be renewed by the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. here refers to preſident Edwards's book on freedom of will, and ſays,
<q>The whole deſign of that book is to prove, that <hi>the will is as the greateſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good is.</hi> All the arguments there offered, muſt be confuted, before this character here given of the ſinner can be eſtabliſhed.</q>
P. 13.</p>
            <p>ANS. Preſident Edwards does not attempt to prove, nor ſay, that the will always is, according to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dictates of the judgement and conſcience, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to what is beſt, and moſt for a perſon's intereſt: But he ſays directly the contrary, p. 12. And the whole that he ſays in ſhewing that the will is as the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent good, ſhews that he does not mean the appearance that is made to the judgment and conſcience only; but to 'the whole faculty of perception or apprehenſion, and not meerly what is called <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>judgment.</hi>' He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the heart may be ſuch as to reſiſt the cleareſt dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of conſcience; ſo that what this dictates to be moſt for his intereſt, ſhall not be the greateſt apparent good; but ſomething directly oppoſite. If preſident Edwards had ſaid any thing inconſiſtent with this, it would be contrary to known fact and univerſal experience.</p>
            <p>To the ſelfiſh heart, that which ſelfiſhneſs dictates is
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:012811_0163_0F8ABFD2557531D0"/>
the greateſt apparent good, and not what reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience dictate. Therefore, to ſuch an heart, <hi>that</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the greateſt apparent good, which oppoſes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, diſintereſted benevolence. If ſelfiſhneſs is agreeable to itſelf, and a ſelfiſh good is to this the greateſt apparent good; then this benevolence is diſagreeable, and it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and hates this and the higheſt good which it ſeeks, as the greateſt evil. Mr. M. ſpeaking of Adam in his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſtate ſays,
<q>He having now a ſeparate intereſt from God, there was of courſe contrariety to the divine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſo far forth as that ſtood in oppoſition to his own ſeparate intereſt.</q>
P. 15. The ſelfiſh man always has a ſeparate intereſt from God. This is the very nature of ſelf-love, it conſiſts in ſetting up a ſeparate intereſt from God; and therefore is of courſe, in its nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety &amp; enmity to the divine character; for this always did, and always will ſtand in direct oppoſition to the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate intereſt of a ſelfiſh man. And this ſeparate intereſt will be the greateſt apparent good to ſelfiſhneſs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſon and conſcience may dictate to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. thinks the doctrines about regeneration, &amp;c. which he is oppoſing, originated from what preſident Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards has advanced in his treatiſe on religious affections; where he repreſents holineſs and the exerciſes of it, as ſomething of a different nature from any thing that takes place in unholy men; and ſays that in theſe holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and affections, 'there is a new inward perception or ſenſation of the minds of holy perſons, entirely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in its nature and kind, from any thing that ever their minds were the ſubjects of before they were ſanctified;' which he calls 'a new ſpiritual ſenſe.' P. 35, &amp;c. This, Mr. M. thinks, is a great error, and of a very bad tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it being the ſource of a ſet of doctrines, which he calls '<hi>new divinity,</hi>' which ſays he, 'are ſurpriſingly ſpread in the land, in the preſent day.' P. 36, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>No wonder Mr. M. objects againſt this, ſeeing if it is true, it overthrows all his divinity at once. According to
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012811_0164_0F8ABFD32E7E5030"/>
him, the ſame ſelf-love which in unholy men is inconſiſtent with their loving God, and leads them to hate and oppoſe him, is a principle of holineſs in the ſaints; and is really exerciſed in true love to God, when their eyes are opened to ſee that his character is favourable to their own dear ſelves; and that they had been under a ſad miſtake all their days before: So that holineſs does not differ, in nature and kind, from unholineſs or ſin. But it holineſs conſiſts in benevolence, and the affection implied in it, and this is in its nature different from ſelfiſhneſs, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it, what Mr. Edwards ſays of holy affections muſt be true. So that we ſtill ſee the diſpute is about the nature of holineſs, or what is God's moral character. If we were agreed about this, it would end the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. makes three objections againſt Mr. Edwards's doctrine on this head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> He ſays, 'If regeneration is ſuch a change as is here deſcribed, it is evidently not a moral, but a <hi>phyſical change.</hi>' His argument is this: Giving this new, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe or taſte, is the ſame with giving a new bodily ſenſe, or opening the eyes of the blind; but this would be a phyſical change; therefore the giving this taſte is a phyſical change.</p>
            <p>ANS. 1. The ſcriptures, ſpeaking of this change, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it by giving eyes to ſee, a being turned from darkneſs to marvellous light, giving a new heart, the new creature, or new creation, a being raiſed from death to life, &amp;c. Theſe expreſſions as ſtrongly import a phyſical change as does Mr. Edwards's deſcription of it, and are therefore as liable to Mr. M's objection. Mr. M. tho't of this, and ſaid,
<q>I am ſenſible that very <hi>ſtrong</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are uſed in the ſcripture about this change; it is ſtyled a <hi>new creation,</hi> &amp;c. but if regeneration is no other than a moral change, then thoſe ſtrong ſcripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions will not warrant us to deſcribe it as a phyſical change.</q>
P. 40. Theſe ſcripture expreſſions are full
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012811_0165_0F8ABFD3CD28C640"/>
as ſtrong as Mr. Edwards's: What warrant then had Mr. M to ſay <hi>his</hi> import a phyſical change, when he owns he has none to put ſuch a conſtruction on the ſcripture? He has not offered a word to ſhew why Mr. Edwards's deſcription of this change does make it a phyſical change, which will not equally prove that the deſcription of it in ſcripture makes it ſo.</p>
            <p>ANS. 2. What does Mr. M. mean by a <hi>phyſical change?</hi> I think he has not ſufficiently explained himſelf, Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards expreſsly ſays he does not mean, by his new, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe or taſte, any thing which implies any new natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties of the ſoul, of underſtanding and will; but that it conſiſts in a new diſpoſition of the ſame will, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of heart. And if this is not a moral change, and nothing elſe, let Mr. M. ſhew why it is not, and tell what a moral change is, and what he means by it. A moral change is a change of the heart or will, in which it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hate what it before loved, and to love and chuſe thoſe objects to which it before had an averſion, with a new kind of ſenſation or love, which it never had before. And will not Mr. Mather allow that men paſs a change like this in regeneration and converſion? A phyſical change is a change of the natural faculties of the ſoul, or giving new natural faculties: But this is no more implied in the change Mr. E. deſcribes, than in that which Mr. M. ſuppoſes takes place in regeneration. And Mr. E. expreſsly declares he does not mean any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. ſays,
<q>If God ſhould give ſight to one that was born blind, we ſhould readily agree that the change wrought in him was phyſical, and not a moral change: And it is equally evident, that it is a real phyſical change which is here deſcribed by Mr. Edwards. And to deſcribe regeneration as a proper phyſical change, and then ſay, <hi>we don't mean ſo,</hi> is only to bewilder our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our readers about that important change.</q>
P. 39. It appears that Mr. M. has bewildered himſelf
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012811_0166_0F8ABFD497861458"/>
by not ſufficiently attending to the matter, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing between a change of the heart, in which a new inclination takes place there, which was not there before, and that change in which a new natural faculty is given, in which the heart is not in the leaſt concerned. This appears by the inſtance he brings. He has bewildered himſelf in not diſtinguiſhing between a ſpiritual ſenſe, which conſiſts in the diſpoſition or affection of the heart, and our bodily ſenſes. If a man who has always been wholly contracted and ſelfiſh in all his views, deſigns and purſuits, becomes benevolent and generous, in a hearty love of God and his neighbour, placing all his happineſs in the glory of God, and the greateſt good of the creation, he is turned from darkneſs to marvellous light, and has a ſet of ſenſations that are quite new, and oppoſite to any thing he had before. But is this therefore a phyſical change? It is altogether of a moral kind, if there is any ſuch thing as moral change. Now this is the change Mr. Edwards deſcribes.</p>
            <p>ANS. 3. Mr. M's regeneration has much more of the appearance of a phyſical change, then that which Mr. Edwards deſcribes, and will be found to be really ſuch, I believe, if examined. He ſuppoſes the change, as wrought by God, to be wholly in the underſtanding, conſidered as diſtinct from the will, and to conſiſt in giving a new ſet of ideas, in which the will or heart is not concerned, and which could not take place, however well diſpoſed the heart is, as they are entirely independent of any diſpoſition of heart. Now this is no more a moral change than any other change whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Mr. M. ſays, 'If regeneration is ſuch a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal change, the ſinner is ſo far from being to blame for his continuing in an unregenerate ſtate, that he is wholly excuſed from all blame. P. 39.</p>
            <p>ANS. 1. This is granted, <hi>if</hi> regeneration is a phyſical change, i. e. is a change not of the diſpoſition of heart, but ſomething elſe independent of this. But Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:012811_0167_0F8ABFD5543ADD10"/>
deſcribes no ſuch change, but only a change of heart, which conſiſts wholly in new ſenſations and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which it turns from ſin to God.</p>
            <p>ANS. 2. This objection is made with an ill grace by Mr. M. For though it is groundleſs, as made againſt Mr. Edwards, it lies with full force againſt himſelf, and all who hold that men are regenerated by light, and not by giving a new taſte and diſpoſition of heart.—For, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the difficulty of the ſinner's forſaking ſin, and turning to God, does not properly lie in the heart or will; but in the underſtanding, which being blinded, does not ſee divine objects in a true light. This is the only cauſe of their continuing unregenerate; and not any thing wrong or blamable in the will. The fault is wholly in the underſtanding; and this is a blameleſs fault or defect, for the will or heart has no hand in it; and can no more help or remove it, however well inclined, than a blind man can reſtore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſight. All that hold to regeneration by light, without any immediate divine influence on the will, may be challenged to ſhew how men are wholly to blame for continuing in a ſtate of unregeneracy, or that this is any crime at all. They never can do it: Nor can they tell how this is conſiſtent with total depravity; for this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways implicitly, if not expreſsly, denied, in all they ſay in vindication of their ſcheme.</p>
            <p>But Mr. M. has gone beyond all others on this head, and expreſsly declared that Adam was, in his fallen ſtate, under a natural impoſſibility of loving God, and that his total depravity, which is the ſame with a ſtate of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, primarily and radically conſiſted in this, together with the darkneſs that was upon his mind: And that this is the caſe with his poſterity. How then can they be to blame for continuing in this ſtate, which is wholly owing to their external circumſtances, and a natural impoſſibility they are under of being otherwiſe? And yet this ſame Mr. M. thinks it is a ſufficient objection
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:012811_0168_0F8ABFD61E85ACC8"/>
againſt Mr. Edwards's ſcheme, if it is inconſiſtent with ſinners being to blame for continuing in a ſtate of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Mr. M. ſays, 'If regeneration is ſuch a <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical change,</hi> it will follow that every regenerate perſon muſt have the moſt certain knowledge of it.' P. 39.</p>
            <p>ANS. It is not a phyſical change. But if it were, why muſt the ſubjects of it be more certain of the change, than if it were a moral change? The exerciſes and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart are as perceptible, as any thing that can take place in the mind. And when, in this reſpect, all old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new, and a perſon is called out of darkneſs into marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light; this change is in its own nature as perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the ſubject may be as ſure of it, if called moral, as if it were called phyſical; and it's being really a moral or phyſical change, alters nor the caſe with reſpect to the evidence or certain knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon that can be given why every perſon that is poſſeſſed of real holineſs (let him come by it how he will, and whatever may be the change that brought him to it) has not the certain knowledge of it, is, that he has ſo ſmall a degree of it, and is no more changed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to God; and ſo much darkneſs and ſin ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his heart.—But it is needleſs to ſpend time to anſwer ſuch an objection: It is not eaſy to ſay by what means it was ſuggeſted to Mr. Mather, and why he thought it worthy to be inſerted.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>IN my reply to Mr. Mills, I had occaſion to conſider the duties of the unregenerate, which he ſpoke ſo much of, as required of them, and performed by them, while unholy and under the dominion of ſin. And I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove that ſuch <hi>do not do any duty,</hi> or comply with any of the commands which God hath given to men. Mr. Hemmenway had, not long before, publiſhed ſeven ſermons, which were deſigned to prove and inculcate the contrary doctrine; and were wholly confuted, if I had proved the point I had advanced. This was probably the occaſion of his more particularly attending to what I had ſaid in this part of my reply, and undertaking to write againſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="unknown:012811_0170_0F8ABFD78EAD0CB0"/>As I am far from being convinced that what he pleads for is agreeable to divine revelation, and look upon it of a very hurtful tendency; I have undertaken an anſwer. It is thrown into the form of an appendix to the foregoing inquiry, becauſe what is there ſaid, is, in my opinion, a full anſwer to the leading ſentiments and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle in his piece; ſo that, by refering to that, the anſwer may be much ſhortened.</p>
               <p>After having obſerved that I had not given a right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the queſtion in diſpute, he proceeds to ſtate it in the following words:<note n="*" place="bottom">Though Mr. H—y did not chooſe to diſpute the queſtion as I ſtated it, I yet believe it was ſtated agreeable to the ſenſe of moſt of thoſe who have aſſerted that duties are preſcribed in the word of God, to be done by thoſe who are in a ſtate of unregeneracy. And it will, I believe, appear to be his own ſenſe of the matter before we have done. But I think it not worth while to enter into a diſpute about this, ſince he owns 'the whole drift of my reaſoning is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and confute' the affirmative of the queſtion, as he has ſtated it, p. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether any actions which men do, or can perform, while unregenerate, are required of them in and by a divine command?</hi> He aſſerts and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove the affirmative of this queſtion; and has wrote a book upon it of two hundred and twenty-ſeven pages. If I was to ſtate the queſtion in my own words, I ſhould ſay, it was, <hi>Whether the unregenerate do any duty which God has commanded?</hi> But as Mr. H—y appears to mean nothing different from this, by the words he has uſed, and to underſtand the real matter in diſpute between us; I ſhall make no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt his ſtate of the queſtion; but proceed to conſider his vindication. <note n="‡" place="bottom">I have an objection againſt the title he has given his book, viz. <hi>A vindication of the power, obligation and encouragement of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to attend the means of grace, againſt</hi> the exceptions <hi>of the Rev. Mr. Hopkins.</hi> This is not a juſt title, as it does not tend to give the reader, who caſts his eye upon it, a right idea of the matter in diſpute; but will unavoidably deceive him, if he knows no more about it than what is ſaid here, for it is really contrary to the truth. I have not made any <hi>exceptions</hi> againſt the power, obligations and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the unregenerate to attend the means of grace, that I know of, but held to all this, as fully as he does. And I think more fully: For he does not pretend they have <hi>power</hi> to do this in the manner he contends for, unleſs they have the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God: Whereas I ſuppoſe the <hi>ſecure ſinner</hi> has this power. And he acknowledges I grant, they have <hi>encouragement</hi> to attend on means, and that he has no diſpute with me about this, p. 3.

               <head>
                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> The point in controverſy more particularly ſtated: The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod Mr. H—y takes to ſupport his cauſe: Its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fallacy ſhewn.</head>
               <p>MR. H—y agrees with me, that the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands require holineſs, and nothing but holineſs; or 'nothing but what is ſome way included in holineſs.' P. 3. And we are agreed that the unregenerate are wholly deſtitute of holineſs, and that all their exerciſes and actions are unholy. I ſuppoſed the plain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable conſequence from theſe premiſes was, that they do not obey the divine commands, or do their duty in any degree. Mr. H—y denies this to be a juſt conſequence; and ſays, 'though no actions of the unregenerate are ſo fully conformable to the divine command, as that they can be denominated holy in the leaſt degree;—yet ſome actions are conformable to the divine command, in ſome reſpects, and therefore comprehended in the requirement of it.' P. 4. To vindicate this, and anſwer what has been ſaid in oppoſition to it, is the profeſſed deſign of his book.</p>
               <p>In order to this, he particularly conſiders the nature of true holineſs, and what is included in this. He ſays, holineſs is a very complex thing, containing many parts; all which are neceſſary to make up that compound holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Therefore, the commands which require holineſs,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012811_0172_0F8ABFD90E0AD940"/>
require every part which is involved in the whole. That the unregenerate may do ſome of the things contained in this compound, and ſo far obey the command requiring holineſs; though it being but a part, ſuch doings, being ſo defective, have no degree of true holineſs; yet in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they do their duty, and ſo far obey the divine command.</p>
               <p>To prove that there are ſome parts of duty and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the unregenerate may perform, and yet be unholy, he divides holineſs into principle, end, manner and matter. <note n="§" place="bottom">Mr. H—y makes many more diſtinctions, diviſions and ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in what he ſays about the nature of holineſs, and ſays a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of things, which appear to me very exceptionable: But as they do not effect the matter in diſpute, I ſhall make no remarks upon them. Let him who underſtands and approves, avail himſelf of the edification. Wherein we differ in our accounts of holineſs will in ſome meaſure appear from the foregoing inquiry.</note> All thoſe, he ſays, are required, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to render an action truly holy. And though the unregenerate do nothing from a holy principle, in a holy manner, and to a holy end; yet they may do THE MATTER OF DUTY; and in complying with this part of holineſs, they ſo far obey the command requiring holineſs, and do their duty. As the whole diſpute now turns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the matter of duty,</hi> 'tis neceſſary we ſhould well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is meant by this, in order to judge on which ſide the truth lies.</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y has uſed this phraſe often enough, &amp; ſaid a great deal about <hi>the matter of duty</hi>; but after all (under favour) I muſt think he has not given a clear, conſiſtent account of it. He ſays it does not mean external actions, aſide from the will producing them; but <hi>the effective acts of the will,</hi> chooſing and producing external effects; that by the ſubſtance and matter of an action is meant THE ACTION <hi>as abſtracted from all its circumſtances,</hi> and not any conſequent effects diſtinct from it.' P. 40. Matter of external duty, according to him, 'is the act of the will, <hi>ad extra,</hi> productive of an external work, required in the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:012811_0173_0F8ABFD9CA0619E0"/>
divine law:' And this action is to be conſidered <hi>as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all its circumſtances,</hi> viz. principle, motive, deſign and end.</p>
               <p>Upon this I would obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is in nature no ſuch effective act of the will, nor can any ſuch thing be conceived of, as 'tis ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory. An act of choice, without any motive or deſign, is juſt as impoſſible, as an act of choice without an act of choice. Therefore we may be ſure no ſuch action is commanded, or done by the unregenerate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there could be any ſuch actions, there would be no more duty or any thing of a moral nature in them, than there is in external conduct, conſidered as abſtracted from all acts of choice, or <hi>in themſelves conſidered.</hi> An act of will, abſtracted from all motive and deſign, if any ſuch thing could be, would have no more morality in it, than the wind or fire, producing effects, and would be no more praiſe-worthy or blamable. Mr. M. is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that no one 'ever dreamed that the mere motion of matter, ſeparate from the agency of the mind, has any morality in it.' p. 40. We might with as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance aſſert that no man ever dreamed that the <hi>mere motion of the mind,</hi> ſeparate from all motive, deſign and end, has the leaſt morality in it, had he not furniſhed us with an inſtance. He is however, perhaps, the firſt, and, I hope, will be the laſt.</p>
               <p>But Mr. H—y comes out of the clouds before he has done, and appears ſenſible that matter of duty done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any motive and deſign, good or bad, is neither duty nor ſin; and grants that any action done with a bad end is 'materially evil,' that is, not the matter of duty, but the matter of ſin. Therefore it was not the matter of duty; but 'vile treachery in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das to kiſs his Lord, in order to betray him.' p. 91. If the matter of duty was the effective act of the will, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all circumſtances; then Judas did the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012811_0174_0F8ABFDAB0A1D058"/>
of duty, as much as any one can. But if his end and deſign cannot be abſtracted, but muſt come into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to determine, whether he did the matter of duty or not; and his evil deſign made it the matter of ſin, then a man never does the matter of duty with an evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or from a wrong motive. So that the whole comes to this at laſt. There are certain effective acts of the will producing effects, <hi>ad extra,</hi> which are either good or evil, matter of duty, or matter of ſin, according as the end of the agent is either good or bad. This is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to common ſenſe. When the beloved diſciple John kiſſed his dear Lord, as a ſincere expreſſion of love to him, it was a good action, the matter of duty. When Judas kiſſed him with a traiterous deſign, it was a vile action, and the matter of ſin.</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y being ſenſible of this, notwithſtanding all his diſtinctions about matter of duty, undertakes to ſhew that the unregenerate may act from a good end; and reſts his whole cauſe on this. He ſays, though they do not act from the higheſt and beſt ends, which men muſt act from, in order to denominate their actions holy; yet they may act from ſelf-love, which is not forbidden, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, uſeful and good principle. Therefore when they do things externally right, from this principle, and ſeeking their own intereſt as their end, they ſo far obey the divine command, and do their duty.</p>
               <p>He does not expreſsly ſay, that I have obſerved, that ſelf-love is commanded, and ſo a duty; but if it is not commanded, and ſo a duty to act from this end, how can acting from ſelf-love make an action a duty, or the matter of duty,—or what obedience is there in this? I do not find that he has told us.</p>
               <p>He has <hi>ſaid</hi> ſelf-love is a natural, innocent &amp; good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. But I do not find that he has offered any evidence of this; or that there is any thing to ſupport it but his bare aſſertion. This ſurely ought not to be taken for granted; ſince he builds all his oppoſition to me on this
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:012811_0175_0F8ABFDB4AC1FB88"/>
foundation. If ſelf-love is not a good or innocent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but forbidden and ſinful in every degree of it, all his building falls to the ground, and his <hi>matter of duty</hi> done by the unregenerate, turns out to be the matter of ſin. This I have endeavoured to make evident in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inquiry; and I think I have a right to conſider it as a full anſwer to the whole he has ſaid in proof of the doctrines he has advanced, till it be ſhewn that I have not given a right account of holineſs and ſelf-love. I therefore refer him and the reader to that, hoping it may be the means of ſuch light to him and all who attend to this controverſy, as ſhall put an end to the diſpute. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. H—y's dividing and ſplitting up holineſs into ſo many parts, in order to find ſomething belonging to it to be duty for the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to do, has brought to mind the following ſimilitude, which may ſerve to illuſtrate it. A certain debtor owed his creditor a thouſand dollars; but inſtead of paying him the real dollars, which he was able to do at any hour, had he been inclined, he brought to him an equal number of counterfeit dollars, and pleaded he had paid the debt, and anſwered his obligation, in part at leaſt; as there are ſeveral things in counterfeit dollars, which belong to true dollars, ſuch as external appearance, ſhape, &amp;c. though they want the moſt eſſential thing, and are not true ſilver. And though he had no regard to his creditor and his intereſt, yet he acted from the <hi>innocent</hi> principle of ſelf-love, as he did it in hopes that hereby he ſhould eſcape being caſt into priſon.</p>
                     <p>Mr. H—y undertakes to confute a poſition which he ſays I 'often lay down, and build much upon it, without once offering any thing in the ſhape of an argument to prove it: ver. 12. <hi>That the unregenerate act wholly from ſelf-love.</hi>' p. 60, &amp;c. It may be proper to take ſome notice of this. I grant the unregenerate have appetites and taſtes which are not ſelf-love, but quite diſtinct from it; ſuch as animal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, hunger, thirſt, &amp;c. And ſuch are a taſte for natural beauty, and what is called natural affection, &amp;c. But theſe are not of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kind; and therefore man's moral agency does not conſiſt in theſe; and if he had no other affections and principles of action, he would be no more a moral agent than the beaſts. Therefore when we ſpeak of man's <hi>moral</hi> actions, it is not proper to ſay he acts merely from theſe appetites and inſtincts; but muſt find ſome other principles of action. Mr. H—y ſays, p. 23. 'By moral actions I mean ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden by the divine law.' But theſe inſtincts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites are neither commanded nor forbidden in the divine law. Therefore there is no moral agency in them, in themſelves conſidered. Though theſe may have influence in moral actions many ways; yet the morality of them does not conſiſt in theſe, but in univerſal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, or ſelf love, one of which is implied in every moral action, and determines it. And in this the moral good or evil of every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wholly conſiſts. For inſtance, if a man determines to gratify any particular bodily appetite, or not to do it, as a moral agent, he does this in the exerciſe of ſelf-love, or univerſal benevolence; and therefore all his moral actions are determined by benevolence or ſelf-love; a regard to others which includes a regard to himſelf, or that regard to himſelf only, which is ſelfiſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>Mr. H—y gives a different account indeed, p. 61—64. He thinks becauſe 'men often, in their actions, follow the impulſe of particular inſtincts or appetites, in oppoſition to their own intereſt on the whole; yea, in oppoſition to what reaſon declares to be beſt or moſt for their happineſs, taking in the whole of their duration,' it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that they not only do not act from ſelf-love in ſuch inſtances, but directly contrary to its dictates. The fallacy of his argument is eaſily detected. Self-love never prompts men to that which is on the whole moſt for their happineſs, but to the contrary; and therefore to chooſe and act contrary to the judgment, and determines men to do that which their reaſon dictates not to be for their greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the whole of their duration conſidered. Reaſon may dictate that the only way for a perſon to be truly happy is to be benevolent, and devoted to the greateſt good of the whole.' If any one ſhould hence infer that ſelf-love will influence ſuch a perſon to ſeek the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good in a diſintereſted way; and that not to do this would be to act contrary to ſelf-love, he would argue as well as Mr. H—y does. But I need ſay nothing to ſhew the weakneſs and ſelf contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſuch an argument. He is lead by his way of arguing to the following concluſion, p. 64.
<q>The diſorders and miſeries which abound in the world, through the wickedneſs of men, are perhaps chiefly owing to the inordinate ſtrength of particular appetites and inclinations, ungoverned by a regard to their own general good.</q>
According to this, ſelf-love is ſo far from being ſin, or tending to it, that the wickedneſs of men is chiefly owing to the want of ſelf-love, or the weakneſs of it. And if this took place to a ſufficient degree, ſo as to govern men, there would be very little wickedneſs among men, if any; even though they had no love to God or their neighbour! How different this account of ſelf-love is from that given in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding inquiry, ſect. iv. p. 19. &amp;c. every intelligent reader will ſee; and will judge for himſelf which if moſt agreeable to ſcripture, reaſon and experience.</p>
                     <p>Mr. H—y has attempted, by ſeveral arguments, to prove that the unregenerate have love to <hi>perſons,</hi> diſtinct from ſelf-love, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence them to wiſh them well, do them good, &amp;c. He ſays, if the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate act merely from ſelf-love, then we are under no obligations of gratitude to them for any acts of kindneſs they may do us. 'But this is a conſequence not to be endured, which at one ſtroke cancels all obligations of gratitude to parents, friends and benefactors, for all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and kindneſſes, if they are unregenerate.' P. 66, 67.</p>
                     <p>ANS. 1. We are under obligations of gratitude to others for the kindneſs they ſhew us, ſo far as there is an <hi>appearance</hi> of kindneſs, which ought to affect us as ſuch. Where there is an appearance of kindneſs, we ought to be affected with it as ſuch, unleſs there be as great and ſenſible appearance of ſomething to the contrary, or of no kindneſs intended, ſufficient to counterbalance it. And in ſuch a caſe there is, on the whole, no appearance of kindneſs. When an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man ſhews us kindneſs, there is commonly a more ſenſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of kindneſs than of any thing to the contrary. The act of kindneſs is generally, if not always, more apparent and certain than his unregeneracy. And if we could be as certain he is unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; yet that this is the character of all the unregenerate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is really his character, and he has no real diſintereſted good will to us; conſequently 'tis not really an act of kindneſs, however kind he may appear to be; we get the evidence of all this by a courſe of reaſoning, and a number of deductions, which cannot affect our minds ſo much, as the appearance of good will in the kindneſs ſhewn; therefore the latter ought to preponderate in our minds, and affect us moſt, produce &amp; feelings &amp; exerciſes anſwerable. Therefore there is in ſuch caſes an obligation to gratitude. If Mr. H—y, or any other perſon, is not ſatisfied with this ſolution, let him account for our Saviour's weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over Jeruſalem, in any other way; or the child's being grieved at the pain and trouble of his parent, while he verily believes it will all work for his good; and that he will be unſpeakably more happy, on the whole, than he could be without it.</p>
                     <p>ANS. 2d. Let it be remembered, the unregenerate have no true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to benefactors. They are not pleaſed with diſintereſted good will, for its own ſake. All their gratitude conſiſts in ſelf-love, and a conſequent love of thoſe who appear to love them. Whatever obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations they are under to gratitude for diſintereſted kindneſs, they never fulfil them, nor are influenced by them, more than if they did not exiſt.</p>
                     <p>The regenerate or benevolent are thankful to God for all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they receive by the hands of men: And if they have the moſt clear and ſenſible evidence that theſe act wholly from ſelf-love, they will love them, and do them all the good they can. In this view, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence Mr. H—y dreads, does not appear ſo intolerable.</p>
                     <p>Mr. H—y further ſays, 'That love the unregenerate have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to others, cannot poſſibly be educed from ſelf-love. It is evident that the unregenerate have ſometimes ſuch a love to others, as cauſes them to have a real pleaſure in and concern for their welfare, ſeparate from all hopes, or proſpects of being benefited by them,' which could not be if they loved others only for their own ſakes, or wholly from ſelf-love. He inſtances in one dying, and yet manifeſting concern for the welfare of his friends after he is dead, which can be of no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to him. P. 67, 68.</p>
                     <p>ANS. There is not the leaſt difficulty in accounting for this from ſelf-love. Self-love will lead men to love others and wiſh them well, for the good <hi>they have done</hi> to them, as well as for the good they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they will do to them. Therefore this will influence a man to wiſh well to another who has been, and is now his friend, though, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is now going out of the world, he does not expect to receive any future benefit from him. Self-love does in a ſenſe unite us to them who love us, and do us good; and leads us, by a neceſſary aſſociation of ideas, to look on them as belonging to us, and as part of ourſelves. Hence there is a deſire in ſelfiſh men, which ariſes from ſelf-love, to exiſt after they are dead, in their ſurviving friend or relations, which they look upon in ſome ſenſe as themſelves. And hence they are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wiſh &amp; provide for their exiſtence &amp; comfort after they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall be dead, for the ſame reaſon they would do this for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they were to live, viz. from love to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Mr. H—y ſays, 'More arguments might be offered to the ſame purpoſe.' P. 70. If they are no more to the purpoſe than thoſe he has mentioned, 'tis to be hoped he will never be at the pains. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is to be obſerved, if he had proved that the unregenerate do not act wholly from ſelf-love, it would anſwer no end in his diſpute with me; for he does not make uſe of this at all to prove his point, but, as has been obſerved, does this wholly by ſelf-love. Indeed he does not pretend that the love to others in the unregenerate, which he contends does not ſpring from ſelf-love, is more virtuous, or in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect better than ſelf-love; and ſays 'it will not follow from any thing that has been pleaded for, that mankind have naturally a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of true holineſs.' He will however, be put to difficulty to <hi>prove</hi> this, I believe. If diſintereſted benevolence to our fellow-men is not of the nature of holineſs, and in its nature univerſal benevolence; and does not imply a friendly regard to God, and ſupreme love to him, it will be impoſſible to tell, I believe, what holineſs is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Edwards, to whom Mr. H—y had reference here, did, with good reaſon, ſuppoſe if it could be made evident that men naturally have diſintereſted benevolence to others, it muſt be granted they are naturally virtuous and holy. See his nature of true virtue, chap. iv. Mr. H—y adds, 'nor does it enervate the proofs of man's natural depravity from ſcripture and experience.' This, with the whole of his ſcheme, is doubtleſs inconſiſtent with man's <hi>total depravity,</hi> which the ſcripture aſſerts; and in this view, is not only falſe; but of a moſt deſtructive tendency. The ſcripture repreſents the natural depravity of men, as rendering them <hi>hateful and hating one another,</hi> Tit. iii. 3. and ſays love and good will to others is of God; and none have this but they who are born of God. 1 Joh. iv. 7. Moreover, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays of men, in their natural ſtate, 'they are <hi>altogether</hi> become unprofitable, there is none that doth good; no not one.' Rom. iii. 12. Their 'mind is enmity againſt God; is not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.' chap. viii. 7. 'That <hi>every</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the thoughts of their heart is <hi>only evil continually.</hi>' Gen. vi. 5.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Remarks on Mr. Hemmenway's particular arguments to prove his point.</head>
               <p>OUR author attempts a particular proof of his poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by <hi>nine</hi> arguments, which are ſo enlarged as to take up above an hundred pages. I ſhall not take notice of many particulars in theſe pages, which I think might
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012811_0177_0F8ABFDF6A81AB08"/>
be eaſily ſhewn to be very exceptionable: Nor is there need of a particular anſwer to ſuch of his arguments as are built wholly on the foundation he has laid, which has
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:012811_0178_0F8ABFE065ED1370"/>
been particularly conſidered in the preceding ſection, and ſhewn not to have any ſufficient ſupport.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="unknown:012811_0179_0F8ABFE285F11E40"/>His firſt argument is expreſsly built wholly on this, p. 104—119. And is ſufficiently confuted by obſerving the unregenerate do not the <hi>matter of duty,</hi> if ſelf-love is not a good thing, but ſin; and that ſo far as men act from this, they act not for a good end, but a bad one, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to which he has not proved, but rather <hi>begged.</hi>— There is one paſſage, however, in theſe pages which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires particular attention. P. 116, he ſays,
<q>when he (meaning myſelf) ſays, that the unregenerate in attending the externals of religion, do nothing that is their duty, he conſiders theſe things as enjoined on men <hi>only on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that they are regenerate,</hi> and have a holy love to God: For he ſays, <hi>they are required only as expreſſions of love to God.</hi>
                  </q>
From this he draws <hi>four</hi> frightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and ſays,
<q>I could eaſily go on further, but I forbear. Methinks theſe conſequences are ſo intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:012811_0180_0F8ABFE2C847C428"/>
that no principle ought to be admitted, from which they are fairly deduced. If they can fairly be avoided on Mr. H's plan, let it be ſhewn.</q>
p. 118.</p>
               <p>ANS. This is all a miſrepreſentation. I do not ſay that the attending on the externals of religion, or any thing elſe, is enjoined on men, <hi>only on ſuppoſition they have a holy love to God.</hi> I ſay God requires all men to love him with all their hearts; which they do not, unleſs they expreſs it in all proper ways, in a proper attendance on the externals of religion. This command is abſolute, without any ſuppoſition that they are regenerate, &amp;c. I ſay they who have no love to God really do no duty when they attend on the externals of religion. And if they cannot do this without a pretence and profeſſion of doing duty, and of love to God; then his conſequences will follow. But till he ſhall <hi>prove</hi> this, they can be as fairly avoided, and as ſafely denied, on my plan, as on his own.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond</hi> argument is taken from a paſſage in Mark, parallel to that in Matt. where our Saviour gives a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the divine law, from which I thought I had proved, that they who do not love God or their neighbours, do no duty. As what he ſays here, p. 119—132, is chiefly to obviate and confute the ſenſe in which I underſtood theſe words of Chriſt, I ſhall leave the particular conſideration of this argument to another place. <note n="*" place="bottom">I would however juſt obſerve, that under this argument, he aſſerts, &amp; thinks he proves,
<q>that an attendance or religious ordinances is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined on men <hi>by other commands</hi> than thoſe which enjoin holy love.</q>
P. 121, 122, 123. This is a different and contrary ſtrain from that in which he ſets out: For, in the beginning of his book, he is ready to allow there is no command that does not require holineſs; and ſays I have ſtated the queſtion wrong in ſaying it is, 'Whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate, <hi>which do not require any thing truly holy, but only</hi> require ſuch exerciſes as have not the nature of true holineſs.' ſee p. 3, 4, 6. But he ſeems to have forgotten all this now, and aſſerts the affirmative of this queſtion, and what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to what he had granted. For if there are '<hi>other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> than thoſe which enjoin holy love;' then there are commands which do not enjoin holineſs, or any thing truly holy: Since he grants there is nothing truly holy, where there is no holy love.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. H—y's third argument is taken from Rom. ii.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:012811_0181_0F8ABFE937710228"/>
14. 'For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, theſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the law, are a law unto themſelves.' Here the Gentiles, whom he concludes all will allow to be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, are expreſsly ſaid to do the things contained in the law: Therefore the unregenerate may obey the law and do their duty in ſome inſtances.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. If the apoſtle is ſpeaking of the heathen, the words taken in their connexion will prove that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then by, nature, do thoſe things by which they ſhall be juſtified. This will ſuit the groſs Pelagians, and they have improved them to this purpoſe, as Mr. H—y ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; but this will prove too much for him, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. The apoſtle, in the verſe immediately preceding, ſays <hi>the doers of the law</hi> ſhall be juſtified; and then theſe words came in. FOR when the Gentiles do the things contained in the law, that is, are <hi>doers of the law.</hi> It would be doing violence to theſe words to ſuppoſe that doing the law, in the former clauſe means one thing, and doing the things of the law, in the next, which is connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the former by the illative particle <hi>for,</hi> means quite another thing. Therefore if the doers of the law ſhall be juſtified; and the heathen do the law, they ſhall be juſtified, and ſaved, whether they are regenerate, or ever hear of Chriſt and the goſpel, or not. Mr. H—y ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that, ſince the ſame word is uſed in each of theſe verſes, it muſt mean the ſame thing; and this, I think, is the moſt weighty reaſon he gives againſt Mr. Glaſs's ſenſe of the words. <note n="§" place="bottom">Mr. Glaſs obſerves that the words in the original, rendered, <hi>do the things of the law,</hi> might more properly be rendered, <hi>do the offices of the law</hi>; i. e. their own conſciences dictate to them what is right, and condemn or juſtify, by which they are a law unto themſelves.</note> He ſays 'It ought not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, without evident reaſon, that the apoſtle ſhould immediately uſe the ſame word, in effect, to expreſs a meaning intirely diverſe.' P. 136. If he does not, he ſpeaks of ſuch a doing of the things contained in the law, which is connected with juſtification and ſalvation; for
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:012811_0182_0F8ABFEB2F37F788"/>
of ſuch doings he ſpeaks in the ſentence immediately before.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. Some have ſuppoſed the apoſtle is here and in the preceding verſes ſpeaking of that doing the things of the law, by which they who did them ſhould live; and is explaining what he afterwards ſays is the tenor of law. Chap. x. 5. 'For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the law, that the man which doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them.' That he ſpeaks of keeping the law in the ſenſe in which the Jews generally underſtood it, as the way to life; and obſerves that on this footing the Gentiles ſtood as fair a chance for life as the Jews, if they were doers of the law, by a patient continuance in well doing. Yea, while ſuch Gentiles were ſaved, the Jew, who heard the law, and did not keep it, would certainly periſh. That he ſays this only to convince the Jews of their error, without ſuppoſing that any one, Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, ever did or will do the things contained in the law, which if a man do, he ſhall live in them. This ſenſe is much preferable to that which repreſents the heathen as actually doing thoſe things by which they ſhall be ſaved, without any knowledge of Chriſt and the goſpel. But there are objections againſt this ſenſe, which I ſtay not now to mention, but proceed to another, which to me is the moſt natural and eaſy.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. The apoſtle is not here ſpeaking of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted heathens, but of ſuch doing the things contained in the law as is implied in embracing the goſpel, or in the character of a chriſtian, which in the preceding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text he calls a <hi>patient continuing in well doing</hi> and <hi>working good.</hi> And this is agreeable to our ſaviour's account of the matter, Matt. vii. 21. and on. And St. James de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the true chriſtian in the ſame manner. Jam. i. 25. 'But whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but <hi>a doer of the work,</hi> this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.'</p>
               <p>The words following confirm this ſenſe, in which theſe
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:012811_0183_0F8ABFEBD9C8D868"/>
Gentiles are ſaid to ſhew the work of the law <hi>written in their hearts</hi>; i. e. diſcover, by their prefeſſion and conduct, the law written on their hearts. But this is ſpoken of as the character of God's people, as the effect of God's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a bleſſing peculiar to the covenant of grace, Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.10.</p>
               <p>The paſſage under conſideration might, conſiſtent with the original, be rendered thus, 'For when the Gentiles, who by nature have not the law, do the things contained in the law.' The word tranſlated <hi>by nature</hi> being uſed to denote their natural ſtate, by birth and education, by which they are diſtinguiſhed from the Jews, and not what they did by the force of mere nature. We have an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on parallel to this in the 27 verſe, where the ſame word is uſed: 'And ſhall not uncircumciſion, <hi>which is by nature,</hi> if it fulfil the law &amp;c.' This phraſe means the ſame with that under conſideration, 'the Gentiles who <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are without law.' <note n="†" place="bottom">When St. Paul diſtinguiſhes the Jews from the Gentiles, he uſes the ſame word. 'We who are Jews <hi>by nature.</hi>' Gal. ii. 15. In op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this, the Gentiles were <hi>by nature</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the Jews.</note> And he is here evidently ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame thing; to <hi>fulfil the law</hi> is the ſame with doing the things contained in the law. And he goes on to ſhew what this is, to the end of the chapter, viz. that it is nothing merely external, but belongs to the heart. But none will ſuppoſe this character belongs to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Gentiles. He ſpeaks of the ſame Gentiles in the following parts of this epiſtle, 'Even us whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles. What ſhall we ſay then? That the Gentiles which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not after righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſneſs.' chap. ix. 24, 30, ſee alſo x. 12, &amp;c. xv. 18.</p>
               <p>The Jews were greatly prejudiced againſt the Gentiles being received as the people of God, without being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and becoming Jews by ſubmitting to their law in every particular. They ſaid to the Gentiles, 'Except ye be circumciſed, after the manner of Moſes, ye cannot
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:012811_0184_0F8ABFEC98443820"/>
be ſaved, that it was needful to circumciſe them, &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to keep the law of Moſes.' Act. xv. 1, 5. The apoſtles themſelves had the ſame prejudices at firſt. And when Peter came to underſtand the truth, he ſaid, 'Of a truth, I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons: But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is accepted with him. Act. x. 34, 38. This is the truth Paul is vindicating in this chapter, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to convince and confute the oppoſing Jews. This might be more fully ſhewn, had I room.</p>
               <p>It will perhaps be objected, that the laſt clauſe of the verſe ſeems inconſiſtent with the Gentiles here ſpoken of being chriſtians: 'Theſe having not the law, are a law unto themſelves.' Gentile converts had the law as much as the Jews.</p>
               <p>ANS. They had not the law in the ſenſe in which the Jews had it. It was not given to them as it was to the Jews; nor in this ſenſe binding on them. Therefore in the ſenſe in which the Jew had the law, as a Jew, the Gentile had it not, but was without law, and continued ſo, after he was converted to chriſtianity. And by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily improving the revelation of the moral law, made to the Jews, being approved by his own reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for his own inſtruction, conviction and practice, he was a law unto himſelf. This ſenſe of the words has been mentioned by Auguſtin and others, as may be ſeen in <hi>Poli Syn. in loc.</hi> Though Mr. H—y thought not fit to take any notice of it. This ſenſe is conſiſtent with the whole bible, and particularly with it's being ſaid of all men by nature, chap. iii. verſe 12. 'There is none that doth good, no not one,' which cannot be eaſily reconciled with their doing <hi>by nature</hi> the things contained in the law; and being ſuch <hi>doers of the law</hi> as ſhall be juſtified. Mr. H—y muſt prove this cannot be the ſenſe of the text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his argument from it will be of any ſervice to him.</p>
               <p>His three next arguments, viz. from its being ſaid of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, that when he heard John, <hi>he did many things,</hi> Mark
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:012811_0185_0F8ABFED4B72D110"/>
vi. 20. From Paul's exhorting the chriſtians at Philippi to practiſe whatever things are true, honeſt, &amp;c. Phil. iv. 8. And 'from divers teſtimonies from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, manifeſting God's <hi>approbation</hi> or favorable notice of the actions of unſanctified men, when for the ſubſtance conformable to his will,' are not ſo different as to require a diſtinct anſwer to each of them.</p>
               <p>The general anſwer is, Whatever men do from an evil principle, or for a forbidden end, is not duty in any ſenſe; but ſin. 'No man may do any acts of religious obedience for ſuch ends as are ſimply and abſolutely unlawful. Such ſacrifices are in a peculiar ſenſe an abomination to the Lord.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Hemmenway's ſerm. p. 51.</note> Mr. H—y grants the unregenerate act from no higher or better principle than ſelf-love, and have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end than this ſets up. But this is a ſinful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and always purſues a wrong and bad end. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſuch really do no duty. Therefore if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that ſelf-love is an innocent and good affection, there muſt be ſome fallacy in all his arguments from theſe ſcriptures, or any others in favour of the unregenerate doing any part of their duty; eſpecially their doing that which is worthy of <hi>God's approbation and favourable notice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid that Herod <hi>did many things</hi>; but not that he did any duty, or one thing, as John directed him to do it. John directed him to repent, and expreſs his repentance by acts of righteouſneſs and mercy; and if he had two coats, to give one to him that had none. Luk. iii. 8—14. If Herod gave a coat to the poor from ſelf-love, he acted from no better principle or higher end than he did in depriving his brother of his wife, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering John to be put to death. Selfiſhneſs and pride go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned him in the former, as well as in the latter. He was the ſame man, acted from the ſame principle, and had the ſame end in view, in each of theſe actions.</p>
               <p>His argument from Paul's directing Chriſtians to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe whatſoever things are true, &amp;c. is indeed ſomewhat remarkable. He ſays, 'I have not cited it becauſe
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:012811_0186_0F8ABFEE112119F0"/>
ſtraitned for proofs.' P. 139. None will imagine he can be <hi>ſtraitned</hi> for proofs, who thinks this text to be one: Every command in the bible might be as 'pertinently ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as this. Chriſt's command to his diſciples, 'Bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you,' is full as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; for the unregenerate can do this, ſo far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in externals, as well as ſpeak the truth, and do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are lovely. And indeed this implies what our Saviour enjoins; for a kind behaviour towards our enemies is one of theſe lovely things. But I believe Mr. H—y will not ſay that they whoſe character is, <hi>hating one another,</hi> hating thoſe that hate them, do ever bleſs their enemies, according to the command of Chriſt. For when they bleſs with their mouth, their heart is full of curſing &amp; bitterneſs. And he inſiſts, as has been obſerved, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done for a bad end, is not duty. Men may bleſs their enemies to gratify their ill will againſt them: But this is not doing the matter of duty, he grants. And they who bleſs them from no higher principle than ſelf-love, always do it from ill will; for ſelf-love is always and neceſſarily ill will to enemies. In a word, Mr. H—y's argument from this text takes its fair appearance wholly from a gingle of words; and a ſuppoſition that the unregenerate may ſpeak the truth not for a bad, but a good, end, which he has not yet proved.</p>
               <p>The truth of the matter is plainly this. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain external actions in words and conduct, which are the fruit of volition, or an expreſſion of the heart, acting out in theſe ways. Such of theſe as are the proper expreſſion of love to God and our neighbour, or univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, are put for the whole; the external ſign or effect, which alone is ſeen by men, is mentioned and ſpoken of as including the whole. Therefore theſe are mentioned in the command, and are commanded, as comprehending the whole. And when theſe effects are produced by men, they are ſaid to do the things that were commanded, the
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012811_0187_0F8ABFEEDEBB3000"/>
whole being implied, unleſs there be an expreſs exception. Therefore when only ſomething external is mentioned in the command, and this is complied with and done, men are ſaid to do as they are commanded in ſcripture, and in common language among men, where none imagine that nothing is intended, but the exernal thing which is mentioned. This I take to be a full ſolution of all the ſeeming difficulty in all the paſſages of ſcripture Mr. H—y mentions, or that can be found, where only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal actions are mentioned in the command, and men are ſaid to do as they were commanded, when they did the external thing mentioned in the command. Mr. H—y ſuppoſes the effective act of the will is implied, when only ſomething external is mentioned; and we have as good authority to ſay the motives and deſign of the agent are implied; for theſe are as eſſential to every effective act of the will, as is this effective act, to the external effect; and more ſo; for the external effect may take place where there is no act of the will, whereas there can be no effective act of the will without motive and deſign.</p>
               <p>The whole therefore comes to this: There are certain external things which are the proper expreſſion of love to God and our neighbour, and by which the greateſt good of the whole is promoted. Theſe are therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. <note n="§" place="bottom">Our author ſays, p. 48. 'The higheſt good of the univerſe is the original reaſon and foundation of the divine law.' This therefore muſt be the deſign of every particular command. And when any particular external action is commanded, it is ſuppoſed it muſt be done with a deſign to anſwer this end, which is the great end of all laws. And if the external action mentioned in the command is done with a contrary view and deſign, there is no obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but it is nothing but diſobedience. But this is true of all who act wholly from ſelf-love. No affection but univerſal benevolence agrees to the higheſt good of the univerſe. Self love does always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily oppoſe it. Therefore he does not obey any command, who has no univerſal benevolence. See the preceding inquiry.</note> And when the command is complied with, and the external thing is done with a right view and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, i. e. with a diſpoſition to promote the general good,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012811_0188_0F8ABFEF892EF7A8"/>
it is matter of duty: But if it be done with a bad deſign, and from a contrary motive, viz. to ſet up ſelf in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the general good; it is not matter of duty, but matter of ſin.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to what is ſaid of God's manifeſting his approbation of the doings of wicked men, and taking a favourable notice of them, out of reſpect to what they did, in the caſe of Ahab, Jehu, &amp;c. I ſaid in my reply to Mr. Mills, God did not conduct in theſe inſtances, as a ſearcher of hearts, but in what he ſaid of them, and his conduct towards them, had reſpect to their preſent exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance, profeſſion and conduct, i. e. as if they really were what they profeſſed to be, true penitents, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y demands 'direct and poſitive ſcripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this hypotheſis;' and ſays, 'Of this, according to my beſt obſervation, his book affords nothing.' <hi>Anſ.</hi> I mentioned two paſſages of ſcripture, Iſai. lxiii. 8—10. Pſalm. lxxviii. 36. which I thought amounted to a full proof of this. How this paragraph came to eſcape his obſervation I can't tell:—If he <hi>obſerved it,</hi> and ſaw it was not to the purpoſe, why was he not ſo kind as to help our ignorance? He adds, 'Nor has he told us how it could properly be ſaid of any one, without any reſpect to his heart, that his <hi>heart</hi> was or was not perfect, upright, &amp;c. when his behaviour was externally right.'</p>
               <p>ANS. There is no ſuch inſtance. It is ſaid of Amazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah that he did that which was right; but not with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart. 2 Chron. xxv. 2. But this has reference to what appeared in his external conduct. This was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together right, and this diſcovered that his heart was not perfect. This would not have been ſaid of him, if his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour had been externally right.</p>
               <p>I alſo ſaid, if God granted favours to Ahab, Jehu, &amp;c. out of reſpect to their repentance and good deeds, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted hereby his approbation of their doings, and took this favourable notice of what they did, and favoured
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:012811_0189_0F8ABFF0550AD358"/>
them becauſe they did ſo well, while they were conſidered as having no connexion with Chriſt, and enemies to him; then he might beſtow the greateſt favours on men, out of reſpect to their own goodneſs; and conſequently they may be juſtified by the deeds of the law; which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the goſpel, and repreſents Chriſt as dead in vain.</p>
               <p>To this he ſays, in the firſt place, God does in fact grint favours to men who are not believers in Chriſt, and therefore if my poſition is true, he might grant the greateſt favours as well, even eternal ſalvation, had there been no mediator;—ſo that according to my way of arguing, a mediator was not neceſſary, in order to the ſalvation of men; &amp;c.</p>
               <p>ANS. He has wholly overlooked the argument. I do not ſay 'tis inconſiſtent with the goſpel for God to grant favours to men, antecedent to their believing in Chriſt; but that 'tis inconſiſtent with the need of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin by Chriſt, if men, while unbelievers &amp; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt and the atonement, <hi>may do thoſe works,</hi> by which they obtain God's approbation and favourable notice; for this implies pardon and acceptance, <hi>out of reſpect to their works,</hi> and <hi>purely for their works ſake</hi>; which is the ſame with being juſtified by their works. If a man can be approved and accepted of God in his perſon and works, while he has no union to Chriſt or faith in him; then he is ſo far accepted, and favoured, <hi>purely</hi> out of reſpect to his good deeds; and not in the leaſt out of reſpect to the righteouſneſs and worthineſs of Chriſt. The neceſſity of Chriſt's atonement is grounded in man's being in ſuch a ſtate by ſin, that he cannot have God's approbation and favourable notice, on account of any thing he can do; even though he ſhould become perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy. If he could, Chriſt's atonement would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. There is a wide difference between God's exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing benevolence to men; and his approving and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and their doings, and taking a favourable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:012811_0190_0F8ABFF1231DEDE0"/>
of them <hi>becauſe</hi> they have done ſo well. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is exerciſed towards men antecedent to their union to Chriſt; the latter cannot take place, unleſs they are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united to Chriſt, and intereſted in his worthineſs and righteouſneſs, which alone recommends men to the divine approbation and acceptance in their perſons and works; for they are <hi>accepted in the beloved.</hi> Antecedent to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, they are condemned and accurſed, which is inconſiſtent with their having God's approbation, and his taking a favourable notice of their doings. It men could be thus delivered from the curſe by their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and righteouſneſs, there was no neceſſity of Chriſt's being made a curſe, to deliver them from it: Therefore, as to ſuch, Chriſt is dead in vain. Gal. ii. 21. Mr. H—y has not ſaid a word to ſhew the defect of this argument, that I have obſerved.</p>
               <p>But he goes on to make another miſtake, and upon this ſays, the very ſame objections lie againſt the ſenſe I put on theſe paſſages. For if God treated them as if their conduct was right and acceptable to him, having reſpect only to their external conduct, without ſearching their hearts, he did this, either on account of Chriſt's media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or not. If not, then all the conſequences follow from this, which I have mentioned as following from his interpretation. If he in this has reſpect to Chriſt's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, his doctrine is as vindicable, on this principle, as mine. He concludes thus,
<q>Plainly then, when he will tell us how it can be reconciled with the divine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſpeak of, and conduct towards, ſinners, not as the ſearcher of hearts, but merely according to their viſible behaviour; and clear his own hypotheſis from the conſequences he draws from the doctrine he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; then I ſuppoſe a man of his diſcernment, or even half an eye, will eaſily ſee that the doctrine he oppoſes may in the ſame way be as well vindicated.</q>
P. 155.</p>
               <p>ANS. God, in treating them, not as the ſearcher of hearts, but according to their viſible profeſſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:012811_0191_0F8ABFF1D6CA4A20"/>
had reſpect to them, and expreſſed his approbation of them, conſidered as intereſted in the atonement, or as his ſervants truly devoted to him; which was true, if their hearts were anſwerable to their external appearance. Since he really accepts and approves of all true penitents, purely for Chriſt's ſake; he viſibly approved of them who were viſibly penitents, and devoted to him, or appeared to be intereſted in the atonement.</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y has got to ſhew, it will follow from hence, that God may as well manifeſt his approbation of men's characters and doings, conſidered as impenitents, and not united to Chriſt. At preſent I believe he who has not ſo much as <hi>half an eye</hi> is moſt likely to attempt it.—While we treat men according to their viſible appearance, we are obliged to take a favourable notice of and love him who profeſſes ſubjection to Chriſt, purely for his ſake, without knowing his heart, but treating him as if it was anſwerable to his profeſſion. If any one ſhould hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that we may, with as great propriety, manifeſt the ſame approbation and love to thoſe who are viſibly unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and bear no particular relation to Chriſt, he would argue as Mr. H—y does, if he underſtands my argument. The way is now prepared to ſee with how much propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety he introduces the following words:
<q>Methinks it is ſomewhat odd, firſt to deny and diſpute againſt <hi>the fact,</hi> viz. <hi>That God expreſſes his approbation of ſome actions of ſinners, and grants temporal rewards to them becauſe of ſuch actions,</hi> and then immediately ſuppoſe the ſame fact, and introduce a ſcheme to account for it, or ſhew it to be conſiſtent with the divine perfections, and the truth of the goſpel.</q>
I at preſent think it <hi>ſomewhat more than odd</hi> that a gentleman of his abilities ſhould be ſo much in the dark in ſo plain a caſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall finiſh this head by obſerving, that in the paſſages under conſideration, and others of the like kind, there is as much evidence from the expreſſions themſelves, that they did the whole of their duty, as that they really did
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:012811_0192_0F8ABFF2ABBE5D40"/>
any part of it. And Mr. H—y is very arbitrary, having nothing in theſe expreſſions or any where elſe to warrant him, in aſſerting the meaning is, they did <hi>the matter of duty.</hi> Yea we are as certain they did not the matter of duty, as he explains it, as that they did not the whole of their duty, when they are ſaid to do as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; for in order to this, according to him, they muſt do it in a ſerious, conſcientious manner, with a regard to their duty, and under the influence of the ſpirit of God; and for ends that are innocent and good. But we have no more reaſon to think that all the Iſraelites, or the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger part, had all this, than that they were all holy. But we are ſure they did right, and as the Lord commanded, in appearance, and ſo far as their external conduct is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Why then ſhould we not be content with the plain, obvious ſenſe, though this be conſiſtent with their really doing no duty; but, as their act, may be an act of rebellion?</p>
               <p>His ſeventh argument is taken from ſinnners having <hi>encouragement to attend on means</hi> in order to their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſays it hence follows that this is their duty; for 'God never encouraged any one to do that which was not his duty.' P. 157—165.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. It has been ſhewn that the unregenerate do no duty, according to his own account, if ſelf-love is not an innocent and good thing, but is ſin, and ſo far as men act for the end <hi>that</hi> propoſes, they act wrong. But this we ſhall conclude to be true, till ſome evidence that 'tis not ſo be produced. Therefore till he has done this, his own ſcheme muſt be conſidered as involved in all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties he thinks he finds in mine. He ſays, 'No one muſt be encouraged to perform duties for ſuch ends as ought not to be propoſed, or cannot be attained.' Serm. p. 39. But they who act from ſelf-love only, always act for ſuch ends: Therefore ought not to act from ſelf-love. He alſo ſays, 'God's deſign in giving theſe commands (i. e. commands to the unregenerate) <hi>are indeed different
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:012811_0193_0F8ABFF35B9EFBE0"/>
from theirs</hi> in obeying them;' and repreſents every uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted man 'held by Satan, <hi>under his dominion,</hi>' and 'walking upon enchanted ground.' Ibid. p. 63. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they act for ends which ought not to be propoſed,' and cannot be obtained, according to his own account. To what then are they to be encouraged? What duty do they do, while acting from thoſe ends, which ought not to be propoſed, by which they are held under the dominion of Satan, and walk upon enchanted ground? If we ſtrip their actions of all ends, and conſider them as doing duty without motive and deſign, as he ſometimes ſeems to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to do, we ſtrip them of every thing that is either du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſin, as has been obſerved; and that only remains, to which there can be no encouragement; for to talk of encouraging men to do that which involves no motive and deſign, is a contradiction. When Mr. H—y will make his own ſcheme conſiſtent with itſelf, and with his doctrine of encouragement, I truſt all the difficulties he has attempted to faſten on mine, will be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. If it appears from ſcripture hiſtory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they are moſt likely to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth and be ſaved, with whom moſt means are uſed, and who are moſt engaged to attend, in a ſenſe of their undone, miſerable caſe; and have the cleareſt conviction of their true ſtate, &amp;c. Then this is a motive and encouragement to men to attend on theſe means, ſo far as future miſery is an evil, and eternal happineſs is a good in their view, whatever may be their ends in other reſpects. And if this is all that is meant by encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attend on means, may not a man take this encouragement and act upon it, without doing any duty? The encouragement in this caſe does not turn upon the ends he has in view, or the goodneſs or badneſs of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and conduct; but upon this plain fact, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſuch a ſituation are more likely to be ſaved, than
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:012811_0194_0F8ABFF4089A6C50"/>
thoſe in another. One takes the encouragement, and is induced to attend, from bad motives, and for a wrong end; and does nothing but ſin; another is influenced by this fact from the beſt motives, and does his duty; yet it is encouragement to both of them. It is certain, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, this fact affords encouragement to the ſinner, who dreads damnation, to attend, though he is conſcious he attends as a rebel, with a heart wholly oppoſed to God and all his commands: And will it follow that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages him in his rebellion!</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y ſays,
<q>It will be impoſſible to convince thoſe, who view things in any meaſure as they are, that ſuch a conduct as is not their duty, has any probable tendency to promote their final intereſt.</q>
P. 172. It is granted, ſuch conduct has no tendency in itſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ſalvation. The ground of hope, in this caſe, is entirely in what God does, many times over-ruling it ſo as to iſſue in their ſalvation. It is impoſſible for Mr. H—y to prove that a perſon, ſenſible that he does no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether he attends on means or not, may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to attend, as the only hopeful way of eſcaping the evil he dreads; for this is not only contrary to reaſon, but to many known facts. Many who are convinced they do no duty, but that all the exerciſes of their hearts are a conſtant ſeries of horrid rebellion againſt God, are engaged to attend on means as the moſt likely way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the damnation they dread. And it appears from fact, that the more fully a ſinner is convinced that his heart conſtantly oppoſes God, and the more he feels the miſery of his caſe, the more engaged he will be in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on means. And if ſuch could be made to believe that there was no hope for them, but in the way of doing duty, they would ſit down in abſolute deſpair.</p>
               <p>His eighth argument, which he ſays is an <hi>important one,</hi> now offers itſelf. P. 165—199. This is taken from 'the ends for which the ordinances of the goſpel were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.' He ſays, 'ſuch an attendance to duties as unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:012811_0195_0F8ABFF7523FD830"/>
ſinners are capable of, may and does anſwer ſome of thoſe ends for which theſe duties were enjoined. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch obedience is enjoined in and by them.'</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. Though God's ends are anſwered by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and the ſinners attendance on means; and it is ſometimes made the occaſion of good to him; yet it does not follow that the ſinner does any duty. He ſays the ſinner is under the dominion of Satan in all he does, and his ends are different from God's in his inſtitutions and commands. The ſinner's exerciſes and exertions have no tendency, in themſelves, to anſwer any good end. They are all evil, and tend to evil, being oppoſition to the divine authority and command. When they iſſue in ſaving good to the ſinner, 'tis wholly owing to the interpoſing, over-ruling hand of God. The ſinner in all his exertions under awakenings and convictions of conſcience, while <hi>under the dominion of Satan,</hi> is more like a wild bull in a net, than a ſubmiſſive, obedient child; and would get out of the hands of God, if he could, and all his ſtrivings are really ſtrivings againſt God, as they are utterly oppoſed to ſubmiſſion to him; like the exertions of a wild beaſt, untamed, unſubdued, in the hands of him who is taking methods to bring him to ſubmiſſion. God uſes means with the ſinner, ſuited to bring him to ſubmiſſion, and is pleaſed to cauſe them to be ſucceſsful in ſome inſtances; but till the ſinner ſubmits he does not comply with God's deſign, but acts like a rebel in all his exertions. This is the ſcripture account of the matter. 'The carnal mind is enmity againſt God. Every one that doth evil <hi>hateth the light.</hi>' Joh. iii. 20. 'He that is not with me, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad.' Matth. xii. 30. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. H—y ſpeaks of the ſinner's <hi>waiting on God in the way of his bleſſing</hi>; and of his <hi>endeavours of obedience,</hi> p. 169, 170. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſcripture will not warrant him to apply theſe expreſſions to the doings of the unregenerate. They only tend to blind and deceive. Endeavours of obedience ſuppoſe the heart is gained and friendly to God and his commands: And <hi>to wait on God,</hi> does in ſcripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note faith and truſt in him, and promiſes are made to this. Does the unſubdued rebel, the carnal mind which is enmity againſt God, ever do this?</note>

                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:012811_0196_0F8ABFF83941BAE8"/>ANS. 2. It is granted that God's inſtitutions and commands, have a tendency to influence the unregenerate; and are deſigned and uſed to promote what is called a preparatory work in them; but it does not follow that they, while unregenerate, obey any of theſe injunctions &amp; commands. Our author ſays,
<q>The hearers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are to be immediately called to believe and repent; and theſe commands and exhortations are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with a promiſe of pardon and ſalvation, if they comply; and a threatening of damnation if they remain impenitent.</q>
P. 191. And he adds,
<q>The inculcation of it, by the bleſſing of God, is a means of good to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The work of conviction and humiliation may, through the influence of the holy ſpirit, be promoted in them. Hereby they are led into a juſt view of the miſery and danger of a ſtate of ſin; and are excited earneſtly to implore the mercy of God;—and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend on all the appointed means of converſion.</q>
—If this is the tendency of inculcating theſe commands, what need is there of preaching up any other duty ſhort of repentance, to promote a work of conviction, &amp;c. and lead ſinners diligently to attend on means? This will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all theſe ends to all intents as well; and, I muſt add, much better than preaching up duties to be done by them while in a ſtate of enmity with God; for this has no tendency to convince the ſinner of his true ſtate, of his ſin, miſery and danger, or thoroughly to awaken him to an engagedneſs in this matter; but the contrary. I appeal to fact and experience. What perſons have appeared to have the moſt juſt view of their miſery and danger; and to be moſt in earneſt in attendance on means? Are they not ſuch as have been convinced that they are wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; that they are ſo far from doing any duty, that all they do is ſin; and their hearts conſtantly riſe in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

againſt God? When ſinners come to this conviction, you cannot perſwade them that they do any duty, or keep them from a conſtant attendance on means. And where theſe doctrines are preached, and ſinners are called upon to repent, &amp;c. and taught that they do no duty, while they refuſe this, they are as much diſpoſed to be in the uſe of means, as <hi>they,</hi> at leaſt, who have the contrary doctrine preached to them.</p>
               <p>But what is moſt to the purpoſe to obſerve here is, that Mr. H—y has, in this conceſſion, given up the whole of this argument. His argument is, that becauſe the divine commands and inſtitutions are deſigned to anſwer ends, with reſpect to the unregenerate, to promote a preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work, &amp;c. therefore they muſt enjoin duty to be done by them while unregenerate. But he here ſays, all theſe ends may be anſwered by calling on them to repent and believe immediately, on pain of damnation. And by this has ſapped the whole foundation of his own argument.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. Mr. H—y allows they do no duty, and have not 'a next power' to do any of the duties he pleads for, who have not 'the inward influence of the ſpirit of God.' P. 50, and in many other places. But the inſtitutions and commands of God reſpect theſe, as well as thoſe who have the inward influence of the ſpirit, and are deſigned to anſwer ends with reſpect to them; and ſuch attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on means, as they are capable of, may, &amp; does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, anſwer theſe ends, and proves the means of their awakening and ſalvation. Therefore ſuch obedience is enjoined in and by goſpel inſtitutions. This argument is built on the ſame ground on which his ſtands: But he will not allow it to be good: Conſequently muſt allow us, and ought himſelf, to have as poor an opinion of his own.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething to be done with a ſinner, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his receiving 'the inward influences of the ſpirit of God,' and as a means of it; and he may do ſomething, viz. read the bible, and hear the goſpel preached. And
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:012811_0198_0F8ABFFAC867CB60"/>
why is not this as much duty, as any thing the ſinner does, who has the inward influences of the ſpirit, according to his argument? Therefore it proves too much, even what he ſays is not true; and ſo proves nothing at all.</p>
               <p>He probably made this diſtinction, and expreſsly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all who have not the inward influences of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from doing any duty, becauſe it would be not a little ſhocking to repreſent the openly profane perſon as doing the matter of duty, when he puts on a ſerious face for an hour in hearing a ſermon, while his heart is as much giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to profaneneſs as ever, and his deſign is to improve what he hears to the vileſt purpoſes. But they who judge not <hi>according to the appearance, but righteous judgment,</hi> according to the ſtandard of truth, and look on every unregenerate heart full of nothing but thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which are wholly evil continually; of curſing and bitterneſs; of enmity againſt God; <hi>deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked</hi>; will be as far from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that ſuch do any duty, as he is that any duty is done by the ſecure and profane. And though he may think it very uncharitable, I am confident that if he had conſtantly viewed the unregenerate in this ſcriptural light, his two books wrote to prove and inculcate unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate duties, never would have exiſted. But it is to be obſerved, that he often forgets this diſtinction, as well he might, ſince 'tis ſo arbitrary, and repreſents thoſe as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, who can have no pretence to the ſpirit of God, more than all men on earth, even the whole hoſt of Iſrael, and the mixed multitude at the red ſea, and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; though he ſays, God, at the ſame time, 'knew that they were a rebellious generation.' P. 174. And he ſays the multitude of the Jews did their duty in ſitting down to eat, though they were a ſtupid, carnal generation, and followed Chriſt, only for the loaves. And his deſcription of the matter of duty in many places is ſuited to the doings of the moſt profligate wretch in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012811_0199_0F8AC000CFFF2760"/>
though at other times, in contradiction to himſelf, he expreſsly excludes ſuch from doing any duty.</p>
               <p>This leads me to obſerve, he ſays, when Chriſt directed the Jews to ſearch the ſcriptures, he muſt mean a ſtudy of the ſcriptures by the unregenerate, in order to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or their receiving the holy ſpirit in his ſanctifying influences, becauſe they were then unregenerate. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ground I may ſay, he means a ſearch of the ſcriptures, which men may practice before they have 'the inward influences of the ſpirit of God,' for theſe Jews had not the ſpirit in this ſenſe; and muſt they wait and do nothing till the ſpirit came upon them? Was it not their duty to ſearch the ſcriptures, in order to obtain the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſpirit? And did Chriſt direct them to ſtudy the ſcriptures, only on ſuppoſition they had the ſpirit. If he directed them to that ſearch of the ſcriptures, which they could not perform till they had <hi>the inward influences of the ſpirit,</hi> which they were then wholly without; why might he not as well mean ſuch a ſtudy of them, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the holy ſpirit in his ſanctifying influences? Was not the latter as much in their reach as the former? And are not God's inſtitutions and commands as much calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and deſigned to bring men to the former, as to the latter? When he will ſolve theſe difficulties, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe queſtions, on his own principles, we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe a full anſwer to all he ſays on this head, from this paſſage of ſcripture, or any other. This, we truſt, has been made already. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. H—y frequently repreſents that, upon our plan, the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are not to be exhorted to do any duty, but only <hi>on ſuppoſition they are regenerated</hi>; and that nothing is their duty in preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. In this view, he ſays, p. 171. 'Why do any ſeek to perſwade unregenerate ſinners that theſe things are not their duty?' This is a groundleſs miſrepreſentation. While we tell them they do no duty ſo long as they are impenitent, we have duty enough to urge upon them, and that without making any ſuppoſition; and which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grants is their <hi>immediate</hi> duty.</p>
                     <p>But if this repreſentation were juſt, it might be equally applied to him, and it might be ſaid, he find no duty for them to do, who have not received the inward influences of the ſpirit; and they cannot be exhorted to any, only on ſuppoſition they have theſe influences How they ſhall know when they have theſe influences, he has not told, and perhaps if he ſhould try, he would find it much eaſier to tell, from the bible, how perſons may know whether they have the ſpirit in his ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences, than that they have his influences, which are ſhort of it.</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:012811_0200_0F8C692EC4D45FB8"/>Mr. H—y makes great uſe of imperfect holineſs being preſcribed as the means of ſalvation; and ſeems to think this quite ſufficient to prove his point, and ſtop the mouth of moſt objections againſt him. His argument ſeems to be this: If the beſt of men are imperfect, and do but part of their duty in this world; and true repentance and faith, however imperfect, are the appointed means of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; then the doings of the unregenerate are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duties, as means of their converſion.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. Real holineſs is duty; and he who exerciſeth this, though in an imperfect degree, ſo far does his duty, and no further. But how does it follow from hence that the unregenerate do any duty; or that unholineſs is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as duty, or means of any thing? He has not yet made out this conſequence, and never will.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. They are required to be perfect in all things; nor is imperfect holineſs preſcribed by any command. It is, thro' the grace of the goſpel, made a means of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and intereſts in all the bleſſings of the covenant of grace; but every injunction and command requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs, as much as any degree of it. The loweſt degree of holineſs is in ſome degree obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, though 'tis not required as thus imperfect; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace pardons the imperfection and ſin for Chriſt's ſake, to whom the loweſt degree of true faith in him unites the believer. But ſtill, how does it follow from this, that what has no degree of holineſs is any part of duty, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as a means of converſion?</p>
               <p>Under this argument he undertakes to correct '<hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miſtake,</hi>' which, he ſays, I have made, in repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome ſuppoſe, and argue from it, as an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

maxim,
<q>That whatſoever is ſaid to an impenitent, unregenerate ſinner, by way of exhortation or command, can require or propoſe nothing but what he may do, and yet continue impenitent and unregenerate.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See reply to Mr. Mills, p. 133.</note> He ſays, he knows of none to whom this is applicable. And as, from ſome of my words on this head, he has reaſon to conclude I had reference to his ſermons, he ſays I have miſtook his meaning, and concludes I have alſo miſtook the meaning of others. P. 183, marg. 189, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. I own that when I wrote what he refers to, I did ſuppoſe he had taken this for an undoubted maxim in ſome things he ſaid in his ſermons, as well as others in their writings: And I was not alone in this. I was led to this concluſion from his building an argument, for the duties he was pleading for, wholly on this ſuppoſition, as I thought. P. 130, &amp;c. he undertakes to prove that the things which the unregenerate may do, while ſuch, are required of them. And he does this principally by citing a number of ſcriptures, in which there are commands to <hi>hear, ſearch the ſcriptures, pray,</hi> &amp;c. And all he ſays to prove theſe ſcriptures are to his purpoſe, and require the doings of the unregenerate, is to obſerve <hi>they were ſpoken to ſuch.</hi> Now, if it is not true that nothing but the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the unregenerate, or what they may do, while ſuch, is required of them; then theſe commands, given to the unregenerate, may require not what they do, while ſuch, but what the regenerate only do; ſo his argument comes to nothing. If I ſhould undertake to prove, from ſcripture, that a profane drunkard was required to pray, while in the midſt of his profaneneſs and cups; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this ſhould produce a ſcripture requiring prayer, and only obſerve this ſcripture was addreſſed to profane drunkards; would not every one ſee I had not proved my point, unleſs it was certain that nothing is in ſcripture required of ſuch men, but what they may do while ſuch?
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:012811_0202_0F8ABE7A4E814D78"/>
And would they not have right to conclude I built on this as an undeniable maxim?</p>
               <p>I knew Mr. H—y offered other arguments, and ſaid many things inconſiſtent with what I ſuppoſed he took for granted here, as the foundation of his argument; yet this was no evidence that he did not here build wholly on the maxim mentioned: Nor am I able yet to make any thing of his argument on any other ſuppoſition. But ſince he ſays this was not his meaning, it muſt be left to the public to judge, who has made the greateſt miſtake, he, in writing as he has done, or I, in underſtanding him as I did.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. Though he has undertaken now to 'ſtate the matter <hi>plainly,</hi> as he underſtands it;' I confeſs it is not <hi>very plain</hi> to me, though it may be to others. P. 190, &amp;c. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His argument, as he now ſtates it, proves nothing. The argument is this, if I <hi>now</hi> underſtand him. There are certain inſtrumental duties to be done by the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and means to be attended upon, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Therefore the ſcriptures commanding theſe things, as what they have <hi>a next power to do,</hi> bind theſe duties upon them. Here the whole thing to be proved is ſtill taken for granted, viz. that there are <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental duties</hi> for the unregenerate to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If his argument proves any thing, it proves too much for himſelf. If commands to the unregenerate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect all they may do, while ſuch, in attendance on means, &amp;c. and make all this their duty, as they may do it; then they, who have not 'the inward influences of the ſpirit,' are hereby bound to duty, which they may do, while in this ſtate, and the argument is as ſtrong for theſe duties as any other. But he himſelf grants ſuch do no duty. If his way of arguing does not prove they do, it proves nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He, in explaining his argument, gives it all up, as has been obſerved, p. 188, 189. For if, as he aſſerts,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:012811_0203_0F8ABF7B474C7C08"/>
commands which the unregenerate never obey, while ſuch, are ſuited to excute them to all thoſe exertions and attendance on means, and produce all thoſe effects, neceſſary to take place in order to converſion, and always do this, where they take effect; then the neceſſity of their attending on means, &amp;c. does not infer any command of theſe things, as they do them; for there is no need of any ſuch command, in order to their doing them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He has, I think, in ſtating this matter <hi>plainly,</hi> ſaid other things <hi>plainly</hi> inconſiſtent with themſelves. He ſays repeatedly, it is the <hi>preſent,</hi> the <hi>immediate</hi> duty of the unregenerate to repent and believe the goſpel, &amp;c. And yet, in the midſt of all this, he aſſerts
<q>God has not enjoined on any the impracticable taſk of exerciſing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural powers or principles, before they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with them, as the means of obtaining any bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings temporal or ſpiritual. To preſcribe impoſſible means would be the ſame thing as to preſcribe none. Faith and repentance are means of ſalvation only to thoſe who are enabled to believe and repent.</q>
P. 191. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Agreeable to this, he in his ſermons quotes with approbation the following ſentence.
<q>God does not command impoſſibilities; but in commanding, directs ſinners to <hi>do what they can,</hi> and to ſeek and endeavour to do what they cannot.</q>
P. 199. marg. i. e. God does not command the unregenerate to do any thing, which they cannot do while ſuch.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps I have made another <hi>notable miſtake</hi> for Mr. H—y to correct: But if I have not, theſe are not only inconſiſtencies, but he has here aſſerted the very doctrine I had ſaid ſome hold, and was implied in the argument abovementioned; which he repreſents to be a notable miſtake. For according to this, God does not enjoin any thing on the unregenerate in order to their ſalvation, which they may not do while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Upon this ground his argument, from the ſcriptures above mentioned, ſtands good; and we may be ſure that whatever the ſcripture directs ſinners to, in order to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is ſomething they may do while unregenerate.
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:012811_0204_0F8ABF7C1A8AA5B0"/>
And I am yet peruſaded he in his own mind built on this as an undeniable maxim, when he wrote his ſermons, though he may now think he did not. His argument is concluſive, on this ſuppoſition: And why ſhould he not ſuppoſe then, what he has aſſerted now; and that even while he is declaring he holds no ſuch thing?</p>
               <p n="4">4. He here aſſerts a certain connexion between what the unregenerate may do, and ſalvation; which he had repeatedly ſaid, we have no warrant to aſſert from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and has declared his belief of the contrary. His words are,
<q>God's denying ſpecial and effectual grace to thoſe who are favoured with the outward means, is a penal conſequence of their neglecting to do what they had a next power to do in a way or attendance on means.</q>
P. 193. If ſo, then none periſh who attend on the means as the unregenerate may do. But how does he know this, unleſs he finds it aſſerted in the bible? But if it is aſſerted there, it is the ſame with a divine promiſe of ſalvation to all who thus attend the means. How then can he ſay, as he does repeatedly, it cannot be proved there are any promiſes of ſalvation to the doings of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate? <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. H—y, in his ſermons, ſays, 'I do not plead for a promiſe of regeneration to the endeavours of the unconverted.' Yet at the ſame time ſays the unconverted 'by improving diligently the grace they have received, ſhall obtain further degrees.' And to this purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the words of Chriſt, 'Whoſoever hath (i. e. holds or improves what he hath) to him ſhall be given.' This is an abſolute promiſe to that improvement here intended. Therefore if it intends what the unregenerate do, there are promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate. Moreover, he applies one of the moſt expreſs promiſes in the bible to the unregenerate. Matth. vii. 7—10. See p. 106, 107, 108. How theſe things can be made conſiſtent, I know not.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He concludes by ſaying, 'Theſe obſervations, it is hoped, may help Mr. H. to underſtand the principles on which our argument proceeds, better than he appears to have done.' I confeſs I am not helped; nor does it appear to me that he well underſtands himſelf. But perhaps it will be <hi>plain</hi> to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:012811_0205_0F8ABF7CC8B33028"/>His laſt argument is this: 'The hearers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are commanded to repent and be converted that they may be ſaved; and this infers an obligation on all to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the means of converſion. Such commands impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly require whatever is neceſſary to be done by us, in order to a compliance with them.' P. 199.</p>
               <p>ANS. The command to repent does not infer an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to attend on the means of converſion in an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent way, or with a heart wholly oppoſed to repentance; nor is this neceſſary in order to a compliance with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, unleſs oppoſition to the command is implied in the command, and is the means of obedience to it. But the doings of the impenitent are impenitent doings, and wholly oppoſed to repentance and converſion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not implied in the command to repent, &amp;c. ſo far from this, that they are altogether diſobedience to the command. <note n="§" place="bottom">This is, I think, ſufficient to ſhew I was not guilty of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence he thinks he finds in what I have wrote on this head, p. 199, 200, marg.

               </p>
               <p>I know Mr. H—y will come in here with his <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and ſay, impenitence and unbelief 'are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as <hi>adjuncts</hi> or <hi>qualifications</hi> of mens attendance on means; but the <hi>attendance itſelf</hi> is abſolutely required of men.' But when he has ſeparated the adjuncts and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of their doings from the attendance itſelf, there remains nothing to be required or forbidden, that is duty or ſin, as has been ſhewn.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> A brief reply to Mr. Hemmenway's anſwer to my arguments, proving the unregenerate do no duty.</head>
               <p>MY firſt and chief argument to prove the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate do no duty was taken from Matth. xxii. 37—40. and Rom. xiii. 8—10. Chriſt mentioning love to God &amp; our neighbour as required in the firſt &amp; ſecond commands, ſays, 'On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.' I thought it hence followed that all required in the law and prophets is love: And that this inference was ſupported and fully aſſerted by Paul, when he ſays 'love is the fulfilling of the law;' and then enumerates a number of commands of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, and ſays, all theſe, and every other command, are briefly comprehended in this ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Therefore, ſince the unregenerate do not love God or their neighbour, they do no part of their duty, nor yield the leaſt true obedience to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y is ſo far from admitting this argument to be concluſive, that he takes much pains to overthrow it, and <hi>ſays</hi> theſe paſſages will prove directly the contrary. His oppoſition to the ſenſe I put upon the words of Chriſt, is grounded on the words Mark mentions, as ſpoken by our Lord with reſpect to theſe two commands, viz. 'There is none other commandment greater than theſe.' He ſays this neceſſarily implies there were <hi>other commands,</hi> beſides thoſe which require love.</p>
               <p>ANS. He has not proved, nor will he ever do it, that theſe words imply there are any other commands. Both may be true, that there is no other command greater than theſe; and that there is no other command which is not comprehended in theſe. If there is no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:012811_0207_0F8ABE71D450D9F8"/>
but theſe imply the whole; then certainly there is none greater. And it appears from comparing the evangeliſts, that our Lord aſſerted both. Firſt, that there is none greater; and ſecondly, that in truth theſe comprehend the whole that is required of man; 'On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.' As if he had ſaid, 'There is no other command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>greater</hi> than theſe; and indeed theſe are the whole of the law and the prophets; all <hi>depend</hi> on theſe, and they compriſe the whole. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is ſaid 'The LORD is greater than all gods.' Exod. xviii. 11. But who ever ſuppoſed this implied that there were other gods beſides JEHOVAH? Or that this expreſſion is inconſiſtent with its being ſaid, 'There is no God beſides me. We know that an idol is nothing in the world?' Both theſe aſſertions are true, though more is aſſerted in the latter, than in the former.</p>
                     <p>He ſays, 'A part of any thing cannot be called another thing than that in which it is contained.' P. 122. ANS. This is a contradiction to his whole ſcheme. For he ſays holineſs is a compound made up of many parts; and that the matter of duty is a part of holineſs; and yet aſſerts, this is <hi>another thing than that in which it is contained,</hi> viz un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs. See p. 4. But it ſeems he has now altered his plan on which he firſt ſet out. <hi>Then</hi> he allowed there was no command that did not require holineſs, and corrected me for ſtating the queſtion as if this was denied. But <hi>now</hi> he is proving there are other commands than thoſe which require holineſs. 'Here I muſt refreſh our author's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which ſeems <hi>(not)</hi> a little to have failed him.'</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>But he further ſays, There is nothing in the expreſſion uſed by our Saviour, 'On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,' that ſo much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that every command in divine revelation really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing but true love. P. 127.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. If there is any command which does not require love, and is not fulfilled by love, it cannot be ſaid to hang or depend on theſe two commands, which require nothing but love. Whatever depends wholly on theſe commands, would be wholly aboliſhed, or ceaſe to be a command, if theſe commands ſhould ceaſe. But if love, and nothing elſe, is the fulfiling of every thing required in the law and the prophets, theſe words are ſuited to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:012811_0208_0F8ABE72932B0738"/>
this. Therefore this is the ſenſe in which they muſt be taken; eſpecially as the ſame thing is aſſerted in other paſſages of ſcripture; and appears every way reaſonable. —When Chriſt ſays, 'Therefore, all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them: For this is the law and the prophets.' Matt. vii. 12. he expreſſes the ſame thing, with reference only to the ſecond command of love to our neighbour. What is here commanded, all grant, is to love our neighbour as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And how is this the law and the prophets; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be that this is the thing inculcated in the law and prophets; ſo that he who comes up to this, does all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in them, ſo far as they reſpect our duty to our neighbour?</p>
               <p>And when Paul ſays, 'If I have no love, <hi>I am nothing,</hi>' 1 Cor. xiii. 2. he expreſſes the ſame thing; for how could this be true, if the law and the prophets were any thing aſide from love? When Chriſt ſays, 'He that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings,' Joh. x<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>v. 24. what could be a more expreſs declaration, that there is no obedience where there is no love? Mr. H—y, in order to ſupport his ſcheme, muſt prove that he who loveth not Chriſt may keep his ſayings. I know that he can eaſily do this, in the way he proves almoſt any thing, by his <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> and <hi>ſenſu diviſo.</hi> But whether he can do it conſiſtently with <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> let them judge who are willing to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. Mr. H—y ſays
<q>The love of God and our neighbour is ſpoken of in ſcripture as a kind of ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the duty of man.</q>
P. 35. He alſo ſays,
<q>We do indeed allow that nothing is required as duty, but what is either implied in the affection of love, or is a fit way of exerciſing and expreſſing it; nothing which may not be conſidered as comprehended in love.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Our author ſays, 'Had our Lord thought that thoſe two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments <hi>contained all,</hi> he would have ſaid, there is no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment <hi>beſides theſe.</hi>' P. 122. He here grants they do in truth contain all; and I conclude he will not deny our Lord <hi>thought</hi> this to be truth. And doubtleſs he expreſſed himſelf perfectly agreeable to this truth, though Mr. H—y thinks it 'a groſs impropriety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> P.
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:012811_0209_0F8ABE7349625BE8"/>
125. In theſe words, I think he grants the whole he is diſputing againſt. For if love is a ſummary of the duty of man, then this comprizes the whole of his duty, and he who does not love, does no duty. And if nothing is required as duty but what is implied in love, or a fit way of expreſſing it, or comprehended in it; then that which does not imply love, and is not an expreſſion of it; is not required, and is no duty.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. The apoſtle's words are ſo plain and expreſs, that they cannot be evaded. He ſays love fulfils the law; which could not be true if the law required any thing beſides love. He enumerates a number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and ſays all theſe, and <hi>every other</hi> command, is comprehended in that, <hi>thou ſhalt love</hi>; therefore love ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fils the law, does all that is commanded.</p>
               <p>I have ſuch an opinion of our author's abilities that I do not think he has pleaſed himſelf in his attempt to evade the force of this paſſage. To me it appears ſo futile and frivolous, as neither to need or deſerve an anſwer. And the boaſting flouriſh he makes in the concluſion, p. 132, ſeems rather to be the effect of the weakneſs of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the contrary. But of this, 'let ſuch as exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their <hi>reaſon</hi> judge.' <note n="*" place="bottom">He ſays, it plainly appears, that there are other duties we owe to our neighbour beſides love, from the apoſtle's own words, 'Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.' Since 'the apoſtle here diſtinguiſhes between rendering to all their due, and loving one another. He compares and <hi>oppoſes</hi> theſe different duties to each other.' P. 130. I believe none ever before heard of duties which <hi>oppoſe</hi> each other. If there are any ſuch, it is certainly impoſſible to do them both at the ſame time; as the one muſt be a holy duty, and its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite a <hi>ſinful</hi> duty. The apoſtle ſays, the command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> is fulfilled by love. If by this we are commanded to pay our juſt debts, then it requires us to owe no man any thing; conſequently this is fulfilled by love. How then can theſe be diſtinguiſhed as <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and oppoſite duties!</hi> This I mention as a ſpecimen of his way of arguing on this head. I think we may borrow his language with propriety here (p. 34) 'Such metaphyſical flights are, I believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of moſt.'</note>

                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:012811_0210_0F8ABE7430638AF0"/>He ſays,
<q>It does not appear that love is ever uſed in ſo extenſive a ſenſe in the ſcriptures, as to include all thoſe acts of external obedience which flow from it.</q>
P. 126.</p>
               <p>ANS. Paul ſays it includes all that is commanded in the divine law, as this is all fulfilled by love; and none, I ſuppoſe, will deny that acts of external obedience are commanded. Yea, he particularly mentions a number of commands requiring external obedience, and expreſsly ſays, love includes all this obedience. And does not John ſpeak of love as including external acts when he ſays, 'Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in truth?' 1 Joh. iii. 18. Is not to <hi>love in deed,</hi> to love in external action, i. e. in doing acts of love and mercy? Again, he ſays, 'This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.' Chap. v. 3.</p>
               <p>As a further evidence that he who does not love, does no duty, nothing that is commanded, I obſerved, that when the people of Iſrael appeared by their openly wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to have no true love to God, they are repreſented as doing nothing that was required of them, while they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the temple ſervice, offered ſacrifices, &amp;c. God calls all their offerings <hi>vain oblations,</hi> and ſays, 'Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? Iſai. i. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. H—y ſays
<q>We have no reaſon to think that their attendance on the externals of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is here called an abomination, and what was not required of them, merely or principally becauſe they were unregenerate.</q>
P. 203.</p>
               <p>ANS. We have reaſon to be certain this was becauſe they appeared to have no love to God or their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and diſcovered themſelves to be his enemies, which is true of all the unregenerate, and of no other.—To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his obſervation, he ſays,
<q>At other times, when the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:012811_0211_0F8ABE74D39B7090"/>
Iſraelites attended the ordinances of divine worſhip, there is no hint that what they did was not required of them, but the contrary, it is repeatedly ſaid <hi>they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commandment of the Lord,</hi> though they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from a principle of true holineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. At theſe other times, they put on the appearance and profeſſion of God's people and ſervants, and were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly holy; for though they were guilty of groſs, open ſins, they profeſſed repentance, and reformed, and were again reſtored to good ſtanding, as in the caſe of making and worſhiping the golden calf. But the people to whom Iſaiah ſpeaks, refuſed to reform, though God had been uſing means with them to this end; therefore <hi>appeared</hi> to be impenitent enemies to God.</p>
               <p>He thinks I have here fallen into a contradiction to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I had ſaid, 'God, in his conduct toward the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael, and in what he ſays of them, acted not as the ſearcher of hearts; but has reſpect only to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance and conduct.' Upon this he obſerves,
<q>It ſo, it was not the want of inward holineſs that was the cauſe why their religious performances are declared to be an abomination, and not required at their hands; but it was the irregularity of their outward behaviour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. God ſpake of them and treated them, as being his friends or his enemies, i. e. regenerate or unregenerate, according as they <hi>appeared</hi> in their external conduct. Their outward behaviour was not an abomination any further than it proceeded from a wicked heart. Their attendance on religious worſhip would not have been repreſented as an abomination, and what God did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them, had they not by their wicked works ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have no love to God, and to be his enemies, i. e. unregenerate. Had Mr. H—y underſtood me, or the text under conſideration, would he have thought of finding a contradiction here?</p>
               <p>But he himſelf does not ſeem to be ſatisfied with what he has yet ſaid; and therefore proceeds to obſerve, that the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:012811_0212_0F8ABE758B185CD0"/>
ſacrifices and offerings which are ſaid not to be required, were free-will offerings, which were not commanded. With theſe they 'overcharged God's altars,' and for this they were reproved.</p>
               <p>ANS. This is a mere conjecture, for which there is not the leaſt foundation in the whole paſſage; but much to the contrary, as any one may ſee who will read it. Would any one think of ſuch an expedient to get rid of the text, were he not driven to a ſtrait?</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y has an anſwer to my other arguments; but as moſt he ſays conſiſts in making and keeping up his favourite diſtinction, between matter of duty, &amp; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, end and deſign; and duty in a <hi>compound ſenſe,</hi> and in a <hi>divided ſenſe</hi>; which diſtinctions are, I think, at beſt unintelligible, and tend to darken, rather than give light to the ſubject: And if this were not true, they are not to the purpoſe, if ſelf-love is oppoſed to duty, as has been obſerved: I ſay, ſince this is the caſe, I ſhall not trouble myſelf or the reader with a particular reply; concluding that every one who will attend, will ſee that what I have ſaid is a full reply to all he has offered in anſwer to theſe arguments.</p>

               <p>HE ſays,
<q>I agree with our author that the inability of the unregenerate is a ſinful defect, nor have I the remoteſt view or deſire to weaken the foundation of this important truth, but rather to confirm it.</q>
P. 82. I have no diſpoſition to call in queſtion his ſincerity in this declaration; but I muſt take leave to think, however, that he has not made it underſtandingly, and is ſo far
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:012811_0213_0F8ABE764A5AECB8"/>
from <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> this important truth, that he has not only <hi>weakened</hi> the foundation of it, but taken it wholly away, if what he advances be juſt. Did it not appear in this light, it would not in the leaſt affect the matter in diſpute between us; nor ſhould I think it worth while to take any notice of it, in any other view. And it is difficult, yea impoſſible, to conceive how he ſhould think his repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this matter was any thing to his purpoſe; and that he ſhould make the uſe of it he does, through his whole book, unleſs he thought the inability of the unregenerate did excuſe them, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, from obligations to holy exerciſes, and rendered them leſs ſinful than if they were not the ſubjects of this defect. <note n="*" place="bottom">He indeed declares he cannot tell or conceive, how or why this ſhould be a ſinful defect; and that the unregenerate ſhould, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their inability, be held bound to do the duty they are unable to do, 'is a point attended with <hi>vaſt difficulty</hi>; and is perhaps the Gordian knot in revealed religion.' However, ſince God in his word declares it to be ſo, his faith <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> reſts ſatisfied upon this teſtimony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to ſee through thoſe difficulties.' P. 29, 30. If this declaration is not, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, oppoſed to that mentioned above, I am much miſtaken. And how he, or any one elſe, can, in this view and ſenſe of this matter, <hi>feel</hi> guilty, and juſtly condemned to deſtruction, for not obeying God's law perfectly; and heartily repent, of all ſuch defect, as utterly vile and inexcuſable, is quite inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But of this more hereafter.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He ſays, the unregenerate are under a <hi>natural inability</hi> to embrace the goſpel and be holy, in diſtinction from a moral inability, it being much more properly called <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> than a <hi>moral.</hi> That it is an inability of a different kind from that which conſiſts only in the want of a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs to do a thing, or oppoſition of will to it, when this may be removed without putting any new principle into the heart; as in the caſe of the reformation of a profligate: Though he is now unwilling to reform, he may be made willing by perſuaſion, applying to the principles which he now acts from. Whereas the unregenerate muſt have <hi>a new principle</hi> put into their heart, in order to their loving God, embracing the goſpel, &amp;c. and their inability con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in their want of this principle, and not properly in
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012811_0214_0F8ABF8008EACE70"/>
the want of a will, and the oppoſition of their heart to holineſs. See p. 10—30.</p>
               <p>I take leave to make the following obſervations upon this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſult common ſenſe, and the ſentiments and feelings of mankind in general, we ſhall find they make no ſuch diſtinction between want of a principle or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which they are prepared and prompted to will and do any thing, and their unwillingneſs, or oppoſition of will to it. If perſons have natural capacity for any thing which is looked upon in itſelf right and reaſonable, and nothing is wanting but a will, or a compliance of heart, they are always looked upon bound to do it, or to have ſuch a will and choice; and wholly inexcuſable for all defects of this kind. And the further they are from ſuch a choice, and from having any thing in their mind that will be influenced by the motives ſet before them, the more they are blamed. Nor are mankind wont to form any notion of two different kinds of difficulty or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability in ſuch caſes; one conſiſting in not being willing, while there is a promptitude, or an habitual readineſs to will, or a good principle; the other in being wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any principle or promptitude to the thing propoſed. But when the difficulty lies not in the want of a will, but is ſuch as can not be removed by any good inclination or choice, and is conſiſtent with having a good will, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looked upon to be of quite a different kind, and oppoſite to the other, as it wholly excuſes a perſon, ſo far as he is under this inability. Therefore to call them by the ſame name, would be highly improper, and contrary to common ſenſe. <note n="†" place="bottom">He ſays this inability 'is termed by divines, and has not unfitly been called <hi>Ethico-phyſical.</hi>' P. 78, 80. But he has given no inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this hard name, as he has not attempted to explain it. He will not ſurely pretend it is more ſcriptural or intelligible than the word <hi>moral.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We do not find the leaſt hint of any ſuch diſtinction in divine revelation; but this matter is there repreſented agreeable to the common notions and ſenſe of mankind.
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:012811_0215_0F8ABF80A104A6E8"/>
There, as he allows, the unregenerate are repreſented as being as much bound to perfect holineſs, as others. Every thing is required of them, that is required of others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the leaſt allowance for any inability they are under: Which could not be, if they were under any <hi>natural</hi> inability to holineſs; or if any thing was wanting but a willing heart.</p>
               <p>And the ſcripture repreſents the wicked as under no kind of inability to repent, obey God and embrace the goſpel, different from that which they are under to do the common actions of life, when their hearts are oppoſed to them. Therefore their readineſs to do the latter, is often mentioned to ſhew their utter inexcuſableneſs and crime in oppoſition of heart to the former. God ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jews, the Rechabites obedience to the command of their father, to illuſtrate and convince them of their great and inexcuſable folly and wickedneſs in not obeying him. Jer. xxxv. And our Lord ſays to them, 'the Queen of the ſouth ſhall riſe in judgment with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and condemn them; for ſhe came from the utmoſt parts of the earth to hear the wiſdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.' 'Ye hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the ſky, and of the earth: But how is it, that ye do not diſcern this time? Luk. xi. 31. xii. 56. If they were under a different kind of inability to obey God, repent and believe the goſpel, from that which men are under to obey men, &amp;c. when they have no will to it, how could theſe ſimilitudes and repreſentations be juſt? Might not they who were reproved juſtly reply? 'The caſes are not ſimilar, the Rechabites had natural principles which being applied to, they might be induced to obey their father: And the Queen of the ſouth acted from principles ſhe had: And men diſcern the face of the ſky, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any new principles given to them. But we are wholly without any principles by which we can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſpiritual things and obey the goſpel, which muſt firſt be implanted in us before we can feel any motive to this.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012811_0216_0F8ABF814A23B7E8"/>
                  <hi>They</hi> needed nothing but a will, in order to do theſe things; but <hi>we</hi> want a <hi>power</hi> to repent, &amp;c. being under a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> inability. Were it not for this, we would as readily believe and embrace the goſpel, as men purſue the affairs of this world.' <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. H—y ſays, to repreſent the inability the unregenerate are under to holineſs, as conſiſting in nothing but the want of a will; or to be of the ſame kind with that which conſiſts only in the want of a will, when they have principles in their hearts, by application to which they may be made willing, is contrary to the language of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: That 'the inſpired writers aſſert not only the want of a will, but of power to that which is holy,' which is denoted by <hi>cannot.</hi> Chriſt ſays 'no man <hi>can come</hi> to me.' And he does not remember that the mere want of willingneſs is ever ſignified by ſuch words. P. 20.</p>
                     <p>ANS. Peter and John ſaid, 'We <hi>cannot</hi> but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard,' when they mean nothing more than want of will, or the oppoſition of their will to the contrary. Solomon ſpeaks of men to whom God hath given riches, &amp;c. but hath not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them <hi>power to eat thereof,</hi> meaning by want of power, nothing but want of a will. If he had <hi>remembered</hi> ſuch paſſages as theſe, he muſt have been ſenſible that it is agreeable to the language of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſpeak of want of a will, and want of power, as the ſame thing; and that <hi>cannot</hi> means no more than a ſtrong and fixed oppoſition of will to a thing, when nothing is wanting but the conſent of the heart. The ſcripture conſtantly ſpeaks of ſinner's deſtruction as owing to their <hi>will,</hi> or not willing. 'Way WILL ye die!' 'Whoſoever <hi>will</hi> let him come.'</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As Mr. H—y grounds all he ſays, on this head, on the ſuppoſition that there is a holy <hi>principle,</hi> diſtinct from all <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the heart, and neceſſary in order to all holy acts of the will, and the cauſe or ground of them; and that unregeneracy, and the inabiliy of ſinners to holy acts of will, conſiſt wholly in the want of this inactive, dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, holy principle; he ought to have offered ſome proof of this, on which his argument wholly turns, and which he has taken for granted. Though we ſhould not dare to deny this doctrine of <hi>principle,</hi> we muſt not be blamed for not admitting the force of an argument, which is built wholly on this, without ſome poſitive proof
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:012811_0217_0F8ABF820B5FED20"/>
of the exiſtence of ſuch principle, which he has not yet produced. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Perhaps it will be thought he has proved the neceſſity of ſuch a principle in order to holy acts in the following words. 'The words <hi>power</hi> and <hi>inability,</hi> have relation to acts. And in order of nature, power is neceſſary in order to all acts flowing from it; even as the cauſe is neceſſary prior to the effect. To talk of power or inability, whether natural or moral, in any other ſenſe, is <hi>unintelligible jargon.</hi>' P. 17. In anſwer to this, and all he ſays about <hi>power,</hi> I refer him and the reader to Mr. Weſt's late <hi>eſſay on moral agency,</hi> ſect. ii. Perhaps when he has well conſidered this, he will give his own 'talk of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er' as hard an epithet as he has here uſed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems to be impoſſible to have any conception of ſuch a principle: And we ſeem to run into contradictions, in our attempts to deſcribe it. Thus he ſpeaks of it as that by which the mind is <hi>biaſſed</hi> to act wiſely; and he calls it a <hi>propenſity</hi> and <hi>promptitude</hi> to holy action and the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it. P. 22, 23, 24, &amp;c. At the ſame time it is to be diſtinguiſhed from all acts or exerciſes of the mind, as being perfectly inactive. But how that which does not act, can be the cauſe of action; and how there can be propenſity and promptitude to act, while there is not the leaſt activity, or inclination one way or the other, cannot be told, it is likely, by any divine or philoſopher; and will, after all that can be ſaid, <hi>look</hi> like a contradiction.</p>
               <p>And if the holy ſcripture, when examined with this view, ſhall be found wholly ſilent about this principle, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being there ſaid that expreſſes or implies any ſuch thing, it is thought it will be difficult to find any good medium of proof.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am ſenſible I ſhall, by calling in queſtion Mr. H—y's doctrine about principle, expoſe myſelf to his cenſure, as denying original righhteouſneſs and ſin. See p. 33, 34. But if it cannot be proved to be inconſiſtent with ſcripture and reaſon, to believe that Adam's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs <hi>firſt began</hi> in holy exerciſe: And that corrupt exerciſes take place in his children, as ſoon as they exiſt as his poſterity, <hi>of the ſame nature</hi> with thoſe which took place in him, when he firſt ſinned, though differing in circumſtances; he will not be able to ſupport his charge.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. H—y's account of the nature and kind of man's natural inability to exerciſe holineſs, and embrace the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:012811_0218_0F8ABF82CAD6DB48"/>
is not conſiſtent with his being under any obligations to this, or in the leaſt blamable for not being holy. How can he be obliged to do that which he is under a natural inability to do; which defect is not properly a want of will, or oppoſition of will to holineſs; but is what the will has no concern in? He ſays 'tis moſt properly called natural inability. That 'tis blamable becauſe man has brought this inability on himſelf by his ſin; i. e. Adam had abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be holy, but loſt it for himſelf and his children: And becauſe he had it, and loſt it, <hi>they</hi> ought to have it, and are now as much to blame for not being holy, as if they had this natural power. But it is impoſſible to reconcile the reaſon of a man to this, or to make him feel himſelf blamable for not doing that for which he has no natural power, even though Adam, or he himſelf, once had it. All the blame there can be in this caſe, lies in doing that by which this power was loſt, and not in not being holy, after he loſt his natural power to be ſo. Mr. H—y owns he can't account for it, that it ſhould be ſo, and ſpeaks of it as one of the greateſt myſteries in all the bible; but thinks he is obliged to believe it, becauſe it is revealed. But this is a myſtery of his own making. Bleſſed be God! there is no ſuch thing revealed in the bible. Men are there blamed only for that which natural conſcience will make them feel they are wholly blamable for, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly awakened. And there is no myſtery in it: Perſons of the loweſt capacity, and children, may underſtand it, condemn themſelves and repent. But a perſon never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of neglect of that which he thinks he had no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power to do, and while he can have no conception how or why he ſhould be blamable. While he views things in this light, and his heart is anſwerable to his ſpeculations, he will not, he cannot, <hi>feel</hi> himſelf guilty, even though he thinks divine revelation declares him to be ſo, and he <hi>ſays</hi> he therefore believes it.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>Our author will perhaps think this an uncharitable cenſure of him. It would be ſo, I confeſs, if his heart neceſſarily agreed with his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as his heart may be, in this reſpect, better than his head, nothing is cenſured but his doctrine.</p>
                     <p>This leads me to take notice of a remarkable inſtance of my <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs,</hi> mentioned by him, p. 215, &amp;c. I had ſaid in my reply to Mr. Mills,
<q>The only reaſon, I conceive, why any have run into this notion of God's appointing duties to the unregenerate, to be done by them while ſuch, and have not rather been ſhocked at it, is, that they look on them as in ſome meaſure, at leaſt, excuſable for not loving God and embracing the goſpel; this being above their power, and what they cannot do while unregenerate.</q>
And I had before publiſhed a ſermon, in which I ſaid, They who have not been brought to ſee and <hi>feel</hi> themſelves wholly inexcuſable for not being perfectly holy, have not been convinced of ſin, as God's people are. Theſe two paſſages put together, he ſays, condemn all without exception as unconverted, who think God has appointed duties to be done by the unregenerate, while ſuch.</p>
                     <p>ANS. In my ſermon I addreſs myſelf to my hearers in a uſe of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, deſiring them to conſider what are the exerciſes and feelings of their own hearts; whether they have been brought to feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to blame for the neglect of every thing God's law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; or whether they are wont to excuſe themſelves, as not wholly blamable? And I repreſent the former, not the latter, the character of the Chriſtian.—In my reply, I am not attending to a perſon's ſenſe and feelings of heart of his own blamableneſs for not loving God, &amp;c. but the views he has of others in a ſtate of unregeneracy. He may, by the influence of education, &amp;c. imbibe wrong notions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the blamableneſs of the unregenerate, and hold principles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their being in the leaſt blamable for not being holy; and be led by this to think and talk of the unregenerate, as in ſome meaſure excuſable for not loving God, &amp;c. And yet, when he conſults his own heart, and his views and exerciſes with reſpect to himſelf, may find be has no excuſe <hi>for himſelf,</hi> that he is not perfectly holy. This, I <hi>charitably</hi> believe, is the caſe in many inſtances; and in how many, I don't pretend to ſay. I hope therefore to be acquitted from the charge Mr. H—y has laid againſt me here, of the 'uncharitable judgment expreſſed concerning all differing from me in ſentiments on this point,' of which he ſays, '<hi>I do not remember ever to have met with ſo hard and extenſive a cenſure.</hi>' And adds, 'This is a ſample of the ſpirit he ſhews towards <hi>all</hi> differing from his opinion. The lump is <hi>thoroughly fermented</hi> with the ſame <hi>ſour leaven.</hi>' Hard, ſevere, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cenſure! Not of my ſentiments, but of my <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſays, 'That there are ſome who hold to this notion on reaſons different from what is here aſſigned, he may now inform himſelf.' Where ſhall I go for information? Not to Mr. H—y; for he declares he cannot ſee how the unregenerate are blamable for not loving God; as they <hi>cannot,</hi> being under a natural inability: Of which ſentiment he makes great uſe through his whole book.</p>
                     <p>He does not conclude his note without expreſſing <hi>his charity,</hi> as a contraſt to <hi>my uncharitableneſs,</hi> in the following words;
<q>I can ſay, with ſincerity concerning him, (though he may hereafter twit me with it, as he has done by Mr. Mills, in the like caſe) <hi>I charitably hope that he is a true ſervant of Chriſt:</hi> Though I muſt add, that Chriſtians would regard him with more complacency, if his diſcourſes favoured more of that meekneſs of wiſdom, recommended by the apoſtle. <hi>I may not imitate him in his hard cenſures, for I fear God.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I hope I ſhall be acquitted from this charge of <hi>hard cenſures</hi> by the reader; or, at leaſt, that what I have ſaid will not be looked upon to be inconſiſtent with my having the fear of God before my eyes, though Mr. H—y, it ſeems, thinks it to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>The following obſervations offer themſelves upon reading this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.—<hi>A true ſervant of Chriſt, who does not fear God,</hi> if this were poſſible, is not a character very honorable to him or his maſter. If it is a <hi>hard cenſure</hi> to rank a perſon among thoſe who do not fear God, and ſuch cenſures are inconſiſtent with fearing God; then Mr. H—y, while he is expreſſing his charity, does pronounce a hard cenſure on him towards whom he is ſo charitable; and while he is declaring that he fears God, is doing that which he at the ſame time intimates is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it.—But all this is left to the reader, wiſhing there had been no occaſion for any thing which is in ſuch a degree perſonal.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge myſelf greatly defective in meekneſs of wiſdom, and doubt not my diſcourſes would favour more of this, had I more of it. Where this defect appears, or that which is contrary to wiſdom and humility, as it doubtleſs does, in ſome inſtances at leaſt, I aſk the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and forgiveneſs of the offended, Chriſtian reader. With how much <hi>meekneſs of wiſdom</hi> Mr. H—y has corrected <hi>my pride,</hi> I cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully leave to every reader's judgment, as others are better judges of this, than I am, and this ſaves me the trouble of remarking on any thing of this kind; and if I ſhould, different readers will, after all, judge differently: And the point in diſpute turns not at all upon this.</p>

on the will, is oppoſed to his ſcheme, attempts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this great author. P. 11—22.</p>
               <p>He profeſſes to give Mr. Edwards's definition of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral inability; but has not done it fairly. He ſays the firſt is defined to be
<q>An inability to do a thing, becauſe what is moſt commonly called nature, does not allow of it, or becauſe of ſome defect or obſtacle that is extrinſic to the will,</q>
&amp;c. This he can't underſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is 'utterly at a loſs what is commonly called <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>;
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:012811_0221_0F8ABE7052533538"/>
a word which is obſerved by a philoſopher to bear about a dozen different ſignifications.' If, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting his philoſopher, he had read the page preceding Mr. Edward's definition, where he particularly ſhews what is commonly meant by nature, he could have been at no loſs about the meaning. This looks like perfect quibbling. Beſides, he has left out of the definition, the words of Mr. Edwards, which are moſt plain, and ſerve to fix the meaning beyond diſpute. Mr. Edwards's words are 'We are ſaid to be <hi>naturally</hi> unable to do any thing, <hi>when we can't do it if we will,</hi> becauſe what is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called nature don't allow of it, &amp;c. i. e. when the difficulty don't lie in the heart or will, but in ſomething elſe; ſo that if there was a willing mind, the difficulty would not be removed. What can be plainer than this? And as plain is the following definition of moral inability. 'It conſiſts in the oppoſition or want of inclination,' i e. all the difficulty or inability lies in this, and nothing is wanting but a willing mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. H—y accuſes Mr. Edwards of reaſoning about moral impotency in a <hi>dark manner</hi>; but I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no more need be ſaid, in order to the judicious reader's having full evidence, that the darkneſs lies wholly with him, and that his inability to underſtand Mr. Edwards is of the <hi>moral</hi> kind; therefore think it needleſs to attempt a more particular anſwer.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Our author's treatment of what Mr. Edwards ſays on this head, leads me to take notice of ſomething of the ſame kind in his remarks on a paſſage in my ſermon on Rom. vii 7. p. 6. I had ſaid,
<q>The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a legiſlator is exerciſed and expreſſed in the threatening to the diſobedient, and cannot poſſibly be expreſſed in any thing elſe, or any other way.</q>
And in the next paragraph ſay,
<q>The authority of a law lies wholly in the threatening, <hi>or appears and is expreſſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that,</hi> as has been juſt obſerved.</q>
Mr. H—y, to anſwer his end the better, puts together part of two ſentences, taken from two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent paragraphs; and then underſtands the words, 'The authority of a law <hi>lies</hi> wholly in the threatening' as meaning, 'that the threatening of the law is all that obliges the ſubject to obedience; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the threatened puniſhment could be avoided, it would no longer be our duty to obey the law.' And this, he ſays 'is indeed groſs hobbiſm; the very dregs of antinomianiſm.' P. 31, 32.</p>
                     <p>When I ſay, 'The authority of a law lies wholly in the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>or appears and is expreſſed</hi> only in that,' I meant by the laſt part of the ſentence to explain the former, and expreſs the ſame thing in other words. However inaccurate the expreſſion may be, I believe no intelligent, candid reader, who attends to the whole paſſage, will be likely to miſtake my meaning, viz. that the authority of a legiſlator <hi>appears</hi> and <hi>is expreſſed,</hi> in his law, in the threatening only.—But he diſputes this too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſays, 'Nor is it true that the authority of the law <hi>appears only</hi> in the threatening.' His reaſon is, 'For then the moſt unrighteous laws may appear to have as much authority, or right to command obedience, as any.'</p>
                     <p>ANS, What I aſſert is, that the authority of a legiſlator cannot be expreſſed and appear <hi>in his law,</hi> unleſs there be a threatening to the diſobedient. I grant that unrighteous laws may have this appearance and expreſſion of authority: But it does not follow from this, that there is any other way to <hi>expreſs</hi> authority <hi>in a law.</hi> He who has authority to make a law, muſt expreſs it in the ſame way in his law; yet there are mediums aſide from the law, in itſelf conſidered, by which it may be known whether this expreſſion and appearance of authority, in a law, is according to truth or not.</p>
                     <p>He ſays, 'The authority of a lawgiver conſiſts in his right to require obedience <hi>under penalty.</hi>' I aſk, how this right, to require obedience under penalty, can be expreſſed in a law which has no penalty, or does not require obedience under penalty? When this queſtion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, it will perhaps appear that he has not granted all I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION V.</hi> On the evil tendency of Mr. Hemmenway's Book.</head>
               <p>MR. H—y has waved the mention of 'the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequences' which appeared to him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from my doctrine; becauſe it might look too much like uncharitableneſs to dwell on theſe things.' P. 202. But it may be queſtioned whether his charity, in this inſtance, is according to knowledge. Charity is indeed tender of the perſon, character, eaſe &amp; happineſs of every man; but it loves the truth ſo well, and is ſo friendly to
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:012811_0223_0F8ABF8815979680"/>
the general good, that when any one publiſhes ſentiments contrary to important truth, and of a fatal tendency to the ſouls of men, it will do its utmoſt to detect the error, point out the danger and evil tendency of it, and give warning to all, how much ſoever the author's performance and character may ſuffer by it. Not to do this, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and cruel. I ſhall therefore think I am obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voice of charity itſelf, in the attempt I am now entering upon. But before I proceed, I give notice that I deſign not the leaſt intimation that Mr. H—y ſaw the evil tendency of his ſcheme, or would deſire to promote what I think is the unavoidable conſequence of it. But this is ſo far from being a reaſon for ſilence on this head, that it offers a ſufficient motive to attempt to open his eyes, and the eyes of all others, who are as far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the danger, as the author.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I think what he has ſaid tends to keep out of ſight, and hide from men, their real ſinfulneſs and guilt; and therefore oppoſes one great end of the gift of the holy ſpirit, viz. to reprove or convince the world of ſin, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to underſtand and embrace the goſpel.</p>
               <p>He inſiſts 'That ſin conſiſts formally and eſſentially in defect or privation.' P. 8. That this defect, or want of holy principles, is the true cauſe of the ſinfulneſs of men's actions. P. 64. 'The corruption of human nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts eſſentially and radically in a defect or privation of a principle of true holineſs. P. 83. <note n="*" place="bottom">If ſin conſiſts originally and eſſentially in defect, and this defect is the cauſe of the ſinfulneſs of men's actions; then this defect was the cauſe of Adam's firſt ſin. I aſk, by what means did this defect take place in Adam? Not by his ſin; for this defect was the cauſe of his ſin. But he gives a different account of Adam's ſin elſewhere. P. 27, 28. According to him, it conſiſted in a <hi>voluntary act,</hi> by which he caſt away the perfection and glory of his nature, and 'the habit or principle of righteouſneſs was loſt,' and a uſurper was placed on the throne. No ſinful defect in his nature, or privation of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holineſs could be the cauſe of this poſitive, ſinful act, becauſe this act was the cauſe of this defect, and the loſs of the perfection of his nature. And this was a ſtrange <hi>uſurper,</hi> if it was only negative, a defect or privation, that is, <hi>nothing.</hi> I think he ought to have given a more clear and conſiſtent account of that ſinfulneſs which conſiſts wholly in defect and privation (which I take to be the ſame with its conſiſting in nothing at all) and is the cauſe of the ſinfulneſs of men's actions, before he had made ſuch great uſe of it as he does in ſupport of his ſcheme.</note> He ſays, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and exerciſes which are naturally found with men, are not in themſelves ſinful, but the ſin conſiſts in the want of ſomething elſe or their corruption conſiſts in not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupernatural principles joined with them. That ſelf-love,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:012811_0224_0F8ABF88DF2EB638"/>
love, is innocent and good in itſelf, and men never love their own ſelves too much, or in too high a degree; <note n="§" place="bottom">Our author ſays,
<q>No action is the worſe for being intereſted, or or the better for being diſintereſted. Diſintereſted miſchievouſneſs imports the utmoſt wickedneſs. And it was no ways derogatory to our Saviour's ſubmiſſion to the will of God in his ſufferings, that he endured the croſs for the joy that was ſet before him.</q>
P. 98. Theſe are three as remarkable ſentences, perhaps, as were ever put together. Nothing can be more contrary to truth and holineſs than the firſt. The ſecond ſuppoſes what is impoſſible. And ſo does the laſt; and is moſt diſhonorable to our ſaviour, if his pleaſing not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; his diſintereſted love, was excellent &amp; honorable. For this, the reader is refered to the preceding inquiry; eſpecially, p. 28—31.</note> and 'the viciouſneſs of ſelfiſhneſs conſiſts <hi>not at all</hi> in the love of ourſelves;—but <hi>wholly</hi> in the excluſion of love to others.' It is never in any degree ſinful, unleſs when want of love to others has influence in men's actions.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. H—y ſays,
<q>It may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>methaphyſics,</hi> that a defect or privation ſhould be ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of as a formal principle, which has an influence in it's kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an action.</q>
P. 71. If he can by his <hi>metaphyſics</hi> prove this, he will at the ſame time prove what has been often aſſerted, viz. that men by metaphyſics can prove any thing, even the groſſeſt contradictions, to be true. He adds, what all his readers will doubtleſs believe, 'To open this matter <hi>fully</hi> would carry us <hi>too great a length</hi> into ſome <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe diſquiſitions.</hi>'</note> i, e. When a man is induced by ſelf-love to 'do that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own intereſt which is <hi>in his apprehenſion</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the intereſt of others.' So that if a man has no <hi>deſign</hi> to injure others, to anſwer his own ends, &amp; does the matter of duty, his ſelf-love and all he does is as innocent 'as the action of a ſucking infant that reaches earneſtly for the breaſt.' P. 71, 95, 96. Therefore all that men are blamable for, is want of a principle of love to God and their neighbour. And this being a natural defect,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:012811_0225_0F8ABF89A09022C8"/>
and they under a natural inability, independent of their will &amp; choice, to act from higher principles, &amp; love God, &amp;c. their ſinfulneſs does not lie in this defect, in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſidered, or in any of their neglects or doings; but in their looſing their power in Adam: For, according to him, if Adam had not poſſeſſed this ſuperior principle &amp; power, &amp; caſt it away by his voluntary act, his children could not be under the leaſt obligation to holineſs. But that men ſhould now be bound to love God and be perfectly holy, when they have no principles, or natural power to do this, merely becauſe Adam had them, &amp; caſt them away, he ſays, is the moſt difficult to be underſtood &amp; accounted for, of any thing contained in the bible; and if it is believed, it muſt be merely becauſe 'tis revealed, and not from any inward conſciouſneſs we have of our ſinfulneſs and blame, from any inward ſenſe or feeling, or from our ſeeing the reaſon of it; for theſe unitedly declare, under all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble convictions of conſcience and illuminations of the mind, there is no ſinfulneſs in that, in which <hi>all</hi> ſinfulneſs and blame do conſiſt, if they are to be found in man.</p>
               <p>This ſcheme ot our author does almoſt, if not wholly, exclude ſin and blame from man, in his preſent ſtate. He whoſe heart is formed on this plan, will feel himſelf in a great meaſure innocent, and have little ſin to confeſs and repent of. This is very agreeable to unſubdued, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, ſecure ſinners, &amp; anſwers to their views &amp; feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp; the very ſcheme they naturally fall into, to excuſe and juſtify themſelves. But when the law comes, ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives, and they die. They find that <hi>every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts is only evil continually.</hi> That they are <hi>abominable and filthy, drinking in iniquity like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>—That <hi>their heart is deceitful above all things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately wicked—Their throat is an open ſepulchre; with

their tongues they have uſed deceit; the poiſon of aſps is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lips; their mouth full of curſing and bitterneſs: Their feet ſwift to ſhed blood; being abominable and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and unto every good work reprobate</hi>; and their heart full of <hi>enmity againſt God.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God.</hi> This ſeems to be a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult text with Mr. H—y; and no wonder, ſince it is oppoſed to his whole ſcheme. He refers to it, p. 20, and there underſtands it as meaning a ſtate of unregeneracy, or depraved nature. But in expreſs contradiction to this, in p. 97, he ſays, 'That which is here called en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is not the carnal heart or depraved nature; but the actual exerciſe of the heart as depraved.' And here, I think, he runs into another inconſiſtence. He ſays, p. 95, 96, the exerciſes of ſelf-love, in the unregenerate ſinner, in which 'his deſign is not to hurt others, but to advantage himſelf, can, with no propriety, be called exerciſes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God or man; the action of a ſucking infant, that reaches ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the breaſt, might as properly be called an exerciſe of enmity to being in general.' And yet in the next page he allows the 'exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and actings of natural principles, as corrupted by ſin, are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the law of God, and ſo are <hi>conſtructively, at leaſt,</hi> enmity againſt God, <hi>ſince</hi> they are at beſt deſtitute of that rectitude and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of principle and end which the law requires.' Thus that which in one page is perfectly innocent, and cannot be enmity to God, is in the next page conſtructive enmity at leaſt. But no one has any reaſon to be frighted with this <hi>conſtructive enmity</hi>; for he goes on to ſay, 'It does not conſiſt in exerciſe, but in <hi>privation</hi> of right principles and ends in acting. Take this exerciſe of the natural principle entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away, and the ſinfulneſs of the perſon remains undiminiſhed.' So the enmity of the carnal mind turns out a mere nonentity at laſt; ſuch enmity as a beaſt or tree may have.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is doubtleſs impoſſible to reconcile this ſcriptural repreſentation of man's ſinfulneſs, with Mr. H—y's ſcheme. Indeed, he has, through his whole book, kept the ſinfulneſs and guilt of man very much out of ſight; and the whole is ſuited to ſooth and pleaſe the impenitent, unconvinced ſinner; and is oppoſed to that conviction of ſin and humiliation which are implied in a man's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his true ſtate and character, and neceſſary in order to embracing the goſpel. <note n="‡" place="bottom">It is probable Mr. H—y did not view his own ſcheme in the light in which I have here ſet it. And if he ſhould think I have made a repreſentation injurious to him, I can only appeal to his book, and ſay I have been careful not to miſrepreſent any thing, and really think the judicious reader of what he has wrote, will ſee much more oppoſed to a proper conviction of ſin, than I have mentioned. And ſince I have not injured him, <hi>in my own apprehenſion,</hi> he muſt, I think, on his own principles, conſider me as quite innocent.</note>

                  <pb n="219" facs="unknown:012811_0227_0F8ABF8D8A05D778"/>II. Mr. H—y's book tends to give ſinners eaſe ſhort of Chriſt; to prevent that humiliation which is implied in embracing the goſpel; and flatter and confirm them in that ſelf-righteous way, which is moſt pleaſing to their hearts, and in which we have reaſon to fear mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes are periſhing.</p>
               <p>This appears from what has been juſt obſerved of his hiding from the ſinner his true ſinfulneſs and guilt: For nothing will humble the ſinner, and ſtrip him of his confidence in himſelf, and his ſelf-righteous pleas and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and bring him to feel the utterly helpleſs, loſt ſtate he is in, while his true ſinfulneſs &amp; guilt are hid from his eyes. But our author does more than this. He tells the awakened ſinner, he is not wholly a rebel and an enemy to God; but is obeying him, and doing his duty in ſome meaſure, by which he obtains God's approbation and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable notice. This is what the ſinner, when he is firſt awakened, deſires above all things; and ſo long as his heart does not fail him here, he will take courage in his oppoſition to Chriſt, in attempting to obtain a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own. And nothing will drive him from this refuge of lies, this ſelf-righteous bottom, but a conviction that he is ſo far from doing duty, and obeying God, that he is continually, with his whole heart, oppoſing God and the goſpel, and that he never ſhall do any duty, till his heart is ſubdued, and he is willing to embrace the goſpel. This is the voice of ſcripture and reaſon. And for the truth of it, I might appeal to the generation of God's people. How many are there to witneſs, that ſo long as they could flatter themſelves they were doing duty, they had eaſe and ſelf-confidence. But while they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting in this way to ſave themſelves, they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and confounded: Their ſinfulneſs was ſo brought

into view, that their hearts failed them, and they ſaw they were not obedient, but rebels in all their exerciſes and doings, <hi>ſin revived and they died.</hi> And how many are there, who have never come to this conviction; but are going on, as they think, in the way of duty, doing all they <hi>can,</hi> or what they have a <hi>next power</hi> to do, <hi>compaſſing themſelves about with ſparks that they have kindled!</hi> Theſe will be greatly comforted and ſtrengthened by what Mr. H—y has wrote.</p>
               <p>In the ſcripture, a different method is taken with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Our author has not, I think, found one exhortation there to any duty ſhort of faith and repentance, after all his ſearch and attempts; nor one word that implies that the unbeliever does any duty: But there is much there to the contrary. They who are not turned to God, are not ſpoken of as <hi>obeying and doing duty</hi>; but are treated as wholly rebels, altogether <hi>diſobedient.</hi> 'To turn the <hi>diſobedient</hi> to the wiſdom of the juſt.' Luk. i. 17. '<hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience.</hi>' Eph. ii. 2. 'Being abominable and <hi>diſobedient,</hi> and unto <hi>every good work reprobate. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,</hi> ſerving divers luſts, living in malice and envy, hateful, &amp; hating one another. Tit. i. 16. ii. 3. I therefore think I have warrant to ſay, in my turn, 'If he could have ſubmitted his reaſonings to the wiſdom of God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſciptures, great part of his peformances would never have ſeen the light.' P. 148.</p>
               <p>It is to be wiſhed and hoped, however, that what he has wrote, and all theſe diſputes, though in themſelves diſagreeable, will be the means of detecting hurtful error; and diſcovering the true character of ſinners, given in the holy ſcripture, and the way of treating with them, there pointed out. So far as this ſhall come to paſs, <hi>man</hi> will be abaſed, and God alone will be exalted, and have all the glory.</p>
