            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Again, whereas they blame him for <hi>Seperating from Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>: By this it plainly appeareth that they own such to be their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are guilty of denying and opposing <hi>Faith in the Man C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And whereas they say, <hi>He ought to have stated the Difference and sent it to</hi> London: He did write to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and Friends at <hi>London,</hi> and had their answer, approving this Doctrine, before he printed any thing, &amp; yet this prevailed nothing. But <hi>G. K.</hi> did not write to them as having any uncertainty or doubt in himself of the truth of the Doctrine asserted by him, nor was he free to submit so great a matter of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> by way of <hi>Absolute Submission,</hi> to any man or number of man, as <hi>Whether Christ without us was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, as well as Christ within us, as necessary to our Salvation?</hi> for things of that nature are not to be submitted, by way of <hi>Absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> to the best of men, it contradicteth our antient Principle, <hi>viz. That the Spirit in each particular is the Rule of Faith and Doctrine.</hi> But <hi>G. K.</hi> did never refuse to appeal or submit to the Spirit of Truth in any of his faithful Friends in <hi>Old-England</hi> or any where else, but prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it, and was refused, not doubting their unity with him in this weighty matter, but because it is so <hi>unquestionable a Truth</hi> among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, That Christ without is as necessary to be believed in for our Salvation, as that God in Heaven is to be believed in</hi>; therefore he thought it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to concern his faithful Friends to seek their assistance to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that which all <hi>Christendom</hi> grants in words, and none but the greatest <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> dare deny.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obser.</hi> 6<hi>ly.</hi> That both on the first day before in the publick Meeting, and in the evening before this Meeting <hi>G. K.</hi> gave <hi>T. E.</hi> and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions a faithful account how <hi>John Delavall</hi> had accused him of being <hi>guilty of Heresie and Error in a Fundamental Doctrine,</hi> for asserting that <hi>the Light within is not sufficient without some-what else:</hi> thereby excluding the Man Christ Jesus without us.</p>
            <p>Now after this, which T. E. could not but be sensible of, for him to say in such a great Auditory, <hi>That he had made enquiry, and found his Brethren sound in the Faith, and these things in our printed Books were Lyes and Calumnies,</hi> bewrayeth his great weakness in this, as Folly and Rashness in his Signing a Paper of Judgment against us in <hi>Maryland</hi> upon bare Report. And therefore it is manifest that <hi>T. Everndon</hi> has been very imprudent in the management of this weighty Affair, thus to clear the guilty and condemn the Innocent, and that in the Name of the Lord. Oh! the righteous Iudge of the whole Earth, who knows the secrets of all hearts, will judge for these things.</p>
            <p>And in private Conference that Evening aforesaid, the principal thing for which <hi>T. E.</hi> blamed <hi>G. K.</hi> was, <hi>for making known to the World<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Errors of some called Preachers among the</hi> Quakers <hi>here,</hi> saying, <hi>he had made Friends stink, and become the Song of the Drunkards.</hi> But G K. said, he had not made them stink, but themselves had done it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as when the Sun shines warm on a Dung-hill, the Dunghill is to be blamed for the stink, not the Sun. Also, G. K. did expostulate with T. E. and his Companions, Why they did lay open to the World the Adultry of <hi>T. T:</hi> once a great Preacher among them, whereby the <hi>Quakers</hi> generally there away became a stink and a Song of the Drunkards, and many on that very account left the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings; They replyed, <hi>His Wickedness rested on his own head.</hi> To which G K. said, If Carnal Adultry be not to be hid, no more is spiritual Adultry, as this is to deny the Lord that bought us. So that their blaming G. K. for not sending to Friends in other parts, or to <hi>London,</hi> is as idle as if we should send to <hi>London</hi> to enquire whether Adultry be a sin for which we ought to deny them who are guilty, as fit to be seperated from and not fit to hold Communion with. And why should G. K. &amp; his Friends any more delay their publishing to the world, (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And if Friends at <hi>London</hi> found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerned to give forth a Testimony in print against one that was said to carry the Bible to the Exchange to burn it, ought not G.
