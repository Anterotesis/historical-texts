            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE many and great Advantages ariſing to Society, from the Inſtitution of publick SEMINARIES of LEARN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, were ſo early apparent to the illuſtrious Sages and venerable Legiſlators of Antiquity; that we find ſuch SCHOOLS nearly coeval with the Dawnings of Science itſelf. The Hiſtories of the moſt remote Ages inform us, that particular Claſſes of Men, under various Denominations in different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, were employed and ſet apart as the <hi>Depoſitaries</hi> or <hi>Preſervers</hi> of all the Learning then known; whoſe Duty it was by further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of their own, to rectify or improve whatever had been communicated to them; and afterwards to tranſmit the whole, without reſerve, to their Succeſſors. Theſe Men from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Life, reputed Sanctity, and Knowledge of the Powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies, and when Patriarchal Authority had now for ſome Time been ſunk in that of riſing States and Empires, would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be conſidered in Days of Ignorance and Simplicity, as a ſuperior Order of Beings, and as holding immediate Converſe with Heaven; and therefore they were uſually entruſted at the ſame Time, with the Direction of all the religious Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies practiſed among them, in the Worſhip of their ſeveral local Divinities: But that their Attention might not be taken off from theſe different Taſks or Studies, by the Neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding themſelves with Food and Raiment, they were for the moſt Part maintained at the publick Expence. So profuſely liberal had the Kings of EGYPT been to their <hi>Seminaries</hi> or <hi>Colleges</hi> of learned Men, that as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> tells us, one third Part of the whole Country was anciently allotted for the Support of the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> who, he adds, were alſo all <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> or ſkilled in the Art of Healing. Theſe Prieſts, by ſome called <hi>Hierophantes,</hi> or Expounders of ſacred Things, derived the Origin of their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from the earlieſt Ages; and were reputedly the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body of Men then known in the World, wherever Policy and good Government had been eſtabliſhed. For it may be affirmed from natural Reaſon, as well as from all the credible Hiſtories of ancient Nations, that none of the liberal Arts or Sciences ever made any conſiderable Progreſs, but where good Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had been firſt introduced and properly maintained. LAWS are neceſſary both for the Security of the Perſons and Properties of Men, and from that Eaſe and Happineſs which are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequences of ſuch Security, proceeds Curioſity, and an emulous Deſire of diſtinguiſhing themſelves either by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Reſearches into the Nature and Uſes of the Objects around

them; or by ſuch other Inventions and Diſcoveries as are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to themſelves, or Neighbours: The happy Reſult of all which is SCIENCE or Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Beſides the EGYPTIAN COLLEGES already mentioned, we find ſimilar Inſtitutions among ſeveral other Nations of Antiquity; ſome of which I ſhall give a ſummary Account of.</p>
            <p>Among the moſt ancient of theſe are the CHALDAEANS: They are noticed by that Name in Scripture, ſo early as in the Days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is there ſaid to have been born in their Country. Tho' the CHALDAEANS are frequently ſpoken of as a Nation of ASSYRIA, the Name is now moſt generally underſtood of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Body of learned Men diſtinct from the Reſt of the Citizens; whoſe ſole Buſineſs was Study; who lived in and about <hi>Babylon;</hi> and were famous for their Knowledge of Aſtronomy. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Calliſthen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> who attended <hi>Alexander</hi> on his Expedition againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> ſent <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> an Account of Aſtronomical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations made by the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> from nearly the Time of the Moſaical Deluge. They firſt invented <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to foretel Events from the Influence and relative Aſpects of the Stars and Conſtellations. They were much conſulted in Diſeaſes, which they pretended to cure by Charms, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of inviſible Powers, more than by the Medicinal Herbs they uſed on theſe Occaſions.</p>
            <p>The CABEIRI was an Appellation ſometimes uſed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents for their Great Gods, ſo called; but moſt generally for the Prieſts, who performed their ſacred Rites, and taught their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhip. They firſt came from <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and ſettled in <hi>Samothrace:</hi> They affected great Secrecy in their Ceremonies; and uſed certain Forms of Initiation into their Myſteries, by placing their Pupils upon a Throne, and dancing round them; after which they put a Girdle about them, which was thought to poſſeſs great Virtues.</p>
            <p>The CURETES, ſo called from keeping their Hair ſhort, and the CORYBANTES, were different Names for the Prieſts of <hi>Cybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> or <hi>Rhea,</hi> the fabled Mother of the Gods. They were ſometimes called <hi>Idaei Dactyli,</hi> from their Number; and from Mount <hi>Ida</hi> near <hi>Troy,</hi> where <hi>Cybele</hi> was held in particular Veneration. Theſe Prieſts went from <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and took up their Reſidence in the Iſland of <hi>Crete;</hi> where they were ſaid to have been intruſted with the Education of JUPITER; when to prevent the Cries of the young God from being heard by his Father <hi>Saturn,</hi> they invented the noiſy and warlike Dances in Armour, to the Sound of Drums and Flutes, which afterwards became Part of their eſtabliſhed Worſhip. They were expert in the Science of Augury and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011338_0006_0F85805F9EC85348"/>
They applied themſelves much to Aſtronomy, to Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology or the Study of Nature, and to Poetry. They are ſaid to have firſt inſtructed the <hi>Cretans</hi> to build Cities, and to live in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; to manage Flocks and Bees; and to make and uſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. STRABO mentions this Order of Prieſts by the Name of the COLLEGE of the CURETES; and as performing yearly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in Honour of the Birth of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The TELCHINES came firſt to <hi>Greece</hi> from the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> whither they had removed from <hi>Egypt:</hi> They were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of the Tribe of the Prieſts in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Inventors or Preſervers of the ſacred <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> Characters, and of the other Methods by which they concealed their Learning from the Vulgar; for they were very ſcrupulous and reſerved in communicating their Knowledge. The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak of them as the Inventors of Arts; who firſt taught them to rear Temples, to carve Images, and to practiſe regular Ceremonies in the Worſhip of their Deities. They were alſo great <hi>Magicians,</hi> and pretended to work Wonders by Charms, Incantations, and certain Drugs, whoſe Qualities they were acquainted with. They were probably the ſame as <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Sorcerers or wiſe Men; who are ſaid in Scripture to have done ſuch ſupernatural Feats, in Imitation of the Miracles performed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> They were alſo much given to Proceſſions and Shows; and to all the other Arts by which they could excite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in Mankind, and Reverence for themſelves, and their Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In the Book of JOSHUA we read of a City of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> called <hi>Ciriath-Sepher,</hi> which literally ſignifies the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Books</hi> or of <hi>Letters;</hi> as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Sidonians</hi> are known to have even then made great Progreſs in Arts and Learning, it is generally believed that they had in thoſe Times, publick Schools or <hi>Colleges</hi> in <hi>Ciriath-Sepher,</hi> in which were taught the Sciences or Philoſophy of thoſe Ages; and that this City had its Name from theſe Circumſtances, and the Number of learned Men who uſed to aſſemble in it, for Study, or mutual Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is certain that there were COLLEGES among the JEWS, in the Time of SAMUEL, even for the Inſtruction of their Prophets in the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religion; and other Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that important Profeſſion. Here is ſuch an Encomium upon Learning, as exceeds all the Powers of Man to equal: By this we are given to underſtand that Learning was conducive to Inſpiration, and a more familiar Intercourſe with the Deity; and was the eligible Vehicle of his revealed Will to that favourite People. Accordingly in the prophetic Writings we find many beautiful Deſcriptions, ingenious Allegories, and inſtructive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011338_0007_0F8580605CCD2F28"/>
Truths, delivered in a Stile truly Poetical and Sublime. We are alſo told in the Jewiſh Hiſtory, that HULDAH, the Propheteſs, dwelt in the COLLEGE at Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>The SALII or Prieſts of MARS, were inſtituted at ROME by <hi>Numa,</hi> for keeping the <hi>Aneilia</hi> or ſacred Bucklers: They had a PRAESU<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or chief Director; and they were called the COLLEGE of the SALII. This Name was given them, becauſe they danced in Armour thro' the Streets in their Proceſſions, in a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, continually beating upon their Bucklers; on which Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion they were accompanied with a Number of young Virgins in particular Habits, ſinging the <hi>Saliare Carmen,</hi> or Song of their Order.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, we read that there were anciently COLLEGES of the <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> and of the <hi>Indian Gymnoſophiſts</hi> or <hi>Bramins;</hi> which Inſtitutions exiſt in the Eaſt at this Day: And the COLLEGES of the <hi>Druids,</hi> or <hi>Semnotheans</hi> both in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in the Roman and other Hiſtories. Theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges were inferior to none of the others, either in Antiquity, Regularity, or popular Influence. Their Learning and Opinions ſhall be more particularly conſidered hereafter.</p>

            <p>Nor was this Cuſtom of Travelling confined to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The famed ZOROASTER travelled over <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> as far as the <hi>Ganges,</hi> to be inſtructed in the ancient Philoſophy of the <hi>Bramins,</hi> who, even in his Time, were celebrated for the Innocence of their Lives, and Purity of their Doctrines; and the <hi>Gentoo</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, ſtill preſerved in <hi>India,</hi> mention both him and PYTHAGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAS, as Travellers into that Country, in Search of Knowledge. The <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Philoſopher and <hi>Britiſh Druid</hi> ABARIS, is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by ſeveral Greek Writers, as travelling over the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Delos,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Italy.</hi> ANACHARSIS was a noble <hi>Scythian</hi> who came to <hi>Greece</hi> for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; from thence he viſited CROESUS in <hi>Lydia;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was killed in his own Country, for endeavouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Grecian Cuſtoms.

            <p>We read of many more inquiſitive Sages of Old, who quitted their native Countries to viſit diſtant Regions, in Queſt of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. From theſe renowned Travellers of Antiquity, is derived the modern faſhionable Practice, of viſiting foreign Countries for Improvement; which was adopted ſoon after the Revival of Learning in <hi>Europe;</hi> and is ſtill conſidered, by Men of generous Minds and enlarged Underſtandings, not only as a genteel and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Accompliſhment, but as the finiſhing Part of Polite Education.</p>
            <p>Since thoſe more remote Times, Learning has been ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively branched out into various Arts, Sciences, or Profeſſions; by the many curious and amazing Diſcoveries communicated to the World, within theſe few laſt Centuries; and by the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable uſeful and intereſting Improvements made in all its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Departments; that the munificent Founders, and generous Benefactors of modern UNIVERSITIES have been thereby induced to aſſign competent Allowances, for the Support of particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors or Teachers in each neceſſary Branch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who with Abiliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not inferior, tho' with Aſſiſtances and Advantages infinitely ſuperior to the <hi>Antients,</hi> are nevertheleſs conſidered as both uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and neceſſarily employed for themſelves, and the Public, in attending to, and improving the ſingle Part alloted them.</p>

            <p>To render the Influence of this COLLEGE more extenſive and beneficial to Mankind, the reſpectable Governors have, with their uſual Benevolence, been pleaſed to countenance and cheriſh the infant and well-meant Endeavours of a few Gentlemen of the Medical Profeſſion here, to erect a SCHOOL of PHYSICK; by beſtowing upon each of them the Titles, Privileges, and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of PROFESSORS in it, of ſuch ſeparate Branches of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine as they have ſeverally engaged to teach. For theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Marks of Favour, it is with the greateſt Alacrity and Pleaſure, that I embrace this firſt Opportunity, in my own Name, and in the Names of my Brother Profeſſors, of making our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Acknowledgements to the worthy and patriotic GOVERNORS, for that Protection and Encouragement they have ſo chearfully afforded to our Undertaking, and the Honours they have been pleaſed to confer upon us: And in a particular Manner we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn our unfeigned and moſt cordial Thanks to the THREE GENTLEMEN of the COMMITTEE<note n="*" place="bottom">DR.

            <p>When we conſider that the moſt civilized and polite Nations on Earth, have formerly at ſome Period lived as the moſt Savage and Ignorant do at this Day; we have great Reaſon to extol the Sagacity and Addreſs of our Anceſtors, for inventing, cultivating, and improving the Arts and Sciences. To enumerate the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we derive from their Induſtry; the many Conveniencies and Pleaſures of Life which their Diſcernment and Good Senſe have put us in Poſſeſſion of; or the Labours and Inquietudes we have been delivered from, by their profitable and ſucceſsful Endeavours; would be a Taſk not more difficult than unneceſſary; as it would
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011338_0010_0F858065A8C608B8"/>
be doubting the Judgment of this learned AUDIENCE; as well as their Knowledge of Men and Books: I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my ſubſequent Diſcourſe to the preſent Occaſion of bringing together this reſpectable and polite Company; and to what is properly the Subject of this preſent Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The ART of HEALING, as is obſerved by the learned Dr. PITCAIRN, muſt certainly be of greater Antiquity than the Study of PHILOSOPHY; becauſe in the Beginning of the World, every one would be determined to thoſe Studies of PHYSICK or PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSOPHY, according as the Feelings of Man's Body, or the Amuſements of his Mind firſt excited his Attention. Now it is moſt probable, that the Reaſons for PHILOSOPHY were only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental or caſual; for Men then only addicted themſelves to philoſophiſing, when, after experiencing the Efficacy of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they could in ſome Security and at Leizure conſider the Qualities of Natural Bodies, and think of excelling the Reſt of Mankind in the Powers of the Underſtanding: Whereas the Reaſons for PHYSICK, or the Preſervation of Health, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual; and, from the earlieſt Uſe of Man's Faculties, naturally connected with his Well-being and Exiſtence. The SCIENCE of MEDICINE is alſo more uſeful, more honourable than that of PHILOSOPHY; by how much the more reaſonable it is, that our Care for the Life of Man, ſhould exceed that of gratifying his Curioſity.</p>
            <p>By the Word MEDICINE, the Ancients underſtood every Thing which related to the Art of Healing; as by the Appellation of PHYSICIAN<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>MAN, from the Beginning, ſeems to have been formed by his CREATOR, ſubject to Changes, and even to Death itſelf; equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all the other living Productions of Nature. The Structure of his Body, the Functions neceſſary to the Preſervation of Life, Motion and Reſt, Watching and Sleep, and even Health itſelf, are ultimately productive of Infirmities and Sickneſs: The daily Neceſſity of freſh Supplies of Meat and Drink, to recruit the continual Waſte of the Body, by the Actions of Life; the Air he breathes, filled with Exhalations of very different Properties, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they aſcend from the Earth in the Day, or deſcend from the ſurrounding Atmoſphere in the Night; the various and ſudden Changes of the Weather, from hot, cold, moiſt, dry, to their ſeveral Oppoſites; or the long and uninterrupted Cold and Heat of ſucceſſive Days and Nights; the Influence of the Sun and Moon upon our Bodies, thro' the Medium of the Atmoſphere; and the varying Seaſons of the Year; <hi>all</hi> muſt occaſion ſuch Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011338_0011_0F85806680C88FC0"/>
in his Conſtitution, and State of Health, as are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conditions of his Exiſtence; and <hi>finally</hi> muſt become the Source of his total Diſſolution. From all this may we not conclude, that before that myſterious <hi>Fall</hi> of ADAM, the Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the human Body muſt have been very different from what it now is; or that it was not liable to the ſame Inconveniencies, Neceſſities, and Accidents, as at preſent; or otherwiſe, that even in EDEN'S Garden, and while poſſeſſed of that ſo celebrated and golden State of Innocence, nothing leſs than a <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> or ſome ſuch ſingular and perpetual Exertion of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> could preſerve to him, the full and undiminiſhed Enjoyment of all thoſe various Powers and Faculties, depending upon the Health and Well-being of a Machine, ſo mutable, ſo weak, and complicated?</p>
            <p>The firſt Race of Mankind, expoſed in the Forreſts or open Fields, to the ſudden Changes and Inclemencies of the Weather, muſt have maintained their Life in no very comfortable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Unacquainted with thoſe Luxuries and Abuſes of natural Benefits, which have ſince their Time been ſo much followed and refined upon, it is agreed among all the antient Writers of every Country and Denomination, who have treated that Subject, and Reaſon itſelf confirms it to us, that their whole Suſtenance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the Seeds, Herbs, and Roots of their own and Nature's Tillage, juſt as they grew and preſented themſelves to their Hand; joined with the ſucculent Fruits of Shrubs and Trees; and diluted with the cool and refreſhing Draughts from the pure Stream or Fountain. This Diet of the primitive Ages would vary, according to the different Productions of their reſpective Countries; whence many Nations were anciently diſtinguiſhed by Names expreſſive of that particular Food moſt generally uſed among them, or with which their Country chicſty abounded: Thus we are told that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> lived in former Times upon <hi>Acorns;</hi> the <hi>Argives</hi> on <hi>Pears;</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> on <hi>Figgs;</hi> other Nations are ſaid to have fed chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y on <hi>Beech Maſt;</hi> and to keep up the Remembrance of theſe Days of Innocence and Frugality, it was cuſtomary at <hi>Athens,</hi> to preſent the new married Pair on the Day of their Nuptials, with a Baſket of Acorns mixed with Bread. However, let us obſerve by the by, that probably the Acorns in theſe ſouthern Latitudes differed in Quality, from thoſe known to us; and that other Kinds of Shell Fruits might be comprehended under that Name. But when we conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Diet, we muſt allow that, tho' it is very proper for <hi>Cattle</hi> and the <hi>feathered Tribes,</hi> whoſe Organs are adapted to ſuch Aliment, it could not be ſo fit for or agreeable to MAN, who is of a more delicate Texture: For the moſt delicious Fruits are cold, and afford but little Nouriſhment; Seeds, without previous Dreſſing, are flatulent, and hard to digeſt; and Herbs and Roots are ſtill more harſh and crude. This is the uncontroverted Opinion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011338_0012_0F85806719F07CD8"/>
of Phyſicians in all Ages and Climates. HIPPOCRATES ſays, that in the Beginning Men uſed the ſame Food as the Beaſts; and that the many Diſtempers, brought upon them by ſuch indigeſtible Aliment, taught them in Length of Time to find out a different Diet, better ſuited to their Conſtitutions: And the ſame Reaſons no doubt, ſuggeſted the firſt Eſſays of improving the Taſte, and meliorating the Nature of ſuch ungrateful Food, by Means of Fire.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of MILK was probably an early Acquiſition to the Diet of the primitive Ages. This being a ready Article of Food, more palatable, and better ſuited to their Powers of Digeſtion, than any other then known, will eaſily account for that Attention and Care with which the Men of thoſe Times preſerved and multiplied their Herds and Flocks, in which conſiſted all their Riches; and for that perpetual Deſire they had to roam and change their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Abode, in their Function of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> for the Convenience of finding freſh Paſture and Water. Thus the SCYTHIANS were ſometimes called GALACTOPHAGI, or MILK-EATERS, by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from their feeding much upon that nutritious Fluid.</p>
            <p>The Simplicity of their Diet could only be equaled by that of their Cloathing and Habitations. The Skin of ſome Animal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally found dead, or of ſome devouring Beaſt of Prey, killed perhaps in Self-defence, was probably the firſt Covering that was wore, either for Uſe or Ornament: As their Canopy was the Sky; a natural Grotto; or ſome temporary Shelter of Branches and Leaves; agreeable to their Neceſſities, and ſuited to their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>At what Time the Uſe of ANIMAL FOOD was firſt introduced, is not eaſily aſcertained. PLUTARCH wonders what Soul or Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Man had, who firſt with his Mouth touched Blood, or the Fleſh of ſlaughtered Animals; and thinks that nothing but extreme Neceſſity could have introduced ſuch a Practice. When we conſider the helpleſs Condition of Man, in his State of Nature; how he is comparatively unprovided with Weapons of Offence or Defence; and if we reflect that there is in every Man, unprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the Ways of Blood, an innate Abhorrence to deprive of Life, or diſpaſſionately to butcher an inoffenſive Brute, from a preconceived Deſire of eating its Body; we cannot believe that he was originally formed by his CREATOR for an <hi>Animal</hi> of <hi>Prey.</hi> This is further confirmed from <hi>comparative Anatomy;</hi> by which it is evident, that his Inſtruments of Manducation and Digeſtion more nearly reſemble thoſe of <hi>Graminivorous,</hi> than of <hi>Carnivorous</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. Thus ADAM, among other Injunctions given him, is told; <hi>That every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree in which is the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, ſhall be to him for Meat:</hi> But, tho' Dominion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011338_0013_0F858069D33B89C8"/>
is expreſsly given him over all living Creatures, in every Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is no where told that he might kill, or eat of them: And it is as true as remarkable, that excepting thoſe human Figures which inhabit near the frozen Seas to the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and who from Neceſſity live almoſt entirely upon <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Sea Fowls;</hi> the principal Part of Man's Food in all other known Regions of the World, from the fierce Savages of AMERICA, to the wandering Hordes of TARTARY, and the ſooty Tribes of AFRICA, has ever been, and ſtill continues to be <hi>Vegetable.</hi> But by whatever Means Man was firſt tempted to act ſo contrary to the Feelings of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as to deſtroy Animals for Food; whether from the Example of Savage Beaſts, the grateful Odour of Burnt-Offerings, Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, dire Neceſſity, a Spirit of Revenge, or by whatever Motive he was induced to make the bold Eſſay; the firſt Account we have of Animals being the deſtined Prey of Man, is in that formal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion addreſſed to NOAH, immediately after the Flood, in theſe Words; <hi>Every moving Thing that liveth, ſhall be Meat for you; even as the green Herb have I given you all Things:</hi> And it is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Writers,</hi> that no ſuch Food was uſed, till after the Deluge. This Permiſſion to eat Meat, when conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſimply and in itſelf, will appear to have been only a partial Favour: For crude Fleſh quickly putrifies, more eſpecially when aſſiſted by the natural Heat of the Body; while notwithſtanding, the human Stomach and Bowels, from the Delicacy of their Structure and Length of their Tube, are unable to diſcharge the putrid <hi>Faeces</hi> ſo expeditiouſly as is done by Beaſts by Nature formed for Prey, and whoſe Inteſtines are not only ſhorter, but alſo more firm and muſcular: Wherefore it is obvious that the Eating of raw Meat muſt have been attended with very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences, before the various Methods of dreſſing it by Fire, and other Contrivances for preſerving it, were found out; in order to retard its Tendency to Putrefaction, and accommodate this Diſpoſition to the Powers of Digeſtion in Man, and to the Length of Time it muſt neceſſarily remain in his Body. Thus the ART of COOKERY, however it may have adminiſtred to the Folly or Luxury of later Times, was undoubtedly, in its Origin, not more ſimple than proper and neceſſary; and like other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylactick Remedies or <hi>Preſervatives,</hi> was at firſt practiſed for the ſole Purpoſes of Health and Convenience. Phyſicians often form very juſt Opinions reſpecting the Nature of the humane Juices, and the general State of Health, from that particular Kind of Food chiefly uſed, whether it be Animal or Vegetable; and ſome have even pretended to judge of Men's Tempers and Diſpoſition, from eating their animal Food much dreſſed, crude, or nearly ſo. There are however many Examples of a voluntary Abſtinence from all <hi>Fleſh.</hi> both in antient and modern Times; partly from Motives of Humanity to Brutes, and partly from thoſe of Self-Mortification: For not to mention the Auſterities and frugal

Life of ANCHORETS in different Parts of the World, it is well known that, of the preſent religious Orders amongſt the Roman Catholicks, the CARTHUSIANS and MINIMS never eat Meat: and the rigid Order of LA TRAPPE, never eat any Thing which has ever had Life in it; They live entirely on Vegetables, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by their own Hands. The COLLOYERS, a Sect of <hi>Greek Monks,</hi> never eat Meat; and on Faſt Days they uſe Vegetables only. There is another Sect of <hi>Greek</hi> Devotees called ASCETAI, who live recluſe in the Mountains upon Vegetables alone: Many Religious among the <hi>Armenians</hi> never eat Meat; and among the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> we are told, that many of their Prieſts and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees are no leſs abſtemious in that Article of Food. That ſmall Society of induſtrious inoffenſive People, who have lately ſettled in a neighbouring Province, and are commonly known by the Name of DUNKARDS, live for the moſt Part upon Vegetable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; and tho' they do not refrain altogether from Meat, they profeſſedly uſe it very ſparingly, from a Principle of Self-Denial. They are moreover very frugal in their Dreſs, Sleep upon Boards, and are extremely hoſpitable: They have a Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This natural Averſion in Man to kill Animals for Food, if it did not give Riſe to, was certainly much hightened by, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the METEMPSYCHOSIS, or TRANSMIGRATION of Souls; which PYTHAGORAS having been inſtructed in by the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> HIEROPHANTES, and BRAMINS of the Eaſt, is falſly ſuppos'd to have been the Author of, becauſe he firſt publicly taught it in <hi>Greece.</hi> For it is certain that all of this Perſuaſion, abſtain more or leſs from Animal Food; either from Motives of Religion, or Humanity.</p>
            <p>As this Doctrine of the METEMPSYCHOSIS is very ancient, and conſtitutes the very Eſſence of the <hi>Gentoo</hi> Religion at this Day; and as the Account of their original Tenets, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by MR. HOLWELL, who reſided ſeveral Years amongſt them, is in very few Hands here; I ſhall ſubjoin an Abſtract of their Opinions, chiefly from him, for the Amuſement of the Curious, tho' ſomewhat foreign to the preſent Subject.</p>
            <p>The BRAMINS, or GENTOO PRIESTS, by the Ancients called GYMNOSOPHISTS, have ever invariably profeſſed, as funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles of their Creed, the three grand Principles uſually taught to thoſe initiated into the celebrated ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES; to wit, The Unity of the God-Head; his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over all Creation; and a future State of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.

They believe that the Hoſt of Angels was called into Exiſtence long before the Creation of this World; and that long before this latter Event, there was an Apoſtacy or Rebellion of the Angels in Heaven, who, with their Chief, MOISASOOR, were baniſh'd thence by the ETERNAL ONE, into utter Darkneſs: That after ſome Time, at the Interceſſion of the good Angels, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Worlds were created as Places of Puniſhment and Probation for ſuch of the DEBTAH, or fallen Angels, as were penitent and deſirous of regaining their loſt Eſtate, where they were doom'd to animate the Bodies of different Animals, even to the ſmalleſt Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Infect, according to the Nature and Degree of their Crimes; till by Obedience, Perſeverance, and a Series of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrations thro' different Species of Animals in all theſe ſeveral Worlds, they ſhould have totally expiate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They believe that MOISASOOR, or the Arch Rebel, and his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Followers, are continually endeavouring to bring back the Penitent Angels to their Apoſtacy, and to render ineffectual their Atonements, in the different Forms they animate: That the good Angels have alſo, from Time to Time, by the Permiſſion of GOD, voluntarily ſubjected themſelves to the Feelings of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evil,</hi> and undergone the whole Series of Tranſmigrations; for the Sake of inſtructing and encouraging their Penitent Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: That theſe <hi>benevolent Spirits</hi> have appear'd at different Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, in the various Characters of KINGS, LAWGIVERS, PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHERS, or TEACHERS; as ſhining Examples to them of <hi>Courage, Piety, Benevolence,</hi> and of every other <hi>ſocial Virtue;</hi> and that theſe Viſitations were more frequent formerly than now: That in all the inferior Orders of Beings, theſe Spirits are in a State of <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but that in MAN, commences their State of <hi>Probation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this Form only, they become abſolute and free Agents: Whereas in other Forms, they believe that the intellectual Powers of the Criminal Spirits are circumſcribed, by the varied Structure of the Bodies they inhabit; and in this principally conſiſts, ſay they, the Difference between MAN and other ANIMALS.

Nations; and as they cannot even admit of Converts to their Faith, or receive them into the Pale of their Communion, without the loſs of their <hi>Caſt</hi> or <hi>Tribe,</hi> which is a Diſgrace every GENTOO would rather ſuffer Death than incur; therefore that their Nation has not only remain'd unmix'd with any other Race of People to this Day, but their Theological Dogmas have alſo ſubſiſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed and unmix'd, ever ſince they were firſt taught to them by BRAMAH; which according to their Accounts, was near 4900 Years ago; excepting ſome Mythological Interpolations of a later Date: And that the <hi>Chaldaeans, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>AEgyptians,</hi> ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for their Wiſdom, and who were not under the like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Reſtraints from leaving their Country, or from having Communication with the Reſt of Mankind, moſt probably bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed great Part of their Knowledge and Opinions from the BRAMINS; and not they from the <hi>Egyptians, Perſians,</hi> or <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> From all which MR. HOLWELL concludes, that tho' many Theological Syſtems have in all Appearance been built upon the religious Tenets of the GENTOO'S, yet they have copied from none: And that therefore their Doctrines are moſt ancient, and truly Original; as much ſo at leaſt, as any written Body of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity whatever.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of a Remark, that if Firmneſs of Mind, a ſteady Adherence to avow'd Opinions, a philoſophic Indifference to every Object of Pride and Senſuality, and a cool and determined Contempt of Death, are the natural Reſult of Integrity of Heart, and conſcious Rectitude; none have given greater or more volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Proofs of theſe, than the BRAMINS and their <hi>Diſciples,</hi> for ſucceſſive Ages. The Bramin DANDAMIS, tho' ſent for by ALEXANDER the GREAT to viſit him, was equally unmoved by his Sollicitations and Threats; declaring that he had nothing to aſk of ALEXANDER, and that if the King had any Thing to aſk of him, he might come to him: This magnanimous Prince however condeſcended to viſit him firſt; after which the Philoſopher was prevailed upon to come to Court. There is ſtill extant a Letter from this DANDAMIS to ALEXANDER, giving him ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Sentiments of his Sect; and in which he draws a Compariſon between his own Principles and Morals, and thoſe of ALEXANDER, not much to the Advantage of the latter. The deliberate and eaſy Manner in which the Bramin CALANUS, when ſick of a Dyſentery, burnt himſelf at <hi>Paſargadae,</hi> before ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER and his whole Court, upon a Pile of Wood erected for the Purpoſe, is a Story equally well known and atteſted; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Arguments, and even Intreaties were uſed by ALEXANDER, to diſſuade him from his Purpoſe, he perſiſted in his Reſolution to die, for this ſole Reaſon, becauſe he was tired of Life. But ZARMANOCHAGAS, another <hi>Bramin,</hi> who came in the Train of Ambaſſadors ſent from the <hi>Indies</hi> to

AUGUSTUS, when on his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> burnt himſelf in like Manner publicly at ATHENS; profeſſing on the contrary, that he did this in the Height of his Proſperity and Happineſs, leſt he ſhould afterwards meet with Chagrin and Misfortunes; and he ordered it to be engraved upon his Tomb, that he did thus, in Conformity to the Cuſtom of his Country. When Teachers Seal their Doctrines with ſuch palpable Proofs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Sincerity, it is not to be wondered at, if we meet with ſimilar Inſtances of Fortitude and Enthuſiaſm even among their modern female Diſciples; who glory in aſcending the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pile, and in ſetting Fire to it, like CALANUS, with their own Hands; in order to mix their Aſhes with thoſe of their deceaſed Huſbands. We have a very particular Account of ſuch a free Will Offering, told us by MR. HOLWELL, in his Hiſtorical Events.</p>
            <p>STRABO tell us, that Phyſic was in his Time the favourite Study of the INDIANS; that they did not however deal ſo much in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> as in the <hi>Diaetetick</hi> Part of Medicine; that they made great Uſe of external Applications in all Diſeaſes; that they were well acquainted with <hi>natural Philoſophy,</hi> and knew the ſalutary and noxious Qualities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Herbs. We are further told that this Profeſſion is chiefly followed by the BRAMINS; that it is very ancient among them; and that their Rules and Method of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, particularly in <hi>Malabar,</hi> are recorded in Books, in like Manner as among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> derive the Origin of PHYSICK from the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> to their <hi>Prophets;</hi> by whom, they ſay, it was firſt communicated to Mankind.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the <hi>Primitive</hi> State of Man, according to the View already exhibited, we can not doubt that, being unaided by ſupernatural Powers, unprompted by Inſtinct, and without Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he firſt felt the Inconveniencies of his Situation, before he thought of the Means for Relief. His ſlow REASON muſt often have been indebted to the more unerring INSTINCT of the Brute Creation, for the Election of his daily Food; and often, no Doubt, his late but woeful Experience taught him to diſtinguiſh the noxious, from the wholſome Vegetable, the nutritious and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Fruit, from ſuch as he had found to be deleterious or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Thus it is cuſtomary with Sailors, or ſuch as are forced upon an uninhabited Coaſt, where they meet with unknown Fruits or Plants, to obſerve with great Attention, ſuch as are eat or taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Birds or other Animals, before they themſelves venture to feed upon them.</p>
            <p>But it may be preſumed that their Acquaintance with, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the various Productions of the Earth, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſuch only as they uſed for Food: They undoubtedly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011338_0019_0F85806E9E55F208"/>
made Trials of thoſe alſo that attracted their Notice by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Smell, or other ſenſible Qualities: From repeated Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Kind, they could not help obſerving the powerful Effects of ſome of theſe Productions, in exciting and promoting the more obvious and grand Evacuations of the Body; and having perceived that whatever was hurtful or nauſeous to the Stomach, was ejected by <hi>Vomit;</hi> and that every Thing offenſive to the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, was carried off by the <hi>foeculent</hi> Diſcharges; it is reaſonable to conclude, that the moſt efficacious Simples or Remedies for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting theſe capital Evacuations, were carefully conſidered and diſtinguiſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">Sic Medicinam ortam, ſubinde aliorum Salute, aliorum Interitu, pernicios a diſcernentem a Salutaribus.

from repeated Trials, obſerving that the Succeſs of this Remedy, was always proportioned to the Degree of Bitterneſs in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would naturally be led to make Uſe of the Bark itſelf.

            <p>The SCIENCE of MEDICINE, in this its Dawning or Infancy, was uſually with the other Learning of the Times, preſerved by the <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Families:</hi> But the Number of Obſervations and Remedies, becoming too great to be retained in the Memory of Men, otherwiſe occupied with the Concerns of their own little States or Tribes; and the Sacerdotal Function, for the like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Convenience, being now ſeparated from the temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it was long engroſſed by the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> becauſe internal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes were then conſidered as Puniſhments immediately inflicted by the Gods, for Crimes; and were therefore to be cured ſolely by prieſtly Arts and Invocations: And ſuch is the State of Phyſic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome Superſtitious and Pagan Nations, at this Day.

Thus Remedies, handed down from Father to Son, were continually improved and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, by ſucceeding Generations.</p>
            <p>The primitive Phyſicians moſt probably began their Inquiries into the Nature of Diſeaſes, with thoſe which were moſt generally obſerved to attend upon the Changes of the Seaſons: And as ASTRONOMY was the firſt Science cultivated by the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, they would naturally impute theſe Diſtempers to the angry Influence of the Stars and Conſtellations, which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to rule at ſuch Seaſons; hence aroſe a different Mode of treating Diſeaſes, by Charms and Incantations, in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe theſe preſiding Powers: Theſe <hi>medical</hi> Charms continued long in Uſe among the Antients, and are ſtill devoutly con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ided in, by many ſuperſtitious and ignorant Nations at this Day.</p>
            <p>All the Progreſs made in the Art of Healing at, or before the Flood, may well be imagined to have been very inconſiderable. The infant State of the World makes it probable, that as ANIMAL FOOD and FERMENTED LIQUORS were then little uſed, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown, there were but few Diſeaſes exiſting; and that the Extent of Medical Skill then conſiſted, in the ſucceſsful Exhibition of ſome <hi>Simples</hi> internally or externally uſed; in <hi>Frictions, Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Sweating</hi> in the Sun or Sand. Immediately after that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, the making of WINE was found out, and communicated to Mankind. This was probably the Effect of Accident; for NOAH had certainly taſted of the Grape, before he expreſſed or fermented the Juice; and he could not poſſibly know, that the Effects of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation were to give an inebriating Quality, to a Liquor he had ſo frequently experienced to be pleaſing and harmleſs, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Spirit in the expreſſed Juice, which it did not contain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; till he diſcovered it, by that memorable Incident recorded in Sacred Writ. Not long afterwards was probably diſcovered the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of making of BEER; for HERODOTUS tell us, that in thoſe Provinces of <hi>Egypt</hi> where no Vines were cultivated, the People drank a Sort of Wine made of BARLEY: This ſeems to have been the STRONG DRINK mentioned in ſeveral Places of the Old Teſtament, as diſtinct from <hi>Wine:</hi> Thus it is ſaid, "<hi>Give</hi> STRONG DRINK <hi>to him that is ready to periſh,</hi> and WINE <hi>to thoſe that be of heavy Hearts:—Thou ſhalt beſtow that Money for Oxen, or for Sheep, or for</hi> WINE, <hi>or for</hi> STRONG DRINK: AARON and his Sons were forbid to drink WINES, or STRONG DRINK, when they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, under the Penalty of Death: And MOSES tells the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that in all
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011338_0022_0F85807170098028"/>
their 40 Years Journey thro' the Wilderneſs, they neither drank WINE, nor STRONG DRINK: Which proves, that they were both at that Time known and uſed, in the Country whence they had ſo lately emigrated. The Uſe of BEER among the <hi>Germans,</hi> and ſome other northern Nations, is as ancient as any Accounts we have of thoſe People, or their Cuſtoms. DIOSCORIDES informs us, that the antient <hi>Britons</hi> uſed an intoxicating <hi>Drink</hi> made of <hi>Barley,</hi> or ſometimes of <hi>Wheat,</hi> called in their Language CURMI; and this <hi>Liquor</hi> is ſtill highly celebrated in the old feſtival Songs of the ancient <hi>Scots,</hi> by the ſame Name; tho' the Method of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is now loſt. This CURMI ſeems to have been different in its Qualities, and in the Manner of preparing it, from any BEERS now known; if we may credit their Traditions concerning this famed BEVERAGE. We are told that the <hi>Mexicans</hi> alſo uſed a BEER, or intoxicating Liquor made of MAIZ, or INDIAN CORN, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt came amongſt them: This muſt have been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention intirely their own. The ſame Fact is alſo told us of the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> in the Hiſtory of their <hi>Incas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Vice and Debauchery, by ſuch Means prevailed in the World, Infirmities and Diſeaſes muſt have become more frequent; Remedies muſt conſequently have been more ſought after, and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Art itſelf more cultivated and eſteemed, as it became more uſeful or neceſſary to Mankind.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now more particularly conſider the STATE of PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICK, among the moſt celebrated Nations of Antiquity; and the Reputation it was held in by them, from the Times it began to be followed as a Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>ASIA, without Doubt, was civilized before any other Part of the World. Accordingly we find that moſt of the ARTS and SCIENCES, the ſure Concomitants and Conſequences of the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of SOCIETIES, PROPERTY, and LAWS, had their firſt Riſe in the Eaſt. Here too were made the firſt Obſervations upon Diſeaſes and Remedies, which were ſoon communicated to <hi>Egypt;</hi> but it was in <hi>Egypt</hi> itſelf, that MEDICINE was firſt followed as a SCIENCE. In <hi>Egypt</hi> it is to be obſerved, that however the Hiſtory of their firſt Kings has been concealed under Allegories and Fables, it is greatly for the Honour of this Profeſſion, that of thoſe who have been deified by their ſuperſtitious Country-Men, for inventing or communicating uſeful Knowledge to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; ſome as HERMES, OSYRIS, ISIS, and HORUS have been deified, more particularly for inventing and improving of PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIC. It is in <hi>Egypt</hi> we have the firſt authentick Account upon Record, of PHYSICIANS by Profeſſion: For in the Book of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> we are told, that JOSEPH ordered the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to embalm the Body of his Father JACOB. MEDICINE is ſaid to have been firſt reduced to a Syſtem there, by THONIS; but after him, ſeveral
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011338_0023_0F8580719F1F3578"/>
Kings are reported, not only to have ſtudied, but alſo to have practiſed it. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Writer MANETHO, according to <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> relates that ATHOTIS wrote a Treatiſe upon Anatomy; and HERMES, a King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> wrote upon the ſame Subject, for, adds our Author, <hi>he was a Phyſician.—</hi> Whatever Credit may be given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ity of the SCIENCE, as well as the great Veneration it was held in, at the Time when thoſe Authors wrote. Their <hi>Practice</hi> was much ſubdivided; for ſome undertook to cure one Diſtemper only, and others to cure others: So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> practiſed only upon Diſeaſes of the HEAD; others only upon Diſeaſes of the EYES; of which laſt Claſs, CYRUS ſent for one from <hi>Egypt.</hi> Others again practiſed upon Diſeaſes of the BOWELS; ſome Studied thoſe Diſtempers incident to WOMEN only; others applied themſelves to cure OCCULT MALADIES incident to both Sexes: And none were allowed to practiſe out of their own Branch. The Profeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them was hereditary, and the Science tranſmitted from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son. They had Salaries and Mantainance allowed from the Public; and they practiſed Gratis. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Phyſicians were particularly ſtudious of Cleanlineſs. The Books containing their Rules and Method of <hi>Practice</hi> were depoſited in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, along with thoſe of their Religion and Learning.

            <p>The PHAENICIANS are among the firſt Nations that make any Figure in Hiſtory, for Learning and Arts; and who are ſaid to have ſtudied and cultivated <hi>phyſic</hi> very early. But as we have only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſertions to conduct us in our Inquiries here; and as all Obſervations upon Medicinal Facts, were in theſe Times neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily interwoven with their other philoſophic Studies; we are obliged to form our Opinions reſpecting their Skill in the HEALING ART, from the Advances we find they had made in the other Branches of USEFUL KNOWLEDGE. It is uncertain whence they derived their Origin. Some think that they were the Poſterity of the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who eſcaped the devouring Sword of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and this Opinion ſeems countenanced by the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Word <hi>Canaan,</hi> which, in the Language of the Eaſt, means a <hi>Merchant.</hi> The AUTHOR of the <hi>Inquiry into the Life and Writings</hi> of HOMER obſerves, That they retained much of the Manners of the Eaſtern Nations; that their Language was a Branch of the old <hi>Aramaean;</hi> that their Policy, both civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, their Temples, their Records preſerved in Temples, and the Order of their Prieſts exempted from Taxes, are very like the Inſtitutions that prevailed over the Eaſt: To which may be added, that the <hi>Tyrians</hi> worſhipped the Fire. They were the Authors of the nobler Kinds of ARCHITECTURE, of NAVIGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, and GEOGRAPHY; the Improvers of ASTRONOMY; the Inventors of the HELIOTROPE or <hi>Sun-Dial,</hi> and of GLASS; and the Rivals of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for the Invention of LETTERS and ARITHMETICK. They were alſo the Parent of MECHANICS, and the firſt Workers in <hi>Metals, Wood,</hi> and <hi>Stone:</hi> So that what is ſaid of HIRAM, the <hi>Widow's Son</hi> from <hi>Tyre,</hi> and the Maſter Workman to King SOLOMON, was truly characteriſtic of the Nation,—<hi>he was ſkilful to work in</hi> GOLD <hi>and in</hi> SILVER, <hi>in</hi> BRASS, <hi>in</hi> IRON, <hi>in</hi> STONE, <hi>and in</hi> TIMBER; <hi>in</hi> PURPLE, <hi>in</hi> BLUE, <hi>in fine</hi> LINNEN, <hi>and in</hi> CRIMSON: <hi>Alſo to grave every Manner of Grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to find out every</hi> DEVICE <hi>which ſhould be put to him.</hi> In ſhort they excelled in all <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Taſte.</hi> By their frequent Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages over the <hi>Euxine,</hi> and <hi>Red Seas</hi> to all the different Parts of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and into the <hi>Atlantic Ocean,</hi> as far as the <hi>Gum Coaſt</hi> on one Hand, and to <hi>Britain</hi> on the other; we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe that they greatly improved the HEALING ART, and inriched the MATERIA MEDICA: For it is well known that the Communication of Diſeaſes from one Country to another, as well as of Remedies and Operations uſed in different Countries for the ſame Diſeaſes, is the Effect of Commerce. From the <hi>Phaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> HOMER firſt learned the noted Story of the SIRENS; and of that dangerous Dame <hi>Circe,</hi> who with the intoxicating Juice of Herbs, could transform Men into Brutes.

firſt heard of the Inchantments of MEDEA in <hi>Colchis,</hi> and of her wonderful Skill in the Virtues of Herbs. If moreover we conſider their daily Intercourſe with, and Vicinity to <hi>Egypt,</hi> where Medicine was always particularly cultivated and reſpected, and that even then, this <hi>Profeſſion</hi> was a profitable Branch of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; we can not doubt that they, <hi>whoſe Merchants were Princes, and whoſe Traſſickers the Honourable of the Earth,</hi> were alſo well acquainted with the Nature and Cure of Diſeaſes.

The Doctrines of the <hi>Perſian</hi> MAGI, are very ancient. Their Name, in that Language, means the ſame as PHILOSOPHERS among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or SAPIENTES <hi>(Wiſemen)</hi> among the <hi>Latins;</hi> and from their extraordinary Learning, and Knowledge of the Operations of natural Bodies, they were believ'd to have ſecret Communication with, or Power over, <hi>inviſible Spirits.</hi> We are told that they believed the <hi>Tranſmigration of Souls;</hi> and DIOGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES LAERTIUS aſſures us, that they lived intirely upon Milk and Vegetables. They were the ſole Guardians and Superintendants of RELIGION, and of the LAWS: No publick Worſhip could be perform'd but by them; and no Law could be enacted or abrogated without their Concurrence. They allowed of no <hi>Images,</hi> nor uſed <hi>bloody Sacrifices</hi> in their Worſhip; which was always in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times, perform'd by them in the open Air, or in Groves, but never in covered Temples: For as the SUN was the great Object of their Adoration, they ſaid that the whole World was the <hi>Temple</hi> of the SUN. However, Temples were afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for the Preſervation of their <hi>Holy Fire,</hi> which was always kept burning; tho' even then their Temples were open at the Top. Their Doctrines are believed to be older than ZOROASTER, and he lived about the Time of ROMULUS. They were equally revered by Princes and People; and ſeem'd to have had the ſame Power and Influence, as the PROPHETS among the <hi>Jews.</hi> They were famed for their Knowledge in the Arts of <hi>Divination</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury;</hi> and made great Uſe of <hi>Charms.</hi> The Scripture bears Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Skill in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> by the Obſervations they made upon that STAR which appeared at the Birth of CHRIST. The Poſterity of theſe MAGI are ſtill extant in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and are diſtinguiſhed by the Name of PARSSES. They call themſelves FOLLOWERS of ZOROASTER; and have preſerved the Religion and Belief of the ancient MAGI, with little Alteration, to this Day. We are indebted to the Induſtry and laudable Curioſity of MR. DU PERRON, for the beſt and moſt genuine Account we have, of the Rites and Opinions of theſe PARSSES. This Gentleman, a few Years ago, voluntarily undertook a Voyage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> in order to learn the <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of the PARSSES, from the PARSSES themſelves; and to diſcover and tranſlate at the Fountain Head, the ZENDOVESTA, or <hi>Writings</hi> generally attributed to ZO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROASTER. After travelling ſome Time over <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> for Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in Order to collect Materials, he fixed his Reſidence at <hi>Surat,</hi> where he continued three Years, ſtudying thoſe Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in which their <hi>Sacred Books</hi> are written, and which are now no more ſpoken or underſtood, except by a few of their LEARNED. At <hi>Surat</hi> he purchaſed a great many of their Original <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> which he partly copied, and partly tranſlated.

            <p>Of PODALIRIUS, we are told, that on his Return from the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> being fortunately driven upon the Coaſt of <hi>Caria,</hi> he cured the Daughter of DAMAETHUS, King of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

as a Reward for his Skill and Services. This is the firſt Inſtance on Record of <hi>Venoeſection,</hi> or Bleeding with a medicinal Intention.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> in early Times imitated the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in bringing their Sick into the moſt public Places, for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They carried them ſometimes too into their Temples, to be there directed to a Cure, by the ſuppoſed Influence of their Deities in Dreams, or by the Management and Attendance of their Prieſts or Devotees who came to worſhip: And when a Cure was effected, the Hiſtory of the Caſe, and the particular Method of Treatment by which the Sick recovered, were engraved o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> written upon Tables, and hung up againſt the Walls and Pillars of the Temple; both as a Memorial of the Patients Gratitude; and to inſtruct others, who might thereafter labour under the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. From theſe Tables it is ſaid that HIPPOCRATES after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards acquired great Knowledge, by collecting them from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Places, and with the Aſſiſtance of his own Obſervations and Practice, digeſting them into that Regularity and Order ſo juſtly admired in his Writings.</p>
            <p>Many <hi>Medical Schools</hi> were erected at different Times in <hi>Greece,</hi> and alſo by her Colonies, in various Parts of the World. From that of <hi>Crotone,</hi> the celebrated DAMOCEDES, had the good Fortune to cure DARIUS King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> of an obſtinate Diſorder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had baffled the Endeavours of his own Phyſicians; for which he was loaded by that Prince with great Wealth and Honors, and was poſſeſſed ever afterwards of his Confidence and Friendſhip. But that of <hi>Coos</hi> excelled all others in Fame, by giving to the World the immortal HIPPOCRATES; whoſe Reputation was ſo great, that not only his own Countrymen, the <hi>Coans,</hi> impreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Image upon their public Coins; but all <hi>Greece,</hi> by common Suffrage decreed him the ſame Honours as were paid to <hi>Hercules.</hi> The <hi>Athenians,</hi> the politeſt and moſt learned of all the <hi>Graecian</hi> States, made him free of their City, voted him a Crown of Gold, and Maintenance to him and his Poſterity, at the public Expence. And in ſuch Repute was the Profeſſion in his Time, that, when taught to a Pupil, a more than filial Gratitude and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rpetual Obedience were required from him to his Maſter or Teacher; inaſmuch as his Birth or Initiation into thoſe learned and uſeful Myſteries, was thought of ſuperior Import to that of Nature: The <hi>Oath</hi> exacted by HIPPOCRATES from his Pupils, is a Proof of this; and has ſerved as a Model for thoſe ſolemn Obligations uſually adminiſtred to GRADUATES in <hi>Medicine,</hi> in all regular <hi>Univerſities,</hi> ever ſince. The <hi>Athenians</hi> held the HEALING ART of ſuch Conſequence to the Public, that they paſſed a Law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Women, and ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

alſo decreed public Honours and diſtinguiſhed Privileges to PHYSICIANS.</p>
            <p>Thus we find the greateſt PHILOSOPHERS of Antiquity, were proud of the Name and Reputation of being ſkilled in Medicine. PYTHAGORAS, who has been already mentioned, erected a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal School in <hi>Italy,</hi> 550 Years before CHRIST; and both he, and DEMOCRITUS wrote upon the Virtues of Herbs. The divine PLATO wrote upon the <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Medicine,</hi> and particularly <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology,</hi> or the OEconomy of the human Body. ARISTOTLE being deſcended from AESCULAPIUS, conſidered the SCIENCE as his Birth-right; he therefore not only ſtudied, but practiſed it with ſuch Succeſs, that having recovered his Pupil the great ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER from a Pit of Sickneſs, this Monarch, ever ambitious of excelling, prevailed with his Matter to inſtruct him too in that uſeful SCIENCE; and which PLUTARCH tells us, the King after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thought not unbecoming his Dignity to communicate to others: When this Prince was ſick at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> in Conſequence of unſeaſonably bathing in the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> the noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Confidence with which he treated his Phyſician PHILIP, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had received Notice from PARMENIO to beware of him as a Traitor, is not more a Proof of his own Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, than of the high Opinion he entertained of his Phyſicians Skill and Integrity. ALEXANDER's Situation here was critical, himſelf unable to act; DARIUS advancing faſt upon him; being therefore equally impatient of Doubts as of Delay, he preſented PARMENIO's Letter with one Hand to PHILIP, while with the other he took down the medicated Potion prepared for him: Nor was he deceived in the Event. THEOPHRASTUS alſo, and many other <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of Antiquity, both practiſed and wrote upon <hi>Phyſick.</hi> At <hi>Smyrna,</hi> another <hi>Graecian</hi> Colony in the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> PHYSICIANS were held in ſuch Repute and public Eſtimation, that, as we are informed by the learned DOCTOR MEAD, their Names were impreſſed upon their public Coins, with thoſe of their <hi>Praetors</hi> or chief Magiſtrates; they were even frequently joined in their Medals, with their tutelar Deities: Nor did they confine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>In ſhort, the medical Abilities of the <hi>Greeks</hi> continued une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, during the whole Courſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sovereignty; and even after its Declenſion: And the learned FREIND obſerves, that if we compare any of the <hi>Greek</hi> medical Writers, from HIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POCRATES to PAULUS AEGINETA of the 7th Century, with the very beſt of their Cotemporaries in any Art or Profeſſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011338_0034_0F85807CB1159128"/>
we ſhall find them not at all inferior, either in the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Matter, the Clearneſs of their Reaſoning, or the Propriety of their Language. Some have written above the Standard of the Age they lived in; and many have done great Honour to this Profeſſion, by their extenſive Knowledge in other Arts and Sciences, as well as their own. The Integrity of the Ancients was ſuch, that altho' their Credulity was ſometimes an Impeachment to their Underſtandings, yet, being above the little Views of private Intereſt, and acting up to the Character of their Profeſſion; whatever they could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> out by their own Experience, or from the Obſervations of others, which might relieve their Fellow Creatures, they candidly and generouſly made it public. This was the Practice of the Antients, and ought to be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Model for ſuch of their Succeſſors, as would imitate them, either in their Knowledge, or their Virtues. Their medical Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were evidently the Reſult of long Practice, accurate Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſolid judgement. Hence an univerſal and deſerved Deference is paid to their A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thority, by every Practitioner, who deſires to comprehend the whole Circle of this Science, or to diſtinguiſh himſelf by Abilities in his Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The CARTHAGINIANS were a Colony of the <hi>Phaenicians;</hi> and as there was an uninterrupted Amity and Correſpondence kept up between theſe Republicks, while either could be of Uſe to the other, we cannot doubt that they were well acquainted with all the Learning and Arts of the Country they came from. They had alſo frequent Intercourſe with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> while at the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of their Glory for Arts and Arms; and while MEDICINE was both a faſhionable Part of Philoſophy, and followed as a Profeſſion: For we find that their <hi>Lacedemon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

What Progreſs the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> themſelves had made in the HEALING ART, cannot now be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained; by Reaſon of the barbarous Policy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in deſtroying their hiſtorical Monuments and Records.

            <p>The ROMANS are the only Nation of Antiquity who enjoy'd a Form of Government, for ſeveral Centuries, without any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of MEDICINE. This is the more ſurprizing, as they appear from their Origin to have been a reſtleſs, quarrelſome People, perpetually embroiled in bloody Diſſenſions at Home, or in cruel

Wars abroad; when the <hi>Healing Art,</hi> particularly CHIRURGEY, muſt have been extremely neceſſary. In the 350th Year of their City, there was certainly no Practitioner, at leaſt of Merit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; for being them grievouſly afflicted with the Plague, they, by the Advice of the Oracle at <hi>Delphi,</hi> ſent ten Deputies to the Temple of AESCULAPIUS at <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> to bring the God to <hi>Rome.</hi> His Godſhip, as we are told, was pleaſed to go along with them, in the Shape of a Serpent; and having quitted the Veſſel and gone aſhore on an Iſland in the <hi>Tyber,</hi> near the City, a Temple was there erected to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> upon which the Plague ceaſed. Hither the Sick from all Parts of <hi>Italy</hi> reſorted, or ſent for Relief. The Method of recording Cures, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was long practiſed here too, as PLINY teſtifies: And HIERONYMUS MERCURIALIS has preſerved to us ſome Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions written in the Reign of ANTONINUS, and found in this Temple of ESCULAPIUS; where not only the Cures effected, but alſo the Remedies preſcribed by the Oracle are recorded. In the Ruins of this Temple, not long ago, was diſcovered one of the Marble Tables which had been conſecrated to this Deity; upon which are ingraved in Greek Characters, ſeveral Cures performed by his Advice; and which is ſtill preſerved as a great Curioſity, in the Palace of MAPHEO at <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis indeed allow'd that, for nearly the firſt five hundred Years of their City, few or no Veſtiges of any Kind of polite Literature, are to be found amongſt them. Before this Period, they ſeem to have reſembled rather a turbulent, licentious, and ill aſſociated Community, with reſpect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and a vindictive, haughty, and unrelenting Band of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, with reſpect to the neighbouring Nations; than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors of thoſe, who were one Day to give Law to, and diffuſe the Polite Arts with new Luſtre over the World. The Accounts of their Tranſactions, as related by their own Hiſtorians, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently countenance this Opinion; which might probably have been the general Belief at this Day concerning them, if their rival States had been equally fortunate, in tranſmitting to us their own Hiſtories, together with their Sentiments and Portrait, of the Policy, and leading Characters of that imperious and proud Republic; ſo as that Poſterity, unbiaſſed by partial Evidence, might have judged for themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However, we are aſſured that this SCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE was encouraged, as early as any Kind of Learning was taught amongſt them: For about, or a few Years after the <hi>AEra</hi> abovementioned, we have an Account of one ARCHAGATHUS, a <hi>Phyſician</hi> of great Reputation, who came from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he was honoured with the Freedom of the City, and a Houſe given him to dwell in. Some Time after him, lived ASCLEPIADES the <hi>Bithynian,</hi> Phyſician to CRASSUS; no leſs reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Great for his Eloquence, than for his Skill in PHYSIC. It is very remarkable, that from the firſt Introduction of public Schools at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Subverſion of this unweildly and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011338_0036_0F858080EADE8C60"/>
Republic, by the ſuperior Fortunes of the great CAESAR, almoſt every Profeſſion or Art then ſtudied or practiſed amongſt them, except that of War, was chiefly taught by ſuch <hi>Greeks,</hi> as had emigrated thither for the Sake of Curioſity or Gain; or by ſuch as the Fate of Arms had reduced to Servitude: For the fierce and warlike Temper of her own Citizens, unlike the more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and elevated Genius of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> deigned not as yet to profeſs any Science, except ſuch as tended to gratify their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Conqueſt, or to lead and rule the People. While the <hi>Romans</hi> thus had little other Knowledge of PHYSIC, than what was practiſed by Captives and Foreigners, or ſerved only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the Price of a Slave, we cannot wonder that it ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſpoke of by their Learned, in very inadequate Terms: VIRGIL at one Time ſeems to conſider it as a mere manual Occupation<note n="*" place="bottom">Mutas agitare, inglorius, Artes.</note>; yet this great POET tells us, that his Hero's <hi>Phyſician</hi> JAPIS, preferred the Knowledge of <hi>Medicine,</hi> to that of <hi>Divination, Archery,</hi> or <hi>Muſic;</hi> all which APOLLO had put equally in his Election<note n="†" place="bottom">—Scire Poteſtates Herbarum, uſumque medendi Maluit.

            <p>VALENTINIAN ordained that there ſhould be a PHYSICIAN for each of the 14 Wards into which <hi>Rome</hi> was divided, to take Care of the Poor; and who ſhould be paid at the Public Expence. This ſeems to have been the firſt Eſſay towards a Public HOSPITAL. We ſhall here in general obſerve, that many of the <hi>Faculty</hi> lived in the ſtricteſt Intimacy and Friendſhip with the ROMAN Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; that many had ample Salaries allow'd them by thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that many, by the liberal Gratuities given them for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, acquired great Riches, and were the Authors of many

public Benefactions in the Places where they lived; and laſtly, that many, from the Reputation of their univerſal Learning and great Abilities, were employed as Embaſſadors to foreign Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and in the other higheſt Offices of State. But beſides the many and diſtinguiſh'd Honours and Privileges from Time to Time conferred upon Individuals, the whole Profeſſion was held in ſuch Eſteem, that great Immunities were alſo granted to their <hi>Schools</hi> or COLLEGES, as well as to themſelves. They were by the public Edicts of ANTONINUS, CONSTANTINE the GREAT, and JULIAN, exempted from all the uſual Duties of Citizens, or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, from attending Courts, or entertaining public Officers and Strangers; and every one was forbid to moleſt them, under the Penalty of being puniſhed at the Will of the Judge: And a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of theſe public Indulgences was extended, even to the Wives and Children of ſuch uſeful Members to the Common-Weal. Nor was the Fame of their PPYSICIANS always confined to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits even of this vaſt Empire; for when a Peace was negotiating between the Emperor JUSTINIAN, and CHOSROES King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> this laſt would not even agree to a Truce, but upon this expreſs Condition, that the <hi>Phyſician</hi> TRIBUNUS, whoſe Aſſiſtance he wanted, and whoſe Skill he was acquainted with, ſhould be ſent to him; which JUSTINIAN having comply'd with, a Truce was granted for 5 Years. CHOSROES, being reſtored to Health by the Care of TRIBUNUS, offered to give him whatever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: But the generous Phyſician only deſired that ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Captives, his Countrymen, ſhould be ſet at Liberty: That gallant PRINCE not only releaſed the Perſons required, and 3000 Priſoners beſides, but alſo rewarded him with great Preſents; and ſent him back in Safety to his own Country.</p>
            <p>About this Time the MEDICAL SCHOOL of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was ſo celebrated thro' the learned World, that to have been educated there, was alone ſufficient to give the Reputation of great Skill in PHYSIC.

            <p>Before I diſmiſs this Enquiry into the <hi>State</hi> of PHYSIC among the Antient Nations; I muſt requeſt the Reader's Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one more Seminary of learned Men, not leſs remarkable for their Antiquity, the Regularity of their COLLEGES, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of their Doctrines, their Learning, and popular Influence, than any yet ſpoken of: I mean the BRITISH DRUIDS. As
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011338_0038_0F85808333A67538"/>
theſe Men, beſides their other Functions, were alſo in their Day, the ſole <hi>Practitioners</hi> of PHYSIC; and from Circumſtances of Place, ſeem to hold ſome diſtant Connection with ourſelves; I hope I ſhall be indulged in being ſomewhat particular in the following Account of them: As indeed the Advances made by them in the other Branches of Literature, are the only Rule we have, whereby to judge of their Progreſs in MEDICINE.</p>
            <p>The DRUIDS, by ſome called SEMNOTHEANS, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as <hi>reverence the</hi> GODS, were poſſeſſed of the ſame Influence and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among the <hi>Celtes,</hi> and other <hi>Gallic</hi> Tribes, as the <hi>Perſian Magi;</hi> or as the <hi>Prophets</hi> among the JEWS; who are well known to have been often too powerful, for Royalty itſelf. The firſt Account we have of them by that Name, is from CAESAR, who in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries deſcribes them as a COLLEGE, or ſelect Claſs of religious <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> having fix'd Places of Worſhip; as govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by particular and eſtabliſhed Regulations, and ſubjected to one certain Head or ARCHDRUID, who reſided in <hi>Britain:</hi> To which Place, he ſays, all the Noble Youth of the Continental <hi>Gauls,</hi> were uſually ſent for their Education. As they knew not the Uſe of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, before their Intercourſe with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they committed all their Learning to Memory, and delivered it to their Pupils in Verſe. They were ſo called from DERU, which in the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Language ſignifies an OAK; becauſe the OAK was always held ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred by them; becauſe they always worſhiped in Groves of OAK, upon gently elevated Places; and becauſe they never perform'd any of their religious Functions without it. The MISLETOE of the OAK was in a particular Manner revered by them, and gathered at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Seaſons, with great Parade and Ceremony: They believed this to be an infallible Cure for Barrenneſs; an Antidote to Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; a Preſervative againſt Witchcraft; and a powerful Remedy in all Diſeaſes whatever. In ſome old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Books ſtill extant, are to be found many of the <hi>Medical Secrets,</hi> uſually practiſed by the DRUIDS, in their Treatment of various Maladies; and it need not be doubted, that many of the ſtrange Cures and Charms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended at this Day, for different Complaints, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People of the HEBRIDES or <hi>Weſtern Iſlands,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are from the ſame Origin. They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the Powers of <hi>natural Bodies,</hi> and particularly in the Properties of <hi>Plants,</hi> and gave great Application to ſuch Studies; whence they were conſtantly conſulted in all bodily Infirmities and Sickneſs, by all Ranks of People: The SILAGO, a Species of <hi>Moſs</hi> which grows upon Trees, was alſo a ſovereign Remedy with them, eſpecially for Diſeaſes of the Eyes; as was alſo the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molus,</hi> a Species of the <hi>Water-Brook-Lime.</hi> They were much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to <hi>Magick, Incantations,</hi> and <hi>Charms;</hi> and were highly eſteem'd, even by the Romans, for their Skill in <hi>Divination</hi> and <hi>Augury.</hi> They were great <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> and 'tis ſaid, could cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011338_0039_0F858083ABD37B80"/>
Eclipſes. They were indeed well verſed in all thoſe Arts, by which the Terror and Amazement of the Vulgar are uſually excited; and by which the beneficial Belief, of their being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of Supernatural Powers, could be kept up. The <hi>Learned</hi> have found much Reſemblance between the <hi>Britiſh</hi> DRUIDS, and the <hi>Perſian</hi> MAGI, in their religious Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ets, Modes of Worſhip, Learning, and Dreſs. The DRUIDS acknowledged the Exiſtence of one Supreme God, uncreated, and unconfined; whom they therefore adored in the open Air, in conſecrated Groves, but never in covered Temples. They admitted however of inferior Deities: Thus, TARANUS was their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> having Power over the Heavens: HAESUS was their <hi>Mars,</hi> or God of War: TEU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATES was their <hi>Mercury,</hi> who preſided over Arts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and was the Guide of Travellers. But their principal Adoration was directed to APOLLO, or the SUN; as the God of <hi>Light, Heat,</hi> and PHYSIC. To the SUN they offered grand year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifices on the firſt Day of <hi>May;</hi> at which Time all domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Fires were every where extinguiſhed, and the People went to receive holy Fire from the DRUIDS, at their Temples, or Places of Worſhip; to rekindle their houſehold Fires. This Deity or God-like Luminary, was by the DRUIDS of <hi>S. Britain,</hi> called BELIN; and the principal Seat of his Worſhip, was in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey:</hi> But the <hi>Caledonian</hi> DRUIDS gave him the Name of GRIAN, ſignifying the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Heat;</hi> and worſhipped him at particular Seaſons, by making large Fires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tops of Hills. There are many Remains of the <hi>Druidical</hi> Temples, ſtill to be ſeen in <hi>Angleſey,</hi> in the <hi>Weſtern Iſles</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in ſeveral other Places; conſiſting of long, large, and rude ſingle Stones placed on End in the Ground, at regular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and in a circular Form; with an Avenue of the ſame Contrivance, leading up to it. They alſo paid great Veneration to the MOON; whoſe Temples were conſtructed in like Manner, but of a ſemicircular Form; as appears by the Veſtiges of ſome of them, ſtill obſervable in the North of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Muſic, both Vocal and Inſtrumental, was a conſtant Attendant upon all their religious Rites; and their Inſtruments were <hi>Pipes, Flutes,</hi> and <hi>Harps.</hi> It does not appear that they ever uſed any Images in their Worſhip: From which and other Circumſtances, it ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they borrow'd nothing from the <hi>Greeks;</hi> tho' it may be reaſonably ſuſpected, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have been indebted for ſome things to the DRUIDS. Their Authority was ſo great, and ſo devoutly ſupported, that their Excommunications were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even to their Princes; ſo that the Nobles, generally from Prudence as well as Inclination, procured themſelves to be initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into their Myſteries, and frequently, to be enroll'd among them. As they had the ſole Direction in all religious Matters, no Sacrifice, whether Public or Private, could be perform'd but by a DRUID. They were alſo the ſole Judges in all Controverſies
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011338_0040_0F85808460647330"/>
reſpecting Property: No Law could be enacted without their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: They had the greateſt Influence in all public Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: And, like the <hi>Spartan Ephori,</hi> they could controul the chief Rulers of the Nation. They offered up human Sacrifices in Times of imminent Danger, or great Diſtreſs; for which Reaſon it is ſaid, that SUETONIUS PAULINUS under NERO, utterly deſtroyed their Groves and Temples in <hi>South-Britain:</hi> But the true Reaſon ſeems to have been, their great Influence with the People, in ſpiriting them up to defend their Liberties, againſt the unmerited Incroachments and arbitrary Sway of the <hi>Romans:</hi> For ſuch Sacrifices could be no more reproachful in the DRUIDS, than in the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves; who, in no very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Period, had countenanced the like Cruelties: It was only in the 657th Year of the City, and in the Conſulate of LENTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUS and CRASSUS, that human Sacrifices were forbidden at <hi>Rome:</hi> Till then they had been occaſionally authoriſed there; and we meet with ſeveral Inſtances of the like Practices among the <hi>Romans,</hi> long after that Period, in different Parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Indeed we find frequent Examples of this barbarous Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, among moſt Nations, in their Infant State; from the choſen People of God, to the profeſſed Objects of his Vengeance in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> and from the more enlightened <hi>Greeks,</hi> to the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ill fated <hi>Mexicans.</hi> The Deſtruction of the DRUIDS in <hi>North-Britain,</hi> was more gradual, owing to civil Broils, and the Reſentment of Parties contending for Power; they having eſpous'd the weaker Side. Tradition informs us, that there were ſome Remains of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that Time when the firſt Chriſtians fled thither, from the <hi>Roman</hi> Perſecutions: Where theſe pious Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, from their ſequeſtered Life in Caves, and other hidden Places, were called CULDEES; and from the Similiarity of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, being not eaſily diſtinguiſh'd by the Natives from the proſcribed DRUIDS, they have been frequently confounded by Poſterity. They believed the Immortalily of the Soul; and the <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> from one human Body to another, under certain Circumſtances: And they allowed of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments. They uſually burnt the dead Bodies of their Friends, and preſerv'd their Aſhes in earthen Pots, buried under great CAIRNS, or Heaps of Stones: Some of theſe Pots or Urns have lately been dug up, from under theſe CAIRNS, in the <hi>Weſt Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Druidical</hi> Functions were often here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary; and their Females, called DRUIDESSES, were no leſs famous for Divination, than the DRUIDS themſelves.</p>
            <p>The pious and peaceful HYPERBORAEANS, ſo often mentioned by the old <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, were undoubtedly the <hi>Celtic</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> DRUIDS; for as what they tell us of theſe HYPERBORAEANS, cannot be apply'd with any Juſtice, either to the <hi>Scythians,</hi> or <hi>Scandinavians,</hi> there is no other Claſs of Men yet known, who
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011338_0041_0F8580851BAE5590"/>
agree with their Deſcription and Situation, but the DRUIDS. They tell us, that the HYPERBORAEANS inhabited a large I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>land, with many leſſer Iſlands about it, lying to the N. W. of <hi>Europe,</hi> beyond <hi>Gaul,</hi> and in the great <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean; and that LATONA, the Mother of APOLLO, was born there: That APOLLO was the great Object of their Worſhip; ſo that after having finiſh'd the Building of the Walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> he is ſaid by PINDAR, to have haſtened to the HYPERBORAEANS: That theſe Iſlands were frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ghoſts of departed Heroes, and by friendly GENII, who revealed future Events in Dreams; and that one of theſe ſmaller Iſlands, was the peaceful Retreat of old CRONUS or SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURN, after he had been deprived of his Sovereignty by JUPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER: Perhaps the preſent Notion, that ſome People in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Parts, are poſſeſſed of what is called the SECOND SIGHT, or a Power of predicting certain <hi>diſaſtrous</hi> Events, is a Remnant of the old <hi>Druidical</hi> Doctrines and Superſtitions, and of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in friendly GENII, or guardian Spirits. The Fertility of the Soil, Temperature of the Climate, and happy Situation of the Inhabitants of theſe <hi>Hyperboraean</hi> Iſlands, were highly celebrated by many ancient Writers. They ſay that they were a religious, temperate, long lived, hoſpitable, hardy, and vigorous Race of People; that they were ſubject to few Diſeaſes; that they lived chiefly on Vegetabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and were infeſted with no Wars: That frequent Embaſſies of Young Men and Virgins, crowned with Laurel, and cloathed in White, had from Time to Time been ſent from theſe ISLANDS, with Offerings of FIRST FRUITS, wrapped in Wheat Straw, and having their Inſtruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, to the Temple of APOLLO, in the Iſland of <hi>Delos;</hi> where LATONA is fabled to have been delivered of him, and his Siſter DIANA. Now ANACHARSIS ſays, that his Country-Men the <hi>Scythians</hi> deteſted the Uſe of Inſtruments of Muſic in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and Laurel was not then known to exiſt in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> or <hi>Scandinavia:</hi> Beſides, when <hi>Rome</hi> was ſacked by the <hi>Gauls</hi> under BRENNUS, it was the general Report in <hi>Greece,</hi> that this City had been taken by an Army of Foreigners, from the Country of the HYPERBORAEANS.</p>
            <p>This Intercourſe between <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Country of the HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERBORAEANS, has been traced up to about the Time of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> War: So that ABARIS, the celebrated HYPERBORAEAN PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSOPHER, and PRIEST of APOLLO, who came to <hi>Athens</hi> about 550 Years before CHRIST, to renew this Correſpondence, and to viſit <hi>Delos,</hi> could be none other than a DRUID, and probably too from the <hi>Weſtern Iſles</hi> of Britain. DIOCENES LAERTIUS obſerves, that it was the Opinion of many learned Men, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> acquired their Philoſophy from the BARBARIANS; among whom he names the DRUIDS: And it is allow'd, that the HYPERBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAEANS firſt taught the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that the Earth was <hi>Spherical,</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011338_0042_0F858085E8B8AAD8"/>
ſituated in the Center of the World; whence it is conjectured, that what they called the SPHAERE of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> was a Form or Machine contrived by the HYPERBORAEANS, for the eaſier In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Pupils in <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi> Beſides, as the Images uſed by moſt Nations, to repreſent the happy State of Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, are uſually drawn from Subjects which were the principal Part of their Delights in this World; ſo the HYPERBORAEANS, according to PLATO, among other Things, promiſed in their PARADISE or ELYSIUM, the fineſt Fruits of every Seaſon, Choirs of Dancers, Theatres of Poets, vocal and inſtrumental Muſic, public Feſtivals, Banquets, and SCHOOLS of PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHERS: All which are in every Reſpect conformable to the known Rites, Uſages, and Belief of the DRUIDS. Thus, the DRUIDS being generally deſcended of the beſt Families, the Honours of their Birth, joined with thoſe of their Functions, and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their great Learning, procured them the higheſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Authority, among all the <hi>Gallic</hi> Nations: And it is natural to believe, that ſuch a Set of Men, under ſuch a regular Inſtitution, continually employ'd in the Search of Knowledge, and communicating their Diſcoveries from Age to Age, muſt have made great Improvements in PHYSIC, ASTRONOMY, MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEMATICS, PHILOSOPHY, and the other SCIENCES; according as their Studies or Reſearches were directed.</p>
            <p>There was alſo another Order of <hi>Prieſt</hi> among them, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be inferior to the DRUIDS; called EUBATES, or FAIDS; whence the VATES of the <hi>Latins.</hi> Theſe likewiſe ſtudied the ſublime Myſteries of Nature, and pretended to be inſpired: There are ſome Veſtiges of their <hi>Name,</hi> among the <hi>Highland Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The BARDS were a Set of Men, inferior to both DRUIDS, and FAIDS: They were the Diſciples of the DRUIDS; but they were no Prieſts, nor interfered with religious Matters: Their Perſons however were every where ſacred, among the old <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Gallic</hi> Nations, and they were the uſual HERALDS of State, between contending Chiefs. They were by Profeſſion POETS, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd on Subjects merely mortal; and who celebrated in Songs, the Genealogies of the Great, and the Gallant Deeds of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Warriors: Nor were the ſofter Paſſions forgot in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as is evident from theſe genuine and invaluable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of ancient Poetry, aſcribed to OSSIAN: They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Taxes, and all public Duties, both Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: They frequently went from Place to Place, repeating their Songs for Hire, like the <hi>Scandinavian</hi> SCALDS; or rather like the AOIDOI <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> among whom ſome have claſſed the immortal HOMER himſelf. The BARDS at laſt came to be retained in the Families of the Great, as Implements of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011338_0043_0F858086C1A470D0"/>
State: Their Function became hereditary; Lands were aſſigned to their Office in Perpetuity; and they continued in the higheſt Eſtimation with the antient Natives, for many Ages after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the DRUIDS; as appears from OSSIAN'S Poems, and the Traces of that Profeſſion ſtill extant, in ſome remote Parts of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worthy of Remark, that all the ancient Nations, who firſt cultivated or made any conſiderable Improvements in ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICINE, have either attributed the firſt Diſcovery of it to their GODS; or have deified the Inventors. Such Sentiments at leaſt ſhow the high Veneration they had for this uſeful Profeſſion; and how beneficial and neceſſary they believed it to be, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Happineſs of Mankind. HIPPOCRATES obſerves, that this Belief of the divine Origin of PHYSIC, was not only conſonant to the general Opinions of the World in his Time; but alſo, he thinks, agreeable to Reaſon. In ſhort, all Nations, as they emerged from Barbariſm and Ignorance, and improved in civil Polity and Knowledge, have encouraged and reſpected the Learned in the HEALING ART; as the Friends and Benefactors of Society, and of Mankind. They rewarded their Services while living, with a Liberality almoſt beyond Belief; and revered their Memories after Death, not more honourably by monumental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, Medals, and Statues; than gratefully, by continuing their public Benefactio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, even to their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Let us next view the State of the MEDICINAL PROFESSION, among certain foreign Nations, who, tho' <hi>Ancient</hi> as to their Origin and Government, may yet be conſidered as <hi>Modern,</hi> with Reſpect to our Acquaintance with them.</p>
            <p>The CHINESE have applied themſelves to the Study of MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINE, from the very Infancy of their Empire; and they have a great Number of ancient Authors, upon that Subject. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not only much reſpected among them; but their own Phyſicians alſo are juſtly eſteemed, for their Sagacity and ſingular Acuteneſs in diſtinguiſhing Diſeaſes, and forming Prognoſticks by the Pulſe; tho' they pay great Attention to the Tongue, Eyes, Voice, and Complexion of the Patient, at the ſame Time, in forming their Opinions: From the Manners of the Country, they are ſometimes obliged to find out Diſtempers by the Pulſe alone; for many of the great Men will not permit their Wives to be ſeen or ſpoke to, but only to put their Arms thro' a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in Order for the Phyſician to feel the Pulſe. DU HALDE has given us a particular Account of their Method of judging by the Pulſe, with their various Obſervations and Diſtinctions concerning it. Their <hi>Herbal</hi> is very copious, and contains many Simples not known in <hi>Europe;</hi> from which they form a Variety of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011338_0044_0F85808766094A18"/>
Compoſitions. The ſame Author gives us ſeveral Specimens of their Preſcriptions, both ſimple and compound; and aſſures us, that they are as expert in curing Diſeaſes with their Medicine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>There is an Anecdote mentioned in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtories, which, while it proves their high Eſtimation of the HEALING ART, yet greatly invalidates the boaſted Antiquity of their <hi>Chronology:</hi> They tell us that CHI-HOAM-TI, acknowledged to be one of their greateſt Monarchs, being intereſted in the Deſtruction of all the ancient hiſtorical Records, and of thoſe who preſerved the Memory of them, cauſed all Books to be burnt, except ſuch as treated of AGRICULTURE, and MEDICINE; in Hopes that his own Actions might eclipſe all thoſe of his Predeceſſors in the Empire. This happened about 213 Years before CHRIST. As the Uſe of Paper was not known, the <hi>Chineſe</hi> then wrote their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon wooden Tablets, or little Plates of <hi>Bamboo,</hi> which could not eaſily be ſecreted or concealed; and therefore it is imagined, that this Deſtruction of their hiſtorical Monuments, muſt have been pretty complete: And that they can have few if any authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Records, anterior to that Period. This Emperor built the

As to their National Character, they are juſt in their Dealings; faithful to their Promiſes; civil to Strangers admitted among them; and of ſtrict Veracity: They have but one Language, and one Meaſure over all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Their Laws are every where uniform, and duely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Property is well ſecured, and generally hereditary; Perjury, Theft, and Gaming for Money, are puniſhed with Death: They are remarkably fond of Muſic, and admit it to all their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. They are not permitted to leave their Country, on any Pretence; and if they do, they can never return. In State Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, the Emperor generally orders the Nobleman in Diſgrace, to be his own Executioner, on an appointed Day: This is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Indulgence, and always complied with: But the Kindred and Friends of the Criminal, are frequently involved in his Fate.

None however are allowed to write or publiſh Books, but their DAIRO, or <hi>Chief Prieſt,</hi> with his Family, and Deſcendants, who for this Reaſon, are particularly induced to apply themſelves to Learning. The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> PHYSICIANS

make very little Uſe of Bleeding: And in violent Pains, or Spaſmodic Affections, they uſe <hi>Acupuncture;</hi> or burn MOXA upon the Parts affected: This Practice is alſo followed by the <hi>Chineſe</hi> in the like Complaints, as well as in the Gout.</p>
            <p>The State of Phyſic among the BRAMINS, and Inhabitants of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> has been already taken Notice of. We ſhall only add here, that they uſually divide Diſeaſes into certain Claſſes; and that their PHYSICIANS confine themſelves to one or two of ſuch Claſſes, that they may excell in thoſe they particularly profeſs. They are very exact and punctilious with Regard to Regimen; and have a particular Regimen for moſt Diſeaſes. They have ſome Knowledge of CHYMISTRY; and make frequent Uſe of Medicines prepared by Fire. They have a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> in which is contained all their <hi>Medicinal Knowledge.</hi> Their PROG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOSTICKS are much influenced, by ſuperſtitious Obſervations. They are very nice in their Choice of Medicines, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preſerving them. They carefully conſider both the <hi>Pulſe</hi> and <hi>Excretions,</hi> in order to form juſt Notions of Diſeaſes; but they were ignorant of ANATOMY, or the CIRCULATION of the BLOOD, when firſt viſited by the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Iſland of CEYLON, the Practice of PHYSIC, as well as their Modes of Worſhip, and religious Tenets, are very ſimilar to thoſe of the MOGUL Nations, and Bramins. They make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Uſe of ſtrongly purgative <hi>Simples;</hi> and apply ſteeped <hi>Pepper</hi> outwardly, in all Complaints of the Bowels. The <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> is alſo much uſed here in Medicine; and the Iſland abounds with various Drugs, and valuable Spiceries.</p>
            <p>In the Iſland of AMBOYNA, they are remarkably expert in the Knowlege of poiſonous Plants; and not leſs ſo, in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of their Antidotes. The Natives of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> in general, particularly of the Iſlands, are chiefly ſtudious of the noxious Properties of Vegetables; tho' it muſt be owned, that they are alſo well acquainted with many ſalutary and Medicinal Productions.</p>
            <p>In SIAM, the <hi>Practice</hi> of MEDICINE conſiſts in adminiſtering a certain Number of Receits, which have been handed down from their Anceſtors; and which, like our modern Quacks, they apply at Random, without Regard to the different Cauſes, or diſtinguiſhing Symptoms of Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Among the TARTARS of THIBET, the LAMAS or Prieſts are their only PHYSICIANS. They preſcribe the moſt common <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and chiefly ſuch as are uſed in <hi>China.</hi> We are aſſured, that ſome of them are well acquainted with the Methods of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

The <hi>Tartars</hi> believe their chief LAMA, to be a living Deity ever preſent with them; and accordingly worſhip him ſeated upon an Altar in their Temple, whenever he pleaſes to ſhow himſelf for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: They believe that he never dies, but only changes his Perſon, or the Body the chooſes to inhabit, as ſuits his Inclination: The Vulgar have the ſame Notions, with Reſpect to their ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Lamas. The LAMA of <hi>Thibet,</hi> like the <hi>Roman Pontif,</hi> is Supreme both in Spiritual and Temporal Affairs; and is often viſited by diſtant Princes, to receive his Bleſſing, and Remiſſion of their Sins.</p>
            <p>The ARABIANS were long acquainted with the Practical Part of MEDICINE, before the Foundation of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire: 'Tis believed, that their Prophet MAHOMET had ſome Knowledge of MEDICINE himſelf; and that therefore it was ever afterwards highly eſteemed, by his Succeſſors in the <hi>Caliphat.</hi> The <hi>Saracens,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> ſcarce applied themſelves to any Study, beſides that of cultivating their own Language, and underſtanding their own Laws, except PHYSIC; but this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was generally eſteemed among them, as being of univerſal Advantage to Mankind. It was the barbarous Policy of this People, to deſtroy all Books, and other Veſtiges of Literature wherever they carried their Conqueſts: Accordingly, AMROU, having made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and being loath to deſtroy ſo famous and valuable a LIBRARY as he found in that City, ſent to the CALIPH OMAR, to know his Pleaſure; he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Anſwer, that if theſe Books contained the ſame as the CORAN, they could be of no Uſe; and if they advanced any thing contrary to it, they ſhould therefore be burnt. This was accordingly executed, excepting ſuch as treated of MEDICINE; theſe were carefully preſerved from the Conflagration. The Quantity of Volumes which had been collected there, at an immenſe Expence, for a Series of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſtanding this Havoc among the Records of Antiquity, the FATHERS of PHYSIC, as has been ſaid above, found an Aſylum with theſe religious Conquerors. Afterwards, when <hi>Spain,</hi> in the 9th Century, was reduced to the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Yoke, they began to attend to the Arts of Peace, and founded COLLEGES there; to which there was a great Reſort of Students, from all Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> particularly to learn the HEALING ART. The many voluminous Publications of the <hi>Arabian</hi> PHYSICIANS, which for many Years were almoſt the only Books conſulted upon the Subject of <hi>Medicine;</hi> the liberal Rewards and Salaries beſtowed upon them, by their CALIPHS and Princes; the many valuable Additions they have made to the MATERIA MEDICA; and the accurate Deſcriptions they have left us, of ſeveral new Diſeaſes, unknown to former Authors; are not only Teſtimonies of the great Eſteem the Science was held in, by that People, but alſo of the extenſive Knowledge and Abilities of their Practitioners.

By long Experience, they had found out various Herbs and Plants, proper for all kinds of Pains and Diſeaſes; and with which they often effected ſurprizing Cures. The Emperor himſelf not only diſtributed ſuch Plants from his Collection, as had been preſcribed by the Phyſicians, or deſired by the Sick; but would alſo inquire after the Succeſs of the Medicines given; thus, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gratifying his Vanity, or believing that he thereby fulfilled the Obligations of a Sovereign, in taking ſuch Care of the Health of his Subjects. The ſame Author tells us, that CORTES having been ſeized with a violent Fever, and Diſorder in his Brain, at <hi>Tlaſcala,</hi> in Conſequence of a Wound of the Head, which he had received a few Days before, in an Engagement with the <hi>Mexicans;</hi> the Senate of that Republic, ſent for the beſt PHYSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIANS in the Country to his Aſſiſtance: Who, by a wonderful Diſcernment in the Virtues of their Medicinal Herbs, and by varying their Applications, according to the different Turns and Appearances of the Diſtemper, at laſt reſtored him to Health.</p>

            <p>The PERUVIANS, as we are told in the Hiſtory of their INCAS, had ſeveral Medical Secrets and Operations, for various Diſeaſes, which had been tranſmitted from Father to Son; and which they had learned from long Experience: Tho' they had a pretty extenſive Knowlege of Remedies, they had not advanced ſo far in that Branch of Learning, as to have any regular <hi>Theory</hi> reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes, or to have reduced their <hi>Practice</hi> to a SYSTEM. That they had profeſſed Practitioners among them ſeems evident, from reading in the Hiſtory of the Conqueſt of PERU, that ATAUCHI, Brother to the murdered INCA ATABALIBA, having taken ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners, would have ſacrificed them all to his Revenge; but he was afterwards prevailed upon, not only to give them their Lives, in Conſideration of two among them, who had warmly proteſted againſt the INCA'S Murder: But alſo he took Care, ſays our Author, that ſuch as were wounded, ſhould be <hi>cured:</hi> And then he diſmiſſed them with Preſents. By Means of the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> we are become acquainted with ſeveral power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Drugs, particularly <hi>Jeſuits Bark,</hi> and <hi>Ipecacoan;</hi> which are ſtrong Proofs of their Knowledge in the Virtues and Properties of various Plants.</p>
            <p>The warlike <hi>Savages</hi> of NORTH-AMERICA, particularly the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> or five confederate Nations, where they are untainted with the Vices and cozening Arts of the more civilized <hi>Europaeans,</hi> exhibit the moſt ſtriking and genuine Picture of the primitive World, or ſuppoſed State of Nature, to be met with upon the known Face of the Globe. They have no eſtabliſhed Authority among them, hereditary or elective, but ſuch only as is acquired by approved Bravery and Succeſs in War, or by Eloquence in Council: And even this Obedience or Submiſſion to ſuperior Merit, is altogether voluntary; for their SACHEMS o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some diſtant Nations about the upper Lakes, pay Reverence to the SUN: And ſome alſo to the MOON. Some have MANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOOS, or ſmall tutelar Divinities of their own Compoſition, which they carry to War with them in Boxes, and conſult upon particular Emergencies, with ſtrange Ceremonies, and always in the Dark; upon which Occaſions, the <hi>War Captain</hi> generally acts the Conjurer. War and Hunting are the ſole Occupations of the Men; and almoſt every menial Office at Home, or in the Field, is performed by the Women. Whoever firſt Plants a Spot of Land with <hi>Maize</hi> or Indian Corn, poſſeſſes it undiſturbed, as long as he pleaſes; and when he leaves it, which is frequently the Caſe, the next Comer occupies it by the ſame indiſputed Right, <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi> Whence the Migration of Families is both eaſy and frequent among them; and even whole Tribes or Nations, from various Motives, will ſometimes change their Habitations.

            <p>Among the <hi>Negro</hi> Tribes of AFRICA, we are told, that the Practice of MEDICINE conſiſts in the outward Application of certain Herbs or Roots, or Infuſions and Decoctions of them given inwardly: But the REMEDIES they chiefly depend upon, are the Charms, and other Tricks of their <hi>Conjurers.</hi> They are all believed to be ſo very miſchievous, and with all ſo expert in the Uſe of vegetable <hi>Poiſons,</hi> that every obſtinate and uncommon Ailment among them, is uſually ſuppoſed to be the Effect of Poiſon adminiſtred by ſome envious or revengeful <hi>Negro:</hi> 'Tis true, ſuch Accidents too frequently happen; but this Belief is ſo prevalent among the <hi>African</hi> Slaves, that when once a ſick <hi>Negro</hi> is fully impreſſed with ſuch a Notion, he ſeldom recovers. Tho' the extenſive Countries of the <hi>Negroes</hi> are generally, for obvious Reaſons very unhealthy, yet we do not find any where a fixt or uniform Practice in their Cure of Diſeaſes; nor do we know any remarkable Remedies or Drugs which are peculiar to their Climates. It is however worthy of Remark, that, from undoubted Accounts both of Traders and intelligent Natives, ſome of the inland Nations of <hi>Africa</hi> have long had the Practice of INOCULATION for the SMALL POX; but whether this is a Diſcovery of their own, or derived from the more intelligent Nations of ASIA, we know not.</p>
            <p>The Revival of Learning in EUROPE, is in nothing more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable, than by that ardent Attention, and early Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given for improving all the various Branches of the HEALING ART. Many <hi>Medical</hi> COLLEGES were ſoon after this Period en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, and Lecturers appointed, by different Princes in their reſpective Dominions; to which there was a great Reſort of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, from many diſtant Countries; according as the Reputation of the Profeſſors attracted them. From theſe firſt Eſtabliſhments in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> already mentioned, as we approach our own Times, we find the PROFESSION riſing more and more into Fame and Eſtimation, thro' <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> in Proportion as Diſcoveries and Improvements were made, in ANATOMY, CHYMISTRY, BOTANY, and PHYSIOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GY: Till the immortal HARVEY, Phyſician to that great Patron of Learning CHARLES THE FIRST, by his Diſcovery of the CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD, caſt ſuch an inextinguiſhable Light upon this Science, as fixes HERE, the moſt memorable <hi>AEra</hi> in the Hiſtory of PHYSIC, ſince it firſt exiſted as a Profeſſion.

               </gap>alents in particular, than for their exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Knowledge of LETTERS in general. But when we turn our Reſearches from theſe glorious Fields of SCIENCE, to the preſent obſcure and illiterate <hi>Scenes</hi> before us; when we lift our Eyes to theſe towering and enlightened Geniuſes of ancient and modern Days, and afterwards look down to the <hi>favourite</hi> Wonder-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Doctors</hi> of this Place, how wide is the Diſtance between ſuch contraſted Objects? How numerous the Links which connect the Extremes of ſuch a lengthened Chain? The Compariſon, with all Reſpect to thoſe who think differently be it ſaid, is too une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, abſurd, and ridiculous to be ſupported.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude this Inquiry into the ancient and preſent State of PHYSIC, without acknowledging, in Juſtice to the ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICAL FACULTY of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that THEY firſt ſet us the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Example of this Inſtitution in <hi>America;</hi> tho' the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability of inſtructing Youth in this uſeful and learned Profeſſion, among ourſelves, has for many Years been an Object of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation here: Whereby we may in a great Meaſure prevent the future Neceſſity of long and perilous Voyages to EUROPE; as well as large Remittances of Money, which never more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns: Nor indeed is this the only Inſtance of the <hi>wiſe Police</hi> and <hi>public Spirit</hi> of that flouriſhing and well regulated CITY, which deſerves our Imitation.</p>
            <p>The ART of PHYSIC inſtructs us in the Method of preſerving
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011338_0055_0F85808FA50157C8"/>
Health when preſent; and in the Means of reſtoring it when loſt; or how to alleviate the Inconveniencies conſequent upon Health impaired, when a total Cure cannot be effected. This <hi>Art</hi> is by HIPPOCRATES called the NOBLEST of all ARTS; which heals, by adding that which was wanting, and taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what is ſupper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The whole Syſtem of PHYSIC is comprehended under theſe two Denominations, the THEORY, and the PRACTICE. The Nature a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Meaning of the latter is pretty generally underſtood: But the THEORY of PHYSIC, tho' the Foundation of all rational PRACTICE, being very little underſtood or attended to <hi>here,</hi> and conſequently its Advantages not ſo obvious, a particular Explication of the Nature and Uſefulneſs of it, will now the more readily be indulged me, as it will ſerve at the ſame Time to convey a more adequate Idea of the Importance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent INSTITUTION.</p>
            <p>There is but too frequent Occaſion to remark, that we are apt to undervalue in others, what we ourſelves do not poſſeſs, or deſpair of ever attaining; eſpecially when the Subject of our Envy gives any Pre-eminence to the Poſſeſſor! This is in no Caſe more applicable, than with Reſpect to the Uſefulneſs of THEORY in PHYSIC; and will fully account for that Obloquy and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule with which <hi>the Self-taught Doctors</hi> of this City, affect to treat a Plan of MEDICAL Education, which they either have not Senſe to comprehend, or Honeſty and Candour enough to regret the Want of. Such little Foes are pardonable; they indeed claim our Pity; becauſe they know no better. But when an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Head, is totally guided by an unfeeling and malevolent Heart: When the Want of <hi>academical</hi> Inſtruction in his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is artfully concealed under many real and more ſtudied Oddities of Behaviour; by ſhunning every Occaſion of Medical Converſe with ſuch as can judge of his Skill, or cenſure his Practice; by amuſing his credulous Hearers with vulgar Jeſts, or the too generally delectable Arts of Defamation, and illiberal Abuſe of thoſe, who have been more fortunate in Opportunities of Improvement than himſelf: When a Spirit of Rapacity is gloſſed over by boaſted <hi>Noſtrums,</hi> and fictitious Cures; or otherwiſe, by himſelf, or his <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> practiſing upon the diſtempered Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the ſick; and by every other mean and reproachful Artifice; it might well excite the Amaze and Regret of every Friend to Learning, and of every good Member of Society, ſhould he find that the inſidious Opinions of ſuch a <hi>Medical Phaenomenon,</hi> who reflects ſo little Honour upon the City he lives in, and much leſs upon the Profeſſion he follows, were ſtill, as
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011338_0056_0F8580905B5037D0"/>
heretofore, not only liſtened to, but applauded. However I would willingly hope, that this reſpectable Community will, for the future, form their Opinions of this Profeſſion, and of this preſent Undertaking, from their own Underſtanding and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and that Strangers, who ſhall henceforth viſit theſe hoſpitable Regio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, for the Sake of Health, will not too haſtily judge of the whole FACULTY here, from the ungracious Practiſes of a HETEROCLITE DOCTOR, or the relentleſs Cravings of an inſatiable LEECH.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed, let us here conſider ſuch common Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made to the Uſefulneſs of THEORY, as carry with them any Appearance of Reaſon or Plauſibility.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to be univerſally allowed, that Experience alone can never form a rational PHYSICIAN: Yet ſome decry THEORY, as of no Uſe in explaining Diſeaſes, becauſe, ſay they, it cannot be accommodated to all of them. But ſuch Diſputants may as well contend, that becauſe THEORY cannot obtain in all Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it therefore does in none; which would be to contradict all Senſe and Obſervation. Others, becauſe they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, or not willing, or perhaps not able to inveſtigate the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, reckon <hi>Theory</hi> not only as uſeleſs, but would inſinuate alſo, that it may ſometimes be dangerous in Practice. Now, what can be more abſurd, than to imagine that a PHYSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIAN will be the more unſucceſsful, the better he underſtands the Diſtemper? Or that he who ſees clearly into the Origin and Cauſe of an Indiſpoſition, ſhould therefore be the more incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of rightly applying a Remedy? Or on the contrary, that he ſhould be the moſt happy in his Cures, who is altogether ignorant why one Method ſhould be purſued rather than another? The Futility of ſuch Objections is obvious to every Capacity. Others again ſay, that Diſeaſes have been cured by Perſons ignorant of all THEORY; who neither underſtood ANATOMY, the ANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAL OECONOMY, nor the Manner in which <hi>Remedies</hi> operate! This has ſometimes undoubtedly been the Caſe; and happy are they who have eſcaped, to tell the Tidings! But were we to examine the <hi>Practice</hi> of ſuch Perſons, and obſerve how unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably moſt Medicines are applied; how many and how contrary Things are given; we muſt acknowledge that their <hi>Apothecaries</hi> are much obliged to them, but their <hi>Patients</hi> not at all: For being unacquainted with the Nature of the Diſtemper, or any certain Method of Cure, they <hi>range</hi> thro' the whole MATERIA MEDICA, in Hopes that they may fortunately <hi>hit</hi> upon a Remedy at laſt. There are ſome too who object to the Uſefulneſs of THEORY; That there are Perſons who, tho' intirely ignorant of any rational Scheme of Practice, yet by being much employed, have acquired ſuch a Degree of Knowledge, as to ſucceed in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011338_0057_0F858091ABA2C2D8"/>
the Cure of ſome particular Diſeaſes! This Obſervation will hold equally good of every ſagacious and attentive <hi>old Woman,</hi> or <hi>Nurſe;</hi> nor, if true, is it ſo very ſurprizing, when it is conſidered, that ſome Diſeaſes recur as it were in a Circle. But ſhould any new Diſtemper ariſe, and ſuch as this Practitioner never ſaw before, our <hi>Champion</hi> of <hi>Experience</hi> would then be much at a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs, and turn over his muſty Receipts and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries long in vain, 'ere he could diſcover any Light to guide him to a proper Treatment. Whereas the judicious and rational PHYSICIAN, who is intimately acquainted with the Powers of the human Body, and the Nature of the Fluids; without being alarmed at any unuſual Caſe; applies the Ideas he had already formed in his Mind, about the Nature of Diſeaſes in general, to this particular Caſe; by which he eaſily diſcerns the Genius of the Diſeaſe; whence it ariſes; the true Indications of Cure; and what Method ought chiefly to be purſued: Amidſt the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Drugs,</hi> he has no Difficulty in chooſing immediately ſuch as are moſt proper for his Purpoſe, and in fixing upon that Order he ought to follow in preſcribing them. EMPYRICS do not ſo much diſtinguiſh between Diſeaſes themſelves, as the <hi>Names</hi> of Diſeaſes: For Inſtance in <hi>Fevers,</hi> the ſame ſymptoms frequently occur, where the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe and State of the Humours, are very different. Thus ſome <hi>Fevers</hi> ariſe from a <hi>Redundancy,</hi> ſome from a <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> others from a <hi>Lentor,</hi> and others again from a <hi>putrid Diſſolution</hi> of the Blood; all which require a different Treatment, according to their ſeveral Cauſes. Suppoſe now this <hi>Nominal</hi> Phyſician to be ſent for; he would immediately form his Diſtinctions, or <hi>Diagnoſis,</hi> as it is called, from the moſt obvious Symptoms attending Fevers in general; and without further Inquiry, pronouncing the Diſtemper to be a <hi>Fever,</hi> would boldly purſue the ſame Method of Cure in all! On the contrary, the rational PHYSICIAN explores not ſo much the <hi>Name,</hi> as the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Diſeaſe: He endeavours to find out its immediate and remote Cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, with the State of the circulating Fluids; and from theſe is directed in his Application of Remedies: And often too, by a judicious ANALOGY, extends thoſe Medicines to many Diſeaſes, which Uſe had perhaps too arbitrarily determined as SPECIFICS in one. How can he apply a proper Remedy to a Diſeaſe, ſays CELSUS, who knows not whence it ariſes, what Parts are affected, how they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, where they are ſeated, or what are their Functions? And tho' it is undeniable that Experience is abſolutely neceſſary to a Phyſician; yet even this Experience can neither be purſued, nor ſafely applied, without Reaſoning upon it; or without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſome Theory from his own Obſervations. Whence it may be fairly concluded, that THEORY and PRACTICE ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire each others Aſſiſtance, that no one can ever deſerve greatly of PHYSIC, who does not unite them: And let us add, that the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011338_0058_0F858091D942B0A8"/>
beſt Collection of Medical Receipts or Preſcriptions which ever was, or will be made, can no more make a complete PHYSICIAN, than good Colours and Pencils alone, can make a fine PAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER.—Thus then the Knowledge of the THEORY of PHYSIC, regularly acquired as a SCIENCE, according to the beſt and moſt approved Methods of Study, is the ſureſt Guide to a ſafe and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Practice; and diſtinguiſhes the rational PHYSICIAN, from the daring EMPYRICK, and other <hi>trammel'd Labourers</hi> in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now conſider the Nature of THEORY, and what it particularly teaches us. It is well known, that all other SCIENCES have their PRAECOGNITA, or Introductory Parts; and that no one can arrive at their Summit, without aſcending by ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Steps, as Reaſon and Experience inform us are neceſſary to conduct him. The PRAECOGNITA, or THEORY of PHYSIC, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends ſeveral curious, and intricate Subjects of Study; each of which alone is ſufficient to employ the Attention of a Student, for a long Time, before he can acquire ſuch a competent Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein, as will intitle him to practiſe with <hi>Safety</hi> to his Patient, <hi>or Honour</hi> to himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Foundation of all true and rational <hi>Medical Knowledge,</hi> is ANATOMY; or that dextro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, nice, and methodical <hi>Diſſection</hi> of the human Body, which diſcovers to us its various component Parts, together with their Figure, Arrangement, Situation, and Connections. ANATOMY gives us the Mechaniſm and Uſes of the Bones, and of the Muſcles; it deſcribes the Contents of the different Cavities of the <hi>Trunk</hi> of the Body: It teaches alſo, the particular Courſe of the Nerves, and Blood Veſſels; and how we may often diſcover the Origin or Seat of an Injury, when perhaps the Part affected or complained of, is very diſtant from it. The Demonſtrations in this <hi>Polar</hi> Branch of MEDICINE, are ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary and inſtructive, that they can never be too often repeated by every Denomination of the FACULTY, whether <hi>Pupils</hi> or <hi>Practitioners;</hi> for it is ſelf evident, that they ought to know intimately and minutely the Compoſition and Frame of the Body, in the natural and ſound State, before they attempt to remedy its Infirmities or Ailments.—To uſe a familiar Compariſon—would not a Man deſerve to be laughed at, who ſhould undertake to regulate or repair any valuable or curious Piece of Machinery, (ſuppoſe a <hi>Watch,</hi>) without underſtanding its Principles and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm? Yet how many are guilty of a greater Abſurdity, by truſting their own moſt curious ANIMAL MACHINE, which itſelf alone is a WORLD of WONDERS, in the Hands of thoſe, who are ignorant of the Structure and Uſes even of ſuch Parts, as admit of equal demonſtrative Certainty, with any Contrivance of Man's Invention?</p>

Beſides what we are inſtructed in by ANATOMY, which is principally concerned in deſcribing the human Body after Death; there are other Parts of Knowledge, reſpecting our preſent Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being and Exiſtence, which are properly the Subjects of PHYSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OLOGY.—This Branch of THEORY conſiders Man progreſſively, from his earlieſt Exiſtence, before he has yet breathed the Breath of Life; before he is even faſhioned in his Mother's Womb; and while all the boaſted Pre-eminence of this future Image of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, of this Deputy Ruler of the World, is that of a <hi>loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive Vegetable,</hi> a mere <hi>automatous Machine,</hi> an almoſt impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Worm;</hi> to his Decay, or natural Death. PHYSIOLOGY treats of the Animalization of our Food; of the Properties and Uſes of our various Fluids; of the Nature and Circulation of the Blood; of Reſpiration; of the Senſes; and, in ſhort, of every <hi>Function,</hi> whither <hi>Vital, Animal,</hi> or <hi>Natural,</hi> which is, or ought to be performed by the Body, while in Health: All which are comprehended under the Appellation of,—the ANIMAL OECO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOMY. By PHYSIOLOGY, we are enabled to form a juſt Idea of Health, and wherein it conſiſts: As from the total, or partial Depravation of any of the various <hi>Functions,</hi> which are or ought to be performed in HEALTH, we form the Idea of SICKNESS, in all its different Stages and Degrees. ANATOMY may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the <hi>Topography</hi> of the Body; and PHYSIOLOGY as <hi>its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory.</hi> ANATOMY is the guiding Star to the SURGEON; but both are alike eſſential to the PHYSICIAN. We have already obſerved, what great Improvements have from Time to Time been made, in PHYSIOLOGY, by opening and inſpecting the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of different Animals <hi>alive;</hi> and otherwiſe making Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them. How far ſuch Practices, tho' influenced by ſuch good Motives, are reconcileable to Humanity, I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine: But when it is conſidered what important, what uſeful Diſcoveries have been made in that Way; the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive both in PHYSIC and PHYLOSOPHY, will always congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late themſelves upon every Acquiſition of KNOWLEDGE, however abhorrent they may be from ſuch <hi>Means</hi> of obtaining it. We find too, that ſuch practical Curioſity prevailed in a very early Period of this Profeſſion; and was even carried to great Lengths, if what ſome affirm of ERASISTRATUS, the ſagacious PHYSICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN to the firſt SELEUCUS, and of HEROPHILUS above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, be true. From what is already ſaid, it muſt be evident to every Man of Senſe or Reflection, how prepoſterous it is, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to remedy the Alterations and Changes produced in the Body by SICKNESS, without a previous particular Knowledge of its State in HEALTH.</p>
            <p>But theſe Studies of ANATOMY, and PHYSIOLOGY, beſides being conſidered as neceſſary Qualifications for the Practice of PHYSIC, may moreover be looked upon as Branches of NATU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL

PHILOSOPHY, both pleaſing and inſtructive to Men of <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Letters;</hi> and no leſs amuſing to ſuch as carry their Reſearches, no farther than the immediate Objects of their Senſes. If our Curioſity receives ſuch exquiſite Gratification, in contemplating the immenſe VARIETY, which Nature has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in her inferior Productions; why ſhould we not in like Manner take Pleaſure in purſuing her, in her more complete and noble Work, the HUMAN FRAME? When we examine the various component Parts of the Body, with their different Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and Uſes, how are we amazed, to find all the Motions of this moſt complicated Machine performed, according to the well known and immutable <hi>Powers</hi> of MECHANICS? How are our moſt warm and Heart-felt Emotions of Gratitude called up, when we perceive, that every minute diſcernible <hi>Atom</hi> is formed, and placed, according to the moſt juſt <hi>Weight,</hi> and ſtricteſt <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration?</hi> That the Diſtribution of our Veſſels, and Courſe of the Fluids thro' them, are all conformable to the ever permanent <hi>Laws</hi> of HYDRAULICS; and that all theſe are diſpoſed of, with ſuch Symmetry and benevolent Care, as are moſt conducive to the Preſervation, and preſent Happineſs of BEINGS, whoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſo ſhort and limited?—The Articulations of the SPINE, or Back-Bone, moving over their liquid Axle, and reſting upon the <hi>Incompreſſibility</hi> of Water, at leaſt incompreſſible by any <hi>natural</hi> Force of the Body: The aſtoniſhing <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> of the EYE, and EAR, ſo beautifully contrived, and carefully adapted to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Properties of LIGHT, and SOUND; ALL muſt excite the moſt profound Reſpect, and awful Veneration in every attentive Obſerver of NATURE, for HIM who has thus faſhioned us. In ſhort, what more rational Entertainment can be found; what Subject of Admiration, more grand or noble; what more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proofs can be given, of the ſuperlative and paternal GOODNESS of the DEITY, than ſuch an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Survey of this little WORLD of MAN?

            <p>PATHOLOGY neceſſarily depends upon the previous Knowledge of PHYSIOLOGY, and is naturally connected with it; it is uſual therefore to teach both, in the ſame <hi>Courſe</hi> of LECTURES: Theſe two Branches together are more particularly, and in a limited Senſe, called the THEORY of PHYSIC. The Subject of PATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGY conſiſts, in the general Inveſtigation of the various <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Diſeaſes, whether adventitious or natural; with their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Symptoms,</hi> and <hi>Effects.</hi> PHYSIOLOGY conſiders the Human Body, in its ſound and <hi>healthy</hi> State: But PATHOLOGY conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, in its preternatural and <hi>morbid</hi> State.</p>

            <p>By BOTANY we are inſtructed in the <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Characters</hi> of PLANTS.

            <p>The principal and moſt intereſting Part of MEDICINE, and to which all thoſe other foregoing <hi>Studies,</hi> or Branches of THEORY are ſubſervient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is PRACTICE; or the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of Diſeaſes.

Experiments, and Obſervations of Facts, made by our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the HEALING<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ART, upon Diſeaſes and Remedies; and compared with thoſe made by ourſelves: And thence, from what uſually has happened, we collect what may again happen, and what we ought to do in ſimilar Caſes. As all the Proficiency made in the other <hi>preparatory</hi> CLASSES, with every Aſſiſtance which can be derived from Memory, or the Powers of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is neceſſarily exerted here; it has always been cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for Students, to embrace the earlieſt Opportunities of being converſant in it; by attending, from their firſt Entrance upon their Studies, the Practice of ſome Gentleman, eminent for Buſineſs and Abilities; or by viſiting the Sick in HOSPITALS, where the ſame Opportunities of Inſtruction uſually occur.—Permit me to obſerve here, that, in this wealthy and populous CITY, which from its extenſive Trade and commodious Situation, is ſo much the Reſort of Strangers, and to which, as the ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TROPOLIS and Seat of Government, there is ſuch a Concourſe of People from the inland Settlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

When we look round, and ſee how many Objects of Diſtreſs, are every where ſuffering under the accumulated Woes of <hi>Poverty Sickneſs,</hi> and <hi>bodily Infirmities;</hi> only becauſe they cannot have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies neceſſary for their being benefited by that Aſſiſtance, which many Gentlemen of this Profeſſion daily do, and would ſtill moſt cheerfully give them; it is a Matter of ſincere Regret, that neither the Motives of Humanity, nor the laudable Example of a neighbouring COLONY, have yet been able to give Being, to ſo deſirable a Place of Refuge, from ſuch complicated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. An Eſtabliſhment, ſo beneficial to the whole PROVINCE, and to this CITY in particular, well deſerves the Attention of a PUBLIC SPIRITED LEGISLATURE; as well as the united In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of every FRIEND to the <hi>Country,</hi> and of every <hi>compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> and <hi>good</hi> MAN: But the Manifold Advantages, which would hence ariſe to the Young <hi>Student,</hi> and <hi>Practitioner,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion both of PHYSIC and SURGERY, are ſo very palpable and obvious, that it in a particular Manner claims the Countenance of every FRIEND to the ART of HEALING. I am not ignorant, that there has been for many Years in this CITY, a <hi>public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle</hi> for <hi>poor</hi> INVALIDS; but the intentional <hi>Plan</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of that <hi>Houſe,</hi> render it undeſerving of the Name of an HOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PITAL. From the known Humanity of the Magiſtrates and Managers, it cannot be doubted that the Sick are there at all Times ſupplied with decent, and ſuitable Entertainment: But their <hi>Medical</hi> Treatment has hitherto been ſo ſtudiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, that as yet it is inſcrutable; and therefore it remains

            <p>Every Thing which can poſſibly affect the Body, or influence its State of HEALTH, whether it be done by us, or ſuffered by us, comes under the Conſideration of PRACTICE. Thus, as the Body is greatly influenced by the general<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Climate of the Country, as well as by the particular Air, Soil, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tuation, &amp;c. of the Places we live in; and by the Diet, Cloathing, Occupation, and Exerciſe peculiar to each Individual; they are all Objects of PRACTICE. Hence it is not to be wondered at, if the Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations made in our <hi>State</hi> of HEALTH, ſhould be as different, as are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> they may ariſe from; or that the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ſhould be more or leſs frequent in ſome Places, than they are in others; and even that they ſhould be ſometimes widely different in the ſame Places, according to their various <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> they affect. This Diverſity in the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and Degrees of Violence, by which Diſeaſes are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, muſt neceſſarily require the utmoſt Attention of the PHYSICIAN, in his Management of them; and it muſt be very evident, from theſe Conſiderations, that no one <hi>Method</hi> of CURE can poſſibly be framed, ſo general or comprehenſive, as to ſuit every <hi>Climate;</hi> nor even the ſame <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> in every CASE, in the ſame <hi>Climate.</hi> We ſhall in general obſerve upon this Head, that a thorough Knowledge of ANATOMY; and of the ANIMAL OECONOMY, according to the lateſt Diſcoveries, and moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved THEORIES; a competent Acquaintance with the Powers and Effects of DRUGS; and a diligent Study of the beſt <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern</hi> MEDICAL WRITERS, improv'd by his own Experience and Obſervations, ſhould be the Buſineſs of every PHYSICIAN; and are the eſſential Requiſites, to a ſafe and happy <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A PHYSICIAN ought alſo to be well acquainted with the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of SURGERY: And to underſtand both the THEORY

and MANUAL PART of MIDWIFRY; tho' he may not incline to practice either the one, or the other. How neceſſary ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments are every where, eſpecially in this infant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; how conducive they are to the Increaſe and Welfare of our fellow Citizens; and how imprudent it is, to permit any one to practice theſe <hi>Arts</hi> of SURGERY and MIDWIFRY, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Examinations, or having public <hi>Teſtimonials</hi> of their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, muſt be obvious to every one. A Practitioner ought to know how to <hi>act,</hi> as well as to <hi>adviſe:</hi> And in Caſe of Neceſſity, to aſſiſt in, or even perform every Operation needful for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or Preſervation of thoſe who have placed their whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him; or are otherwiſe committed to his Care.</p>

When it is conſidered, how extenſive this SCIENCE is, how many, and how various are its Objects; can we poſſibly imagine it to be ſuch a mean Acquiſition, ſuch an eaſy Attainment, as to be within the Reach of every needy <hi>Trader</hi> in PHYSIC, or mercenary <hi>Patcher</hi> of Cures? Can we ſuppoſe, that a Releaſe from the Importunities of <hi>Pain;</hi> a Reprieve from the Horrors of the <hi>Grave;</hi> and a Reſtitution to the Bleſſings of HEALTH, are ſuch contemptible Endowments, as to be in the Gift of every <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer,</hi> who takes upon himſelf to preſcribe Medicines, or to tamper with the Lives of Citizens, as uſeful to the Community, as his own is perhaps baneful and pernicious?

Such being the State of PHYSIC here, what Wonder is it that this CITY ſhould be peſtered in ſo remarkable a Manner, with the <hi>needy Outcaſts</hi> of other Places, in the Character of <hi>Doctors;</hi> or that this Profeſſion, of all others, ſhould be the Receptacle and Common Reſource for the Refuſe of every other Trade and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? The Wonder indeed is, that we ſhould be ſuch Dupes to their Effrontery, as to employ them, or buy their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Compoſitions; not that they ſhould frequent ſo beneficial a Market.

Before I diſmiſs this Subject, permit me to add ſome few Thoughts upon the relative Duties of PUPILS, PATIENTS, and PHYSICIANS.</p>
            <p>No PUPIL ought to apply himſelf to the Study of PHYSIC, till he has previouſly laid the Foundation, in a competent Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of CLASSICAL LEARNING, and ſome general Acquaintance with the MATHEMATICKS, and NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. No Expence ought to be put in Balance with the Acquiſition of every neceſſary Branch of Inſtruction, to inſure a ſucceſsful Practice. He, who conſiders how he may go the cheapeſt Way to Work, too often purchaſes the <hi>Name,</hi> for the <hi>Reality;</hi> the <hi>Shadow</hi> for the <hi>Subſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce:</hi> A candid and curſory View of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Practitioners</hi> here, and in the Country around, will ſoon convince the moſt incredulous, of the Truth of this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. As it may be preſumed that no PUPIL puts himſelf under the Tuition of a Maſter, but from a Conviction of his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſuperior Underſtanding; he ought therefore to conſider himſelf as at all Times accountable to his TUTOR in this SCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE, not only for the Progreſs he makes in his <hi>Studies;</hi> but alſo for every other Part of his Conduct, that can influence his Morals, or affect his Reputation: And to behave to him on all Occaſions, with that Attention and Deference due to a <hi>temporary</hi> FATHER. He ought indeed to extend this Reſpect and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, to all in the Character of MEDICAL MASTERS, tho' not immediately his own; in Order to conciliate to himſelf the Friendſhip and good Offices of every eſtabliſhed Practitioner, who can any Way contribute to his Inſtruction and Improvement, by Precept or Example.</p>
            <p>It may appear oſtentatious, to give Inſtructions how a PATIENT ought to behave, with Reſpect to his PHYSICIAN: But when it is conſidered, that <hi>both</hi> are only as Aſſiſtants, contributing their mutual Endeavours to relieve or ſupport Nature, as the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal; and that the Reputation of the PHYSICIAN often ſuffers by the Indiſcretion or Obſtinacy of the PATIENT; ſome Advice on that Head may not be altogether improper. I ſhall now only obſerve, that a PATIENT ought to be extremely cautious to whom he commits the Care of his HEALTH; but when he has once fix'd upon this his <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Counſellor</hi> in Diſtreſs, he ought to receive his Viſits with that warm Welcome, and his Advice with that Deference and implicit Obedience, becoming the Importance of the Truſt repoſed in him. A Want of <hi>Confidence</hi> in the PATIENT, naturally begets <hi>Diſguſt</hi> or <hi>Neglect</hi> in the PHYSICIAN; and it muſt ever be diſadvantageous, and ſometimes hazardous for <hi>Valetudinarians</hi> to change the PHYSICIAN, who has ſtudied their Conſtitutions, in all their Peculiarities; for one who is an intire Stranger to them. It is for this Reaſon, that among PHYSICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS

Tho' the Lot of Mortality is ſuch, that the beſt PHYSICIAN cannot always be ſucceſsful; yet even when he fails of his Expectations, his Care and aſſiduous Endeavours to reſtore Health, ought at leaſt to be remembered with Gratitude. But when he happily obtains his Purpoſe; when the late languiſhing Patient, is at laſt ſnatched from the Graſp of the <hi>Grim Tyrant,</hi> and relieved from the Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of a Sick Bed; a Retroſpect of that dreary and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Gulp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Manifold and important are the Duties of the PHYSICIAN. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry PRACTITIONER who charges himſelf with the Inſtruction of <hi>Youth,</hi> ſhould be cautious of ſetting them any Example, he would not wiſh them to follow. He ought to conceal Nothing from them in the Way of his Buſineſs, which it imports them to know; unleſs where his own Honour is engaged to keep it ſecret. He ſhould always readily and with Complacence anſwer their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and ſolve ſuch Doubts as occur in their Reading, or in the Courſe of his Practice; and in Terms ſuited to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. He ought ſo to watch over their <hi>Studies</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> as well knowing that the Succeſs or Reputation of the <hi>Pupil</hi> in Life, may ultimately reflect Honour or Reproach upon the MAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER. A PHYSICIAN ought to viſit his <hi>Patients</hi> frequently; and to be minutely attentive to every Thing reſpecting them, by which their HEALTH may be affected. He ought to be patient to bear; and never aſhamed of informing himſelf, even by the meaneſt People, of <hi>Remedies</hi> confirmed by Experience. Let it be remembered alſo by the PHYSICIAN who does not adminiſter his own <hi>Medicines,</hi> that according to the STATUTES of the COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGE of SALERNUM, he ought to be obliged to ſwear, that he ſhall have no Share of Gains with the <hi>Apothecary;</hi> as the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,</hi> by the ſame STATUTES, was to take an Oath, that he would make up his Medicines faithfully, according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions given him. A prudent PHYSICIAN will never preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly warrant the Succeſs of his Preſcriptions; as Experience muſt have taught him, that the minuteſt Circumſtances will cauſe a Variation in the Diſtemper, either as to <hi>Danger</hi> or <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> He ought to be decent in his Appearance; diſcreet in his Manners; cautious in his Expreſſions; modeſt and circumſpect in his Queſtions to his Patients; many of which may often with greater Propriety be propoſed to their Attendants. He ſhould be
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011338_0070_0F85809D18C581C8"/>
moderate in all his Actions; yet always ready to do his Duty, without diſconcerting himſelf. He ought to be humane, and compaſſionate; no Talebearer, but ſecret; no rude Dogmatiſt, but affable and polite: In ſhort, all the Qualifications of the HEAD and HEART, becoming the <hi>Character</hi> of a GENTLEMAN, are indiſpenſably required to conſtitute the PHYSICIAN of Merit, who would ſecure the Eſteem of his Patients, do Honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or Support the Dignity of his <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> If it is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in him to collect Information from every one; he cannot ſurely, when conſiſtent with the Duty he owes himſelf, refuſe to <hi>conſult</hi> with other reſpectable <hi>Practitioners,</hi> in every Caſe of Sickneſs, upon what can be done for the Benefit of the <hi>Patient.</hi> As the humane PHYSICIAN prefers the Welfare of his <hi>Patient,</hi> and his own <hi>Succeſs</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> to every Conſideration which Pride or Avarice can ſuggeſt; he will not only with Alacrity join in ſuch CONSULTATIONS, when requeſted to it, but ſolicit them occaſionally, as an Indulgence and Relief to himſelf: Whereas a contrary Conduct can only proceed from ſordid Motives, or the Dread of having his Ignorance or <hi>Mal-Practice</hi> expoſed, to thoſe who only can judge of them.

are the <hi>mean</hi> ARTS of needy <hi>Pilferers</hi> of Fame, and of Spirits poor indeed. To vaunt of extraordinary <hi>Cures,</hi> before ſuch as are not competent Judges, or incapable of inquiring into the Circumſtances of them, may juſtly render the Belief of them at leaſt doubtful. An Oſtentation of LEARNING in common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, even when his <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is the Subject, is not always a Proof of it; on the contrary, to be unable to convey his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without having Recourſe to numerous <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> is generally a Proof of contracted Ideas, and a narrow Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

A PHYSICIAN ought frequently to reviſe the different Subjects even of his youthful STUDIES, in order to run off the <hi>Ruſt</hi> of Memory, and render him more <hi>habile</hi> in Argument, as well as clear and diſtinct in Conſultations.

            <p>One Thing more is ſeriouſly recommended to thoſe Gentlemen in Practice, whoſe Judgment and Experience in the Diſeaſes of this Country, may have enabled them to undertake the Taſk: That they would not only ſtudy and improve upon the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who have gone before them, but alſo collect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their own Uſe, and the Benefit of their Succeſſors. The various Changes which are continually happening in the State of PHYSICK, make this neceſſary. For there are many Diſeaſes now exiſting, which were intirely unknown to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: The Names both of Diſeaſes and Drugs, by Cuſtom, are differently applied; Improvements and Diſcoveries are daily made; Medicines in the higheſt Reputation at one Time, are laid aſide, and other ſubſtituted in their Place; and the Forms and Manners of uſing thoſe retained, are perpetually diverſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Beſides, the PHYSICIANS of this <hi>Country</hi> have ſtill more forcible Reaſons, for imparting to the World, ſuch Medical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks as may ſeem inſtructive or uncommon: For our Climate, Way of Living, and other Circumſtances, which ought always to be regarded in the Treatment of Diſeaſes, are ſo very different from thoſe of the Countries, whence the moſt uſeful and judicious Obſervations are tranſmitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are ſome other particular Advantages, reſulting from MEDICAL SOCIETIES to PRACTITIONERS themſelves, as well as to young STUDENTS, and the PUBLIC. For <hi>there,</hi> different Opinions and Modes of <hi>Practice</hi> are examined; Experiments are <hi>there</hi> directed, or critically weighed, and applied: Dangerous and extraordinary Caſes are frequently ſtated and conſidered, in ſuch SOCIETIES: And <hi>there</hi> Advice is aſked and given, with that Openeſs and mutual Confidence becoming FRIENDS, not leſs zealous for the Honour of their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> than attentive to the Reputation of each other: While every Member chearfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes his Aſſiſtance, to the Recovery or Relief of ſuch <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> as are the Subjects of theſe CONSULTATIONS. And permit me to add, as one of many Inſtances of the Utility of theſe SOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETIES, that whatever Merit there is in this preſent INSTITUTION, it was firſt planned and concluded upon, in a MEDICAL SOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY now ſubſiſting in this Place; and MAY IT LONG SUBSIST.</p>

prompt him to beſtow, after he was cured: They enjoyed certain Immunities, which could not be claimed by other Subjects; as, that they, with their Wives and Children, were exempted from all the Taxes and Burdens of the State; that ſuch as reſided in the Provinces were not obliged to quarter Soldiers, or any other Perſons; that they could not be taken Priſoners, or dragged to the Bar; nor obliged to make a perſonal Appearance before the Judge; and that none might inſult them, without incurring the ſevereſt Penalties. The LAW which ordains this, ſeems to extend theſe Privileges to all the PHYSICIANS of the Empire; but a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent LAW reſtrains them to the ARCHIATRI of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>The ARCHIATRI both of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were divided into two <hi>Claſſes:</hi> The Firſt were called ARCHIATRI SACRI PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATII INTRA PENETRALIA REGALIS AULAE FLORENTES, or CHIEF PHYSICIANS who compoſed Part of the Princes private Family; and who were always employed about his Perſon and Court. The others were thoſe of the City and Country, called ARCHIATRI POPULARES; who attended the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in general, or whoever would employ them. The ARCHIATRI of the PALACE were again divided into two <hi>Ranks,</hi> called COMITES ARCHIATRORUM SACRI PALATII of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Rank;</hi> according to the Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence repoſed by the Prince in their Skill and Abilities.

               </hi> was at firſt, the uſual Place of Reſort for all the STUDIOUS and LEARNED, where PHYSICIANS too depoſited their Books, as in a Place of Safety; till it was deſtroyed by Fire. In the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,</hi> a COLLEGE built by <hi>Adrian</hi> expreſsly for the Advancement of the ARTS and SCIENCES, PHYSICIANS had their Places of Meeting: The <hi>Emperor Severus</hi> alſo aſſigned them particular Chambers or Apartments; after which, we read of their SECRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARIES and LIBRARIANS. But under the later <hi>Emperors,</hi> there was a COLLEGE of ARCHIATRI, compoſed of a certain Number of PHYSICIANS, who took their Places, according to the Dates of their Admiſſion; ſo that when any of them died, the Perſon choſen to ſucceed, was loweſt of all. This COLLEGE judged of the Capacity of <hi>Candidates,</hi> and choſe, or rejected them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and the <hi>Emperors</hi> always confirmed thoſe who were elected. This is probably that SCHOOL of PHYSICIANS, in the Quarter of <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Eſquilia,</hi> which according to <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with many fine Statues.</p>
            <p>After the Subverſion of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Gothic</hi> Kings introduced a great Change in this MEDICAL DIGNITY; for inſtead of ſeveral COMITES, they appointed one COMES AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIATRORUM, or SOVEREIGN PHYSICIAN, who had a certain Juriſdiction over all of that Denomination, and over all the PHYSICIANS of the State. The Powers of this NOBLE ARCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATER were very extenſive; as we learn from a Clauſe in the FORMULA of his <hi>Inſtallment;</hi> preſerved by <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> Secretary to <hi>Theodoric</hi> in the 6th Century, <abbr>

               <q>Henceforth we confer upon you, the Dignity of COMES of the ARCHIATRI, that you may ALONE be diſtinguiſhed among the GUARDIANS of HEALTH; and that all who ſhall have Diſputes reſpecting MEDICINE, may ſubmit to your Determination. Be <hi>thou</hi> the ARBITER of this SACRED ART, and the <hi>ſole</hi> JUDGE of thoſe Controverſies, which were formerly decided by Caprice or Prejudice. You will in Effect cure the Sick, by putting an End to thoſe Conteſts, which are injurious to them. GREAT is your DIGNITY, to rule and direct Men of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Skill;</hi> and to be HONOURED by thoſe, who themſelves are HONOUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ABLE in the Eyes of all.</q> After the 6th Century, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of BOOKS by the <hi>northern Barbarians,</hi> involved MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINE and the other SCIENCES in the ſame Fate. Some Veſtiges of them, during this <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of Learning, were probably preſerved at <hi>Salernum;</hi> for we find different <hi>Praeceptors</hi> eſtabliſhed there, about the End of the 8th Century. May not the <hi>illuſtrious</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> NAME of DE MEDICIS, be originally derived from the DIGNIFIED PHYSICIANS above mentioned; or from ſuch as had formerly followed this PROFESSION?

            <p>With Reſpect to this OFFICE of ARCHIATER, we ſhall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve, that it was an early Inſtitution among the <hi>Franks;</hi> for we find in a cotemporary Author, that <hi>Marileifus</hi> was CHIEF of PHYCIANS to <hi>Chilperic,</hi> in the 6th Century: And other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tell us, that it thereafter was endowed with great Privileges; as, that he had Acceſs to the KING at all Times, even when in Bed; that he ranked with, and wore the ſame Robes as a COUNSELLOR of STATE; that he ſuperintended the King's Baths, and licenſed all Mineral Springs; that he had 8 <hi>Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> who attended the Court by Turns, and who viſited thoſe who had been, or were to be touched for the <hi>King's Evil;</hi> and that he was every where treated by all of the FACULTY, with the Reſpect due to a SUPERIOR. <hi>Monſ.
