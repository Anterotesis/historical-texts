            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi>n the Verse before out Text, we have both a <hi>Confession,</hi> and a <hi>Petition</hi> of a Distressed Man.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Confession,</hi> we have both the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, and the <hi>Object</hi> of it. The <hi>Matter</hi> of it, is contained in those

words, <hi>I have sinned, what shall I do unto thee?</hi> q. d.

The <hi>Object</hi> of it is intimated in those words, <hi>O Thou preserver of Men,</hi> which are by some rendred, <hi>O thou Observer of Men, q. d.</hi> God has <hi>Observed</hi> more amiss in me, than ever <hi>I</hi> found in my self.</p>

            <p>For the <hi>Argument:</hi> the force of the plea for a <hi>Pardon</hi> here, seems to ly in this, <hi>It will else quickly be too late!</hi> The terms of it are, <hi>For now shall I sleep in the Dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be;</hi> which in short is, <hi>I shall quickly be dead and gone!</hi> To <hi>Not be,</hi> is a Scripture-Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Phrase for <hi>Dying:</hi> denoting not a total <hi>Annthilation</hi> but a vast <hi>Alteration</hi> come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us by Mortality, which is

            <p>Wherefore the Doctrine unto which you are now to give a very great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men should be very Importunate in their Prayers to the Eternal God,</hi> T<hi>hat their</hi> Transgression <hi>may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their</hi> Iniquity <hi>taken away, before the</hi> Sleep <hi>of Death bring their Great</hi> Change <hi>upon them.</hi>

               <p>Sin is an Heavy <hi>Burden</hi> upon the Soul which it lies upon; and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may justly roar under it, as in Psal. 38. 4. <hi>My Iniquities, as an heavy Burden, are too heavy for me.</hi> Hence, <hi>The Bearing of Iniquity,</hi> is a phrase that sometimes occurrs in the Book of God: Every sensible Soul, feels it like a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Mountain of Lead upon him; the Thousands of Talents which he owes unto the Revenge of God, are a <hi>Weight</hi> upon him, which he finds there is no Enduring of.

               <p>It is observed, that the same words [<hi>Transgression,</hi> and <hi>Iniquity</hi>] are used both for <hi>Sin</hi> it self, and for the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> of Sin.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I shall here tender you this one Conclusion more.</p>

                  <hi>In Justification, the severe punishment of Sin, is Remitted, with the Fault it self.</hi>

the Righteous God. It was said in in <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 24. <hi>The Inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given their Iniquity.</hi> Thus, when men are <hi>Forgiven their Iniquity,</hi> they shall not by <hi>vindictive</hi> Justice be made to say, <hi>I am sick,</hi> or <hi>I am poor,</hi> or, <hi>I am pained,</hi> and the like.

               <p>Tis an Article in that <hi>Platform</hi> of Prayer; which our Lord has given us, O our <hi>Heavenly Father, Forgive us our Trespasses.</hi> When a certain Man had sinned at a grievous Rate, there was this Direction given to him, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Repent of thy wickedness, and pray to God.</hi> And O that this Direction

might penetrate into the very Soul of the sad man that is now before us here; a <hi>Man</hi> (if he be worthy to be called so) of whom we may say, <hi>O this Man hath sinned a great Sin!</hi> Behold, the course to be taken by every sinner, that would have a <hi>Pardon</hi> from the Lord; <hi>Pray to God, if perhaps thy sin may be forgiven thee.</hi> We have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> in <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.25.

Even those that have been already <hi>Pardoned,</hi> are to continue <hi>praying</hi> for a Pardon still. Tis a thing which none among the <hi>Disciples</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, are to be excused from.

Well, if we want <hi>Assurance,</hi> we are to pray that it may be <hi>vouchsafed;</hi> if we have <hi>Assurance,</hi> we are still to pray, that it be <hi>continned.</hi> A <hi>Prayer for a pardon</hi> is never out of Season.</p>

               <p>To set this Conclusion home, there are three <hi>Assertions,</hi> which methinks may sound like so many Claps of the loudest Thunder, in the Ears of all this Numerous Auditory; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>that</hi> poor man, that must never come within these Walls again.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Death</hi> of Men, is a kind of <hi>sleep</hi> unto them.</p>
               <p>This is a Scheme of speaking used by the <hi>Holy Spirit of God.</hi> Death is a <hi>Sleep</hi> to the <hi>Godly:</hi> therefore it was said in <hi>John</hi> 11:11,12. <hi>Our Friend Lazarus sleepeth; Howbeit Jesus spake of his death.</hi> Death is a <hi>Sleep</hi> to the <hi>Wicked</hi> also. Hence it is said in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>many of them that sleep in the Dust shall awake,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000539_0035_0FA6B53FF3E7CBC8"/>

Tis not for the <hi>Spirit</hi> so. A P<hi>sychopannychia,</hi> a sleeping of the Soul on Death, is too gross and sad a thing to be imagined: it is it self, a <hi>Dream.</hi> The <hi>Active</hi> Apostle would never have said, as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be dislodged and be with Christ;</hi> if he should have had nothing to do but <hi>Sleep</hi> in the Lodging which he was thus desirous to go unto. Let no man imagine that his departed Soul shall become stupid and senseless, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Apprehensions after Death. God forbid it should be so! Nor do YOU that are here a dying Prisoner, expect that within a few Hours, you shall be fallen into a <hi>Deep Sleep</hi> of all your Faculties.

                  <hi>The Pardon of Sin, is not after Death, a thing to be obtained.</hi> As 'tis said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 18, 19.

Hence it was the plea of the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>O Lord, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Iniquity, for it is great.</hi> What a FOR is that?

                  <p>There dwelt at a <hi>Village</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, one who dyed in <hi>December</hi> 1688. This man had been remarkable for his bad Life, till he had spent fifty years in the lewd and rude Courses of notorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness. Though he had the Benefit
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000539_0103_0FA6B5990CE11E80"/>
of a christian and pious <hi>Education,</hi> yet he had shaken off all the yokes which that had laid upon him. Hee became a foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd <hi>Scoffer</hi> at all good men and good things; and a great mocker of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Members</hi> in particular. The Vices of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Lying</hi> made the Characters of his Conversation. <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Breaking</hi> and <hi>Promise-breaking,</hi> made him infamous among honest people, and his <hi>Disobedience</hi> to his Parents was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the rest of his miscarriages. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin,</hi> in the furthest efforts of it, fill'd his whole man, and his whole way, for half an hundred years; at which age he left the world; and he had sat under &amp; sinn'd against the <hi>meanes of Grace</hi> all this while. But yet, which you will admire to hear! Yet this enormous liver was judg'd to be converted unto God some few weeks before he died, The great God so <hi>blessed</hi> &amp; <hi>owned</hi> the <hi>Ministry</hi> which he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Efficacy of it on him, became conspicuous to Astonishment. He became a serious Paenitent, and so devout, so pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, that every one saw a <hi>New-Creature</hi> in him. He mourned for all his former faults, and caused his Complaints to reach unto the <hi>Plague of his Heart</hi> as the Root
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000539_0104_0FA6B599C61236E8"/>
of all. He reformed what was amiss in him, and applyed himself with an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vigour to the Saviour, for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his soul. While the <hi>Grace</hi> of God was thus beginning its Impressions on him, he fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ortally sick, and it was not long before he passed out of this world with a marvellous Assurance of his Interest in a better.</p>
                  <p>It were Endless to reckon up the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Expressions that fell from him, &amp; Behaviours that he had in the <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>last</hi> dayes of his life; but some of them were such as these.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>—O (<hi>said he</hi>) What a wonder of Mercy is it to my soul, that God hath not cast me immediately into Hell, and given me <hi>no Time</hi> to repent, or to beg for an Heart to Repent! But <hi>Great Mercy</hi> hath spared a <hi>great Sinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>—The stoutest man (<hi>said he</hi>) that ever lived, should he but seriously think on <hi>ETERNITY,</hi> and have no Christ to fly unto, it will so sink the the Heart of him, that he could never bear it; but the Lord will show Mercy to my distressed soul.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>He gave himself wholly to Prayer, and would excuse <hi>Watchers</hi> from sitting with

him, that he might be at leisure for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God alone. Sometimes he would give a start as he lay, and being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Reason of it, he said, <hi>O I have a great work to do! and but a little time to do it!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conflicts which he endured in his Spirit were unutterable, under which, he day &amp; night kept <hi>wrestling with God</hi> for His Mercy. One morning his <hi>Brother</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of him how he did, he replied, <q>O I have had as doleful a night as ever man had, I have had three great enemies this night encountering with me; the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Devil.</hi> I have been this night, both in <hi>Hell</hi> &amp; in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and I can truly say with <hi>David,</hi> all this night long <hi>I have watered my couch with my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>To his Father once he said, <q>I have felt a great work on my distressed soul; <hi>This your son was lost and is found, was dead and is alive.</hi> Doleful nights have I seen; the Thoughts of my sins did sorely oppress me, when I would be crying to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

a servant of the Devil and of thy Lust, and dost thon now come to me? I have been call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, and thou hast been hardening thy heart at my Calls, and dost thou expect mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy after all?</hi> And then the <hi>Devil</hi> would put in, saying, <hi>Thou hast been my Vassal so long, thy Cries for Mercy are now all too late.</hi> I have also seen the face of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God,</hi> and that is the most terrible thing that was ever seen. I then found no stay for my distressed soul, but <hi>Free-mercy! Free-mercy!</hi> The Lord now put under me His everlasting Arms, and gave me an heart still to pray &amp; say, <hi>Lord Jesus, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for Thy own sake, Mercy for thy Name's sake!</hi> My Redeemer would say, <hi>Thou art a great sinner and an old sinner!</hi> The Answer of my soul was, <hi>Truth, Lord, but even such sinners have already found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at thy hands, I come to thee, for with thee the fatherless find mercy.</hi>

                  <p>—He would break forth into very High Expressions; his great Comfort was fetch'd from that Promise in Mat. 11. 28. <hi>Come to Me—and I will give you rest.</hi> He would now cry out, <q>O the Riches of <hi>Free-grace!</hi> There are thousands of thousands, &amp; ten thousand times ten thousand, in the third Heaven, rejoicing over a <hi>great</hi> and an <hi>old</hi> sinner coming to <hi>Glory!</hi> O glorify <hi>
