            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Celebrated Dean of St. Patrick's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where obſerves, that a man of talents no ſooner emerges from obſcurity than all the block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads are inſtantly up in arms againſt him. Fully perſuaded of the truth of this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould have been prepared for hoſtility, had I imagined myſelf a man of talents; but, knowing the contrary too well, I little expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the harmleſs eſſays from my pen would have conjured up againſt me this numerous and ſtupid hoſt. It is their misfortune, never to form a right conception of any perſon or thing, and therefore their abuſe is not always a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof of merit in the object on which it is beſtowed: their ignorance leſſens the honour conferred by their envy, hatred and malice.</p>
            <p>I have long been the butt of the ſilly aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this grovelling tribe; but their ſpite never diſcovered itſelf in its deepeſt colours, till they ſaw me, as they imagined, <q>iſſue from poverty to the appearance of better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> Then it was that their gall ran over, and jaundiced their whole countenances; then it was that the ſtupideſt of all ſtupid gazettes, that lewd and common ſtrumpet, the <hi>Aurora,</hi> became pregnant with the following <hi>baſtard,</hi> as abundant in falſehood as any one that ever ſprang from the loins of <hi>Poor Richard.</hi>

                  <p>As the people of America may not be informed who PETER PORCUPINE is, the celebrated manufacturer of <hi>lies,</hi> and retailer of <hi>filth,</hi> I will give you ſome little account of this peſtiferous animal. This wretch was obliged to <hi>abſcond</hi> from his darling <hi>Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to avoid being turned off into the other world before, what he ſuppoſed, his time. It may be well imagined, that in a land of liberty and flowing with milk and honey, his <hi>precipitate retreat</hi> could not have been owing to any offence committed againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very honourable to himſelf. Gnawed by the worm that never dies, his own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs would ever prevent him from making any attempt in favour of human happineſs. His uſual occupation at home was that of a <hi>garret-ſcribbler,</hi> excepting a little <hi>night-buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> occaſionally, to ſupply unavoidable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies; Grubb-ſheet did not anſwer his purpoſes, and being ſcented by certain tip-ſtaffs for ſomething more than ſcribbling, he took a <hi>French leave</hi> for France. His evil genius purſued him here, and <hi>as his fingers were as long as ever,</hi> he was obliged as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to leave the Republic, which has now
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030212_0004_0FE5207382D95AD8"/>
drawn forth all his venom for her attempt to do him <hi>juſtice.</hi> On his arrival in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he figured ſome time as a <hi>pedagogue;</hi> but as this employment ſcarcely furniſhed him ſalt to his porridge, he having been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally without hardly bread to eat, and not a ſecond ſhirt to his back," he reſumed his old occupation of ſcribbling, having little chance of ſucceſs in the other employments which drove him to this country. His talent at <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>Billingsgate rhetoric,</hi> introduced him to the notice of a certain foreign agent, who was known during the Revolution by the name of <hi>traitor.</hi> This ſaid agent has been ſeen to pay frequent viſits to PETER. To atone for his tranſgreſſions in the mother country, as well as to get a little more bread to eat than he had been accuſtomed to, he enliſted in the cauſe of his gracious Majeſty. From the extreme of poverty and filth, he has ſuddenly ſprouted into at leaſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of better condition; for he has tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a houſe for the ſale of his large poiſon, at the enormous rent of <hi>twelve hundred dollars a year,</hi> and has <hi>paid a year's rent in advance!!</hi> The public will now be enabled to account for the overflowings of his gall againſt the Republic of France, and the Republicans of this country, as well as his devotion to the cauſe of tyranny and of Kings. From the frequency of viſits paid him by the agent already mentioned, and his ſudden change of condition, <hi>ſecret ſervice-money</hi> muſt have been liberally employed; for his zeal to make atonement to his mother country ſeems
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030212_0005_0FE520655FC8B418"/>
proportioned to the magnitude of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the <hi>guineas</hi> advanced. As this <hi>fugitive felon</hi> has crept from his hole, his <hi>quills</hi> will now become harmleſs; for hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have only excited apprehenſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beaſt who ſhot them was conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have a number of anecdotes reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that I will ſoon trouble you with, for the amuſement of the public. This ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will convince PETER, that I know him well, and that I have only diſcloſed a part of the truth.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Paul Hedgehog</hi> I know nothing of. I can hardly ſuppoſe that he is one of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins at New-York: if he be, for the honour of our family, I hope that he is a baſtard. But, let Paul be what he will, he is not the only one who has attempted to ſink me in the opinion of a public that has ever honoured my eſſays with diſtinguiſhed marks of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have been well informed, that it is currently reported, that Mr. Thomas Bradford, the Book-ſeller, "put a coat upon my back," and that, when I was firſt favoured with his patronage, I had not a <q>ſecond ſhirt to my back.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:030212_0006_0FE520875320F900"/>Were I to calculate upon the uſual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truth and gratitude, I ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as impoſſible that inſinuations of this kind had ever been thrown out by Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, or any of his family; but, now-a-days, in this happy age of reaſon and liberty, we ſee ſuch extraordinary things happen in the world, that to doubt, at leaſt, does not argue an exceſs of credulity or incredulity.</p>
            <p>Let the propagators of all theſe falſehoods be who they may, I am much obliged to them for giving me this opportunity of publiſhing the Hiſtory of my Life and Adventures, a thing that I was determined to do, whenever a fair occaſion offered, and which never could have been ſo well timed as at the moment when I am ſtepping into a ſituation, where I may probably continue for the reſt of my life.</p>
            <p>I here remember well what I ſaid in my <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Emigration of Doctor Prieſtley.</hi> 
               <q>No man has a right to pry into his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's private concerns; and the opinions of every man are his private concerns, while he keeps them ſo; that is to ſay, while they are confined to himſelf, his family and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friends; but, when he makes thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions public; when he once attempts to make converts, whether it be in religion, politics, or any thing elſe; when he once comes forward as a candidate for public ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, eſteem or compaſſion, his opinions, his principles, his motives, every action of
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:030212_0007_0FE520B06DB9F690"/>
his life, public or private, become the fair ſubject of public diſcuſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a principle I laid down in the firſt original page I ever wrote for the preſs. On this principle it is, that I think myſelf juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſent publication, and that I am ready to approve of others for publiſhing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may know concerning me. Let them write on, till their old pens are worn to the ſtump: let the devils ſweat; let them fire their balls at my reputation, till the very preſs cries out murder. If ever they hear me whine or complain, I will give them leave to fritter my carcaſs and trail my guts along the ſtreet, as the French ſans-culottes did thoſe of Thomas Mauduit.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PETER PORCUPINE.</head>
            <p>TO be deſcended from an illuſtrious fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certainly reflects honour on any man, in ſpite of the ſans-culotte principles of the preſent day. This is, however, an honour that I have no pretenſion to. All that I can boaſt of in my birth, is, that I was born in Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the country from whence came the men who explored and ſettled North America; the country of Penn, and of the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of General Waſhington.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to my anceſtors, I ſhall go no further back than my grand-father, and for this plain reaſon, that I never heard talk of any prior to him. He was a day-labourer, and I have heard my father ſay, that he worked for one farmer from the day of his marriage to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030212_0009_0FE520425433E000"/>
that of his death, upwards of forty years. He died before I was born, but I have often ſlept beneath the ſame roof that had ſheltered him, and where his widow dwelt for ſeveral years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. It was a little thatched cottage with a garden before the door. It had but two win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; a damſon tree ſhaded one, and a clump of filberts the other. Here I and my brothers went every Chriſtmas and Whitſuntide, to ſpend a week or two, and torment the poor old woman with our noiſe and dilapidations. She uſed to give us milk and bread for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, an apple pudding for our dinner, and a piece of bread and cheeſe for ſupper. Her fire was made of turf, cut from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heath, and her evening light was a ruſh dipped in greaſe.</p>
            <p>How much better is it, thus to tell the naked truth, than to deſcend to ſuch miſerable ſhifts as Doctor Franklin has had recourſe to, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to perſuade people, that his fore-fathers were men of wealth and conſideration. Not being able to refer his reader to the herald's office for proofs of the fame and antiquity of his family, he appeals to the etymology of his name, and points out a paſſage in an obſolete book, whence he has the conſcience to inſiſt on our concluding, that, in the Old Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, a <hi>Franklin</hi> meant a man of <hi>good reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of conſequence.</hi> According to Doctor Johnſon, a Franklin was what we now call a gentleman's ſteward or land-bailiff, a perſonage one degree above a bumbailiff, and that's all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030212_0010_0FE5204F7B376898"/>Every one will, I hope, have the goodneſs to believe, that my grandfather was no philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. Indeed he was not. He never made a lightning rod nor bottled up a ſingle quart of ſun-ſhine in the whole courſe of his life. He was no almanac-maker, nor quack, nor chimney-doctor, nor ſoap-boiler, nor ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, nor printer's devil: neither was he a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, and all his children were born in wedlock. The legacies he left, were, his ſcythe, his reap-hook, and his flail; he bequeathed no old and irrecoverable debts to an hoſpital: he never <hi>cheated the poor during his life,</hi> nor <hi>mocked them in his death.</hi> He has, it is true, been ſuffered to ſleep quietly beneath the green-ſord; but, if his deſcendants cannot point to his ſtatue over the door of a library, they have not the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to hear him daily accuſed of having been a whoremaſter, a hypocrite and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel.</p>
            <p>My father, when I was born, was a farmer. The reader will eaſily believe, from the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his parents, that he had received no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brilliant education: he was, however, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a man in his rank of life. When a little boy, he drove plough for two-pence a day, and theſe his earnings were appropriated to the expenſes of an evening ſchool. What a village ſchool-maſter could be expected to teach, he had learnt, and had beſides conſiderably improved himſelf in ſeveral branches of the mathematicks. He underſtood land ſurveying well, and was often choſen to draw the plans of diſputed territory: in ſhort, he had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030212_0011_0FE5209F3675ECD0"/>
of poſſeſſing experience and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which never fails, in England, to give a man in a country place, ſome little weight with his neighbours. He was honeſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and frugal; it was not, therefore, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that he ſhould be ſituated in a good farm, and happy in a wife of his own rank, like him, beloved and reſpected.</p>
            <p>So much for my anceſtors, from whom, if I derive no honour, I derive no ſhame.</p>
            <p>I had (and I hope I yet have) three bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the eldeſt is a ſhop-keeper, the ſecond a farmer, and the youngeſt, if alive, is in the ſervice of the Honourable Eaſt India company, a private ſoldier, perhaps, as I have been in the ſervice of the king. I was born on the ninth of March 1766: the exact age of my brothers I have forgotten, but I remember hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard my mother ſay, that there was but three years and three quarters difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the age of the oldeſt and that of the youngeſt.</p>
            <p>A father like ours, it will be readily ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did not ſuffer us to eat the bread of idleneſs. I do not remember the time when I did not earn my living. My firſt occupation was, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmall birds from the turnip ſeed, and the rooks from the peas. When I firſt trudged a-field, with my wooden bottle and my ſatchel ſwung over my ſhoulders, I was hardly able to climb the gates and ſtiles, and, at the cloſe of the day, to reach home was a taſk of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030212_0012_0FE520C71FAF7EF8"/>
difficulty. My next employment was weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wheat, and leading a ſingle horſe at har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing barley. Hoeing peas followed, and hence I arrived at the honour of joining the reapers in harveſt, driving the team and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plough. We were all of us ſtrong and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and my father uſed to boaſt, that he had four boys, the eldeſt of whom was but fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, who did as much work as any three men in the pariſh of Farnham. Honeſt pride, and happy days!</p>
            <p>I have ſome faint recollection of going to ſchool to an old woman, who, I believe, did not ſucceed in learning me my letters. In the winter evenings my father learnt us all to read and write, and gave us a pretty tolerable knowledge of arithmetic. Grammar he did not perfectly underſtand himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his endeavours to learn us that, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly failed; for, though he thought he underſtood it, and though he made us get the rules by heart, we learnt nothing at all of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>Our religion was that of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to which I have ever remained attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the more ſo, perhaps, as it bears the name of my country. As my anceſtors were never perſecuted for their religious opinions, they never had an opportunity of giving ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proof of their faith as Doctor Franklin's grandfather did, when he kept his Bible under the lid of a cloſe-ſtool. (What a book-caſe!) If I had been in the place of Doctor Franklin,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030212_0013_0FE5208487C46740"/>
I never would have related this ridiculous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, eſpecially as it muſt be conſtrued into a boaſt of his grandfather's having an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary degree of veneration for a book, which, it is well known, he himſelf <hi>durst</hi> not believe in.</p>
            <p>As to politics, we were like the reſt of the country people in England; that is to ſay, we neither knew or thought any thing about the matter. The ſhouts of victory or the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs at a defeat, would now-and-then break in upon our tranquillity for a moment; but I do not remember ever having ſeen a news-paper in the houſe, and moſt certainly that privation did not render us leſs induſtrious, happy or free.</p>
            <p>After, however, the American war had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time, and the cauſe and nature of it began to be underſtood, or rather miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by the lower claſſes of the people in England, we became a little better acquainted with ſubjects of this kind. It is well known, that the people were, as to numbers, nearly equally divided in their opinions concerning that war, and their wiſhes reſpecting the reſult of it. My father was a partizan of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans: he uſed frequently to diſpute on the ſubject with the gardener of a nobleman who lived near us. This was generally done with good humour, over a pot of our beſt ale; yet the diſputants ſometimes grew warm, and gave way to language that could not fail to attract our attention. My father was worſted without
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030212_0014_0FE520756ECFCB90"/>
doubt, as he had for antagoniſt, a ſhrewd and ſenſible old Scotchman, far his ſuperior in political knowledge; but he pleaded before a partial audience: we thought there was but one wiſe man in the world, and that that one was our father. He who pleaded the cauſe of the Americans had an advantage, too, with young minds: he had only to repreſent the king's troops as ſent to cut the throats of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, our friends and relations, merely becauſe they would not ſubmit to oppreſſion, and his cauſe was gained. Speaking to the paſſions is ever ſure to ſucceed on the uninformed.</p>
            <p>Men of integrity are generally pretty obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in adhering to an opinion once adopted. Whether it was owing to this, or to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mr. Martin's arguments, I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, but he never could make a convert of my father: he continued an American, and ſo ſtaunch a one, that he would not have ſuffered his beſt friend to drink ſucceſs to the king's arms at his table. I cannot give the reader a better idea of his obſtinacy in this reſpect, and of the length to which this difference in ſentiment was carried in England, than by relating the following inſtance.</p>
            <p>My father uſed to take one of us with him every year to the great hop-fair at Wey-Hill. The fair was held at Old Michaelmas-tide, and the journey was, to us, a ſort of reward for the labours of the ſummer. It happened to be my turn to go thither the very year that Long-Iſland was taken by the Britiſh. A great company
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030212_0015_0FE52030DAB478B8"/>
of hop-merchants and farmers were juſt ſitting down to ſupper as the poſt arrived, bringing in the extraordinary Gazette which announced the victory. A hop-factor from London took the paper, placed his chair upon the table, and began to read with an audible voice. He was oppoſed, a diſpute enſued, and my father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, taking me by the hand, to another apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where we ſupped with about a dozen others of the ſame ſentiments. Here Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's health, and ſucceſs to the Americans, were repeatedly toaſted, and this was the firſt time, as far as I can recollect, that I ever heard the General's name mentioned. Little did I then dream, that I ſhould ever ſee the man, and ſtill leſs that I ſhould hear ſome of his own countrymen reviling and execrating him.</p>
            <p>Let not the reader imagine, that I wiſh to aſſume any merit from this, perhaps miſtaken, prejudice of an honoured and beloved parent. Whether he was right or wrong is not now worth talking about: that I had no opinion of my own is certain; for, had my father been on the other ſide, I ſhould have been on the other ſide too, and ſhould have looked upon the company I then made a part of as malcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and rebels. I mention theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances merely to ſhow that I was not <q>nurſed in the lap of ariſtocracy,</q> and that I did not imbibe my principles, or prejudices, from thoſe who were the advocates of blind ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If my father had any fault, it was not being ſubmiſſive enough, and I am much
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030212_0016_0FE5206702DD98C8"/>
afraid my acquaintance have but too often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſame fault in his ſon.</p>
            <p>It would be as uſeleſs as unentertaining to dwell on the occupations and ſports of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try boy; to lead the reader to fairs, cricket-matches and hare-hunts. I ſhall therefore come at once to the epoch, when an accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that gave that turn to my future life, which at laſt brought me to the United States.</p>
            <p>Towards the autumn of 1782 I went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit a relation who lived in the neighbourhood of Portſmouth. From the top of Portſdown, I, for the firſt time, beheld the ſea, and no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did I behold it than I wiſhed to be a ſailor. I could never account for this ſudden impulſe, nor can I now. Almoſt all Engliſh boys feel the ſame inclination: it would ſeem that, like young ducks, inſtinct leads them to ruſh on the boſom of the water.</p>
            <p>But it was not the ſea alone that I ſaw: the grand fleet was riding at anchor at Spithead. I had heard of the wooden walls of Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: I had formed my ideas of a ſhip and of a fleet; but, what I now beheld ſo far ſurpaſſed what I had ever been able to form a conception of, that I ſtood loſt between aſtoniſhment and admiration. I had heard talk of the glorious deeds of our admirals and ſailors, of the defeat of the Spaniſh Armada, and of all thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable combats that good and true Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men never fail to relate to their children about
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030212_0017_0FE5208E0A4B6428"/>
a hundred times a year. The brave Rodney's victories over our natural enemies, the French and Spaniards, had long been the theme of our praiſe, and the burthen of our ſongs. The ſight of the fleet brought all theſe into my mind; in confuſed order, it is true, but with irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force. My heart was inflated with national pride. The ſailors were my countrymen, the fleet belonged to my country, and ſurely I had my part in it, and in all its honours: yet, theſe honours I had not earned; I took to myſelf a ſort of reproach for poſſeſſing what I had no right to, and reſolved to have a juſt claim by ſharing in the hardſhips and the dangers.</p>
            <p>I arrived at my uncle's late in the evening, with my mind full of my ſea-faring project. Though I had walked thirty miles during the day, and conſequently was well wearied, I ſlept not a moment. It was no ſooner day-light than I aroſe and walked down towards the old caſtle on the beach of Spithead. For a ſixpence given to an invalid I got permiſſion to go up on the battlements: here I had a cloſer view of the fleet, and at every look my impatience to be on board increaſed. In ſhort, I went from the caſtle to Portſmouth, got into a boat, and was in a few minutes on board the Pegaſus man of war, commanded by the Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble George Berkley, brother to the Earl of Berkley.</p>
            <p>The Captain had more compaſſion than is generally met with in men of his profeſſion: he repreſented to me the toils I muſt undergo,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030212_0018_0FE52076F43FEA60"/>
and the puniſhment that the leaſt diſobedience or neglect would ſubject me to. He perſuaded me to return home, and I remember he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his advice with telling me, that it was better to be led to church in a halter, to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a girl that I did not like, than to be tied to the gang-way, or, as the ſailors call it, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>miſs roper.</hi> From the concluſion of this wholeſome counſel, I perceived that the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thought I had eloped on account of a baſtard. I bluſhed, and that confirmed him in his opinion; but I declare to the reader, that I was no more guilty of ſuch an offence than Mr. Swanwick, or any other gentleman who is conſtitutionally virtuous. No; thank hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I have none of the Franklintonian crimes to accuſe myſelf of; my children do not hang their hats up in other men's houſes; I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther patriot nor philoſopher.</p>
            <p>I in vain attempted to convince Captain Berkley, that choice alone had led me to the ſea; he ſent me on ſhore, and I at laſt quitted Portſmouth; but not before I had applied to the Port-Admiral, Evans, to get my name en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among thoſe who were deſtined for the ſervice. I was, in ſome ſort, obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Admiral with what had paſſed on board the Pegaſus, in conſequence of which my requeſt was refuſed, and I happily eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſorely againſt my will, from the moſt toil-ſome and perilous profeſſion in the world.</p>
            <p>I returned once more to the plough, but I was ſpoiled for a farmer. I had, before my Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030212_0019_0FE5208F8FD1E958"/>
adventure, never known any other am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition than that of ſurpaſſing my brothers in the different labours of the field; but it was quite otherwiſe now; I ſighed for a ſight of the world; the little iſland of Britain ſeemed too ſmall a compaſs for me. The things in which I had taken the moſt delight were neglected; the ſinging of the birds grew inſipid, and even the heart-cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cry of the hounds, after which I formerly uſed to fly from my work, bound o'er the fields, and daſh through the brakes and coppices, was heard with the moſt torpid indifference. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I remained at home till the following ſpring, when I quitted it, perhaps, for ever.</p>
            <p>It was on the ſixth of May 1783, that I, like Don Quixotte, ſallied forth to ſeek ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. I was dreſſed in my holiday clothes, in order to accompany two or three laſſes to Guildford fair. They were to aſſemble at a houſe about three miles from my home, where I was to attend them; but, unfortunately for me, I had to croſs the London turnpike road. The ſtage-coach had juſt turned the ſummit of a hill and was rattling down towards me at a merry rate. The notion of going to London never entered my mind till this very moment, yet the ſtep was completely determined on, before the coach came to the ſpot where I ſtood. Up I got, and was in London about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
            <p>It was by mere accident that I had money enough to defray the expenſes of this day. Being rigged out for the fair, I had three or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030212_0020_0FE520C8A453A6F0"/>
four crown and half-crown pieces (which moſt certainly I did not intend to ſpend) beſides a few ſhillings and half-pence. This my little all, which I had been years in amaſſing, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, like ſnow before the ſun, when touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fingers of the inn-keepers and their waiters. In ſhort, when I arrived at Ludgate-Hill, and had paid my fare, I had but about half a crown in my pocket.</p>
            <p>By a commencement of that good luck, which has hitherto attended me through all the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which fortune has placed me, I was preſerved from ruin. A gentleman, who was one of the paſſengers in the ſtage, fell into converſation with me at dinner, and he ſoon learnt that I was going I knew not whither nor for what. This gentleman was a hop-merchant in the borough of Southwark, and, upon cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inquiry, it appeared that he had often dealt with my father at Wey-Hill. He knew the danger I was in; he was himſelf a father, and he felt for my parents. His houſe became my home, he wrote to my father, and endeavoured to prevail on me to obey his orders, which were to return immediately home. I am aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay that I was diſobedient. It was the firſt time I had ever been ſo, and I have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it from that moment to this. Willingly would I have returned, but pride would not ſuffer me to do it. I feared the ſcoffs of my acquaintances more than the real evils that threatened me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:030212_0021_0FE4FE1529853A08"/>My generous preſerver, finding my obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy not to be overcome, began to look out for an employment for me. He was preparing an advertiſement for the news-paper, when an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of his, an attorney, called in to ſee him. He related my adventure to this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe name was Holland, and who, happening to want an underſtrapping quill-driver, did me the honour to take me into his ſervice, and the next day ſaw me perched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great high ſtool, in an obſcure chamber in Gray's Inn, endeavouring to decypher the crabbed draughts of my employer.</p>
            <p>I could write a good plain hand, but I could not read the pot-hooks and hangers of Mr. Holland. He was a month in learning me to copy without almoſt continual aſſiſtance, and even then I was of but little uſe to him; for, beſides that I wrote a ſnail's pace, my want of knowledge in orthography gave him infinite trouble: ſo that, for the firſt two months I was a dead weight upon his hands. Time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, rendered me uſeful, and Mr. Holland was pleaſed to tell me that he was very well ſatisfied with me, juſt at the very moment when I began to grow extremely diſſatisfied with him.</p>
            <p>No part of my life has been totally unattended with pleaſure, except the eight or nine months I paſſed in Gray's Inn. The office (for ſo the dungeon where I wrote was called) was ſo dark, that, on cloudy days, we were obliged to burn candle. I worked like a galley-ſlave from five
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030212_0022_0FE520AC05464BC8"/>
in the morning till eight or nine at night, and ſometimes all night long. How many quarrels have I aſſiſted to foment and perpetuate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe poor innocent fellows, John Doe and Richard Roe! How many times (God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me!) have I ſet them to aſſault each other with guns, ſwords, ſtaves and pitch-forks, and then brought them to anſwer for their miſdeeds before Our Sovereign Lord the King ſeated in His Court of Weſtminſter! When I think of the <hi>ſaids</hi> and <hi>ſoforths</hi> and the counts of tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy that I ſcribbled over; when I think of thoſe ſheets of ſeventy-two words, and thoſe lines two inches a part, my brain turns. Gracious heaven! if I am doomed to be wretched, bury me beneath Iceland ſnows, and let me feed on blubber; ſtretch me under the burning line and deny me thy propitious dews; nay, if it be thy will, ſuffocate me with the infected and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential air of a democratic club room; but ſave me from the deſk of an attorney!</p>
            <p>Mr. Holland was but little in the chambers himſelf. He always went out to dinner, while I was left to be provided for by the <hi>Laundreſs,</hi> as he called her. Thoſe gentlemen of the law, who have reſided in the Inns of court in London, know very well what a <hi>Laundreſs</hi> means. Ours was, I believe, the oldeſt and uglieſt of the officious ſiſterhood. She had age and experience enough to be Lady Abbeſs of all the nuns in all the convents of Iriſh-Town. It would be wronging the witch of Endor to compare her to this hag, who was the only creature that deigned to enter into converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030212_0023_0FE5206B74BEF1E8"/>
with me. All except the name, I was in priſon, and this Weird Siſter was my keeper. Our chambers were, to me, what the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous cavern was to Gil Blas: his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Dame Leonarda exactly ſuited my Laundreſs; nor were the profeſſions, or rather the practice, of our maſters altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar.</p>
            <p>I never quitted this gloomy receſs except on Sundays, when I uſually took a walk to St. James's Park, to feaſt my eyes with the ſight of the trees, the graſs, and the water. In one of theſe walks I happened to caſt my eye on an advertiſement, inviting all loyal young men, who had a mind to gain riches and glory, to repair to a certain rendezvous, where they might enter into His Majeſty's marine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and have the peculiar happineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being enrolled in the Chatham Diviſion. I was not ignorant enough to be the dupe of this morſel of military bombaſt; but a change was what I wanted: beſides, I knew that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines went to ſea, and my deſire to be on that element had rather increaſed than diminiſhed by my being penned up in London. In ſhort, I reſolved to join this glorious corps; and, to avoid all poſſibility of being diſcovered by my friends, I went down to Chatham and enliſted, into the marines as I thought, but the next morning I found myſelf before a Captain of a marching regiment. There was no retreating: I had taken a ſhilling to drink his Majeſty's health, and his further bounty was ready for my reception.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:030212_0024_0FE5204B27125D78"/>When I told the Captain (who was an Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and who has ſince been an excellent friend to me), that I thought myſelf engaged in the marines: "By Jaſes, my lad," ſaid he, "and you have had a narrow eſcape." He told me, that the regiment into which I had been ſo happy as to enliſt was one of the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and boldeſt in the whole army, and that it was at that moment ſerving in that fine, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and plentiful country, Nova Scotia. He dwelt long on the beauties and riches of this terreſtrial Paradiſe, and diſmiſſed me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enchanted with the proſpect of a voyage thither.</p>
            <p>I enliſted early in 1784, and, as peace had then taken place, no great haſte was made to ſend recruits off to their regiments. I remained upwards of a year at Chatham, during which time I was employed in learning my exerciſe, and taking my tour in the duty of the garriſon. My leiſure time, which was a very conſiderable portion of the twenty-four hours, was ſpent, not in the diſſipations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſuch a way of life, but in reading and ſtudy. In the courſe of this year I learnt more than I had ever done before. I ſubſcribed to a circulating library at Brompton, the greateſt part of the books in which I read more than once over. The library was not very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, it is true, nor in my reading was I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by any degree of taſte or choice. Novels, plays, hiſtory, poetry, all were read, and nearly with equal avidity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030212_0025_0FE52091145FB2C0"/>Such a courſe of reading could be attended with but little profit: it was ſkimming over the ſurface of every thing. One branch of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, I went to the bottom with, and that the moſt eſſential branch too, the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar of my mother tongue. I had experienced the want of a knowledge of grammar during my ſtay with Mr. Holland; but it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that I never ſhould have thought of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering the ſtudy of it, had not accident placed me under a man whoſe friendſhip ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond his intereſt. Writing a fair hand procured me the honour of being copyiſt to Colonel Debieg, the commandant of the garriſon. I tranſcribed the famous correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between him and the Duke of Richmond, which ended in the good and gallant old Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel being ſtripped of the reward, beſtowed on him for his long and meritorious ſervitude.</p>
            <p>Being totally ignorant of the rules of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, I neceſſarily made many miſtakes in copying, becauſe no one can copy letter by letter, nor even word by word. The Colonel ſaw my deficiency, and ſtrongly recommended ſtudy. He enforced his advice with a ſort of injunction, and with a promiſe of reward in caſe of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I procured me a Lowth's grammar, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied myſelf to the ſtudy of it with unceaſing aſſiduity, and not without ſome profit; for, though it was a conſiderable time before I fully comprehended all that I read, ſtill I read and ſtudied with ſuch unremitted attention, that, at

laſt, I could write without falling into any very groſs errors. The pains I took cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: I wrote the whole grammar out two or three times; I got it by heart; I repeated it every morning and every evening, and, when on guard, I impoſed on myſelf the taſk of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it all over once every time I was poſted ſentinel. To this exerciſe of my memory I aſcribe the retentiveneſs of which I have ſince found it capable, and to the ſucceſs with which it was attended, I aſcribe the perſeverance that has led to the acquirement of the little learning of which I am maſter.</p>
            <p>This ſtudy was, too, attended with another advantage: it kept me out of miſchief. I was always ſober, and regular in my attendance; and, not being a clumſy fellow, I met with none of thoſe reproofs, which diſguſt ſo many young men with the ſervice.</p>
            <p>There is no ſituation where merit is ſo ſure to meet with reward as in a well diſciplined army. Thoſe who command are obliged to reward it for their own eaſe and credit. I was ſoon raiſed to the rank of Corporal, a rank, which, however contemptible it may appear in ſome people's eyes, brought me in a clear two-pence <hi>per diem,</hi> and put a very clever worſted knot upon my ſhoulder too. Don't you laugh now, Mr. Swanwick; a worſted knot is a much more honourable mark of diſtinction than a <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe badge;</hi> though, I confeſs, the king muſt have ſuch people as Tide-waiters as well as Corporals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030212_0027_0FE52040D0816720"/>As promotion began to dawn, I grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to get to my regiment, where I expected ſoon to baſk under the rays of Royal favour. The happy day of departure at laſt came: we ſet ſail from Graveſend, and, after a ſhort and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſſage, arrived at Hallifax in Nova Scotia. When I firſt beheld the barren, not to ſay hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rocks at the entrance of the harbour, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fear that the maſter of the veſſel had miſtaken his way; for I could perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that fertility that my good recruiting Captain had dwelt on with ſo much delight.</p>
            <p>Nova Scotia had no other charm for me than that of novelty. Every thing I ſaw was new: bogs, rocks and ſtumps, muſquitoes and bull-frogs. Thouſands of Captains and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels without ſoldiers, and of 'Squires without ſtockings or ſhoes. In England, I had never thought of approaching a 'Squire without a moſt reſpectful bow; but, in this new world, though I was but a Corporal, I often ordered a 'Squire to bring me a glaſs of grog, and even to take care of my knapſack.</p>
            <p>We ſtaid but a few weeks in Nova Scotia, being ordered to St. John's, in the Province of New Brunſwick. Here, and at other places in the ſame Province, we remained till the month of September, 1791, when the regiment was relieved, and ſent home.</p>
            <p>We landed at Portſmouth on the 3d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, and on the 19th of the next month I obtained my diſcharge, after having ſerved not

quite eight years, and after having, in that ſhort ſpace, paſſed through every rank, from that of a private ſentinel to that of Sergeant Major, without ever being once diſgraced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, or even reprimanded.—But, let my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors ſpeak for me, they will tell my friends and all my readers what I was during my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</p>

            <p>After having laid theſe pieces before my reader, I beg him to recollect what the <hi>Argus</hi> of New York and the <hi>Aurora</hi> of Philadelphia have aſſerted concerning Peter Porcupine's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flogged in his regiment for thieving, and afterwards deſerting. The monſtrous, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing, democratic gang were not aware that I was in poſſeſſion of ſuch uncontrovertible proofs as theſe.</p>
            <p>I hope, I may preſume that my character will be looked upon as good, down to the date of my diſcharge; and, if ſo, it only remains for me to give an account of myſelf from that time to this.</p>
            <p>The democrats have aſſerted, as may be ſeen in the preface, that I got my living in London by "garret-ſcribbling," and that I was obliged to <q>take a <hi>French Leave</hi> for France, for ſome <hi>night work.</hi>
               </q>—Now, the fact is, I went to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030212_0030_0FE520AD89924588"/>
France in March, 1792, and I landed at New York in the month of October following; ſo that, I had but three months to follow <q>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret-ſcribbling</q> in London. How theſe three months were employed it is not neceſſary to ſay here, but that I had not much leiſure for <q>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret-ſcribbling</q> the ladies will be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, when I tell them that I got a wife in the time. As to the charge concerning <q>night work,</q> I am afraid I muſt plead guilty, but not with my "fingers," as theſe malicious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows would inſinuate. No, no, I am no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Citizen <hi>Plato:</hi> the French ladies do not call me, the <hi>Garçon Fendu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I go any further, it ſeems neceſſary to ſay a word or two about "French Leave." Did this expreſſion eſcape the democrats in an unwary moment? Why "French Leave?" Do they wiſh to inſinuate, that nobody but <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are obliged to fly from the hands of thief-catchers? The Germans, and after them the Engliſh, have applied this degrading expreſſion to the French nation; but, is it not inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and even ungrateful, for thoſe who are in the intereſt, and perhaps, in the pay, of that magnanimous republic, to talk about <q>French Leave?</q> It is ſomething curious that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſhould find a place in a paragraph wherein I am accuſed of abuſing the French. The fact is, the friendſhip profeſſed by theſe people, towards the French nation, is all gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace, all hypocriſy: the moment they are off their guard, they let us ſee that it is the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſyſtem of French tyranny that they are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030212_0031_0FE520D50671DF30"/>
attached to, and not to the people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—"French Leave!" The leave of a <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,</hi> a <hi>thief,</hi> a <hi>Tom Paine!</hi> What could the moſt prejudiced, the bittereſt Engliſhman have ſaid more galling and ſevere againſt the whole French nation? They cry out againſt me for <hi>"abuſing"</hi> the cut-throats of Nantz and other places, and for accuſing the demagogue-tyrants of robbery; while they themſelves treat the whole nation as thieves. This is the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic way of waſhing out ſtains; juſt as the ſweet and cleanly Sheelah waſhes her gentle Dermot's face with a diſhclout.</p>
            <p>Leaving the ingenious citizens to extricate themſelves from this hobble, or fall under the diſpleaſure of their maſters, I ſhall return to my adventures.—I arrived in France in March, 1792, and continued there till the beginning of September following, the ſix happieſt months of my life. I ſhould be the moſt ungrateful monſter that ever exiſted, were I to ſpeak ill of the French people in general. I went to that country full of all thoſe prejudices, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen ſuck in with their mother's milk, againſt the French and againſt their religion: a few weeks convinced me that I had been deceived with reſpect to both. I met every where with civility, and even hoſpitality, in a degree that I never had been accuſtomed to. I found the people, among whom I lived, excepting thoſe who were already blaſted with the principles of the accurſed revolution, honeſt, pious, and kind to exceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030212_0032_0FE520A205FC5940"/>People may ſay what they pleaſe about the miſery of the French peaſantry, under the old government; I have converſed with thouſands of them, not ten among whom did not regret the change. I have not room here to go into an inquiry into the cauſes that have led theſe people to become the paſſive inſtruments, the ſlaves, of a ſet of tyrants ſuch as the world never ſaw before, but I venture to predict, that, ſooner or later, they will return to that form of government under which they were happy, and under which alone they can over be ſo again.</p>
            <p>My determination to ſettle in the United States was formed before I went to France, and even before I quitted the army. A deſire of ſeeing a country, ſo long the theatre of a war of which I had heard and read ſo much; the flattering picture given of it by Raynal; and, above all, an inclination for ſeeing the world, led me to this determination. It would look a little like coaxing for me to ſay, that I had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed principles of republicaniſm, and that I was ambitious to become a citizen of a free ſtate, but this was really the caſe. I thought that men enjoyed here a greater degree of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than in England; and this, if not the principal reaſon, was at leaſt one, for my coming to this country.</p>
            <p>I did intend to ſtay in France till the ſpring of 1793, as well to perfect myſelf in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as to paſs the winter at Paris; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſtorm gathering; I ſaw that a war with England was inevitable, and it was not
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030212_0033_0FE4FE3606D55420"/>
difficult to foreſee what would be the fate of Engliſhmen, in that country, where the rulers had laid aſide even the appearance of juſtice and mercy. I wiſhed, however, to ſee Paris, and had actually hired a coach to go thither. I was even on the way, when I heard, at Abbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, that the king was dethroned and his guards murdered. This intelligence made me turn off towards Havre de Grace, whence I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for America.</p>
            <p>I beg leave here to remind the reader, that one of the lying paragraphs, lately publiſhed in the lying <hi>Aurora,</hi> ſtates, that I was whipped at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and that hence I bear a grudge againſt the French Republic. Now, I never was at Paris, as I can prove by the receipts for my board and lodging, from the day I entered France to that of my leaving it; and, as to the Republic, as it is called, I could have no grudge againſt it; for the tyrants had not given it that name, when I was ſo happy as to bid it an eternal adieu. Had I remained a few months longer, I make no doubt that I ſhould have had reaſon to execrate it as every other man, woman, and child has, who has had the misfortune to groan under its iron anarchy.</p>
            <p>Some little time after my arrival in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I ſent Mr. Jefferſon, then Secretary of State, a letter of recommendation, which I had brought from the American Ambaſſador at the Hague. The following is a copy of the letter Mr. Jefferſon wrote me on that occaſion.</p>

            <p>I will juſt obſerve on this letter, that it was thankfully received, and that, had I ſtood in need of Mr. Jefferſon's ſervices, I ſhould have applied to him; but as that did not appear likely to be the caſe, I wrote him a letter ſome few months afterwards, requeſting him to aſſiſt a poor man, the bearer of it, and telling him
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030212_0035_0FE5203DEBDF1440"/>
that I ſhould look upon the aſſiſtance as given to myſelf. I dare ſay he complied with my requeſt, for the perſon recommended was in deep diſtreſs, and a <hi>Frenchman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to the authenticity of this letter there can be no doubt. I have ſhown the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, as well as thoſe of the other documents here tranſcribed, to more than fifty gentlemen of the city of Philadelphia, and they may, at any time, be ſeen by any perſon of credit, who wiſhes a ſight of them. Nor have I confined the peruſal of them to thoſe who have the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be deemed ariſtocrats. Among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of diſtant places, I have ſhown them to Mr. <hi>Ketlatas</hi> of New York, who, I muſt do him the juſtice to ſay, had the candour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a becoming deteſtation of the baſe cut-throat author of the threatening letter ſent to Mr. Oldden.</p>
            <p>I have now brought myſelf to the United States, and have enabled the reader to judge of me ſo far. It remains for me to negative two aſſertions which apply to my authoring tranſactions: the one is, that <q>
                  <hi>Mr. Bradford</hi> put a coat upon my back;</q> and the other, that I am, or have been, <q>in the pay of a Britiſh Agent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the month of July, 1794, the famous Unitarian Doctor, fellow of the <hi>Royal</hi> Society, London, <hi>citizen</hi> of France, and delegate to the <hi>Grande Convention Nationale</hi> of notorious memory, landed at New-York. His landing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030212_0036_0FE520D68B0A6E68"/>
was nothing to me, nor to any body elſe; but the fulſome and conſequential addreſſes, ſent him by the pretended patriots, and his canting replies, at once calculated to flatter the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here, and to degrade his country and mine, was ſomething to me. It was my buſineſs, and the buſineſs of every man who thinks that truth ought to be oppoſed to malice and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Obſervations</hi> on the Emigration of this "martyr to the cauſe of liberty" were ready for the preſs, I did not, at firſt, offer them to Mr. Bradford. I knew him to retain a rooted hatred againſt Great Britain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that his principles would prevent him from being inſtrumental in the publication of any thing that tended to unveil one of its moſt bitter enemies. I therefore addreſſed myſelf to Mr. Carey. This was, to make uſe of a culinary figure, jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. Mr. Carey received me as book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers generally receive authors (I mean au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whom they hope to get but little by): he looked at the title from top to bottom, and then at me from head to foot.—"No, <hi>my lad,</hi>" ſays he, "I don't think it will ſuit"—<hi>My lad!</hi>— God in heaven forgive me! I believe that, at that moment, I wiſhed for another yellow fever to ſtrike the city; not to deſtroy the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but to furniſh me too with <hi>the ſubject of a pamphlet,</hi> that might make me rich.—Mr. Carey has ſold hundreds of the <hi>Obſervations</hi> ſince that time, and therefore, I dare ſay he highly approved of them, when he came to a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030212_0037_0FE52035394E0F28"/>
peruſal. At any rate, I muſt not forget to ſay, that he behaved honourably in the buſineſs; for, he promiſed not to make known the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and he certainly kept his word, or the diſcovery would not have been reſerved for the month of June, 1796. This circumſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Mr. Carey's politics, is greatly to his honour, and has almoſt wiped from my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory that contumelious <hi>"my lad."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Mr. Carey I went to Mr. Bradford, and left the pamphlet for his peruſal. The next day I went to him to know his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He heſitated, wanted to know if I could not make it a little <hi>more popular,</hi> adding that, unleſs I could, he feared that the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it would endanger <hi>his windows. More popular</hi> I could not make it. I never was of an accommodating diſpoſition in my life. The only alteration I would conſent to was in the title. I had given the pamphlet the double ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of, <q>The Tartuffe Detected; <hi>or,</hi> Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> The former was ſuppreſſed, though, had I not been pretty certain that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſs in the city was as little free as that to which I was ſending it, the <hi>Tartuffe Detected</hi> ſhould have remained; for, the perſon on whom it was beſtowed merited it much better than the character ſo named by Moliére.</p>
            <p>Theſe difficulties, and theſe fears of the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, at once opened my eyes with reſpect to the boaſted liberty of the preſs. Becauſe the laws of this country proclaim to the world, that every man may write and publiſh freely,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030212_0038_0FE520D0C63F4DE0"/>
and becauſe I ſaw the news-papers filled with vaunts on the ſubject, I was fool enough to imagine that the preſs was really free for every one. I had not the leaſt idea, that a man's windows were in danger of being broken, if he publiſhed any thing that was <hi>not popular.</hi> I did, indeed, ſee the words <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>equality,</hi> the <hi>rights of man,</hi> the <hi>crimes of kings,</hi> and ſuch like, in moſt of the bookſeller's windows; but I did not know that they were put there to ſave the glaſs, as a free republican Frenchman puts a cockade tricolor in his hat to ſave his head. I was ignorant of all theſe <hi>arcana</hi> of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preſs.</p>
            <p>If it had ſo happened that one of the Whiſkey-Boys had went over to England, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived addreſſes from any part of the people there, congratulating him on his eſcape from a nation of ruffians, and beſeeching the Lord that thoſe ruffians might <q>tread back the paths of <hi>infamy</hi> and <hi>ruin;</hi>
               </q> and if this emigrating <hi>"Martyr"</hi> in the cauſe of whiſkey had echoed back the hypocritical cant, and if he and all his palavering addreſſers had been detected and expoſed by ſome good American, in London, would not ſuch an American have received the applauſe of all men of virtue and ſenſe? And what would, or rather what would not, have been ſaid here againſt the proſtituted preſs of Great Britain, had an Engliſh bookſeller teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his fears to publiſh the truth, leſt his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſhould be daſhed in?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:030212_0039_0FE520232E8EABB0"/>The work that it was feared would draw down puniſhment on the publiſher, did not contain one untruth, one anarchical, indecent, immoral, or irreligious expreſſion; and yet the bookſeller feared for his windows! For what? Becauſe it was not <hi>popular enough.</hi> A bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in a <hi>deſpotic</hi> ſtate fears to publiſh a work that is <hi>too popular</hi> and one in a <hi>free</hi> ſtate fears to publiſh a work that is not <hi>popular enough.</hi> I leave it to the learned philoſophers of the "Age of Reaſon" to determine in which of theſe ſtates there is the moſt liberty of the preſs; for, I muſt acknowledge the point is too nice for me: fear is fear, whether inſpired by a Sovereign Lord the King, or by a Sovereign People.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be told, that Mr. Bradford's fears were groundleſs. It may be ſo; but he ought to be a competent judge of the matter; he muſt know the extent of the liberty of the preſs better than I could. He might be miſtaken, but that he was ſincere appeared clearly from his not putting his name at the bottom of the title page. Even the <hi>Bone to Gnaw for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrats,</hi> which did not appear till about ſix months afterwards, was <q>Publiſhed for the Purchaſers.</q> It was not till long after the public had fixed the ſeal of approbation on theſe pamphlets, that they were honoured with the bookſeller's name. It was ſomething curious that the ſecond and third and fourth editions ſhould be entitled to a mark of reſpect that the firſt was not worthy of. Poor little innocents! They were thrown on the pariſh
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030212_0040_0FE5205B30618368"/>
like foundlings; no ſoul would own them, till it was found that they poſſeſſed the gift of bringing in the pence. Another ſingularity, is, they got into better paper as they advanced. So the prudent matron changes the little dirty ragged wench into a fine mademoiſelle, as ſoon as ſhe perceives that the beaux begin to caſt their eyes on her.</p>
            <p>But, it is time to return, and give the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er an account of my gains. The pecuniary concerns of an author are always the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting.</p>
            <p>The terms on which Mr. Bradford took the <hi>Obſervations,</hi> were what bookſellers call <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it together.</hi> I beg the reader, if he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees the poſſibility of his becoming author, to recollect this phraſe well. <hi>Publiſhing it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is thus managed: the bookſeller takes the work, prints it, and defrays all expenſes of paper, binding, &amp;c. and the profits, if any, are divided between him and the author. —Long after the Obſervations were ſold off, Mr. Bradford rendered me an account (undoubtedly a very juſt one) of the ſales. According to this account, my ſhare of the profits (my ſhare only) amounted to the ſum of <hi>one ſhilling and ſeven-pence half-penny,</hi> curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the State of Pennſylvania (or, about eleven-pence three farthings ſterling), quite entirely clear of all deductions whatſoever!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:030212_0041_0FE520AA7A989858"/>Now, bulky as this ſum appears in words at length, I preſume, that when 1∫7½ is reduced to figures, no one will ſuppoſe it ſufficient to put a coat upon my back. If my poor back were not too broad to be clothed with ſuch a ſum as this, God knows how I ſhould bear all that has been, and is, and is to be, laid on it by the unmerciful democrats. Why! 1∫7½ would not cover the back of a Lilliputian; no, not even in rags, as they ſell here.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this clothing ſtory will at once fall to the ground, when I aſſure the reader (and Mr. Carey will bear witneſs to the truth of what I ſay), that, when I offered this work for publication, I had as good a coat upon my back, as ever Mr. Bradford or any of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookſellers put on in their lives; and, what is more, this coat was my own. No taylor nor ſhoemaker ever had my name in his books.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Obſervations,</hi> Mr. Bradford and I <hi>publiſhed it together</hi> no longer. When a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet was ready for the preſs, we made a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for it, and I took his note of hand, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in one, two, or three months. That the public may know exactly what gains I have derived from the publications that iſſued from Mr. Bradford's, I here ſubjoin a liſt of them, and the ſums received in payment.</p>

            <p>I propoſed making a mere collection of the debates, with here and there a note by way of remarks. It was not my intention to publiſh it in Numbers, but at the end of the ſeſſion, in one volume; but Mr. Bradford, fearing a want of ſucceſs in this form, determined on publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030212_0043_0FE5209DB2ACDEB0"/>
in Numbers. This was without my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as was alſo a ſubſcription that was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſupport of the work. When about half a Number was finiſhed, I was informed that many gentlemen had expreſſed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that the work might contain a good deal of original matter, and few debates. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, I was requeſted to alter my plan; I ſaid I would, but that I would by no means undertake to continue the work.</p>

            <p>When Mr. Bradford found I was preparing to publiſh a continuation of the remarks on the debates, he ſent me the following note:

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:030212_0046_0FE5208302B494C8"/>Here ended the correſpondence, except that it might be ſaid to be continued for about five minutes longer by the hearty laugh, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on this <hi>correct</hi> and polite billet.</p>
            <p>It is ſomething truly ſingular, that Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſhould threaten me with a proſecution for not writing, juſt at the moment that others threatened me with a proſecution for writing. It ſeemed a little difficult to ſet both at open defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet this was done, by continuing to write, and by employing another bookſeller.</p>
            <p>Indeed theſe bookſellers, in general, are a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el race. They imagine that the ſoul and body of every author that falls into their hands, is their excluſive property. They have adopted the bird-catcher's maxim: <q>a bird that can ſing, and wont ſing, ought to be made ſing.</q> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their devils are out of employment, the drudging goblin of an author muſt ſharpen up his pen, and never think of repoſe till he is relieved by the arrival of a more profitable job. Then the wretch may remain as undiſturbed as a ſleep-mouſe in winter, while the ſtupid dolt whom he has clad and fattened, receives the applauſe.</p>
            <p>I now come to the aſſertion, that I am, or have been, in the pay of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place the democrats ſwear that I have been <q>frequently viſited by a certain Agent,</q> meaning I ſuppoſe Mr. Bond: to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030212_0047_0FE52057ED9301E8"/>
this I anſwer, that it is an abominable lie. I never ſaw Mr. Bond but three times in my life, and then I had buſineſs with him as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Frenchmen, who wanted certificates from him, in order to ſecure their property in the conquered colonies. I never in my life ſpoke to, correſponded with, or even ſaw, to my knowledge, either of the Britiſh Miniſters, or any one of their retinue. Mr. Bradford once told me, that Mr. Allen, the father-in-law of Mr. Hammond, ſaid he was acquainted with me. If this gentleman did really ſay ſo, he joked, or he told a lie; for he never ſaw me in his life, that I know of.</p>
            <p>A little while after the New Year's Gift was publiſhed, an attack was made in the <hi>Argus</hi> of New York, on the ſuppoſed author of it; in conſequence of which, this ſuppoſed author, or ſome one in his behalf, took occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in Mr. Claypoole's paper, that it was uncandid to attribute to a gentleman of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable character, what was well known to be the work of a democrat. I had a great mind to ſay at that time, what I ſhall now ſay; and that is, that let this gentleman be who he will, I think myſelf as good as he, and of as good a character too; and that, as to the diſhonour attached to the publication, I am willing to take it all to myſelf.</p>
            <p>It is hard to prove a negative; it is what no man is expected to do; yet, I think I can prove, that the accuſation of my being in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030212_0048_0FE520817A0AFE58"/>
pay is not ſupported by one ſingle fact, or the leaſt ſhadow of probability.</p>
            <p>When a foreign government hires a writer, it takes care that his labours ſhall be diſtributed, whether the readers are all willing to pay for them or not. This we daily ſee verified in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of certain blaſphemous gazettes, which, though kicked from the door with diſdain, flies in at the window. Now, has this ever been the caſe with the works of Peter Porcupine? Were they ever thruſted upon people in ſpite of their remonſtrances? Can Mr. Bradford ſay that thouſands of theſe pamphlets have ever been paid for by any agent of Great Britain? Can he ſay that I have ever diſtributed any of them? No; he can ſay no ſuch thing. They had, at firſt, to encounter every difficulty, and they have made their way ſupported by public approbation, and by that alone. Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, if he is candid enough to repeat what he told me, will ſay, that the Britiſh Conſul, when he purchaſed half a dozen of them, inſiſted upon having them <hi>at the wholeſale price!</hi> Did this look like a deſire to encourage them? Beſides, thoſe who know any thing of Mr. Bradford, will never believe, that he would have lent his aid to a Britiſh Agent's publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for, of all the Americans I have yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with, he ſeems to entertain the greateſt degree of rancour againſt that nation.</p>
            <p>I have every reaſon to believe, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Conſul was far from approving of ſome, at
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030212_0049_0FE5205E1673FC60"/>
leaſt, of my publications. I happened to be in a bookſeller's ſhop, unſeen by him, when he had the goodneſs to ſay, that I was a <q>wild fellow.</q> On which I ſhall only obſerve, that when the King beſtows on me about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds ſterling a year, perhaps, I may become a <hi>tame fellow,</hi> and hear my maſter, my countrymen, my friends and my parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied and execrated, without ſaying one ſingle word in their defence.</p>
            <p>Had the Miniſter of Great Britain employed me to write, can it be ſuppoſed that he would not furniſh me with the means of living well, without becoming the retailer of my own works? Can it be ſuppoſed that he would have ſuffered me ever to appear on the ſcene? It muſt be a very poor king that he ſerves, if he could not afford me more than I can get by keeping a book-ſhop. An Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador from a king of the Gypſies could not have acted a meaner part. What! where was all the "gold of Pitt?" That gold which tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the democrats, an American Envoy to ſell his country, and two-thirds of the Senate to ratifiy the bargain: that gold which, according to the Convention of France, has made one half of that nation cut the throats of the other half; that potent gold could not keep Peter Porcupine from ſtanding behind a counter to ſell a pen-knife, or a quire of paper!</p>
            <p>Muſt it not be evident, too, that the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſhop would take up a great part of my time? Time that was hardly worth a paying

for at all, if it was not of higher value than the profits on a few pamphlets. Every one knows that the Cenſor has been delayed on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my entering on buſineſs; would the Miniſter of Great Britain have ſuffered this, had I been in his pay? No; I repeat, that it is downright ſtupidity to ſuppoſe, that he would ever have ſuffered me to appear at all, had he even felt in the leaſt intereſted in the fate of my works, or the effect they might produce. He muſt be ſenſible, that, ſeeing the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable prejudices exiſting in this country, my being known to be an Engliſhman would operate weightily againſt whatever I might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. I ſaw this very plainly myſelf; but, as I had a living to get, and as I had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on this line of buſineſs, ſuch a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was not to awe me into idleneſs, or make me forego any other advantages that I had reaſon to hope I ſhould enjoy.</p>
            <p>The notion of my being in Britiſh pay aroſe from my having now-and-then taken upon me to attempt a defence of the character of that nation, and of the intentions of its government towards the United States. But, have I ever teazed my readers with this, except when the ſubject neceſſarily demanded it? And if I have given way to my indignation when a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical political divine attempted to degrade my country, or when its vile calumniators call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it "an inſular Baſtile," what have I done more than every good man in my place would have done? What have I done more than my duty; than obeyed the feelings of my heart?
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030212_0051_0FE520E002777C28"/>
When a man hears his country reviled, does it require that he ſhould be paid for ſpeaking in its defence?</p>
            <p>Beſides, had my works been intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Britiſh influence, they would have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a more conciliating tone. The author would have flattered the people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, even in their exceſſes; he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to gain over the enemies of Britain by ſmooth and ſoothing language; he would have "ſtooped to conquer;" he would not, as I have done, rendered them hatred for hatred, and ſcorn for ſcorn.</p>
            <p>My writings, the firſt pamphlet excepted, have had no other object than that of keeping alive an attachment to the Conſtitution of the United States and the ineſtimable man who is at the head of the government, and to paint in their true colours thoſe who are the enemies of both; to warn the people, of all ranks and deſcriptions, of the danger of admitting among them, the anarchical and blaſphemous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the French revolutioniſts, principles as oppoſite to thoſe of liberty as hell is to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If, therefore, I have written at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Britiſh agent, that agent muſt moſt certainly deſerve the thanks of all the real friends of America. But, ſay ſome of the half democrats, what right have you to meddle with the defence of our government at all?— The ſame right that you have to exact my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, and my contribution towards its ſupport. Several Engliſhmen, not ſo long in

the country as I had been, ſerved in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia againſt the weſtern rebels, and, had I been called on, I muſt have ſerved too. Surely a man has a right to defend with his pen, that which he may be compelled to defend with a muſquet.</p>
            <p>As to the real, bloody, cut-throats, they carry their notion of excluding me from the uſe of the preſs ſtill further. "While" (ſays one of them) <q>While I am a friend to the <hi>unlimited</hi> freedom of the preſs, when exerciſed by <hi>an American,</hi> I am an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foe to its proſtitution to a <hi>foreigner,</hi> and would at any time aſſiſt in hunting out of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, any meddling foreigner who ſhould dare to interfere in our politics. I hope the apathy of our <hi>brethren</hi> of Philadelphia will no longer be indulged, and that an exemplary <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> will ſoon burſt upon the head of ſuch a preſumptuous fellow.—<hi>Juſtice, honour,</hi> national <hi>gratitude,</hi> all call for it.—May it no longer be delayed.</q>

            <p>Are not you, Mr. Swanwick, the Preſident of the Emigration Society? Well, then, Sir, as your inſtitution is ſaid to be for the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons emigrating from foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, be ſo good as to inſert the little extract, above quoted, in your next diſpatches for a cargo of emigrants. Above all, Sir, be ſure to tell thoſe who are diſpoſed to emigrate from England, thoſe martyrs in the cauſe of liberty; be ſure to tell them that this is the land of <hi>equal</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:030212_0053_0FE52093DA75A6B0"/>
liberty; that here, and here alone, they will find the true unlimited freedom of the preſs, but that, if they dare to make uſe of it, <q>
                  <hi>juſtice, honour,</hi> national <hi>gratitude,</hi> will call for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary <hi>vengeance</hi> on their heads.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould not have noticed this diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>foreigners</hi> and <hi>Americans,</hi> had I not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that ſeveral perſons, who are, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, friends to their country, ſeem to think that it was impertinent in me to meddle with the politics here, becauſe I was an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman. I would have theſe good people to recollect, that the laws of this country hold out, to foreigners, an offer of all that liberty of the preſs which Americans enjoy, and that, if this liberty be abridged, by whatever means it may be done, the laws and the conſtitution and all together is a mere cheat; a ſnare to catch the credulous and enthuſiaſtic of every other nation; a downright impoſition on the world. If people who emigrate hither have not a right to make uſe of the liberty of the preſs, while the natives have, it is very ill done to call this a country of <hi>equal</hi> liberty. <hi>Equal,</hi> above all epithets, is the moſt improper that can be applied to it; for, if none but Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans have acceſs to the preſs, they are the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and foreigners are their ſubjects, nay their ſlaves. An honourable and comfortable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon my word! The emigrants from ſome countries may be content with it, perhaps: I would not ſay, that the <q>Martyrs in the cauſe of liberty</q> from England, would not quietly bend beneath the yoke, as, indeed, they are
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030212_0054_0FE52079C4F14DF8"/>
in duty bound to do; but, for my part, who have not the ambition to aſpire to the crown of martyrdom, I muſt and I will be excuſed. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the laws ſhall be altered, or I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to avail myſelf of the liberty that they held out to me, and that partly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to the country. When an act is paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for excluding Engliſhmen from exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their talents, and from promulgating what they write, then will I deſiſt; but, I hope, when that time arrives; no act will be paſſed to prevent people from emigrating back again.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, it ſeems neceſſary to ſay a word or two about the miſerable ſhift, which the democrats have had recourſe to, reſpecting the infamous letter of <hi>Citizen Hint.</hi> They now pretend, that I fabricated it myſelf, though I have publicly declared, that it was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into my hands by a gentleman of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe name I have mentioned. Can any one be ſtupid enough to imagine, that I would, particularly at this time, have run the riſk of being detected in ſuch a ſhameful buſineſs? And, how could it have been undertaken without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that riſk? Had I written it myſelf, there would have been my hand-writing againſt me, and had I employed another, that other might have betrayed me; he might have ruined me in the opinion of all thoſe, whom it is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as well as my pride to be eſteemed by; or, at beſt, I ſhould have been at his mercy for ever afterwards.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:030212_0055_0FE4FE209F48AAC0"/>Beſides the great riſk of detection, let any one point out, if he can, what end I could propoſe to myſelf by ſuch a device. As to making my ſhop and myſelf known, I preſume I did not ſtand in need of a ſcare-crow, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that, when the kind democrats themſelves had publiſhed to the whole Union, that I had taken the houſe in which I live, for the purpoſe of retailing my "poiſon," as they called it, and had even had the candour to tell the world, that I had paid my rent in advance.<note n="*" place="bottom">
