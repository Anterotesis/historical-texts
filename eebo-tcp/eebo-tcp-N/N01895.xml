            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the Concern of every one that would enjoy <hi>Tranquillity</hi> in this World, or obtain <hi>Felicity</hi> in the World to come, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Holy Direction of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf in PIETY.</hi> And there is no <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of PIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY more unexceptionable than that of <hi>making a Joyful</hi> Noiſe of SINGING in the Praiſes of our GOD; That of ſignifying our <hi>Delight</hi> in Divine <hi>Truths</hi> by SINGING of them; That of <hi>Uttering</hi> the Sentiments of Devotion, with the <hi>Voice,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Modulation of the Voice,</hi> as will naturally expreſs the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which a Grave SONG ſhall be expreſſive of. 'Tis indeed a very <hi>Ancient Way</hi> of Glorifying the Bleſſed GOD; As <hi>Ancient</hi> as the Day <hi>when the Foundations of the Earth were faſtened,</hi> and <hi>the Corner-Stone thereof was laid.</hi> The
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002241_0007_0FDAD6964BF8E160"/>
               <hi>Morning-Stars</hi> then <hi>Sang together.</hi> And it is as <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> an one; For it is Remarkable, That <hi>All Nations</hi> make SINGING to be one part of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> which they pay unto their GOD. Thoſe Few <hi>Untuned Souls,</hi> who affect upon Principle to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the reſt of Mankind, by the Character of <hi>Non-Singers,</hi> do ſeem too much to diveſt themſelves of an <hi>Humanity,</hi> whereof it may be ſaid unto them, <hi>Doth not Nature it ſelf teach it you?</hi> Be ſure, they ſufficiently differ from the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians;</hi> For, though the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches were at firſt Superiour to the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> for the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of GOD</hi> in this matter, yet both betimes Concurr'd in it. Not only <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as well as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and ſeveral others of the <hi>Primitive Writers,</hi> but alſo Governour <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf will tell us, what <hi>Singers to their GOD,</hi> the Faithful were then known to be; and how much they <hi>Worſhipped</hi> Him in theſe <hi>Beauties of Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. BUT this piece of <hi>Natural Worſhip</hi> is further Confirmed by a <hi>poſitive Inſtitution</hi> of GOD our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR for it. The <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> with which the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has Enriched us, have directed us unto this <hi>Way</hi> of Worſhipping. In our <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> we there find it as a Command of GOD; but Calculated particularly for Times under the <hi>New-Teſtament:</hi> Pſal. LXVIII. 32. <hi>Sing Praiſes unto GOD, ye Kingdoms of the Earth, O Sing Praiſes unto the Lord.</hi> And Pſal. C. 1, 2. <hi>Make a Joyful Noiſe unto the Lord, All ye Lands; Come into his Preſence with Singing.</hi> The <hi>Ninety-fifth Pſalm</hi> in our Pſalter, does according to the Interpretation of our Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> an <hi>Interpreter, One of a Thouſand,</hi> certainly to be relied upon! — Preſcribe the <hi>Duties</hi> of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Days of the Goſpel. But what is the <hi>Firſt</hi> of thoſe Duties? <hi>O come, Let us Sing unto the Lord, Let us with Pſalms make a Joyful Noiſe unto Him.</hi> In our <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> it ſelf
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002241_0008_0FDAD6A20E0508F8"/>'tis a Thing ſo poſitively enjoined, that it muſt be a wonder, if any Chriſtian can make any Queſtion of it. How plainly is it commanded? Jam. V. 13. <hi>Is any cheerful among you, Let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> Yea, In the <hi>Pauline</hi> Epiſtles, we have it; how frequently, how earneſtly inculcated! This Exerciſe is none of thoſe <hi>Intruſions</hi> into our <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which the <hi>Worſhippers in the Inner-Court,</hi> wou'd ſee a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> ſerv'd upon, 'Tis <hi>Warranted</hi> with a moſt Inconteſtible <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. THE <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> which have <hi>Directed</hi> us to <hi>Sing unto the Lord, and Bleſs His Name;</hi> have alſo <hi>ſupplied</hi> us with an admirable and ſufficient <hi>Matter</hi> for our <hi>Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have a PSALTER, whereof the biggeſt part is of PSALMS, that were Compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>ſweet Singer of Iſrael;</hi> A <hi>David,</hi> who being the <hi>Last</hi> of the Limitations which the Glorious GOD made of the <hi>Line,</hi> wherein the <hi>Firſt Promiſe</hi> was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, GOD for the ſake of that REDEEMER, diſtinguiſhed him, with doing of amazing Things for him, and by him; whereof <hi>This</hi> was one, that he was made the greateſt <hi>Inſtrument</hi> for aſſiſting the Devotions of the Church, that ever was in the World. The reſt were Compoſed by other <hi>Holy Men of GOD, who wrote as they were moved by the Holy SPIRIT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN both <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> we have Compoſures under a <hi>Poetical Dreſs,</hi> fitted unto <hi>Tunes,</hi> that were then known in the Church of GOD. The moſt <hi>Ancient Song</hi> that is now extant in the World is That in the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> Chapter of <hi>Exodus:</hi> In which there is a ſurprizing <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of what is to be Sung upon the <hi>Perdition</hi> of <hi>Anti-chriſt.</hi> Except the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> which (all but the Two firſt Chapters, and the Laſt,) is a <hi>Poem</hi> writ in Verſe, might (perhaps by <hi>Moſes,</hi> making a preſent of it unto his Country-Men under their <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Captivity) be written before it.</p>

THE aſtoniſhing Song, in the Thirty ſecond Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> was prepared in the Heavenly World, and ſent from thence by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Witneſs</hi> for GOD, among the Sons of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> is a Rare <hi>Poem,</hi> and one that it ſeems the Wicked <hi>Homer</hi> was no more a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to, than he was to our <hi>Eighteenth Pſalm,</hi> when he formed the curſed <hi>Iliad,</hi> with which he brought in upon the World, a Flood of Debaucheries and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties.</p>
            <p>IN the Song of <hi>Hannah,</hi> we have the Name of The MESSIAH, firſt mentioned.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>Song of Songs</hi> penned by <hi>Solomon,</hi> we have the promiſed MESSIAH, whom his Father had Sung in our <hi>Forty fifth Pſalm,</hi> appearing in the Habit of a <hi>Royal High-Prieſt,</hi> and the Eſpouſal between Him and His Church, (the <hi>Tipheret</hi> and the <hi>Maleuth</hi>) celebrated, with Metaphors, wherein <hi>he ſpake of Trees,</hi> and produced a Noble <hi>Paſtoral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> (except the Nine firſt Chapters,) gives us, as it was the Cuſtom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the <hi>Maxims of Wiſdom,</hi> in ſuch a way as to be <hi>Sung</hi> among the People.</p>
            <p>IN the Volumn of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> there are more than One or Two <hi>Songs,</hi> (beſides that of, <hi>The Vineyard,</hi>) which are of a lofty ſtrain, and full of Evangelical Myſteries. That of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is tranſcendently wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be <hi>Printed in a Book; to be graven with an Iron pen and Lead in the Rock forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Book of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> has Two Chapters, wherein the <hi>Tears given in great Meaſure,</hi> to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, are Poetically <hi>meaſured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Book of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> has in it, a Song, than which, can any thing be more <hi>Sublime</hi> or <hi>Seraphic?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> have more than a little of, <hi>The Wonderful,</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>'TIS not long, before the <hi>Multitude of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Hoſt,</hi> invite us to a Conſort with <hi>them,</hi> in One
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002241_0010_0FDAD6B9B91E0260"/>of the <hi>Songs</hi> which will enable us to <hi>ſpeak</hi> (and ſing) <hi>with the Tongue of Men and Angels.</hi> The Expiring <hi>Simeon</hi> mounting up to Heaven, <hi>Sings as he Mounts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANON, in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> we have more <hi>Songs</hi> in which we over hear the <hi>Holy Ones</hi> in the Heavenly World, Glorifying our GOD and SAVIOUR; And, <hi>O lifted up to Heaven we,</hi> in theſe Communications!</p>
            <p>HERE is our PSALTER! And were we enriched with no more Treaſures than Theſe, wherein the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has thus provided for the <hi>Songs</hi> of His People, what a precious Article in, <hi>The Unſearchable Riches of</hi> CHRIST, have we therein to be exceedingly Thankful for?</p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſing that we have no <hi>other Portions</hi> of the Inſpired Writings exhibited in the <hi>Tuneable Poetry</hi> of the Ancients, muſt we thence conclude, that we are forbidden to put any other <hi>Portions</hi> of them into ſuch a <hi>Metre,</hi> as may render them capable of being <hi>Song</hi> among the People of GOD?

            <p>§ 4. THE <hi>Songs</hi> which are <hi>prepared</hi> for us by the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, in the <hi>Inſpired Writings,</hi> that <hi>ſhine in this Dark Place,</hi> ought certainly to be <hi>preferred</hi> with us, before any meer <hi>Human Compoſures,</hi> in the <hi>Public Worſhip of the Faithful.</hi> Thoſe which for their Original are peculiarly the <hi>Songs of Zion,</hi> are the moſt proper to be uſed in its <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi> 'Tis
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002241_0011_0FDAD6A4934063F8"/>true, Devout <hi>Hymns</hi> Compoſed by the Good Men of our own Time, affected with the Truths of GOD, and able to <hi>Handle the Pen of the Writer,</hi> for ſoaring Poetry, may be uſed, and found <hi>good for the Uſe of Edifying.</hi> From <hi>Tertullian</hi> we Learn, that in his early Days, the Chriſtians uſed even ſuch <hi>Hymns</hi> as were conceived by themſelves, <hi>de proprio Ingenio. Socrates</hi> mentions the <hi>Pſalms</hi> written by <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> mentions the <hi>Pſalms</hi> written by <hi>Nepos.</hi> The <hi>Arians</hi> made many <hi>Hymns</hi> to be Sung, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of their <hi>Hereſies:</hi> And the <hi>Orthodox</hi> willing to be <hi>made wiſe from their Enemies,</hi> made <hi>Hymns</hi> for the Preſervation of the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> Yea, <hi>Great was the Army</hi> of them, who followed <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in the Publiſhing of <hi>Hymns</hi> for the uſe of the Latin Church. The <hi>Te Deum</hi> aſcribed unto <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> makes to this Day a mighty Noiſe in the World. The <hi>German Pſalter</hi> has in it <hi>Hymns</hi> of <hi>Luthers</hi> Compoſing. And in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches of the later Days, they had a <hi>Cantional</hi> in which there were ſeven hundred and forty <hi>Sacred Songs</hi> beſides the <hi>Davidical Pſalms.</hi> But certainly, the <hi>Hymns</hi> of <hi>Uninſpired</hi> Men, cannot be ſo <hi>Profitable</hi> for all <hi>Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and may not have ſo much Reſpect paid unto them, as thoſe that are <hi>given by Inſpiration of GOD. Auſtin</hi> did well to blame the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> for leaving the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and Singing <hi>Hymns</hi> of their own Invention. Yea, if the Limitations ordered by a Synod at <hi>Bracara,</hi> were perhaps a little too ſtrict, <hi>Extra Pſalmos veteris Teſtamenti, nihil Poetice Compoſitum, in Eccleſia Pſallatur,</hi> yet it was a Wiſe order paſſed in a Synod at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that forbad <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Private Pſalms</hi> to be uſed in the Church. The French Churches, have wiſely confined themſelves unto the <hi>Scriptural Songs;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monized with them, in paſſing that Order, <hi>In Eccleſiis cantabuntur Pſalmi Davidis, Omiſſiscanticis quae in S. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura nou reperiuntur.</hi> Can any thing be ſo Rich, ſo Full, ſo ſublime, as what the Holy SPIRIT of GOD
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002241_0012_0FDAD6BB397BE1A0"/>has declared? Every Line will weigh againſt a <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Wedge of Ophir;</hi> Every Word is a <hi>Pearl,</hi> and has a ſenſe and worth in it, that is Invaluable. The Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> were Sung in <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> time, as well as in <hi>Solomon's,</hi> and in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> time, we read, <hi>He commanded the Levites to ſing praiſe unto the Lord, with the Words of David and of Aſaph.</hi> Words of an Excellency and an Efficacy, which are not found but where the <hi>Spirit of the Lord ſpeaks by</hi> Men, and <hi>His Word is in their Tongue.</hi> Yea, Even the <hi>Song of the Lamb,</hi> in the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſeems to be fetched out of our <hi>Eighty ſixth</hi> Pſalm; and the Song of the <hi>Angels</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> ſeems to be fetched out of our <hi>Eighty fifth.</hi> And our Bleſſed SAVIOUR Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a <hi>Greater than David,</hi> and his Antitype, no doubt, at the Paſſover, as often as it recurred, Sung at leaſt part of what they called, <hi>The Great Hallel,</hi> which was the <hi>Hundred and thirteenth</hi> Pſalm, with the Five that followed it. In a word, we are ſo directed, Eph. V. 19 <hi>Speak to your ſelves in Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.</hi> In this Direction, there appears an evident Reference, unto the Diſtinction of the Poems in our <hi>Hebrew Pſalter.</hi> The Poems there are diſtinguiſhed by Three Terms, exactly anſwering unto <hi>Theſe.</hi> It ſeems to be ſaid, <hi>Let your Pſalter ſupply you with the Songs, wherein the Admonitions of Piety are to be received, and preſerved, and applied among you!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT would follow from hence, that ſuch a <hi>Verſion</hi> of the PSALMS, as keeps moſt <hi>Cloſe to the Original,</hi> were moſt of all to be wiſhed for. Of about Three Times ſeven Tranſlations of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which we have ſeen fitted for the Tunes of our <hi>Sacred Songs</hi> there is not one, but what for the ſake of a needleſs <hi>Rhyme,</hi> does <hi>Leave out</hi> very much of what the Holy SPIRIT has inſerted in the <hi>Original,</hi> and <hi>put in</hi> as much of what is not <hi>there</hi> to be met withal. Of theſe Tranſlations, there are ſome <hi>Nearer</hi> to the <hi>Original</hi> than others, and have more of <hi>That</hi> in it, with leaſt of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002241_0013_0FDAD6A61E5C5AA8"/>from it, or Addition to it: And the <hi>Neareſt</hi> are certainly the moſt worthy to have our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions employed upon them. After all, of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is (the <hi>Similis Definentia</hi> of) <hi>Rhyme,</hi> to our <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> when even to <hi>Poetry</hi> it ſelf, it is not Eſſential? The <hi>Pſalms</hi> might eaſily be ſo turned into <hi>Blank Verſe,</hi> that there ſhould be ALL, and ONLY, what it has pleaſed the Holy One to give us in the <hi>Original.</hi> And no doubt there will a Time come, when Myriads of Chriſtians will chuſe to Serve GOD with ſuch a <hi>Pure Offering,</hi> and preſent unto Him what is <hi>purely His own,</hi> rather than have their Devotions in Danger of being palled, by the ſenſe of <hi>Humane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſements,</hi> upon what they Addreſs unto Him. An Honourable Counſellor in the Low-Countries, Mynheer <hi>Bruyne,</hi> publiſhed in Dutch, the PSALMS in ſuch <hi>Blank Verſe.</hi> But becauſe his Tranſlation differed, as it muſt, from what was in the <hi>Common Bible,</hi> another who was a Maſter of Muſick, fitted a variety of Tunes to the Pſalter, without changing a word in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bible.</hi> However the Tunes were ſo various, and the neceſſary Repetition of the ſame Word ſo frequent, that this did not much mend the matter. Some will think it a pity that the Deſign of the Excellent <hi>Bruyne,</hi> ſhould not proceed, as the Great <hi>Voetius</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Abſ<expan>

            <p>§ 5. IN the Proviſion which our <hi>Pſalter</hi> has made of <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> for us, we find all the Intentions of PIETY, how admirably provided for!</p>
            <p>WOULD we be well Inſtructed in the <hi>Myſteries</hi> which belong to the Kingdom of GOD, or well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Prophecies</hi> that refer to the Delay or the Coming of the Kingdom? In our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> we ſhall find our ſelves <hi>Taught of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Pardoning Mercy</hi> of our GOD is to be implored, how pathetically, how effectually may we with the cries of our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> pierce the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002241_0014_0FDAC942D63B8358"/>till our Hearts are melted with ſome Aſſurance of our Pardon?</p>
            <p>WHEN we are <hi>Panting</hi> after the Diſpoſitions of a <hi>Sanctified Soul, as the Hart after the Water-Brooks,</hi> our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> will be found, how <hi>sanctifying</hi> ones; and how likely to bring us into the very <hi>Feeling</hi> of what we are <hi>Asking</hi> for?</p>
            <p>WHEN we are <hi>Afflicted very much,</hi> be the occaſions what they will, what <hi>Conſolations of GOD,</hi> which are <hi>not ſmall,</hi> may we find in our <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> which GOD <hi>our Maker has given us for the Night,</hi> of thoſe Dark Hours, which our Afflictions may bring upon us?</p>
            <p>WOULD we know our <hi>Duty</hi> in every condition? Our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> will ſoon bring us to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it, yea, ſpur us to the <hi>Practice</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>WHAT point of our <hi>spiritual,</hi> or even our <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proſperity,</hi> is there, that in the Language of our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> we may not Petition for; and with a <hi>Faith</hi> ſo exerciſed therein, that we ſhall have the grant of our Petition?</p>
            <p>WHATEVER <hi>Temptations</hi> we are aſſaulted withal, the Harp of <hi>David</hi> being with our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> well play'd upon, the <hi>Tempter</hi> will ere long depart; <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> will burſt and break upon the <hi>Singing</hi> of ſuch <hi>Verſes</hi> as theſe.</p>
            <p>WE may have <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> of whoſe Influences to hurt us, we may have ſome Terror upon us. By our <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> we fly away to a <hi>Munition of Rocks.</hi> There was a Time, when the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD had like to have been overwhelmed with <hi>Adverſaries;</hi> but <hi>when the Singers began to Sing,</hi> the Providence of GOD with ſtrange Diſpenſations defeated them. Only, when <hi>Imprecations upon Enemies</hi> occur in our <hi>Pſalms,</hi> let us never dart any of them againſt any of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; be they never ſo malevolent, never ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous When we Sing, <hi>Upon mine Enemies my Eyes their Wiſh ſhall ſee.</hi> Let it be remembred, <hi>Their Wiſh</hi> is not
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002241_0015_0FDAD6A79A8E1498"/>in the Original. Thy <hi>Word of ſupply,</hi> O charitable Chriſtian will rather be, <hi>What comes:</hi> For thou will <hi>Wiſh</hi> for them nothing but Good. The <hi>Imprecations</hi> may indeed be hurled againſt <hi>Publick Enemies,</hi> and thoſe without whoſe Confuſion the People of GOD cannot be in ſafety. But rather, Let the <hi>Singer</hi> make his <hi>Interiour Adverſaries,</hi> the Objects of all theſe <hi>Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations.</hi> And as in the Primitive Times, the <hi>Devils</hi> in Energumens diſcovered a ſingular Horror, at the Singing of that Verſe, <hi>May GOD ariſe; His Enemies, may they be ſcattered; and ſuch as are Haters of Him, fly from before His Face:</hi> Thus, O Singer, Let <hi>Satan</hi> be the <hi>Enemy</hi> againſt whom thou wilt <hi>ſing the Songs of the Lord.</hi> And let thy <hi>Original ſin,</hi> be the <hi>Enemy</hi> in like manner ſtab'd by thoſe <hi>Javelins</hi> of the <hi>Divine Armoury,</hi> and let thy <hi>Lusts</hi> be thoſe <hi>Foes,</hi> againſt which thou wilt with thy <hi>Songs</hi> as with <hi>ſlings</hi> caſt forth what ſhall mortify them? One of the <hi>Arnobius's</hi> has very particularly informed us, how the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> did with ſuch an Application of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> carry on, <hi>The Wars of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, What ſhall be ſaid? Surely, By our <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> we may now after ſome ſort begin <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Earth.</hi> It was very juſtly ſaid by <hi>Chryſostom</hi> unto the Devout Singer,

There can be no doubt of it, but that when the Holy SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT with His Afflations, diſpoſed them to write what we have in our Hands, He produced in their <hi>Hearts</hi> thoſe <hi>Motions of Piety,</hi> which were agreeable and anſwerable to the <hi>Matter</hi> then flowing from their <hi>Pens.</hi> In what they have written, there is very Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and a very ordinary Capacity may ſee, A <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of Holy Truths, with an Heart <hi>Believing</hi> of them, <hi>Conſenting</hi> to them; A <hi>Deſire</hi> of Promiſed Bleſſings, with a <hi>Value</hi> for them; a <hi>Love</hi> to GOD, (and Man;) and a <hi>Zeal</hi> for His Kingdom; and His <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;</hi> a <hi>Faith</hi> in GOD, and our SAVIOUR, and His Promiſes; with a Joy in Him; and a Rapturous <hi>Admiration</hi> of Him; An <hi>horror of ſin,</hi> and a <hi>ſorrow</hi> for it; and a <hi>Fear</hi> of the <hi>Judgments</hi> threatned unto it; a <hi>Reſolution</hi> for the Service of GOD; and a Retreat unto Him: with a Deſpair to find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in Creatures; with other <hi>Motions of Piety,</hi> which belong to the <hi>Life of GOD</hi> in the Soul. In Singing our <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> let us be Inquiſitive after thoſe <hi>Motions of Piety,</hi> which are diſcernible in the Verſe now before us; and let us with a Soul flying away to GOD, <hi>for</hi> them, try whether we cannot fly <hi>with</hi> them; and ſtrive to come at <hi>the like;</hi> and give not over the ſtruggle, till we feel our ſelves come into an Holy <hi>Symphony</hi> with the Saints who had their <hi>Hearts burning</hi> within them, when they <hi>Sang</hi> theſe things unto the Lord. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Behold a lovely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of getting into thoſe Heavenly <hi>Frames</hi> &amp; <hi>strains</hi> which will aſſure thee of thy arriving one Day, to the ſame ſtate of Bleſſedneſs, and thoſe <hi>Everlaſting Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which theſe <hi>Favourites</hi> and <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thro' whom our <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> were convey'd unto us, have been renew'd into. Yea, Thou art already <hi>Caught up to Paradiſe</hi> in them. Nor is there a Nobler Method, among all our <hi>Hermeneutic Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to come at the <hi>True ſenſe</hi> of our <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi>

Even an <hi>Illiterate Chriſtian,</hi> that <hi>Lives unto GOD,</hi> and is no Stranger to the <hi>Sentiments of Piety,</hi> may in that way reach the <hi>True ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Lively Oracles,</hi> and (a <hi>Luther,</hi> a <hi>Gerhard,</hi> a <hi>Franckius,</hi> and all the Sons of the Orthodox and Genuine <hi>Pietiſm</hi> will tell us) he will have <hi>within him,</hi> an Expoſition far more Valuable, than any of the <hi>Commentators,</hi> (truly <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators!</hi>) who are <hi>Alienated from the Life of GOD,</hi> can help him to.</p>
            <p>WE read, Rev. XIV. 3. Of, A <hi>song which no man could Learn, but they which were Redeemed from the Earth.</hi> We have now deſcribed a <hi>Way of Singing,</hi> which <hi>none can Learn, but ſuch as GOD Redeems from the Earth.</hi> And, O <hi>Earthly-minded Man,</hi> If upon a Trial for it, thou find thy ſelf Enabled unto this <hi>Way of Singing,</hi> This will fetch thee, and raiſe thee up from the <hi>Earth</hi> in which thy Soul has been buried; It will be a <hi>Token for Good</hi> upon thee, <hi>GOD has Redeemed thee from the Earth;</hi> and the <hi>Heaven</hi> which thou art Anticipating ſhall be thy Portion.</p>
            <p>§. 7. AS in the <hi>Reading</hi> of the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> in general, ſo particularly for the <hi>Singing</hi> of our <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> (by all of which we are to be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed</hi>) the <hi>Poriſmatic</hi> way is a very Notable One, to pay our Homage unto our GOD. That is, To fetch LESSONS out of every <hi>Verſe,</hi> and then turn them into PRAYERS; to form a <hi>Note</hi> and a <hi>Wiſh</hi> upon every <hi>Clauſe</hi> before us: For which the <hi>Time of Dilatation</hi> which we take in our <hi>Singing</hi> affords uſually a ſufficient Opportunity. While we do by the Action of <hi>Singing,</hi> put our Minds into
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002241_0020_0FDAD6C521A69408"/>a due Poſture for it. We ſhould firſt <hi>Hear</hi> what the Glorious GOD <hi>ſpeaks</hi> unto us, and then with fit <hi>Echo's of Devotion</hi> give our <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Anſwer</hi> unto it; and perform what the Pſalmiſt ſo Exemplified: <hi>seek ye my Face;</hi> On hearing this, <hi>My Heart did ſpeak to thee; Thy Face, O thou Eternal GOD,</hi> Thy Face now <hi>will I will ſeek.</hi> An <hi>Alternation,</hi> preferrible to thoſe <hi>Antiphona's,</hi> which are now generally dropt in the moſt Reformed Churches. To do This, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a Skilful and Intenſe <hi>Thinking,</hi> 'tis true; It is requiſite that our Faculties be rouſed for it, with an, <hi>O my</hi> awakned <hi>Soul, Do thou Bleſs the Eternal GOD; and all my Inward Powers the Name of His pure Holineſs.</hi> But what we are now doing <hi>before the Ark,</hi> ought always to be done <hi>with all our might.</hi> And ſuch is the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> as well as the <hi>profit,</hi> of Converſing with the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD, in this way of Proceeding, that thoſe who are uſed unto it, will give Thanks to a Gracious GOD for Inſtructing them in this way of coming at all <hi>Precious and Pleaſant Riches,</hi> more than if all the <hi>Vain Riches</hi> of this World had been thrown in upon them; They <hi>Rejoice</hi> in this <hi>Way</hi> of Living on the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of GOD, <hi>as much as in all Riches.</hi> And the treating of our <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> in ſuch a manner, does not only Satisfy the Good Men, who might elſe complain of the <hi>Jewiſh Dreſs,</hi> which appears upon many of them, and propoſe to ſee <hi>David</hi> ſtript of his <hi>Harp,</hi> and all his Muſical Inſtruments; a <hi>Pſalter</hi> without any Air of the Old Teſtament in it: — Syrs, The <hi>Things</hi> and the <hi>Terms</hi> Originally pertaining to the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will do <hi>us</hi> no Damage; There is a Sweet <hi>Goſpel</hi> in them, if we give Attention to it; Yea, we loſe too much of the Beauty to be diſcovered in our <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> if we lay them wholly aſide! — Is there not a <hi>Zion</hi> of the Goſpel, which you are well-acquainted withal? May not the <hi>Ark</hi> of GOD lead you to His CHRIST? The <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, and the Courts thereof lead you into His <hi>Church;</hi> and into its <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002241_0021_0FDAD6AF2C1DCED8"/>here below, and into the <hi>Heavenly World</hi> above? The <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> lead you to a ſacrificed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, and unto the Devotions and Benignities, which are the <hi>ſpiritual Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> acceptable to GOD, only thro' that <hi>Great Propitiation!</hi> The <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Instruments</hi> be anſwered in an <hi>Heart</hi> that is to be a well-tuned <hi>Harp,</hi> and in the <hi>Opportunities</hi> and <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> to Glorify GOD, with which He has furniſhed you! But it alſo removes a weak Objection, which the <hi>Non-Singers</hi> make againſt our uttering the Language of thoſe who had the Holy SPIRIT of GOD filling of them. It has been weakly cavilled by ſome Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that it would be <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> or <hi>Falſehood,</hi> in many Perſons, to ſpeak the Words of <hi>David</hi> after him. The <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Pſalmody</hi> is not conſidered by theſe Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. It may be, O Man, thou canſt not ſay, <hi>I have ſet the Eternal GOD before me evermore.</hi> But upon <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of this, thou mayſt make that <hi>Obſervation, That it is a great mark of and help to a godly Man, to have the Great GOD always in his View.</hi> And thou canſt ſend up this <hi>Ejaculation</hi> to Heaven upon it; <hi>My GOD, Let me hive my Eye upon thee contimually.</hi> Thou canſt not ſay, <hi>O thou Eternal GOD, my heart it is not haughty grown.</hi> But upon <hi>Singing</hi> of this, thou mayſt make that <hi>Obſervation, An humble Heart will be the Companion and the Diſcovery of a Godly Mind.</hi> And thou canſt ſend up this <hi>Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to Heaven upon it; <hi>My GOD, cloath me with Humility.</hi> The CXIX Pſalm will have in it <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Attainments</hi> which thou canſt not pretend unto: But it will <hi>Inform</hi> thee of what thou ſhouldeſt <hi>Aſpire</hi> unto, and ſhould be Sung with <hi>Aſpirations.</hi> Thus, <hi>Dicas attente, Dic totum Supplice mente.</hi>

            <p>§ 8. <hi>SEARCH the Scriptures, for they teſtify of me,</hi> ſaith our SAVIOUR. When we are <hi>Digging</hi> in theſe deep &amp; vaſt <hi>Mines</hi> of Truth, it won't be long before the <hi>Pearl of great Price</hi> will occur unto us. To <hi>Sing</hi> PSALMS is a Duty not only <hi>Commended</hi> but alſo <hi>Commanded</hi> unto
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002241_0022_0FDAD6C650A100F8"/>us, in the Example which our SAVIOUR has given us of it, ſaying, <hi>Do as I have done.</hi> 'Tis what we find our Bleſſed JESUS us'd unto; and one <hi>Time</hi> above the reſt, we Read, Mat. 26. 30. <hi>He Sung an Hymn.</hi> And Oh! what a <hi>Time</hi> was it? It was the <hi>Night</hi> before His <hi>Crucifixion!</hi> It was at the <hi>Time</hi> when He was juſt going to Encounter Things tremendous, beyond all Imagination: Sufferings and Anguiſhes that were to make Expiation for the <hi>Iniquities of us all,</hi> which GOD laid upon Him. At <hi>ſuch a Time!</hi> one would have thought, that <hi>Now,</hi> if ever, <hi>Singing</hi> had been unſeaſonable, unpracticable. Yet Now, we hear Him <hi>Singing</hi> to His Father. When we are <hi>Tuning our Hearts</hi> for a <hi>Song</hi> of GOD, how much may it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us to think, <hi>I am going to Imitate my Admirable SAVIOUR!</hi> But, O thou <hi>Follower of the Good One,</hi> what a further Animation of thy <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> may it be to think, That in Him who is thy <hi>Pattern</hi> for them, thou haſt alſo the <hi>Matter</hi> of them! 'Tis of thy SAVIOUR; they are on that Score, <hi>The Songs of the Lamb,</hi> that thou art now to <hi>Sing</hi> unto Him.

            <q>
               <p>THERE is a wonderful Thing to be obſerved concerning our PSALMS, which has hitherto been too much over look'd, by all the <hi>Uninſpired Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> But it is a Thing, which our SAVIOUR, and His Apoſtles, who have quoted the PSALMS near Fifty times, have led us into the Apprehenſion of. This is, That they are full of <hi>Prophecies;</hi> and our <hi>Pſalter</hi> is indeed the moſt <hi>Prophetical Book</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>IT is more particularly, but not without holy <hi>Aſtoniſhments!</hi> — to be obſerved, That the Deſign of the <hi>Prophetic Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> all along, has been to deſcribe the Sufferings of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> and of the <hi>Christian Surrogate,</hi> under the Tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and foretel the Characters and Confuſions of that <hi>Wicked one,</hi> and of his Followers; and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Recovery of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> from their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002241_0025_0FDAD6B224841560"/>long Diſperſions; and a long Felicity for them, and the <hi>Converted Gentiles</hi> aſſociated with them, under the ſucceeding Reign of the MESSIAH; and the Happy State of the <hi>New Earth,</hi> in which, under the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>New Heaven,</hi> there ſhall <hi>Dwell Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Tabernacle of GOD, ſhall be with Men,</hi> and <hi>He ſhall dwell with them, and they ſhall be His People, and GOD Himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their GOD.</hi>

               <p>IT may be the Word which we render, <hi>To the Chief Muſician,</hi> but which may be rendred (and was of old ſo,) <hi>For the End,</hi> may be to intimate, that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are calculated eminently with an Eye to the Things that are to be done, at that which the Bible calls, <hi>The time of the End.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Jerom</hi> long ago found <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms:</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirmed, That the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ought all to be underſtood of CHRIST and His Church, and many of them refer to <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ages.</hi> But we now Improve in our Diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY, The <hi>Devout Singer</hi> like the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple,</hi> ſhall <hi>be carried away in the Spirit into the Wilderneſs,</hi> and be ſhown the <hi>Judgment of the Great Whore, that ſitteth upon many Waters.</hi> He ſhall alſo in theſe Viſions of GOD, <hi>See the Holy City, New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, coming down from GOD out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride for her Husband.</hi> Very depraved muſt be that Soul, that has not, a Reliſh for ſuch Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, more than for any Earthly Entertainments; and that will not heartily ſay, <hi>They're more deſireable than Gold, yea, than much ſolid Gold; than Honey alſo ſweeter much, or dropping Honey-Comb.</hi>

The Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids of the Lord, forget <hi>Miriam,</hi> and <hi>All the Women that went out after her,</hi> if they decline their part in <hi>Singing</hi> the Praiſes of GOD; ſince diverſe of our <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> were compoſed by Perſons of the <hi>Female Sex,</hi> 'tis but Reaſonable that the <hi>Female Sex</hi> bear their part in <hi>Singing</hi> of theſe, and all the reſt. A <hi>Gorgenia</hi> the Renowned Siſter of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> is commemorated for it. And as no <hi>Perſons</hi> are to be exempted, ſo no <hi>Places</hi> are to be excluded from the <hi>Reaſonable Service;</hi> but we are to <hi>Sing every where, Lifting up an Holy Voice,</hi> unto the Lord. Not only ſhould we <hi>with all our Heart Praiſe the Eternal GOD, where the Upright meet Privately, and where more Publickly;</hi> But alſo the <hi>Chriſtian Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder</hi> ſhould make this one of his <hi>Family-Sacrifices.</hi> Yea, how comfortably may the <hi>Family</hi> go to Reſt, when the laſt Verſe of the <hi>Fourth Pſalm</hi> has concluded all? This truly is one of the Excellent Methods, wherein the <hi>Word of CHRIST</hi> is to <hi>Dwell Richly</hi> with us, and be a conſtant and welcome Lodger in our <hi>Dwellings.</hi> Yea, <hi>Theodoret</hi> reports, That the Faithful in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, had the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by heart, ſo that they would Recreate themſelves with <hi>Singing</hi> them in the <hi>Streets</hi> and in the <hi>Fields,</hi> as well as in their <hi>Dwellings.</hi> A <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> turn a <hi>Dungeon</hi> into a <hi>Palace,</hi> by <hi>Singing</hi> there. One ſays, <hi>The Earth Danced unto their Muſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is Remarkable, That when the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of GOD has been making any <hi>New Appearance,</hi> a mighty Zeal for the <hi>Singing</hi> of PSALMS, has attended it, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted it. And may we ſee our People grow more <hi>Zealous</hi> of this <hi>Good Work,</hi> what an hopeful <hi>Sign of the Times</hi> would be ſeen in it, That <hi>the Time of Singing is

            </p>
            <p>BUT in the purſuance of this Holy Intention, it would be very deſirable, that people, (and eſpecially our YOUNG PEOPLE, who are moſt in the Years of Diſcipline,) would more generally <hi>Learn to SING</hi> and become able to Sing by RULE, and keep to the NOTES of the TUNES, which our <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> are ſet unto; which would be to <hi>Sing,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> expreſſes it, <gap reason="foreign">

In later Days, <hi>Caſſander</hi> upbraided it, <hi>Ad feritatem quandum barbaricum compoſito ſono, Boant, Latrant, mugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, frendunt, rudunt, et quidvis potius quam canunt. — Tarttaricos quosdam clamores Exprimunt.</hi> In plain Engliſh, They <hi>made ſad and wild Work on't.</hi> It has been found accordingly in ſome of our Congregations, that in length of Time, their <hi>Singing</hi> has degenerated, into an <hi>Odd Noiſe,</hi> that has had more of what we want a Name for, than any <hi>Regular Singing</hi> in it; whereby the <hi>Celestial Exerciſe</hi> is diſhonoured; and indeed the <hi>Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> is treſpaſs'd on. To take notice of the <hi>Ridiculous Pleas,</hi> wherewith ſome very weak People, go to confirm this Degeneracy, would indeed be to pay too much Reſpect unto them. And they muſt have ſtrange Notions of the Divine SPIRIT, and of His Operations, who ſhall imagine, that the Delight which their <hi>Untuned Ears</hi> take in an <hi>Uncouth Noiſe,</hi> more than in a <hi>Regular Singing,</hi> is any <hi>Communion</hi> with Him. The Skill of <hi>Regular Singing,</hi> is among the <hi>Gifts</hi> of GOD unto the Children of Men, and by no means unthankfully to be Neglected or Deſpiſed. For the Congregations, wherein 'tis wanting, to recover a <hi>Regular Singing,</hi> would be really a <hi>Reformation,</hi> and a Recovery out of an <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and what we may judge that Heaven would be pleaſed withal. We ought

Our <hi>Pſalms</hi> too are uſed there. But the <hi>Tunes</hi> uſed in the <hi>French Pſalmody,</hi> and from Them in the <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo, were ſet by a famous Martyr of JESUS CHRIST; And when <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins</hi> illuminated <hi>England,</hi> with their Verſion of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Tunes</hi> have been ſet by ſuch as a Good Proteſtant may be willing to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion withal. The <hi>Tunes</hi> commonly uſed in our Churches, are <hi>Few;</hi> T'were well if there were <hi>more.</hi> But they are alſo <hi>Grave,</hi> and ſuch as well <hi>become the Oracles of GOD,</hi> and ſuch as do Steer clear of the Two Shelves, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> was afraid of; when he did, <hi>In cantu Sacro ſtrictuare, inter Periculum Voluptatis, et Experimentum Salubritatis;</hi> in danger of too much <hi>Delicacy</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Aſperity</hi> on the other.</p>

IT is to be deſired, that we may ſee in the Riſing Generation, a freſh and Strong Diſpoſition to <hi>Learn</hi> the proper <hi>Tunes;</hi> that GOD may be Glorified, and Religion beautified, with a <hi>Regular Singing</hi> among us; And that, <hi>To them that are His Servants, He may let His work be ſeen; His Glory alſo unto thoſe that are their Children</hi> here: <hi>And that the Lovely Brightneſs of the Lord who is our GOD,</hi> may with Conſpicuous Luſtre be ſeen ſhining <hi>upon us.</hi>
