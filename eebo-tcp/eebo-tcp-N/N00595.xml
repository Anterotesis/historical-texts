            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>S.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Iohn Wilson,</hi> descending from Eminent Ancestors, was Born at <hi>Winsor</hi> in the <hi>Wonderful Year</hi> 1588. The Third Son of Dr. <hi>William Wilson,</hi> a Prebend of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> of <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ester</hi> and of <hi>Winsor,</hi> and Rector of <hi>Cliff</hi>: having for his Mother, a Neece of Dr. <hi>Edmund Grindal,</hi> the most Worthily Renowned Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> His exact Education under his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which betimes <hi>Tinged</hi> him with an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to Vice, and above all, to the very shadow of a <hi>Lye,</hi> fitted him to Undergoe the further Education, which he received in <hi>Eaton-Colledge,</hi> under <hi>Udal</hi> (and <hi>Langely</hi>) whom now we may Venture, after Poor <hi>Tom Tusser,</hi> to call, <hi>The Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Men.</hi> Here he was most Remarkably Twice Delivered from Drowning; but at his Book, he made such Proficiency, that while he was the <hi>Least Boy</hi> in the School, he was made a <hi>Propositor</hi>; and when the Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from the French King Henry IV, to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Visited the School, he made a Latin Oration, for which the Duke bestowed Three <hi>Angels</hi> upon him.

in the year 1602. When he came to stand for a <hi>Fellowship</hi> in that <hi>Colledge,</hi> his Antipathy to some Horrid Wickednesses, whereto a Detestable Wretch that had been Acquainted with him, would have betray'd him, caused that Malicious Wretch by Devised and Accursed <hi>Slanders</hi> to ruin so far the Reputation of this Chast Youth with the other <hi>Fellows,</hi> that had not the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Nevertheless, being forestalled with Prejudices against the <hi>Puritans</hi> of those Times, as if they had held, he knew not well what <hi>Odd Things,</hi> he

Declined <hi>Their</hi> Acquaintance; although his Good Conversarion had made him to be accounted <hi>One</hi> of them, <hi>Himself.</hi> Until going unto a <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers</hi> Shop to Augment his Well-furnisht <hi>Library,</hi> he Lit upon that Famous Book of Mr. <hi>Richard Rogers,</hi> called, <hi>The Seven Treatises</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, when he had Read, he so Affected, not only the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but also the <hi>Author</hi> of the Book, that he took a Journey unto <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> on purpose to hear a Sermon, from that <hi>Boanerges.</hi> When he had heard the Heavenly Passages that fell from the Lips of that Worthy Man, <hi>Privately,</hi> as well as <hi>Publickly,</hi> and compared therewithal the Writings of <hi>Greenham,</hi> of <hi>Dod,</hi> and of <hi>Dent,</hi> especially <hi>The Path way to Heaven,</hi> Written by the Author last mentioned, he saw that <hi>They</hi> who were Nicknamed, <hi>Puritans,</hi> were like to be the <hi>Desirablest Companions,</hi> for One that intended his own Everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; and pursuant unto the Advice, which he had from Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> he associated himself with a Pious Company in the University, who kept their Meetings in Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> Chamber, for <hi>Prayer, Fasting,</hi> Holy <hi>Conference,</hi> and the Exercises of true Devotion.</p>

His Father, being hereof Advised, with all Paternal Affection, Wrote unto him to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>; and at the same Time, interceded with the Bishop, that he might have a Quarter of a year allowed him; in which time, if he could not be Reduced, he should then leave his <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in the Colledge. Hereupon he sent him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several <hi>Doctors</hi> of Great Fame, to get his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections Resolved; but when much <hi>Discourse,</hi> and much <hi>Writing,</hi> had passed between them, he was rather the more confirmed in his Principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Church Reformation.</hi> Wherefore his Father, then diverting him from the Designs of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> disposed him to <hi>the Inns of Court</hi>; where he fell into Acquaintance with some Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who associated with him in constant Exercises of Devotion; to which Meetings the Repeated Sermons of Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> were a continual Entertainment: and here it was, that he came into the Advantageous Knowledge of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Diligence Visited the Congregations of the Neighbouring Towns, at their <hi>Weekly Lectures,</hi> until the Weaknesses of <hi>Old Age</hi> rendered him Uncapable. And it was a delightful Thing, then to see upon every Recurring Opportunity a large Company of Christians, and even <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> among them, and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> in the Head of them, Visiting the <hi>Lectures</hi> in all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinage, with such Heavenly Discourses on the Road, as caused the Hearts of the Disciples, to <hi>Burn within them</hi>: and indeed it was Remark'd, That though the Christians <hi>Then</hi> Spent Less Time, in the <hi>Shop,</hi> or <hi>Field,</hi> than they do <hi>Now,</hi> yet they did in <hi>Both</hi> prosper more. But for Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> I am saying, That a <hi>Lecture</hi> was a <hi>Treasure</hi> unto him; he Priz'd it, he Sought it, until <hi>Old Age</hi> at Length brought with it <hi>a Sickness,</hi> which a Long while confined him. In this Illness, he took a Solemn Farewel of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> who had their Weekly Meetings, at his <hi>Hospitable House,</hi> and were now come together from all parts, at the Anniversary <hi>Election</hi> for the Government of the Colony. They asked him, to declare Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what he thought might be the <hi>Sins,</hi> which provoked the Displeasure of God against the Country. Whereto his Answer was, <hi>I have long feared several Sins</hi>; Whereof, One, he said, was <hi>Corahism</hi>; <q>That is, when People rise up as <hi>Corah</hi> against their <hi>Ministers,</hi> as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they do but

And for our Neglect of <hi>Baptising</hi> the Children of the <hi>Church,</hi> those that some call <hi>Grand-children,</hi> I think God is provoked by it.

The Evening before he Dyed, his Daughter asking him, Sir, <hi>How do you Do</hi>? he held up his Hand, and said, <hi>Vanishing Things!

hereby so diverted and mollified, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Young Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> to Dinner with him; and, though he had passed hitherto <hi>Unknown</hi> by his True Name, yet this Inquisitor could now call him, to his great Surpize, by the Name, of Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> and report unto him the Character of his <hi>Father,</hi> and his <hi>Fathers</hi> Industry in Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hereticks of <hi>New-England.</hi> But, that which I here most of all design, is an Account of a thing yet more Memorable and Unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For, at another Time, his Father Dream't himself Transported into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he saw a Beautiful Person in the Sons Chamber, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, with a thousand <hi>Enchantments</hi> to debauch him; whereupon the <hi>Old</hi> Gentleman made, and was by his Bed-fellow overheard making, first, <hi>Prayers</hi> to God full of Agony, and then <hi>Warnings</hi> unto his Tempted Son, to Beware of Defiling himself with the <hi>Daughter of a Strange God.</hi> Now, some Considerable while after this, the <hi>Young</hi> Gentleman Writes to his Father, that on such a Night, (which was upon Enquiry found the very <hi>same Night,</hi>) a Gentlewoman had caressed him, thus and so (just according to the <hi>Vision,</hi>) and that his <hi>Chastity</hi> had been Conquered, if he had not been Strongly Possessed with a Sense of his Fathers <hi>Prayers</hi> over him, and <hi>Warnings</hi> unto him, for his Escape from the Pits, whereinto do fall the <hi>Abhorred of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His other Son, <hi>John,</hi> When a Child, fell upon
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000725_0037_0FAA45186C8A7B28"/>
his Head from a Loft, Four Stories high, into the Street; from whence he was taken up for Dead, and so battered and bruised and bloody with his Fall, that it struck Horror into the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: but Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> had a Wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Prayers, in the Recovery of the Child, both unto <hi>Life,</hi> and unto <hi>Sense</hi>; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he continued unto <hi>Old Age,</hi> a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Painful, Useful Minister of the Gospel; and but lately went from the Service of the Church in <hi>Medfield,</hi> unto the Glory of the Church <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> arrival at <hi>New-England,</hi> his Wife, who had Left off bearing of Children for many years, brought him another <hi>Daughter</hi>; which <hi>Lamb,</hi> was indeed unto him, <hi>as a Daughter</hi>; and he would present her unto other Ministers, for their Blessing, with Great Affection, Saying, <hi>This is my</hi> New-England <hi>Token</hi>! But this Child, fell Sick of a <hi>Malignant Feaver,</hi> wherein She was gone so far, that every one despaired of her Life; Except her Father, who called in several Ministers, with other Christians, unto a <hi>Fast,</hi> on that Occasion; and hearing the Prayers of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> for he, found his Heart so Raised, that he Confidently declared, <hi>While I heard,</hi> Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>at Prayer, I was Confident the Child should Live!</hi> And the Child accordingly <hi>did</hi> Live; yea, She is to this Day alive, a very <hi>Holy Woman, Adorned, like them of Old Time, with a Spirit of Great Price!</hi>

There is a certain Little <hi>Sport of Wit,</hi> in <hi>Anagrammatizing</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of Men; which was used as long ago at Least as the Dayes of Old <hi>Lycophron</hi>: and which sometimes has afforded Reflections very <hi>Monitory,</hi> as <hi>Alstedius</hi> by his just Admirers changed into <hi>Sedulitas,</hi> or very <hi>Satyrical,</hi> as when, <hi>Satan Ruleth me,</hi> was found in the Transposed Name of a certain Active Persecutor: and when, <hi>Lo, a Damned Crew,</hi> was found in the Name of One that made a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, among the Popish Plotters against the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <hi>S.</hi> 21. But it, is to the <hi>Last Place</hi> in our History of <hi>this</hi> Worthy Man, that I reserve that part of his Character, which lay in his Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to allot unto <hi>Himself</hi> the <hi>Last Place</hi> among <hi>all</hi> Worthy Men; for his <hi>Low</hi> Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, was the <hi>Top</hi> of all his other Excellencies. His <hi>Humility</hi> not only caused him, to prefer the Meanest of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> above himself, but also to Comply with the meanest Opportunities of being Serviceable: Hence t'was, that when his Voice in his Age did so fail him, that his Great Congregation could be no longer Edified by his <hi>Publick Labours,</hi> he Cheerfully and Painfully set himself to do all the Good, that he could by his <hi>Private Visits</hi>; and such also, as he could not reach with <hi>Sermons,</hi> he often <hi>found</hi> with <hi>Verses</hi>: Hence t'was, that when that plea was used with the Church of <hi>Ipswich</hi> to resign Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> unto the Church of <hi>Boston,</hi> after the Death of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>; Because it was said, <hi>Let him that hath two Coats give to him that hath None</hi>; and a Person of Quality replied, <hi>Boston hath One,</hi> [mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi>:] this Good man answered; <hi>Who? Me! I am Nothing!</hi> Yea, Hence t'was, that when Malefactors had been openly Scourged upon the Just <hi>Sentence</hi> of Authority, he would presently send for them to his House, and having first expressed his Bounty to them, he would then bestow upon them such gracious Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000725_0043_0FAA46F46AB0E8C8"/>
and Exhortations, as made them to become, instead of <hi>Desperate,</hi> remarkably <hi>Penitent.</hi> Indeed, I know not whether his <hi>Humility,</hi> might not have some <hi>Excess,</hi> in some Instances charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; at least Once, when he had Promised unto a Neighbouring Minister, to Preach a Sermon for him, and after his Promise came in Season to that Minister, saying, <hi>Sir, I told you, that I would Preach for you, but it was rashly done of me; I have on my knees begg'd the Pardon of it, from the Lord; That I should offer thus to deprive His People, of your Labours, which are so much better than any of mine can be: Wherefore, Sir, I now come Seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to tell you, that I shall fail you!</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, there was no perswading of him to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But from the like <hi>Humility</hi> it was, That a Good kinsman, of his, who deserves to Live in the same <hi>Story,</hi> as he now Lives in the same <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> with him, namely Mr. <hi>Edward Rawson,</hi> the Honoured Secretary of the <hi>Massachuset</hi>-Colony, could not by all his Intreaties perswade him, to let his <hi>Picture</hi> be drawn; but still refusing it, he would reply, <hi>What! Such a Poor, Vile Creature as I am! shall my Picture be drawn? I say, No; it never shall!</hi> And when that Gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the Limner, with all things ready, Vehemently importuning him to gratify so far the Desires of his Friends, as to sit a while, for the taking of his <hi>Effigies,</hi> no Importunity
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000725_0044_0FAA46F52F3B9D20"/>
could ever obtain it from him. However, being bound in <hi>Justice</hi> to Employ <hi>my Hand,</hi> for the Memory of that Person, by <hi>whose Hand</hi> I was my self Baptised, I have made an Essay, to draw his <hi>Picture,</hi> by this Account of his <hi>Life</hi>; wherein if I have missed of doing to the <hi>Life,</hi> it might be made up, with several Expressive Passages, which I find in <hi>Elegies</hi> Written and Printed upon his <hi>Death</hi>: Whereof there were many Composed, by those, whose Opinion was well Signified by one of them: <q>
                  <l>Sure <hi>Verseless</hi> he does Mean, to's Grave to Go,</l>
                  <l>And well deserves, that now no <hi>Verse can show.</hi>
