            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Distemper began much later in most of the Towns than in the rest.</p>
            <p>Since I receiv'd the Account from some of the Towns, the Distemper has come into sundry more Families, and prov'd mortal to some of their Children.</p>
            <p>I shall here take Occasion to give some Hint referring to this awful Providence, which ever judicious Person may easily enlarge upon in hi<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> own Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004014_0008_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>The Grave is a Land of Darkness without any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which has of late been remarkably seen, in respect of the Age of those that have been brought to it, when so many Younger ones have <hi>gone to their long Home</hi> before the Elder: Yet <hi>every one</hi> may be said to die <hi>in his own Order,</hi> in respect of God's appointment, who has determin'd the Time of every ones Death, and without whose Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>not a Sparrow falls to the Ground;</hi> which is a good Reason why we should be silent and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive under such heavy Trials.</p>
            <p>The Death of many Children before they were arriv'd to Years of Discretion, shews the woful Effects of Original Sin, and gives us all just Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make the same humble Reflection on our selves that <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Behold, I was shapen in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me:</hi> On which Account we might justly have been cut off in the Beginning of our Days, but God has spar'd us in the greatness of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>In consideration of the above mentioned Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which has been chiefly among Children, young ones should be awaken'd to seek after God betimes, when they see those that were as young, or younger than themselves, taken out of the Land of the Living. 'Tis storied of a Child that was noted to be serious and religiously dispos'd, and one asking the Reason hereof, the Child said, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I must die; but being told you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live many a Year longer, the Child reply'd, I was lately at a Funeral, where I saw a Grave shorter than my self. Many such sad Spectacles have been to be seen to late. O! that our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004014_0009_0000000000000000"/>
that are arriv'd to any Years of Discretion were so <hi>wise</hi> as to <hi>consider their latter End,</hi> when they have had so frequent Warnings of it. Let Children <hi>remember their Creator</hi> and Redeemer in their early Days, lest these should be all the Days they shall ever have to remember them in. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dear Children have been laid in their Graves, where <hi>there is no remembrance</hi> of God; those that survive are very inexcusable if they do not lay it to Heart, so as seriously to think of their own dying, and instantly to prepare for it. Let Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren consider that they are Sinners, or else they would not be liable to the Stroke of Death, and they have no more assurance of living long, than those Children had, that are now <hi>gone down into Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> and let them think sadly what a doleful Condition they will be in, if they should <hi>die in their Sins;</hi> and let them speedily seek an Interest in Jesus Christ, who alone can <hi>save them from their Sins,</hi> and who has said for their Encouragement, <hi>Those that seek me early shall find me.</hi> Let every Child set himself to learn and understand his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, and learn to be <hi>good</hi> betimes. A Pious Child is the Delight of God and Angels. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child learn to pray, and daily go alone and beg of God, that for his Mercy's sake and for Christ's sake, He would forgive his original Sin and all his actual Sins, and that He would <hi>give him a new Heart and put a new Spirit within him,</hi> and cause him to love Him above all, and to take heed of offending Him any more by sinful Thoughts, by wicked Words or vicious Deeds. And O! that all our Children would <hi>remember the Sabbath-Day
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004014_0010_0000000000000000"/>
to keep it holy,</hi> not spending it in Play or Idleness, but in diligent reading of the holy Bible and other good Books, and in a diligent attendance on the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, Private and Publick. Such Children may hope that God will own them for his Children, that He will take them under his Protection, and that they shall live, so long as an All wise God sees Life would be good for them in this World, and if they should be cut off in their younger Days (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others have been) God will <hi>satisfy them with long Life, even with Length of Days for ever and ever</hi> in a better World.</p>
            <p>It has been observ'd concerning several Children, that their Spirits have been strangely supported in the Agonies of Death; they have shew'd a becoming submission to the Divine Will, and expressed good Hopes of being received to a better World; and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd such things as yielded great Consolation to their sorrowful Parents. <hi>Out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings</hi> God can <hi>perfect Praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Mortality that has been among Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, should make Parents very sensible, that their Children are <hi>uncertain</hi> Comforts, and should quicken them to a faithful Discharge of their Duty towards their Children, by sincerely dedicating them to God, and by training them up in the Knowledge and Fear of God. This will be the way for them to have Comfort in their Children, whether Living or Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Elder ones should adore the Power and Patience of God in prolonging their frail and forfeited Lives; and when they see so many younger and more Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent than themselves, taken away in such an awful manner, they have reason to <hi>make haste and not delay to keep God's Commandments,</hi> lest He should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to inflict the like awful Judgment upon them: And some of sundry Ages having been taken away
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004014_0011_0000000000000000"/>
by this woful Distemper, it should serve for the awakening of all; for what has befallen others may also befal any of us.</p>
            <p>How awakening especially should the Death of Children be to their Parents? When the first-born of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were smitten, they said, <hi>We be all dead Men.</hi> Parents are strangely stupid, if the Death of their Children does not put them in mind of their own Mortality. And it should cause them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein they may have offended God; as the Woman said to the Man of God, <hi>Art thou come to call my Sin to remembrance, and to stay my Son?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are not to look upon the immediate suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this Calamity as greater Sinners than others: Our Saviour checks this censorious Humour, <hi>Suppose ye that these Galileans were Sinners above all the Gali-leans, because they suffer'd such Things? I tell you, nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it must be granted, that the Good are often involv'd with the Bad in Publick Calamities; but God can and will make <hi>all things work together for good</hi> to those particular Persons that <hi>love</hi> his Name.</p>
            <p>We read of a hopeful Child in the House of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam,</hi> that died when he was young, whereby he was taken away from the Evil to come: When hopeful Children are taken away, we know not what Evil may be coming; it concerns us speedily to <hi>acquaint our selves with God and make our Peace with Him, and then Good shall come unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many have been bereav'd of their only Child, and others who have had more Children have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd of them all; but there is enough in God to make up all our Losses in the Creature: And those that seek Him in good earnest shall find Him <hi>better</hi> to them, <hi>than ten Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sundry have been raised up from a very low estate; for <hi>the Lord killeth and maketh alive, He bringeth
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004014_0012_0000000000000000"/>
down to the Grave and bringeth up,</hi> which may be understood either of the Distinction He makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween some and others; He <hi>killeth</hi> some, and <hi>maketh</hi> or keepeth others alive, that were attended with the same threatning Symptoms, which must be resolv'd into the Sovereign Pleasure of God; <hi>even so Father, because it seemed good in thine Eyes;</hi> or it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Change He makes in the same Person, whom He brings down to the Brink of the Grave, and raises up when He pleases. Our Eyes have beheld many such Instances of the Wonder-working Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
            <p>And the Distemper that has prov'd mortal to so many, and very grievous to others, has hither to been escap'd by many, or they have had it in a moderate Degree. Such distinguishing Favours calls for great Thankfulness.</p>
            <p>Let those Families whom God has mercifully spar'd, so as not to make any Breach upon them, <hi>not be high-minded, but fear:</hi> The discriminating Goodness of God towards them should <hi>lead them to Repentance,</hi> and they are deeply oblig'd, <hi>If Iniquity be in their Hands, to put it far away, and not to suffer Wickedness to dwell in their Tabernacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those Parents that have been bereav'd of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of their Children, and have had others spar'd to them, when they consider how many have lost a greater Number, and that several have been bereav'd of all their Children, they have great Reason to be silent both in Heart and Tongue, under the Loss that they have sustained, and to bless the Name of God, that He has not dealt so severely by them, as He has by some others, acknowledging that <hi>it is of the Lord's</hi> free and undeserved <hi>Mercies</hi> that they and their's <hi>have not been consumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it becomes us all <hi>as the Elect of God to put on Bowels of Mercies</hi> towards those sorrowful Parents,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004014_0013_0000000000000000"/>
that have lost sundry of their Children, and especially those that have been bereav'd of all, and we ought to present our fervent Requests before the Throne of Grace in their behalf, that as their <hi>Sorrows abound, so the Divine Consolations may abound</hi> towards them; and tho' they are ready to think as good <hi>Jacob</hi> once did, that <hi>these things are against</hi> them, we should pray that they may be really <hi>for</hi> them, in the Issue, that they may work for their spiritual and everlasting Good.</p>
            <p>Tho' Days of Fasting and Prayer have been observ'd in the Beginning of this fatal Calamity, 'tis to be fear'd they were not attended with a suitable Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and therefore God has <hi>answer'd us by terrible things in Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have for some Years been free from the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of War, but God has many <hi>Arrows</hi> of Judgment in his Quiver, and He can send such Epidemical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases among us, as shall be more distressing to the Country in general, than any Wars that we have ever experienced.</p>
            <p>We were some Years ago visited with a terrible <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which was a loud Call to Repentance, but the good impressions made by that awful Providence were soon worn off in most Places; 'tis no wonder then that God proceeds to real inflictions of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when we have forgotten the awful Warning. He has given us thereof.</p>
            <p>The Progress of the late Distemper has been very strange in its passing from one Town to another, after a considerable space of Time, and in its long remaining in one part of a Town, before it has pass'd into other parts, and in its returning where it seem'd to be quite gone and the Fears of it were blown over; on these Accounts the Act of Providence is the more visible in sending it, and we are led to look beyond natural Causes to the Hand of God, to whom we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004014_0014_0000000000000000"/>
are chiefly concern'd to apply our selves, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of this awful Calamity.</p>
            <p>We know not what the Designs of Providence may be, but by what we hear of the spreading of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in other parts of the Country, it seems as if the Lord <hi>were risen up out of his holy Habitation</hi> and coming forth in this awful manner against the whole Continent. It therefore concerns all Places and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to <hi>prepare to meet the Lord</hi> in the way of his Judgments, by unfeigned Repentance and humble Supplication, that He may <hi>turn from the fierceness of his Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Loss of so many Children, whom if it had pleas'd God that they had liv'd, might have built up many Families, will be a great Prevention of the Growth and Increase of the Country; and ought therefore to be lookt upon as a Frown of Providence upon the Land in general, as well as a sore Affliction to the Parents in particular.</p>
            <p>We should seriously enquire <hi>wherefore</hi> the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has thus <hi>contended</hi> with us? We have Reason to look upon the <hi>strange</hi> unusual Distemper that has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd among us, as the Fruit of <hi>strange</hi> Sins. Have not many <hi>strangely</hi> neglected the great Salvation? Have not many Professors of Religion <hi>strangely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted their Profession in their Lives? Have not many been <hi>strangely</hi> guilty of prophaning God's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Name and Sabbaths? Have not many People been <hi>strangely</hi> addicted some to one Vice and some to another? To Pride, Envy, Malice, Evil, speaking, Fraud and Injustice, Strife and Contention, Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality &amp; Intemperance, or to a worldly Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have been dispos'd to be <hi>strangely</hi> grasping after the World for the sake of their Children: But God by the late awful Providence, has shew'd how vain a thing it is for Parents to be inordinate in their Desires and Endeavours, to lay up for their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004014_0015_0000000000000000"/>
Children, when they know not whether their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall live to enjoy what they have laid up for them.</p>
            <p>It concerns us all to <hi>search and try our Ways, and turn unto the Lord,</hi> and <hi>diligently hearken to his Voice,</hi> the Voice of his Rod as well as Word, <hi>and to do that which is right in his Sight, and to give ea<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> to his Commandments and keep all his Statutes;</hi> we may then expect the like Favour from Him, which He promis'd to his ancient People; <hi>I will put none of those Diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord that healeth thee.</hi>
