            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore aſking this, of my Fathers in the Miniſtry eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I apply my ſelf to the Truths of God we are called to meditate on.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005125_0004_1016AD87424D7A40"/>
            <p>We all at leaſt profeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, and our Maſter which is in Heaven, and therefore profeſs to have the higheſt Reverence for his Advices. And his Directions to his Diſciples and the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when on Earth, muſt needs demand a Place in the Hearts of his Miniſters and other Diſciples in all Ages. Very important Exhortations and Cautions we have, in the Words I have choſen for the Subject of our preſent Meditations: Which if they touch not every Branch of Duty, in Miniſters and People, yet will many and very weighty Parts.</p>
            <p>All that is neceſſary before we conſider the Words, is to note: That the Scribes and Phariſees, the Imitation of whoſe Conduct our Lord is here warning his Diſciples againſt, were at that Time the Teachers and Rulers of the Jewiſh Church, and their chief Men on civil Accounts; and were a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men, who inſtead of teaching others the right Way of the Lord, made void his Laws thro' their Traditions; who bound heavy Burdens on the Neck of others, thro' their Tyranny over Conſcience, which they themſelves would not touch with one of their Fingers; at the ſame Time that they burden'd them in ſome Points, freeing their Conſciences in others from the Duties of Morality; ſuffering Children to give the Support they owed to their ancient Parents to the ſumptuous Expences of the Temple; adding to divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and making new Modes of them, and ſetting up va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Worſhips which God never required. And while they thus ruled the religious Affairs of that People, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately ambitious in their common Conduct, ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing after worldly Grandeur, chief Places in Synagogues, Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſlaviſh Submiſſions. On the contrary, our Lord who was himſelf meek and lowly of Heart, and always did what pleaſed the Father, here enjoins on his Diſciples and the Multitude, a Submiſſion to God and him their Maſter, and a meek, equal and humble Carriage and Behaviour.</p>
            <p>We may juſt farther obſerve, that our Lord's Diſcourſes were often more peculiarly addreſs'd to his Diſciples, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> afterward deſigned to make his Apoſtles and Miniſters, and thoſe who conſtantly followed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>m and believed on him, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005125_0005_1016AD8B21AD98E8"/>more remotely the Multitudes. Ver 1. <hi>Then ſpake Jeſus to the Multitude, and to his Diſciples.</hi> And ſeeing the Scribes and Phariſees, and their Faults as Teachers eſpecially, are thro' out this Chapter rebuked; no Doubt but Chriſt intended ſpecial Inſtruction to his peculiar Diſciples, at the ſame Time deſigning the Inſtruction and Advantage of the Multitude in general. Accordingly in what I ſhall by God's Help offer from theſe Words, I ſhall underſtand them in both Views; as ſpoke to his Diſciples, whom the Miniſters of Chriſt in this Day are the Succeſſors of, and to the Multitude here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent who have alſo their Part in them.</p>
            <p>I propoſe,
<list>
                  <item>I. To conſider the Phraſes of the Text, <hi>Rabbi, Father, Maſter,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>your Maſter Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>your Father in Heaven.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. The Caution of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Way and the Truth, to his Diſciples and the Multitude; to his Miniſters and the Multitude of his profeſſing People. <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi—Neither be ye called Maſters—Call no Man your Father on the Earth.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. The Reaſon of his Caution; why we ſhould not ſo do. <hi>For one is your Father which is Heaven—For one is your Maſter which is Chriſt—All ye are Brethren.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. His gracious Advice and Exhortation, <hi>But he that is greateſt among you ſhall be your Servant.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Let us conſider the Intent of the Phraſes in our Text, <hi>Rabbi, Maſter, Father,</hi> oppoſed to <hi>your Maſter in Heaven, your Father in Heaven.</hi> The Titles of <hi>Rabbi</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> were then in Uſe, and frequently given to one and another. And here 'tis evident that Chriſt does not intend to deſtroy natural or civil Titles of Reſpect, or the Authority of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Relations of Life. Becauſe theſe Diſtinctions both Name and Thing he has confirm'd; when he has commanded Children to honour their Parents: when he has commanded us all to give <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due, Tribute to whom
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005125_0006_1016AD908EDD9A60"/>Tribute.</hi> Theſe Titles and what is contained under them, do not contradict the Title of ſupreme Father which we owe to God, nor of ſupreme Maſter which we owe to Chriſt. But the acknowledging theſe Relations, and the Titles of Diſtinction which become them and indicate them, is Part of the Duty we owe to God. For <hi>the Powers that be are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.</hi> But as Chriſt makes an Oppoſition here, he intimates; the giving Men ſuch Titles, or paying them ſuch Submiſſions, as are due to our Father in Heaven, or to him, ſuch as detract from the Dignity of their Relation to us, or the Duty we owe them; and the taking ſuch Titles, or claiming ſuch Power our ſelves.— Further, 'tis not to be ſuppoſed, that Chriſt here cautions only againſt the trifling Ambition of gaudy Names and pompous Titles. Theſe are only what very light Minds are taken with. The Scribes and Phariſees were Men of deeper Aims than theſe. As he levels againſt theſe, he warns againſt the Vices they were guilty of, and againſt all ſuch Actions and Endeavours as Entrenche on the Authority of God or him, or the State and Equality of human Nature. We may then well underſtand, than the Diſciples of Chriſt, whatever their Station be, are not to aim at too high Titles, nor at too great Power; not at that which belongs to God or Chriſt, or is beyond the Capacity of weak Men. By our Father in Heaven, I think Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways means, God the Father, his Father and our's. And by this Term Father, is intended, his Right and Authority over us. By his being our Maſter, is intended his ſpiritual Power over us, in every Branch of it.</p>
            <p>But we come,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To meditate on the Caution given by him who is the Way and the Truth, to his Diſciples and the Multitude, to his Miniſters and the Multitude of his profeſſing People. <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi.—Neither be ye called Maſters.—Call no Man Father upon Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Caution is naturally divided into two Parts, <hi>viz. Be ye not called Rabbi; Neither be ye called Maſters.</hi> And <hi>Call no Man Maſter upon the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005125_0007_1016AD9217C20FD0"/>
            <p>Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Chriſtian is to aim at being called <hi>Rabbi</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> not at too high Power, or too great Submiſſion from his Fellow-Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And here again, as Chriſt firſt addreſſed his Diſciples and then the Multitude, ſo it comes to his Miniſters and all his People.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) No chriſtian Miniſter is to aim at being a <hi>Rabbi</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> at Power too high for his Station, entrenching on the Authority of Chriſt, or bringing our Fellow-Chriſtians under undue Subjection.</p>
            <p>This Miniſters may do, by abuſing their peculiar Offices of Teachers, Adviſers, Overſeers, and Guides of Souls, or in their common Conduct and Walk. The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees offended in this Kind, both as Teachers and as Men in common with their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Now Miniſters tranſgreſs this Direction, when they proudly take too much upon them in the Matters of Faith or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the Conſtitution of the chriſtian Church, or warp their ſpiritual Office to the intermeddling with temporal Matters, or in their ordinary Walk among their People.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our Lord here forbids Miniſters pretending to be Maſters of Men's Faith. This it appears the Phariſees ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly aimed at. When the Officers ſent by the Phariſees to apprehend Chriſt, returned ſaying, <hi>Never Man ſpake like this Man,</hi> the Phariſees anſwered, <hi>Have any of the Rulers or Phariſees believed on him.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 7.48.</note> Our Lord in the Context ſays of them, <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites; for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men: For ye neither go in your Selves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entring to go in</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Math. 23.13.</note>. Which he elſewhere explains, <hi>Wo unto you Lawyers or Scribes: For ye have taken away the Key of Knowledge: Ye entred not in your ſelves, and them that were entring in ye hindred</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 11.52.</note>. And
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005125_0008_1016AD95602E4418"/>all aim at the ſame Power who walk in the ſame Steps, who endeavour to enſlave others to their Opinions, to be Lords of Men's Faith, or to have Dominion over it. There is a vaſt Pride in the Hearts of Men, which diſcovers it ſelf many Ways. Sometimes by tyrannizing over Men's Bodies, but very often over their Souls and Underſtandings, in Matters of Religion. As chriſtian Miniſters have the promoting that for their peculiar Province; they have here often ſhewn their Ambition.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a flagrant Inſtance of this. She bereaves the common People of the Bible the only Rule of Faith, and thereby puts in the Power of the Prieſthood, to dictate to them what Principles of Religion they pleaſe. — The Church of <hi>England</hi> would have arrogated ſomething of the ſame Power, when ſhe ſays in her 21ſt Article, "That the Church (by which I ſuppoſe is meant Aſſemblies of the Clergy in Convocation) hath Authority in Controverſies of Faith;" had ſhe not happily explain'd it to mean, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing any Thing contrary to holy Writ, nor Power to miſinterpret any Part of it.</p>
            <p>All Aſſemblies of the Clergy, do by their Actions ſhew their Deſire of this Power, who meet to decree or determine any Thing to be neceſſary to be believed on their own Authority; or to make their Interpretations of God's Word to be infallibly true; or to publiſh their Reſults as undoubted Comments upon holy Scripture; ſo as to deny any chriſtian Privileges to thoſe who will not ſubmit to them; or to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize and declare Hereticks all whoſe Underſtandings will not cringe to theirs, but will ſearch the Scriptures for themſelves, and believe for themſelves.</p>
            <p>All Miniſters arrogate to themſelves the Authority of <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi>'s, who in their publick and private Teaching, whether as to general Articles of Faith, or particular Applications to Souls, preach themſelves, their own Notions, either philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical or metaphyſical, however they may think them agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Scripture, if they are not to be proved by it: Who preach abſtruſe Speculations and ſuppos'd Conſequences of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005125_0009_1016AD9848DD8FD0"/>dark Texts of Scripture above common Conceptions As this is the being wiſe above what is written, they who are hereby bro't into theſe diſtinguiſhing Peculiarities, muſt be firſt learnt to depend on the Wiſdom of Men, above the Wiſdom of God. —All Miniſters who teach People to build their Hopes of Salvation, on Doctrines founded on the Experience of themſelves or others; when at the ſame Time every neceſſary Point of the Doctrine of Converſion, as well as all other neceſſary ones, is plainly laid down in Scripture, take leading Steps to ſuch a Power. — All Miniſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves Rabbies and Maſters, who expect chriſtian People ſhould believe or diſbelieve Propoſitions, becauſe they affirm or deny them. —They aim at this Power in a Way beneath the Dignity of common Senſe, but often with great Succeſs, who would beat their Sentiments into their Fellow-Chriſtians, by Dint of a loud Voice and boiſterous Delivery, inſtead of Reaſon and Argument upon the holy Scripture.— In a groſs Manner do all Miniſters uſurp the Place of God and Chriſt, who when they publiſh their Opinions, inſtead of proving them by the Word of God, make free with the Terrors of the Almighty, and placing themſelves on his Throne, boldly denounce Hell and Damnation of thoſe who will not ſwallow all they ſay: When at the ſame Time the Perſons they threaten muſt believe for themſelves, muſt obey God rather than Man, and underſtand his Words as they can, not as they will.—In an inſulting Manner do they aſſume the Maſterſhip, who <hi>Diotrephes like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iming at the Preheminence</hi> enter upon the Labours Chriſt has committed to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe their Brethren will not make them the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of their religious Principles or Practices. Eſpecially when the Principles they contend for are not ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained directly in the Word of God, but to be true by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence only, in which C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe humane, fallible, reaſoning Powers take Place. Theſe are ſome Inſtances wherein (I think) they who follow the Steps deſcribed, may be ſaid to affect to be <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>And hence we ſee in this Point what was our Lord's Intent. That his miniſters neither in Aſſembly nor ſingly, take upon them to publiſh of themſelves, Articles of Faith neceſſary to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005125_0010_1016AD9C54BDB140"/>be believed by all chriſtian People. But that they preach up conſtantly, that the Word of God is the only Rule of Faith, and that nothing in Religion is to be proved but by it; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch firſt and almoſt ſelf evident Principles, as even the Truth and divine Authority of the holy Scripture is built upon. That we maintain, that every Man is for himſelf to ſearch it for his own Faith; and tho' he uſe Miniſters and others as Helps, yet not as Authorities. That we lay no Claim to Infallibility, nor make our Interpretations of Scripture equal to the Authority of God; nor breath out the ſame Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt thoſe who differ from us, and perhaps miſtakenly from Truth, which God has againſt thoſe who profanely and contemptuouſly deny his Authority and caſt his Words behind their Backs.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Secondly,</hi> When Chriſt ſays, <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi; Be ye not called Maſter,</hi> he may intend that his Miniſters ſhould not aim at being Lords of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>This was a Power the Phariſees did aſſume. This Chriſt taxed them with, as we may ſee, Matth. 15.2. <hi>Why do you tranſgreſs the Commandment of God by your Tradition. For God commanded ſaying, Honour thy Father and Mother, and he that curſeth Father or Mother, let him die the Death. But ye ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Father or Mother, It is a Gift by whatſoever th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Traditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all Miniſters follow theſe Jewiſh Teachers, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of their own Authority to determine the Nature of Good and Evil. All do ſo who pretend abſolutely to forgive Sins or hold Perſons under the Guilt of them. All Miniſters aſſume the Maſterſhip, who abſolutely declare Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or unconverted. All Miniſters exerciſe this, who advance Things as abſolute Truths and Terms of Salvation, tending either to make the Conſciences of Sinners eaſy or to grieve and perplex the Generation of God's Children. All Miniſters do ſo who put People upon judging of the Nature and Tendency of their Actions, otherwiſe than by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005125_0011_1016AD9FA1903960"/>of Good and Evil as laid down in God's Word: And leaving that to ſuppoſe that their State towards God depends on certain bodily Senſations and Emotions of Paſſion, of which theſe Miniſters are Judges whether they are good or not; or on a particular narrow Set of religious Principles, which are always their own. In a Word, Whoever abuſes the miniſterial Power, in an arbitrary Manner to make Terms of Salvation, diſtinct or different from thoſe of God's Word, aim at being Rabbi's; reach after Maſterſhip.</p>
            <p>Here then Chriſt teaches his Miniſters, not to be Lords, but Guides under him and in Obedience to him. That they take every Direction they give to Souls, from his unerring Word, not tampering with them like Quacks, and dealing out to them their own <hi>Noſtrums;</hi> but the Rules of their Maſter, whoſe Laws, Directions and Advices touch every Caſe which the human Soul can poſſibly be in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This may be included in Chriſt's Advice to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi, be ye not called Maſters,</hi> preſume not to model the external State of Religion, the Ordinances and Inſtitutions of it, by your own Power or after your own Fancy. Thus when Chriſt ſaid, That <hi>not that which goeth into the Mouth defileth a Man, but that which cometh out.</hi> The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were offended.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. 15. <hi>paſſion.</hi>
               </note> When the Phariſees aſked him, <hi>Why do thy Diſciples tranſgreſs the Tradition of the Elders, for they waſh not their Hands when they eat Bread.</hi>—Chriſt ſays in his Anſwer, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of Men.</hi> ‡ When our Lord made his publick Appearance on Earth, it was the indiſpenſible Duty of every one among whom he lived, to believe in him as the Meſſiah; and yet the Phariſees had a great Hand, in caſting one out of the Synagogue, excommunicating him, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt on the moſt powerful Evidence.<note n="*" place="bottom">John 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And this Power has been often aſſumed ſince Chriſt was on Earth. Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, left his Church plain and ſimple, like a clean and modeſt Virgin; but Men preſumed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005125_0012_1016ADA459610648"/>to dreſs and paint her up, till at Length what is called Chriſt's Church in many Places, is the Mother of Whoredoms. But our Lord deſires to have her as he left her. His Work needs not Man's mending.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ſome outward Circumſtances of religious Worſhip and Aſſemblies, (as in all other Matters) which Societies muſt agree upon; but I ſpeak of ſuch Things as are eſteemed the Parts of chriſtian Worſhip, and wherein we are limited by God's Word. The Church of Chriſt is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People throughout the World; but in a more confined Senſe, thoſe particular Societies, to whom he has given ſpecial Rules and Injunctions, Officers and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>All Miniſters encroach on his Authority who pretend to make any humane Mode of a divine Ordinance, and eſſential Part of it, as much as the Parts divinely appointed; and on the other Hand who leave any Part of a divine Ordinance. All thoſe Miniſters eſpecially make themſelves Rabbi's and Maſters in a very extraordinary Degree, who being ſtation'd according to Scripture Plan, to the Execution of their Offices in any particular Part of Chriſt's Church; leaving their Charge, neglect their Labours; and in an arbitrary Manner enter upon Men's Labours; tread under Foot the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erties of other Churches; invade Flocks committed to the Charge of others, by the ſame Authority that fixed them in their Places; endeavouring to alienate People's Affections from Paſtors to whoſe Care they are committed, and in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Way ſtirring up needleſs Strife and perpetual Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the Kingdom of the Prince of Peace. Laſtly here, All thoſe Miniſters aim at too great Degrees of Maſterſhip, who knowingly make the Terms of Communion or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the ſpecial Ordinances, more ſtrait or lax than our Lord himſelf has made them.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt's Miniſters are not to be called <hi>Rabbies</hi> or <hi>Maſters,</hi> not to aim at too great Degrees of Submiſſion from others, in the common Conduct of Life.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005125_0013_1016ADA8F8719D90"/>
            <p>This the jewiſh Teachers, the Phariſees, were notoriouſly guilty of. <hi>They made broad their Phylacteries, and enlarged the Borders of their Garments, and loved the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts, and the chief Seats in the Synagogues, and Greetings in the Markets, and to be called of Men, Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> Math. 23.5, &amp;c. We cannot ſuppoſe our Saviour here forbids all civil Terms of Reſpect and Diſtinction, becauſe he and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples uſed them, But hereby in general is doubtleſs forbidden, a lordly overbearing Behaviour; Expreſſions of Pride and Self-conceit; the aſpiring after high Titles; Places of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in publick Concourſes of People. Eſpecially hereby is condemned the arrogant Air of a Miniſter among his own People.—The maintaining himſelf much above them—The keeping at an awful Diſtance from them—The obſerving a great Reſerve—The dealing in a haughty Manner, eſpecially with ſuch as aſk his Advices and Inſtructions, in a becoming modeſt Manner. Such a Behaviour is very unfit for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus, ſuch as declare they will ſpend and be ſpent for Souls.</p>
            <p>The contrary Character to this, which certainly Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, is a meek and lowly Behaviour; a Condeſcenſion to Inferiours; a free Converſation; an affable courteous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the not taking State, but putting on Humbleneſs of Mind but eſpecially, the treating all humble Souls in their ſpiritual Concerns, with the greateſt: Tenderneſs and Kindneſs; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the beſt Advice, and by no Means driving from them the fearful Sheep and Lambs Chriſt has given them to feed.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This Advice and Caution comes alſo to all chriſtian People. <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi : Be ye not called Maſters.</hi> As the Scribes and Phariſees were Men who ſet themſelves in the moſt conſpicuous Light; as they were greatly revered, ſo they were much imitated. Hence our Saviour takes Occaſion to warn the Multitude againſt their Example.</p>
            <p>No Chriſtian then is to aim at being called <hi>Rabbi.</hi>—No Chriſtian is to be a Dictator of his own Faith, much leſs of that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005125_0014_1016ADAB730E09B0"/>of others. No Chriſtian is to preſcribe to his own Conſcience, much leſs to the Conſciences of others; or to form Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Good or Evil according to his own Fancy. No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to go out of his Sphere, but to keep within the Limits of his Calling, and <hi>therein abide with God.</hi> No Chriſtian or Society of Chriſtians is to make any new Terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Chriſt has not made; nor refuſe any Admiſſion to Chriſt's Ordinances among them, who are not deſtitute of and Qualification he has made neceſſary to the Being of a Chriſtian. No Chriſtian is to take on himſelf Pride and Haughtineſs, but to be humble and meek in every Station.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Branch of the Caution. <hi>Call no Man your Father upon the Earth.</hi> This Advice of our aſcended Lord comes to us all both Miniſters and People. We are forbid to pay too great Submiſſion to, or have too great Dependance on, any Man. If we are not to arrogate the Power of Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it belongs to none but God, then we are to ſuffer none to uſe it over us. We are not to ſuffer any one in an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Manner, to preſcribe to us what we ſhall believe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, or the Duty we owe him; but courageouſly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Freedom of Enquiry into religious Matters, Liberty of thinking and judging for themſelves, to be the unalienable Right of all Chriſtians, and to hold it faſt ourſelves. We are to believe no Man as to any important Truth of Religion upon his bare Word, but upon ſatisfactory Evidence, or the plain Authority of holy Scripture. We are not to rely on any Man, tho' ever ſo famous for Learning or Piety, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we can ſee the Truth of their Aſſertions. It is Part of the Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free, to be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to none but him.</p>
            <p>Much leſs ſhould we call any Man <hi>Father upon Earth,</hi> in reſpect to his Power over Conſcience. This neither is nor can be ſubject to any but God. <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Man,</hi> Acts 5.29. We are to lay no Streſs on any Man's Deciſions of the Nature of Good and Evil, of Duty and Sin, any farther than he agrees with the revealed Will of God. Any Man's confident Declarations of our good Eſtate, or his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005125_0015_1016ADAEB6627C40"/>threatning out Hell and Damnation againſt us; the one is not to be depended on, nor need the other the valued of a Ruſh, any farther than they are agreeable to the Directions of the only Lord of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>No Chriſtian ought to give himſelf up to the Directions of another, as to the Ordinances of Chriſt, the Method and Parts of his Worſhip, ſo far as he has limited them in his Word. But to ſtick by the Simplicity of them, let Men ſay on diſpute what they will; yea, tho' they ſhould in a great Zeal for Piety, pretend that there are ſome Methods different from Chriſt's Ordinances, which God is pleaſed to bleſs, and which abundantly more promote Religion than they, and bring ſome plauſible Evidences thereof.</p>
            <p>No Chriſtian ought to give flattering Titles to Men, or pay them ſlaviſh Submiſſions, in religious Matters; (as the Papiſts do when they give the Titles of God to the Man of Sin) but to aſſert the Dignity of humane Nature. And tho' we give Honour to whom Honour is due, yet not to humour unlawful Pride or any Encroachments upon the Rights of God our only Father, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he has exalted.</p>
            <p>But on the other Hand, We are to receive the Doctrines and Rules of Religion, from none but God and him whom he has ſent and made our only Prophet, Lawgiver and Lord. Not but that common Reaſon will inform us, and God's Word confirms it: That we ſhould pay a becoming Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Opinions of the Wife, the Learned, and the Pious, ſo as to hear their Advices, to give due Attendance to them, to weigh and deliberate upon them, and follow them as far as they appear to us true, and agreeable to the ſacred Oracles. But then this Agreement with Truth and God's Word, is to be the Meaſure of our following them and the Ground of it, and not the meer Sayings or Practices of any Man. We muſt give to Men Honour and Reſpect, but not idolatrous Homage.</p>
            <p>But I now proceed to conſider the Reaſon our Lord gives for this Conduct, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005125_0016_1016ADB67367AEE8"/>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>For one is your Father which is in Heaven.—For one is your Maſter which is Chriſt.— All ye are Brethren.</hi> Theſe I ſhall conſider as our Saviour has been pleaſed to lay them down. Altho' they are interchangeably true. Chriſt's being our Maſter is an Argument, ſufficient to prove, that we are to call no Man our Father upon the Earth. And God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Father is a ſtrong Argument why we ſhould not be called Rabbi. But becauſe our Saviour has thus varied the Phraſes let us ſo conſider them.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to <hi>call no Man our Father upon the Earth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>one is our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> This is a Reaſon common to Miniſters and People. <hi>One God,</hi> may Brethren, <hi>hath created us. We have all one Father.</hi> The great God, is <hi>the Father of the Spirits of all Fleſh.</hi> He at firſt gave us our rational Powers, our Capacity of knowing Truth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing it. He is the Author of all Truths, and the Revealer of all ſuch as concern our Souls. In every Age, and in every Place, true <hi>Wiſdom comes down from the Father of Lights,</hi> who is the Giver <hi>of every good and perfect Gift.</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">James 1.17.</note> Now ſurely he who gave us our Souls, may rightly demand our Improvement of every Faculty of them in the Search of Truth and Care of them. He who is the Author of Truth rightly demands that we embrace all Truths he reveals. Our Father in Heaven, who is all-perfect, all-knowing, all-wiſe, is the only ſuitable Object of Dependance as to Truth and Falſhood. He who is the Author of Conſcience and original Lord of it, has alone a Right to direct it, to lay down the Rules of Good and Evil, and to preſcribe Limits to our Conduct. He who is the only Object of religious Worſhip, has a Right and none elſe, to lay down Rules for the devout Obedience and Worſhip we ſhall pay him the <hi>one God and Father of all,</hi> whom <hi>thro' Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> we are to worſhip in <hi>Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now are not theſe the ſtrongeſt Reaſons why we ſhould call no Man our Father upon the Earth. Is not that to give the Authority of God to Men? Can we receive any Man's Opinion as Truth upon his own Authority, without renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005125_0017_1016ADB80D810FD0"/>the Authority of the Father of Spirits? Can we ſubmit our Conſciences to the Juriſdiction of any Man upon Earth, without revolting from him who is greater than our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and than all Men, and knoweth all Things? Can we receive Laws and Conſtitutions for the Worſhip of God, from any Man without placing him in God's Stead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of Idolatry? Is not this the making the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God void, by worſhipping him according to the Commands of Men? We are then to renounce all abſolute Submiſſions to Men, in Matters that concern the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have a Father in Heaven. And every Chriſtian ought conſtantly to ſay, to any one who would endeavour to bring his Underſtanding or Conſcience or outward religious Conduct under Subjection, <q rend="margQuotes">I have a Father in Heaven, to whom I owe all Duty and Submiſſion. Whatever you ſay agreeable to his Will I believe and conform to; not on your Authority, but out of Obedience to him. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſay diſagreeable to him, I have nothing to do with.</q> Such an Anſwer ought to be given to every Man and every Aſſembly of Men, tho' ever ſo numerous, grave, and pious. <q rend="margQuotes">I cannot ſubmit my Underſtanding or religious Conduct to you, for one is my Father which is in Heaven.</q> Nevertheleſs here alſo, great Caution is to be uſed; that we go not into a faulty Extreme, and caſt off all Counſel, Advice, and Means of Light and Knowledge, from the Wiſe and Judicious. Which Fault the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Frailty of our Nature, and a due Humility will well arm us againſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are to call no Man our Father upon the Earth, becauſe one is our Father which is in Heaven; ſo we are not to <hi>he called Rabbi or Maſter,</hi> becauſe one is our <hi>Maſter, which is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all Mankind lay in the Ruins of the firſt Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, ſunk in deplorable Ignorance, God was pleaſed in the Fullneſs of Time to ſend his Son from Heaven cloathed in Fleſh, to reveal to us all neceſſary Truths that concern the humane Soul. And after Chriſt had perſonally done this, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> out eternal Redemption by his precious Blood, it pleaſed the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005125_0018_1016677C000514C8"/>Father to exalt him, God Man, to great Dignity and royal Power, that he might ſtill carry on this glorious Work, and enjoin as a King, the Faith and Practice of thoſe Things which he as a Prophet revealed. This aſcended Jeſus is our common Maſter, and this is the ſtrongeſt Reaſon againſt our aiming at Maſterſhip. However this admits of a ſomewhat different Conſideration, when apply'd to Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Miniſters are not to be <hi>called Rabbi's or Maſter's, for one is our Maſter even Chriſt.</hi> Miniſters are not their own Men, but under Government. And the Buſineſs of Teachers and Rulers in the Houſe of God, inſtead of giving them a Licenſe this Way, affords peculiar Arguments againſt it. Miniſters have received their Commiſſion from their Maſter in Heaven, who has a juſt Right to lay out all his Servants Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it is a revolting from him and ſetting up for our ſelves, to go a Step beſide his Orders to the right Hand or to the left. Is it not ſo? Chriſt our Maſter is a wiſe Maſter, able to order the Affairs of his own Family infinitely better than the wiſeſt Miniſter. What Folly then is it for any to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Limits he has ſet them. <hi>The Fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than Men, and the Weakneſs of God is ſtronger than Men,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.25. Chriſt our Maſter is jealous of his own Honour and the Rights of his Government. Shall we then preſume to eject him his Throne, and lord it over the Underſtandings or Conſciences of his Subjects. Would a like Inſult be born by an earthly Maſter? Chriſt is a Maſter who will one Day call all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to account, for the Fulfillment of their peculiar Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and will any one ran the Riſque of then telling his Maſter, that he has been acting as tho' he were his own Lord.</p>
            <p>Now if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has laid down the Doctrines he will have his Miniſters preach, and the Manner in which they muſt be preached; if he has laid down the Limits of Good &amp; Evil, of what pleaſes and what diſpleaſes him; if he has conſtituted the Form and Ordinances of his Church; and if he be at the ſame Time ſuch a Maſter as has been deſcribed; Is not that Miniſter proud and preſumptuous beyond compare, who ſhall diſregard theſe Limits, and preach himſelf Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or follow his own Reaſon and Imagination to the Neglect of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005125_0019_1016ADBF08CFC490"/>
            <p>Once more; Chriſt tho' our exalted Maſter, yet is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf. He <hi>came not to be miniſtred to, but to miniſter, and to give his Life a Ranſom for many,</hi> Mark 10.45. And a little before he left the World, waſhed his Diſciples Feet, ſaying, <hi>If I your Lord and Maſter, have waſhed your Feet, ye ought to waſh one anothers Feet; for I have given you an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ye ſhould do as I have done to you,</hi> John 13.14. Surely then his Miniſters ſhould be humble, meek and lowly; ready to do any good Offices to their Fellow-Chriſtians. What? Did our Maſter ſo and ſhall we refuſe? I might under this Head bring many Texts to prove that Jeſus Chriſt is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all religious Truths, and has bound his Miniſters both in publick and private to deliver only his Truths; that he is the only Lawgiver and the only Head of his Body the Church.</p>
            <p>But I muſt paſs on</p>
            <p n="2">2. No Chriſtian or Societies of Chriſtians are to be called <hi>Rabbi or Maſter, becauſe one is their Maſter even Chriſt.</hi> All Chriſtians profeſs him to be their Lord, and if ſo muſt ſurely ſubmit to him. No Chriſtian therefore may pretend to draw up a Scheme of religious Principles for himſelf, but with an abſolute conſtant Regard to the Revelation of Chriſt in his Goſpel. Every Chriſtian is to remember, that his Brother has a Maſter even Chriſt, as well as he, to whom he muſt be ſubject; and therefore is not to try by any other Way than Argument and Scripture to bring his Brother's Reaſon or Conſcience to a Conformity to his. For we muſt remember, my Fellow-Chriſtians, that for all this we are to be bro't into Judgment. Our all-wiſe Maſter will one Day ſee how his Subjects have behaved, and what will be the Event, if he find we have trampled on his Authority and caſt his Laws behind our Backs, if he find us forgetting whoſe Diſciples we are, and filled with Pride and Anger, and every evil Work. <hi>Here particularly</hi> let me briefly ſay, Chriſt's being the Maſter of all Chriſtians, is a ſtrong Reaſon why we ſhould make the Terms of Perſons Communion with us in his Ordinances no narrower than he has done, no narrower than he has made the Term, of Salvation; but <hi>receive all whom he has received to the Glory of God.</hi> For the Maſter of the Family certainly knows beſt who ſhould be admitted into it, and it is an Affectation of Maſterſhip for us to encloſe the Privileges of his Church in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005125_0020_1016ADC525FDC4E0"/>Limits of our preſcribing. <hi>Again,</hi> One Thing more deſerves Conſideration here; If Chriſt be the only Maſter, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are his Servants employed by him on his Buſineſſ; then Chriſtians ſingly or collectively ought never to treat with Severity or to eject or leave the Miniſtry of any of Chriſt's Servants, ſent in his Way, till they find that theſe Servants, do groſly exceed their Limits, or in no Meaſure faithfully fulfill their Miſſion; which they muſt determine by their continual neglecting the plain Duties of their Office, or preaching publickly or privately contrary (not to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular humane Syſtem of Religion but) to the Tenor of the plain and indubitable Parts of the Goſpel of Chriſt. But while they go on in publick and private, ſaying nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto, but delivering the whole Counſel of God, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are fulfilling their Miſſion, they are doing the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt their Maſter; and if their Hearers, thoſe committed to their Charge, neglect them, refuſe to hear them, or aſk Advice of them, it is an Affront to our only Maſter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us conſider the other Reaſon our Lord gives, why none of his Diſciples are to be called Rabbi or Maſter, to indulge Pride or aim at too great Authority; which is this, <hi>Ye are all Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo duly conſidered is a Reaſon of great Weight. For it implies theſe two Things. That God and his Son have not given us any unlimited Power, in Matters of Religion; and that we are very unfit for it. Jeſus Chriſt has given to none of his Diſciples a Superiority over others in Matters of Faith, Life or Worſhip. We are all Brethren.</p>
            <p>Miniſters are peculiarly called to concern themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the propagating the Truths of Religion, but then they may only do it by fair Argument and the Word of God; and after they have done their beſt, leave the Event to God. The paſtoral Office raiſes none above the Level of Brethren to their Fellow-Chriſtians; gives them no Power to tyrannize over their Bodies for the Sake of their Souls, nor to give up to Satan any who differ from their Sentiments, nor to treat People in common Conduct as tho' they were Slaves. But
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005125_0021_1016ADC6C2157668"/>if all Chriſtians are Brethren, Miniſters are freely and in an equal Manner to converſe with private Chriſtians, to be ready to receive Light from them as well as to give it to them; in Meekneſs reclaiming ſuch as they think miſtaken, and leaving ſuch as continue ſo, to the one Maſter. All Chriſtians are to eſteem each other as Brethren, and therefore as they take it to be their Right to think and act for themſelves in the Things of Religion, they are to allow it to every one elſe. Not therefore by meer Power to deny any chriſtian Privileges who own their abſolute Subjection to the common Maſter, and give no Evidence to the contrary. Much leſs ſhould they uſe bodily Terrors to bring them to the Truth. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People are under a common Obligation, and he who encroaches upon it robs his Brother of a right Chriſt has inveſted him with.</p>
            <p>But farther,</p>
            <p>As we are all Brethren, we are not fit or accompliſhed for the Office of Rabbies or Maſters. Brethren have the ſame common Nature, and all the Diſciples of Chriſt are Men. We are all fallible; our Maſter in Heaven is infallible. No Man, be his natural or acquired Parts ever ſo great, is to be acknowledged our Maſter, becauſe he is our Brother; of the ſame Nature, and therefore liable to Miſtakes. All Aſſemblies of Men are but Aſſemblies of our Brethren, and therefore cannot have the Place of Maſters without unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, My Brethren, what ſtrong Reaſons our Lord here gives why we ſhould not take the Authority which belongs to him, or ſubmit our ſelves to it in any other.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And laſtly, We are to attend to our Saviour's gracious Advice and Encouragement, <hi>He that is greateſt among you ſhall be your Servant.</hi> Theſe Words ſhould make a deep Impreſſion on us all. They may be taken either as a Direction and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or Encouragement to True Humility, and a Concern for Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They may be taken as an Advice, what true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is. He that is the Servant of Souls, is in a religious
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005125_0022_1016ADC8892B4A40"/>Senſe, a greater Man than any other, let his Grandeur be what it will. He is ſo who in a juſt and rational Way, in his proper Sphere, takes moſt Pains to promote the Intereſt of Truth and of Souls. Hence ſays <hi>Solomon, He that winneth Souls is wiſe,</hi> Prov. 11.30. To promote Men's everlaſting Good, is the moſt exalted Degree of publick Spiritedneſs. It was an indefatigable and dauntleſs Zeal in this Regard, which gave Renown to the Apoſtles and primitive Martyrs and Confeſſors, and herein muſt every Chriſtian, eſpecially every Goſpel Miniſter be converſant.</p>
            <p>For further, We may thus underſtand the Words. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is placed in any advantageous Station among you, let him honour himſelf and magnify his Office, by Diligence in his peculiar Station, and doing all the Good he can. Hence then the gaping after temporal Honours and Preferments, the aiming at great Names or unlimited Authority, are not Characters of true Greatneſs; but the ſtedfaſt Continuance in every good Office, whereby the real Welfare of Souls is forwarded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Verſe may be alſo taken as an Encouragement. <hi>He that is greateſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> He that is a Servant ſhall be greateſt in the Eſteem of others. A Concern for the Intereſts of Religion, conſtant Endeavours, by Inſtruction, Advice, Reproof, to forward the everlaſting Welfare of others, is ſo far from being beneath the Dignity of any one, be he ever ſo great even in civil Authority, that it raiſes every Part of his Character, how much more in a Goſpel Miniſter? It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true Way to Reputation, Honour, and Eſteem, to labour for Souls.</p>
            <p>But above all, 'tis to be remembred that whoſoever is a Servant is great in the Eſteem of God. <hi>For he reſiſteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble,</hi> Jam. 4.6. Eſpecially does he hate Pride in them who pretend to be Followers of his Son, and Ambaſſadors carrying on his Work, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well done by an ambitious Soul. But where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Miniſter is ambitious only of ſpending, and being ſpent for Souls, there God looks on with Approbation, and his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is always a Crown of Glory.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005125_0023_1016ADCDB90C2810"/>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to enumerate ſome Particulars contained in this cautionary Speech of our bleſſed Saviour; that all Miniſters eſpecially may by having it renewedly bro't to Remembrance be more ſtedfaſtly engaged in practiſing agreable to it.</p>
            <p>Let us make ſome IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How happy had it been for the chriſtian World, if this Caution of our Saviour had been conſtantly obſerved. Pride and Ambition have been the Bane of the Church. Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Office of the Miniſtry, for the Service of immortal Souls, and it was for ſome Ages a Buſineſs of great Burden and Labour, and little Reward, except the Pleaſure of doing Good, and a Conſcience of Approbation with God. But in Proceſs of Time, when the Miniſters of Religion came to much civil Reſpect and temporal Profits, then ambitious Men of corrupt Luſts, counting that Gain is Godlineſs, crept into the ſacred Office, them they ſhaped the Doctrines and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt's Church as they pleaſed. And to hinder Truth's ever emerging, uſed ſecular Terrors to prevent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Tho't, the only Way of gaining and preſerving it. So that in many Lands which call themſelves Chriſtian, a Profeſſion of Chriſt's Truth is attended with Pains, Penalties, and Death. Very unhappy alſo are thoſe Lands where Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and the Freedom of profeſſing it is confined to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sects, and all negative Diſcouragements uſed to prevent Diſſent from eſtabliſhed Opinions. Theſe are Methods which ſerve Falſhood as well as Truth; they are moſt arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Pretences of any Men; Chriſt's Religion needs them not, nor is he well pleaſed with them. His Truths recommend themſelves ſufficiently, when they come in their native Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, unattended by temporal Threats; and Religion will always flouriſh moſt, where Men humbly leave their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to direct their own Conſciences; where Magiſtrates are Protectors of the Quiet in the Land in all their religious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, from Perſecution and ſpiritual Tyranny. How thankful then are we to be that we in this Land enjoy Liberty of Conſcience, of believing and worſhipping for our Selves, and are protected therein; and that the Miniſtry of this Land
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005125_0024_1016ADD32DF63C40"/>makes not Uſe of Fines and Impriſonment to eſtabliſh truth, but of Reaſon, Argument and the Word of God. Theſe Bleſſings may God always preſerve to us, may his Mercy be upon us to all Generations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be proper to ſay ſomething by Way of Caution againſt the Abuſe of the Doctrine of our Text.</p>
            <p>Tho' our Lord here forbids us to be called Rabbi or Maſter, yet he by no Means forbids his Miniſters to act becoming the Dignity of their Office, to inſiſt, when the Intereſts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion require it, on the Rights and Privileges of the Goſpel Miniſtry, or to expect that Deference, Attention and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration from People, which they owe to the Ambaſſadors of God. Nor does he forbid either Miniſters or People, to <hi>covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts,</hi> to gain all Degrees of Knowledge they can, to be ready to communicate what they have, to be ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous for the Truths of Chriſt when attacked; but only if we <hi>ſtrive</hi> we muſt <hi>ſtrive lawfully.</hi> We never fall under this Cenſure for being firm in the Faith of Things, in Proportion to the Evidence and Importance of them; or for being ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in promoting what we think Truth, by lawful Means, Scripture and Argument.</p>
            <p>Tho's we are to <hi>call no Man Father upon the Earth,</hi> yet as I have before hinted, we muſt maintain a humble Temper, and think that ſome may know more than we, and not that we are the Men, and Wiſdom ſhall die with us. We ſhould always have the Diſpoſition of Learners, remembring that the Truths of God may be a continued Employment, that we can never reach the End of them. The Saying and Opinions of Men of Piety ought to have great Weight and be ſolidly tho't on. And that Method of Worſhip, under which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Religion flouriſhes moſt, demands our moſt ſerious Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whether it be not the trueſt. Men of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhould hearken to. <hi>In a Multitude of Counſellors there is ſafety,</hi> and Brethren may and ought to be helpful to each other.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="unknown:005125_0025_1016ADD518567800"/>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall take the Freedom to addreſs my ſelf to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Miniſters preſent. To you my Fathers (whom in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of your Age, Learning, Stations and Piety I may yet ſo call) this Caution and Advice peculiarly comes. But I count my ſelf happy in that I am now ſpeaking to thoſe, to whom I need not uſe a Style unbecoming my Age, and in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, I mean of Taxing and Reproof. For I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is Witneſs and your People are Witneſſes, that as you call no Man Father upon the Earth, ſo you ſeek not the unwarrantable Power your ſelves, which you yield not to others.</p>
            <p>You preach not your ſelves but Jeſus Chriſt Lord. From him you gain every Principle of the Faith you inſtruct your People in, every Rule of Life you adviſe them to, and every Foundation of Hope you encourage them to rely on.—You teach Men the Way to Virtue and Happineſs, not after your own Imaginations or any humane Scheme, but by the Laws and Directions of him, <hi>who openeth and no Man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no Man openeth</hi>—You preach up the Neceſſity of the new Birth, becauſe Chriſt has, but no other Scheme of Converſion than that of holy Scripture; becauſe the Author of that glorious Work can alone deſcribe the Method of it.—You dare direct Men in no other Way than that he has marked out, becauſe in ſo doing you know you would <hi>daub with untempered Mortar, heal the Wound of the Daughter of God's People ſlightly,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt would be no longer King in his own Kingdom.—You know that no falſe Terrors nor ungrounded Joys, can forward any Souls in the Way to Heaven.—You preſume not to ſhape Chriſt's Ordinances according to any ſuppoſed advantageous Scheme nor popular Opinion, but ſo far as you are concerned in them, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep them pure and ſimple as he left them.— You with a ſtedfaſt View to the Example and Authority of our great Maſter, behave your ſelves with all Humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all; not in an aſſuming Manner bearing down and uſurping the Rights of your Brethren in the Miniſtry; nor domineering and lording it over your Brethren of the Laity; Seeking not your Selves, your Honours and Profits, but their Souls Good, you give them your beſt and moſt ſolemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005125_0026_1016ADD81BB08BF8"/>you patiently hear them, reſolve their Doubts, ſupport the Diſconſolate, and lead them by the Hand in the Ways of Chriſt and Holineſs, and thoſe that muſt give Account.</p>
            <p>At the ſame Time, this very Humility leads you to call no Man your Father upon the Earth, becauſe you know that true Humility is to be firſt exerciſed in a Submiſſion to God, and that the neglecting him and receiving the Dictates of any Man is hateful Pride.—It is therefore that you uſe the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries of chriſtian Faith drawn up by any Man or Number of Men, but as Helps; and chuſe rather to take your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from your Maſter, than any of his Diſciples, from the Fountain than any Streams.—It is therefore that you bind not your ſelves to the Opinions of each other, any farther than our Maſter leads the Way.—And therefore however the Opinion or even Silence of Men of Wiſdom and Piety, of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Leiſure for Study, who live as it were at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Head of Knowledge, may influence you in any Cauſe, yet you enſlave not your ſelves to their Sentiments. <hi>For who are Paul and Apollos but Miniſters.</hi> Our Maſter dwells not at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but in Heaven. We are all Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.—You truckle not to all popular Opinions and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Novelties, becauſe you know <hi>we are not to be many Maſters,</hi> leſt we <hi>Receive the greater Condemnation,</hi> Jam. 3.1.</p>
            <p>Nor do you account that in thus following your Father and Maſter, and couragiouſly aſſerting his Doctrines and ſtanding firmly by his Conſtitutions, you act the Part of Rabbi's, tho' the Out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry of Pride and Obſtinacy be raiſed upon you; tho' many of your Hearers be diſpleaſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are perſwaded that ſo long as he honours you with this Office, you are to be faithful to your Maſter; that ſo under all outward Diſcouragements, you may yet have your Conſciences clear, and be able to look up to him with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Joy; truſting that as you have been faithful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainting in ſerving Souls, you ſhall be infinitely better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him, than if you ſwam with the Stream, and were loaded with the fawning Careſſes of an unſtable Multitude.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005125_0027_1016ADDB9B8F30E8"/>
            <p>If there be any Miniſter in this Aſſembly of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, may God enlighten him in his Duty in this Matter. But I truſt that all who thus do, will go on and proſper for a Bleſſing to this Land, for the continuing the Intereſts of Truth and Righteouſneſs. Religion can never be in more Danger than when the Miniſters of it are the Slaves of a Party; ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Time and Study, which ſhould be ſpent about the great and important Doctrines and Laws of Chriſt, in beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into themſelves and others the little Peculiarities of a Sect; Things which gender to Strife, &amp; not to that <hi>Charity which is the End of the Commandment,</hi> nor to the promoting <hi>the wholſome Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs,</hi> (1 Tim. 6.3.) But I hope there is none of ſuch a Character here, I believe we could all ſpeak with the late Rev. Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> (who whatever his Opinions might otherwiſe be, herein ſpake as became a Man, a Chriſtian, and a Champion for the religious Liberties of the Proteſtant Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi>) <q rend="margQuotes">As the holy Scriptures (ſays he) are the only Rule in Matters of Religion, ſo Men ſhould not pretend to impoſe their Notions upon other.—And this Liberty let others tamely give up as they pleaſe, I do and will inſiſt upon it for my ſelf, as a reaſonable Creature, a Chriſtian, a Proteſtant, and a Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As I pretend not to impoſe on others, ſo nor will I in this Caſe be impoſed on by others. No King, no Parliament, no Church, no Council, no Synod, no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Bodies of Miniſters, no Man or Body of Men, ſhall be acknowledged by me to have any ſuch Power or rightful Authority over me. They may deprive me of my civil Liberty, of my Eſtate, or of my Life, but this Liberty by the Grace of God they ſhall never deprive me of; to think &amp; ſpeak of the Matters of God &amp; Religion only in that Manner in which I apprehend they are ſpoken of in the holy Scriptures by God himſelf. Tell me not what <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> or <hi>Arius,</hi> what the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> or <hi>Remini</hi> have ſaid, but what Chriſt, and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> have ſaid. I call no Man Maſter on Earth.</q> After theſe Authorities let us all perſwade Men to be reconciled to God.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005125_0028_1016ADE252301CD8"/>
            <p n="4">4. Let me beg your Patience while I bring Home the Doctrine of the Text to all the chriſtian People here preſent. To you our Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be Chriſtians. Own by your Actions as well as Words that Chriſt is your Maſter. Bow your own Underſtandings and Conſciences to him. And give your Brethren the ſame Liberty of underſtanding God's Word, and worſhipping him that you claim for your ſelves. Let their Conſciences determine their Duty, to their Father &amp; Lord. Never run into that ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sort of Pride, of curſing all Men but yourſelves, or treating with a ſurly Superiority thoſe who cannot come to your Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all Things. Where you think any miſtaken, in Meekneſs inſtruct them. Debate without Anger. Be ready to receive as well as give Light. Deny your Communion in chriſtian Priviledges to none to whom you have not Reaſon to think Chriſt will deny the Glory of God. And always ſeek your own Faith and Practice from our only Maſter. After all Helps and Advantages let him have the caſting Vote. This is the Duty of all as we have but one Father and one Maſter; but eſpecially becoming the Poſterity of thoſe who firſt broke off from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the higheſt humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, that they (as they profeſſed) might be ſubject to none but Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And ſurely every Proteſtant here is of the Opinion of the famous Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> (who was, I think, himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from a popiſh Prieſt) <q rend="margQuotes">By the Religion of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (ſays he) I do not underſtand the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melancthon,</hi> nor the Confeſſion or <hi>Auguſta,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor the Catechiſm of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> nor the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no nor the Harmony of proteſtant Confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with greater Harmony, as a prefect Rule of their Faith and Actions, that is, the Bible. The Bible, I ſay, the Bible only is the Religion of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; whatſoever elſe they believe beſides it and the plain irrefragable indubitable Conſequences of it, well may they hold it as Matter of Opinion, but as Matter of Faith and Religion, neither can they with Coherence to their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005125_0029_1016ADE53605E908"/>own Grounds believe it themſelves, nor require the Belief of it of others, without moſt high and ſchiſmatical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. I, for my Part, after a long (&amp; as I verily believe and hope) impartial Search of the true Way to eternal Happineſs, do profeſs plainly, That I cannot find any Reſt for the Sole of my Foot, but upon this Rock only. I ſee plainly, and with my own Eyes, that there are Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popes, Councils againſt Councils, ſome Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, the ſame Fathers againſt themſelves, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Fathers of one Age againſt the Conſent of Fathers of another Age, the Church of one Age againſt the Church of another Age. Traditive Interpretations of Scripture are pretended, but few or none are found. No Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but only of Scripture can derive itſelf from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but may be plainly proved to be bro't in in ſuch an Age after Chriſt, or that ſuch an Age it was not in. In a Word, There is no ſufficient Certainty but of Scripture, for any conſidering Man to build upon. This therefore and this only I have Reaſon to believe. This I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, according to this I will live, and for this, if there be Occaſion, I will not only willingly but even gladly looſe my Life, tho' I ſhould be ſorry Chriſtians ſhould take it away from me. Propoſe me any Thing out of this Book, and require whether I believe it or no; and ſeem it never ſo incomprehenſible to humane Reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it with Hand and Heart, as knowing no Demonſtration can be ſtronger than this; God hath ſaid ſo, therefore it is true. In other Things I will take no Man's Liberty of judging from him, neither ſhall any Man take mine from me. I will think no Man the worſe Man, nor the worſe Chriſtian; I will love no Man the leſs for differing in Opinion from me. And what Meaſure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully aſſured that God does not, and therefore Men ought not, to require any more of any Man than this, to believe the Scriptures to be God's Word, to endeavour to find the true Senſe of it, and to live according to it.</q> And this noble Foundation, Brethren, let us be ever united on.</p>

            <p>But I muſt not leave this Subject without a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application, to the Church and Congregation at whoſe Deſire we are now aſſembled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> We in Charity believe, that it is with ſincere Hearts you attend the Solemnity of this Day. That you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally think, that one of the Gifts which our lord, when he aſcended on high, gave to Men, was that of Paſtors; for the convincing of Sinners, the perfecting the Saints, and edifying his Body. Wherefore remember that he, for whoſe ſolemn Separation to the Miniſtry we are now met, is a Gift of our aſcended Lord, and a Servant of him our heavenly Maſter. Therefore as you are to call no Man Father on the Earth, you are to regard him no longer than he does his Maſter's Work, but to compare what he ſays and does with his Maſter's Orders.</p>
            <p>But then, Be ye not called <hi>Rabbies.</hi> Set not your ſelves up in Chriſt's Place. So long as he is faithful in Chriſt's Service, remember our Lord's own Words, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke 10.16.</note> You muſt remember that our common Maſter hath ſent him, and your due Regard to him in the Adminiſtration of his Office, is but Part of your Obedience to Chriſt. Wherefore whatever he declares agreable to his Maſter's Will, receive it as tho' Chriſt ſpoke to you. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the Difficulties of your Souls, and meekly receive his Advices, when agreable to the Goſpel; they are the Advices of his Maſter by him. Don't give him Occaſion for that ſad Report to his Maſter, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our Report.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 10.16.</note> Treat him not with Pride and Contempt; he is the Ambaſſador of the King of Kings. Never fault his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, 'till you find your Ground in the Revelations and Laws of our common Maſter. As he is not your Maſter, ſo neither are you his. One is our Maſter ever Chriſt, and all we are Brethren. Shew him that Meekneſs and Love which our Maſter did to his Diſciples, and do it for our Maſter's ſake. Pray for him without ceaſing to the Maſter of the Houſe, that he may be a wiſe Steward of the Myſteries
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005125_0031_1016ADE928A21980"/>of God. That he may come in and out before you, in the Fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Peace, and always have with him the Preſence of him who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, and who has ſaid to his faithful Servants, <hi>Lo I am with you always to the End of the World.</hi> This is the Way wherein you may expect that our Maſter in Heaven will bleſs you, and in a good Meaſure make up to you the heavy Loſs you underwent, when he took your late Paſtor from your Head, to receive the Reward of his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and that he will receive him who is now to be your Paſtor, to eternal Happineſs in his own Time, with a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of you for his Glory and Joy.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Laſtly, Dear Brother,</hi> Let me exhort you to lay up theſe divine Inſtructions. We hope you have ſeriouſly and prayerfully reflected on the high and holy Nature of the Buſineſs you are engaging in, that it is the Service of the one only Maſter of Chriſtians; that therefore you do not vainly and prophanely imagine, it an Office wherein you are only to enjoy ſome temporal Revenues, be careſſed by the People, and indulge your ſelf in Sloth and Idleneſs, or tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their Conſciences; nor yet an Office wherein you are to become a Slave to every one's Humour and Notions. The Tho't of this Subject will, by God's Grace, have a good Influence upon you, in both theſe Regards. Realize that the Father of Spirits has a Right to direct you in the Uſe of your Underſtanding, that Chriſt your Maſter has a juſt Title to all your Service. Wherefore be ſubject to the Father of Spirits only. Believe nothing but what you have rational Evidence of. Teach nothing but what you think Truth, and the Truth of Chriſt, tho' you ſhould have all Mankind affirming it. Your Soul being impreſſed with a Senſe of the Authority of your heavenly Father, this will engage you to Diligence in improving every Power thereof, in ſearching his Will; it will prevent your ſubſcribing to the Authority of any meer Man; it will engage you to deliver to your People, his Doctrine, and his alone; it will engage you to be always getting Knowledge, and therefore readily hearkening to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, receiving Light, and under God, gaining by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations and Writings of the Wiſe, Learned, and Pious.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005125_0032_1016ADF1EBFA1A38"/>But farther, <hi>Brother,</hi> At all Times by a firm Faith, view our aſcended Maſter on a Throne of Glory, from thence giving to all his Servants their reſpective Buſineſs: Realize it that it is he ſends you here, and he does it that you may in his Stead perſwade Men to be reconciled to God, &amp; edify his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their moſt holy Faith. Realize what a Maſter you have.</p>
            <p>This well conſidered will influence you, to Humility and Faithfulneſs, to Diligence and Zeal, it will ſtrengthen you againſt Diſcouragements, and extend your Views beyond the Vanities of Time and Senſe. It will move you to preach his Doctrines, Laws, and Motives at all Times, and his only. —To give ſuch Advices to his People at all Times and in all Caſes, as his Word directs to — To ſtand up for the Order and Ordinances of the Goſpel (according to your Station) againſt all Invaſions. — To treat your People as Brethren in Chriſt — To Humility of Conduct. Eſpecially in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Souls, the Conſideration that the Office of an Adviſer and Guide is committed to you by a Maſter in Heaven, to whom you are to give Account; will make you tender and compaſſionate, bearing them on your Heart at all Times at the Throne of Grace; giving them Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept. For what a Maſter is it you ſerve? A Maſter who takes exact Cognizance of your Behaviour, and will call you to Account therefor. A Maſter from whoſe gracious Mouth thoſe Words proceeded, <hi>If any Man ſerve me let him follow me, and where I am there ſhall alſo my Servant be; If any Man ſerve me, him will my Father honour,</hi> Joh. 12.26. You have a Maſter in Heaven whom you are to ſerve; and if you are to ſerve, you are to follow him. Wherefore always bear in mind the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of your Maſter, which ought to have the Force of a Law with you, O how amiable is it, how engaging ought it to be to all his Miniſters! <hi>He came not to be miniſtred to but to miniſter, and to give his Life a Ranſom for many,</hi> Mark 10.45. <hi>He brake not the bruiſed Reed, nor quenched the ſmoaking Flax.</hi> If you regard him you will be far from deſiring to be a Rabbi or Maſter. You will eſteem it your higheſt Glory, to be doing Good; you will be (as I may ſay) in your Element, when you are impreſſing upon Men the Doctrines and Motives of the Chriſtian Life, to their Progreſs in every Grace. This will as it were force you to be his Servant. To ſubmit to any Service when the Good of Souls requires it. Hereby alſo
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005125_0033_1016ADF3B6796770"/>you gain divine Approbation, <hi>For he that is greateſt among you ſhall be your Servant.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Brother,</hi> Pray to God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, that all theſe Arguments may be laſtingly ſet home upon your Soul. Let the Authority of your Father in Heaven and exalted Lord, the Honour of your great Maſter, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Example, an awful Senſe of the laſt Account to be given to him, and the Glories of his Preſence which you hope for, perſwade you to be the faithful Servant of Chriſt. To him look up for promiſed Help; to his Honour let all your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be dedicated; to him keep your Eye for the Reward of a ſtedfaſt Adherence to his Goſpel. For remember, and let his Example conſtrain you, that Jeſus himſelf, <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down at the right Hand of the Throne of God,</hi> Heb. 12.2. There if you continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, under all the Labours, the Diſcouragements and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of this Office, you may expect one Day to ſee him, for I will again repeat our Saviours Words, <hi>If any Man ſerve me let him follow me, and where I am there ſhall my Servant be.</hi> If you are faithful to him and the Intereſts of immortal Souls, you may with a humble Confidence expect that bleſſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> Math. 25.21.</p>
            <p>Thus, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, I have delivered what I think contained in the cautioning Words of our Saviour. It had doubtleſs more moved our Affections, to have meditated on the Duties of the paſtoral Office which more intimately concern Souls, ſuch as their Love and Care of them, but then we muſt remember that every Advice of Chriſt ſhould be weighed by us and practiced upon, and if we view the State of Religion among us on every Side, perhaps the Subject we have been upon is very uſeful to direct at this Day.</p>
            <p>I conclude all with the Exhortation of the Apoſtle Jude, <hi>Ye Beloved, building up your Selves in your moſt holy Faith, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the Love of God, looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal Life.— Now unto him that is able to keep you from Falling, and to preſent you faultleſs before the Preſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy; to the only wiſe God our Saviour, be Glory and Majeſty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever,</hi> AMEN.</p>
