            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>Dear husband I have preserved the lives of a worthy pair by the savings of my frugality; I have rescued the husband from want, the wife from sickness,—accept this offering as a birth-day tribute!</q>
— And must the story be disclosed?—ah, I feel that the enjoyment of a good action is annihilated the moment that action becomes known: if another praise thee,—there is an end of thy reward;

Smith calls him his friend and fellow countryman. But I, one day saw them together upon the stairs, when Smith had his hat on, and the other, with his in his hand was bowing to him very respectfully. This struck me, and I stopped to observe them; but they immediately perceived me, appeared embarrassed, and the tone of equality was instantly resumed, though evidently with some degree of restraint; soon after which they shook hands and parted.</p>

                     <p>Secretary Allbrand, even if this story, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure of which you seem to find so much gratification, were true, why relate it to me? how does it concern me? what purpose do you hope to make it answer to yourself? For two years, I have been united to Morland; he has studied incessantly to promote my happiness; I have no wish unsatisfied; and what passed prior to our union, is indifferent to me; If my husband was once wild, I esteem myself the more fortunate that such courses are now entirely abandoned by him. Above all things, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the malignity that would trace back the life of a man even to his cradle, to enumerate how many times in his childhood his mother was constrained to use the rod. In short, Sir, I will hear no more! To preserve domestic harmony, and spare my husband some hours of painful chagrin, I have hitherto been silent; but be assured, the next time that a similar expression shall escape your lips, all shall be revealed, whatever may be the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

                     <p>I am not surprised at that, and, viewed in this light, Emilia has certainly been wrong in the secrecy she has observed. She ought to have told you the story herself, lest it might perchance reach your ears from some other quarter, when it would be served up, adorned with all the pretty circumstances, with which rumour delights to garnish such dishes.</p>

                     <p>Must I remind a man who knows the world so well, that a good action is often forgotten in twenty-four hours, while a tale of calumny is scarcely ever wholly laid asleep, even when its victim rests in the grave.</p>

                     <p>To speak in plain terms;—for as you could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly unravel this aegnima, yourself, I must, for once, allow my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to say more than I usually do. In my early years I was a courtier, but the court is not my element; fortunately for me I became acquainted with John Howard, who taught me to be a man. Peace to his ashes! Many an infirmary, many a prison have we examined together; and by this intercourse my mind was gradually strengthened and enlightened. When he quitted England for the laudable purpose of extending his benevolence to the whole race of mankind, I attached myself to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. With him I have explored the interior of Africa, and visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Abyssinia, though not, like Bruce, drank to the health of a Prince whose dominions lay somewhere about the source of the Nile. My concern was rather with the sources of good and ill in the heart of man—the sources whence might flow happiness in life, and composure in death.</p>

                     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus much I have ascertained—That under the palm-tree of Negroland, as under the oak of Germany, domestic peace, and domestic comforts, are, if not the only, at least the prime sources, of mortal happiness.</p>

And were you obliged to explore the interior of Africa to ascertain that?</p>

                     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                     <p>What lies direclly before our eyes, is often sought at the greatest distance. Every spreading tree that we behold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to enjoy peace and serenity beneath its shade; but we pass it by, and only hope to taste repose beyond the grave.</p>

                     <p>You are right. This has long been my wish, and at length I hope the object is attainable. For four years past, I have been in search of a good wife.</p>

                     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis possible,—but I have seen so much of the world, that I have become suspicious—this is the worst effect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. My feelings are like those of a connesseur in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who, amid a magnificent groupe of figures, should pass over the most prominent with contempt, and gaze with delight and astonishment at one, which to the eyes of common observers, appeared lost in the superior grandeur of the rest. Believe me, Mr. Morland, it is a true, but melancholly observation, that our sensibilities to the joys of life, evaporate as the transient dew-drops upon the rose.</p>

                     <p>Then, a prudent man should endeavor the more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to cherish them, while a last fleeting drop still remains.</p>

                     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                     <p>Such is my determination. My pilgrimage is at an end; I am arrived at my goal.—Jenny has won my whole soul, she is the single drop I wish to cherish. Her form is lovely— her mind far superior—her understanding is cultivated, while her heart remains true to nature;—She is charitable and benevolent, without knowing it—witty, without intending it. She never concerns herself with the affairs of others, nor scans the fashion of her neighbor's new gown or cap, to turn them into ridicule. She endeavours to exculpate all who are guilty only of weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and never condemns in severe terms even the most palpable criminality. Above all things, she possesses that richest of all treasures, an equanimity of temper which is the same yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, and forever. Oh! what an infinite source of happiness is idcluded in that one quality!</p>

                     <p>Nor can there be a better medium for forming an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; provided the mind will use it,—nor merely the eye. I will venture to assest, that a tolerably accurate opinion may always be formed of a woman, only by attentively observing her behaviour at the theatre.</p>

                     <p>I mean, supposing the piece to be such as affords suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for observation. For instance, if a woman be looking around at the company, when Philip is engaged in conversation with Posa, I can immediately measure the extent of her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. If at the lamentations of the mother in Iffland's Forest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or at the story of Just's spaniel,—a woman's eyes remain dry; it gives me an immediate insight into her heart.</p>

                     <speaker>Morland.</speaker>
                     <p>And Jenny was accidentally so fortunate—</p>

                     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                     <p>Accidentally!—Jenny, was still Jenny. She never came to see and be seen, but always sat in the corner of her box absorbed in attention to the piece. Her smiles and tears were not ostentatiously displayed, but lost in her muff; she never clapped, but appeared uneasy when any fine passage was interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the clapping of others. This made me observant—I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued my observations for some months—I found that these were not the mere impulses of the moment, but the settled feelings of her heart; and I resolved to become acquainted with her.— Where, and in what manner to procure an introduction to this fair incognita, then became the question?—Should I seek to dazzle the imagination of my future wife with the prospect of rank and fortune?—No! never! never!—If the humble Edward Smith could not win her affections; I resolved that her hand should never be given to the rich Lord Sidney. I heard that you were in want of a clerk; I offered my services,—my plan suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded—they were accepted. Under this disguise I have for two

months secretly watched every thought, every action, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object—I have observed her, under circumstances when even the slightest veil that conceals the feelings of the soul, is thrown aside; and my reason is now satisfied;—it has permitted my heart to speak.</p>

                  <p>Never trust any one!—not even a wife!—Alas! is this all that can be learnt by travelling the world over—that no man is to be trusted!—better be sometimes deceived, than live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant suspicion!—I cannot do that—my heart revolts against it! —Emilia, it is well that the Briton has somewhat dissipated my thoughts!—yet they will recur to one fatal subject—Oh All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand! Allbrand! thou hast placed a worm in my bosom which gnaws my very vitals!—Shall I, without reserve, impart all my torments to Emilia?—that perhaps were best!—A husband or wife cannot guard too cautiously against suffering aught to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within their bosoms, that may at least burst forth into an unquenchable flame. Yet, to-day, I never can assume sufficient fortitude to mention the subject—at least not now—in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps, when all business is over, and the twilight of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic peace may succeed a day of storms—</p>

                     <p>You have disseminated principles—</p>

                     <speaker>Ellfield.</speaker>
                     <p>I desirbe to be judged by my actions: my crippled limbs bear ample testimony, that I have fulfilled my duty.— Yet, I would not shrink from an investigation of my principles. May I ask your excellency of what I am accused?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ellfield.</speaker>
                     <p>Could my colonel be guilty of conduct so dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to make a private conversation the subject of an official report?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Minister.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ellfield.</speaker>
                     <p>Experience informs me—alas! too late.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Minister.</speaker>
                     <p>You would have acted more prudently in times like the present, when all the bonds that unite society are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, not to trust too implicitly to those of friendship. I wish you a good morning, Sir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ellfield.</speaker>
                     <p>Your excellency has at least laid down a doctrine, whence, bitter as it is, I might draw an inference that would furnish me some consolation, amid the agonies of disappointed hope; for when all other bonds are relaxed, why is that to be regarded which would force us to live? and, of what value is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037751_0034_100F00D4291AA8C8"/>
life to one bowed to the earth by corporeal and mental suffering? Yes, with my one remaining arm I should certainly discharge a pistol through that head which has been the undersigned cause of my misfortune; did not an unfortunate being, who in my happier days united her fate with mine, look to me alone for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and support.—But I dare not leave a helpless wife, a prey to hunger and despair!—However reluctant I may be therefore to solicit farther; I must still entreat your excellency to grant me some trifling pension, that may preserve us from the extremity of want. Do not suppose this hat, shot through in so many places, is worn from ostentation—believe me, I have no other. My sword, and a heart glowing with love for my native country, is all the wealth fate has left me.</p>

                     <p>Necessity.—Your Excellency well knows, how small is the productive, how great is the consuming trade about a court. Our inland manufactures are little encouraged; they are almost entirely superseded by the English.—A thousand ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid streams flow out of this city,—one little rivulet alone flows into it.

                     <p>I know, must be considered;—nor are the citizens insensible to the convulsion that shakes all Europe; but they know also that we inhabit a happy corner of the earth, which nature, united with the wisdom of its rulers, have preserved from these convulsions; and they hope—</p>

                     <p>Last night, as I was upon duty, patrolling about the streets, I saw a well dressed woman, followed by a maid, with a bundle under her arm, steal softly across the castle square.— She looked anxiously round her, several times, while I thought within myself, who can this be?—when she came to the well, she stopped and hemmed three or four times; and in a few
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037751_0043_100F00E7A94C0968"/>
moments the house door, at No. 312, was opened, and she entered. I remained wandering about the square for more than an hour,—to be sure the time seemed a little tedious, but at last the door opened again, and the lady came out;—she was attended to the door by a man, of whom she took leave very kindly, promissing to visit him again the next night.— With that she tripped hastily away; and I stole softly after her, till she reached her own house.—And now, whom do you think she might be?</p>

                     <p>Mad! Not a bit of it! I'll consent to live upon bread and water, for a month, if it was any body else. She at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to unlock the garden-door, and as it was dark put aside her veil, to find the key-hole more readily. I took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of throwing the light of my dark-lantern directly in her face, and saw her too plainly to be mistaken.</p>

                     <p>I fetched the constable immediately, and he says, that the house belongs to an old woman, and up in the garret lives one captain Ellfield, who I suppose was the person that let her in and attended her out.</p>

                     <p>I can plead frequent observations of the fact, in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my assertion. Two young people fall desperately in love with each other, and think they never can exist asunder;—a head-strong father, or a cross guardian interposes, and thwarts their wishes:—the young people sigh and pine—and pine and sigh—till at length the old people's hearts are melted. Then the lovers fancy they stand upon the highest pinnacle of fortune's temple, and clasped in each other's arms, look down with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference on every object, in the busy world around them; they rush forward into wedlock, as the night-walker to the lowest edge of the sloping roof, when suddenly some one calls, they start, they wake, and down they fall.</p>

                     <p>And there lie the poor souls, stretched in the mire of <hi>ennui,</hi> exchanging looks of discontent with each other. If, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they be at bottom, people of sense and worth; powerful habit, after a while, will come to their assistance; till at length,

they will learn to endure each other's foibles with patience;— and each will jog on contentedly along the paved foot-path, to which his steps must be confined; thankful if no thorns spring up to obstruct and wound him as he proceeds.</p>

Love ties two beings together;—wedlock makes them only one. Love drinks down large draughts from the cup of joy;—wedlock sips up the sweets, a drop at a time; nor finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them till arrived at the very brink of the grave. Love is a caterpillar, devouring dainties;—wedlock, the same caterpillar, transformed into a butterfly, when it feeds only upon the purer nourishment of the fragrance exhaled by flowers. Years roll on; but a good wife never becomes old;—winter succeeds to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but wedded happiness never chills. The kiss of a chaste wife, is the stamp with which nature seals her choicest blessings; —storms roar above; lightning flashes around; but where domestic love dwells, every trouble, every sorrow, is but half felt —every joy, every pleasure, is doubled.</p>

Woe to that man who would remain cold and insensible, while descanting on female beauty and virtue!—who would drink out of the same cup with him?—Woe to the man who pays no more respect to a good wife, than to his night gown; but because she administers daily, nay hourly, to his comfort, receives her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions without one grateful feeling; and only learns to prize domestic happiness, when lost forever!—Let thy crowns, O Chance! be scattered about like flakes of snow; I would not catch at one;—I only ask thee to bestow upon me, the simple garland of love!
<stage>(he draws his chair still nearer)</stage>
— Should I at length find what I have, so many years sought—find my hopes, my wishes, realized—then farewel, ye petty tyrants of the mind, ambition, thirst of fame, ardour to obtain the palm of wit!—my heart shall have no room for any guest but love. The sweet calm of domestic peace, firm union of souls, a taste for the joys of nature, love for the unempoisoned air of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for rural pastimes, for the pleasures of retirement, where we may live remote from envy and calumny—from—</p>

That I love, is no dream;—but that I flatter myself with my love being returned, in equal portion, may perhaps be the mere effect of a presumptuous vision. For the first time in my life, I feel my happiness dependent upon the favour of others; and, for the first time in my life, I tremble.

                  <p>Music will charm your mind to peace—I will endeavour to soothe mine by benevolence;—at poor Ellfield's I may perhaps forget, what occasions me so much anxiety. And shall I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain without Morland's knowledge?—better at once tell him all! —but then, the pleasure of presenting my patients to him, on his birth day, would be lost!—besides, at the present moment, it might appear obtrusive.—Hist! I thought I heard my name mentioned in the study!—Yet, what concern can my name have with business?—Shall I?—No! shame on the idea!—far be from me the meanness of listening. But now, I dare not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt speaking to my husband, since it will immediately appear as if I <hi>had</hi> listened. And why should I be so desirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the affair at this moment?—I shall not be missed,— and if I am, he knows me!—yet the discovery shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed beyond to-morrow!—all secrecy is pernicious; and I blame myself for having given way to it. I must take a short time to recover myself; and then I will go.—Heaven grant, that when I see Morland, to-morrow, he may be more composed!</p>

                     <p>I should like to know, how the good night is to come, when he has shut an honest man up in prison?—For my part I hav'n't had any concern in it,—but what does that signify?—I know for certain, that I shan't close my eyes all night. Poor dear gentleman! how terribly he looks!—Take heart, noble Syndicus, bad weather will overtake those that are going to church as well as them that are running to the alehouse, but where the heart and conscience are warm, the clothes are soon dried.— Alack-a-day! he neither sees nor hears me!—Truly, I am only the simple wife of a poor citizen, and I don't know how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort such a learned gentleman.

by seeking intelligence at the fountain-head. I was like one thunderstruck:—of the true motives for this proceeding, I could not entertain a doubt; but I had no conception of the pretext that would be urged to sanction it.</p>

their sacrifice—yet still, she has a heart!—Shame may, for a while, be silenced and put to flight; but, at length, it will return, strew the bed of roses with thorns, and change the smile of passion into convulsive distortions. Then will busy recollection reproach her, that for two years her love had been my all—that my heart, my life, had been devoted to the promotion of her happiness—that I had sacrificed every thing to my love—had known no joy without her—no sorrow when she was by my side! —Oh-h-h!</p>

Yes, I must speak. —My dearest Madam, many a book may be found in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, though shabby to the eye from being uncut and unbound, will by its innate worth attract attention from the man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, though it may be scorned by the coxcomb on account of its homely garb. Such a book is Honesty in the heart of a citizen, and Innocence in a plain coat; both are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Is that, any source of consolation to me?</p>

                     <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                     <p>By no means—I rather made the observation, to prove that your brother is lost, because, though his virtue is of sterling worth, the buckles in his shoes are not of equal value.—With Courtiers, the case is the very reverse.</p>

You think me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, cold, unfeeling to your distress—but you mistake—I am only composed through habit—because I have witnessed the like an hundred times.

                     <p>To justify that appellation, I will begin with relating a story. In the course of my rambles, I once came to a small town, the romantic situation of which charmed me, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

for several weeks fixed to the spot. It was surrounded by a chain of hills, at whose foot meandered a beautiful stream; and these were my daily haunt. One evening I had stayed out very late, and was wandering solitarily homewards, by twilight, along the water-side, when suddenly I saw and heard, among the trees, a female form, wringing her hands violently, and uttering deep sighs and groans, as she staggered backwards and forwards, to the brink of the river. Curiosity induced me to conceal myself that I might observe her farther; and, in a few moments, I saw her plunge into the stream. I am a good swimmer; I sprung in after her, and was fortunate enough so save her life: yet she did not thank me for—What think you, young gentleman, of the privy chamber?—what reason do you suppose she gave for this attempt at self-destruction?</p>

Of these, a young man, a student here, sought to beguile me: but failing in his attempt, he had recourse to a most cruel revenge. He traduced my character in all companies; till at length, wherever I went, the neighbors pointed at me with their fingers; my former friends looked askance at me; and worse than all, my lover, an honest mechanic—oh, terrible to think on! desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I could not support myself against such undeserved ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, I was driven to despair, and I resolved to put an end to my life." You do not seem well, sir?</p>

Right! and like that unfortunate girl you have plunged into a rushing stream, whence I may perhaps equally succeed in rescuing you. Young man, that dreadful example ought to have served you as a warning; under its influence you made me a solemn promise to subdue your fatal propensity to calumny: but ask your heart how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully that promise has been kept. Though all who have become sacrifices to your tongue, may not have made like attempts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their lives, yet who can tell how many a bitter tear has been shed in secret, of which you only were the cause: how much domestic happiness may have been destroyed by one word alone, perhaps carelessly uttered by you. The ears of mankind are
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037751_0108_100F016C32D9B728"/>
always open for the reception of slander, but are often inflexibly closed against all attempts at its refutation: a hint is easily given, but its effects cannot easily be calculated: a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less word trips lightly over the tongue; but it cannot be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Almighty himself.</p>

You might be splendid by virtue: and you only glitter by rank: You might enlighten from merit, and you only dazzle with wit. Your heart would gain you friends, but they are repulsed by your head: you might attract love, and you only coquet with fear. To slander a worthy man, who is peaceably following his own pursuits, is no less base, than to murder one who sleeps: and to re-establish the character of the undeserved victim of calumny, is a task scarcely less difficult, than to smooth over scars of the small-pox.</p>

                     <p>This man, his accuser!—My Lord Count, before one word shall pass those impure lips, I entreat you to hear me!— Secretary Allbrand was a daily guest at Morland's, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as his bosom friend. He has shared those moments when wine encreases the circulation of the blood, and when an ardent feeling will often burst out in unguarded wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to know, he has availed himself of the unreserved moments of social mirth, to ruin the man he pretended to love,—he has watched every turn of conversation at table, and dipping his pen in gall, noted down any innocent piece of humour uttered by his honest host, to make use of it as opportunity should offer for trampling him under foot, and ingratiating himself with the court. Count Scharfeneck surely will not listen to such an accuser.—When a man of honor is called to account, a man of honor alone should be heard against him.</p>

Morland's house is a school of morals, his table the rendezvous of innocent cheerfulness—his jokes never wound—his serious conversation is full of instruction, and no captious expression ever escapes his lips. Love for the town he inhabits, affection for the Prince, and respect for my uncle, reign in his bosom. As such I know him: and whoever represents him otherwise, were it my uncle himself, I would say that be misrepresents him and deserves correction.</p>

would venture to pledge my life that they contain nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. But Mr. Morland is a philosopher and a poet: and in the course of philosophical investigation, or in the composition of poetry, things are often hastily written, which were never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for any other eye than the writer's. A random line may condemn a man, only for want of being considered in connexion with the context—the writing-desk is a friend to whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide every effusion of the heart, or imagination—has any one a right to put this friend to the rack? or if he possessed it, would he avail himself of the right?</p>

The delirium attendant upon my disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, deprived me for two months of all sense of our sorrows: and I had sunk unknown, unnoticed, into the grave, had not an accident conducted a lady, a total stranger to us, into our garret. To her benevolence alone, am I indebted for my recovery: she attended me with the affection of a sister: her purse, her heart, were ours: yet she kept her name in concealment: nor knew we till yesterday, when a villainous accident revealed it to us.—

                     <p>Sir, you forget yourself!—of what concern can Morland's domestic quarrels be to me?—it is well known, that his wife was formerly in a certain predicament with the Prince— this he has perhaps now first discovered—perhaps he supposes that the connection still continues—for my part, I neither do, nor will, know any thing of the matter.</p>

                     <p>He himself sought to obtain her favours—and would have influenced our poverty to promote his suit. A pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for my husband was the promised reward of our infamy:— but failing in his attempt, his mean soul was resolved on ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
