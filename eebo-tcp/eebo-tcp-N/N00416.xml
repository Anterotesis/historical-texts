            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

However, as to the general state of Infants, and other adult Persons deaf or dumb, and deprived of these common outward helps given to others, the particular way, method and manner of God towards them is a great secret; it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, that God disposeth of them in Mercy, and doth not destroy any without sin, not only actually committed, but finally and impenitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persisted in, and rejecting the Remedy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  </gap> Infants may be saved by the working of the Spirit in them, why may not the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be so, by giving obedience to the Light in them?</hi> And thus ye would make me appear to the <hi>ignorant</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:000515_0134_0FA6A9CD4CA5EA40"/>
as if I did plead, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were of could be saved without faith in Christ, and the regenerating Spirit of Christ, only by obedience to the general dictates of the Light within; but I say, though none are saved, but who are obedient to the Light in them, yet no Obedience can save, without faith in Christ, and the Spirit of Christ regenerating them, that is altogether necessary to every mans eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>Whereas I produced divers very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Arguments to prove, That the Light in men that did accuse or reprove for sin, could not be some natural faculty of mans Soul; these Arguments some of them ye pass over very slightly, answering by your bare Affirmations, without proof, and some ye give no answer unto at all, nor take any notice of, see my Book, p. 119, 120, 121. which I again recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Readers serious consideration. I argued, That since ye confess, <hi>that man is wholly defiled and darkned, so that he is called Darkness in Scripture,</hi> therefore the Light in natural men could not be any part or faculty of their Souls; for that were to say, Men are not fallen totally, nor totally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is improper to prefer that which is writ or printed on Paper by the labour and work of Men, to that which by God immediately is printed on mens hearts and souls, without the work of men.

ye are guilty of it, and not I; for I doubt not but that I can well defend all my Sayings to be well consistent one with another. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that I readily grant unto you, yea, and plead for it, as much as any, that the <hi>first Administration</hi> of Christ and God, in mens hearts, is weak, and is not sufficient of it self to justifie and save with eternal Salvation, and to give eternal Life, without the <hi>second,</hi> that is to follow, which giveth faith in Christ, as come in the flesh, dead and raised again, and more abundant Grace that doth accompany that Faith and Knowledge of Christ, as such, yet all this nothing serveth your turn in the least; for we never asserted the sufficiency of the <hi>first Manifestation</hi> &amp; <hi>Ministration of Christ</hi> in mens hearts, as alone &amp; without the <hi>second;</hi> but as relative unto it, and as regarding it as the end of the first. And yet we still affirm, that God and Christ is at work in all men, in a day of Visitation, in order to save them, and God and Christ are sufficient to begin and carry on the work. And though <hi>Paul</hi> call the Law <hi>weak,</hi> yet it is to be considered, that he calleth it not so absolutely, or of it self, but weak through the flesh, because the flesh or nature of man is weak to fulfill it, until Christ be revealed in the second Ministration of him, to fulfill the Righteousness of the Law; And if ye were not very partial, ye might have understood, by what I charged against you in

&amp; all true Believers are cloathed, not only with Christ imputed Righteousness, in respect of what he hath done and suffered for them, but with Christ himself, in-dwelling, living and ruling in their hearts, making them really holy and righteous; and this is a double cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto them, or as the Scarlet that is of a double Die, where with all the true Children of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from above, the Mother of all the faithful, are cloathed, so that they are not afraid of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And as ye bring no proof to contradict it, so the truth of what I say is manifest; for it is the Love of the Heart and Soul, as well as Faith, that qualifieth it to receive Christ, yea, Love doth most sweetly embrace Christ; for it is the nature of Love to embrace its beloved Object; the loving Parent embraceth the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Child, and the loving Child embracet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Your Answer hath no Validity, when ye say, <hi>They never had the work, of Conversion past upon them;</hi> but this is barely said: Why may not others, who have had some real beginning, like that of <hi>David,</hi> in some measure, fall into these Sins of Murder and Adultry? And surely, these who commit Murder and Adultry, whatever they have been before, may be numbred amongst the worst of men. They may say, according to your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>They had the work of Conversion wrought upon them formerly, and they are Saints still,</hi> and ye cannot convince them to the contrary by your Doctrine. I say still, it would argue great Partiality (which far be it from us to think it can have place in God) that one and the same Sin is Mortal in one, and not Mortal in the other; the pure Life of Faith is killed by every gross Sin or Crime, such as Murder and Adultry; for if he who hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Pag. 115. Ye grosly abuse me, by alledging, <hi>That I introduce the</hi> Popish <hi>distinction of</hi> Mortal <hi>and</hi> Venial Sins.

            <p>And thus I have gone through all the Heads contained in your Book, relating to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part, and have showed our agreement in every one of them, with the holy Scriptures, and also with famous Protestants, and Antient Writers, call'd <hi>Christian Fathers,</hi> except in that one matter of <hi>Infant Baptism,</hi> wherein if we differ from many of these called Antients in one thing, ye differ in another; for they generally judged it absolutely necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which ye, as well as I, judge an Error in them, and these called <hi>Baptists</hi> commonly, who may be judged as good Protestants as ye, deny your <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> as a humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet ye have no other: And if this doth not unchristian them, so nor can it us; and ye deny their baptizing into Water such, who have been baptized, when Infants; why then may ye not allow the same Charity to us, that ye, <abbr>

yea, and to such in all Professions, where the Head and Foundation is held, which is Christ? &amp; we have that Charity, that there is a sincere fort among all Professions, who belong to God and Christ, and tho' they have wrong Notions and Conceptions of some things belonging to <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> and have not a form of found words, in delivering some matters of Faith, which is a great hurt unto them, yet they have some true inward sence of Christian Truth and Doctrine, and their faith and sence may be partly sound, where their words, where by they express it may be very unsound; for many have a right sence and feeling of things, whereof they have not a right Elocution, Utterance and form of Speech, as in Naturals, so in Spirituals, as when Men taste Honey, and their taste of it is the same, yet they differ in the Names they give it, or in some subtile and curious Questions about the Nature of it, or the nature and manner of tasting it, that is not so very material. So men may have some real sence and experience of the workings of the holy Spirit, &amp; inward divine Revelations and Inspirations, that work and beget in them some measure of true Faith, Hope, Love, and other Christian Virtues, and yet by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Education, and wrong outward tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or ill wording of things, may give wrong Names to things, yet God forbid we should unchristian them, simply for a Mistake,

If it be a Duty to preach to us, is it not also a Duty, when ye are desired, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with us in private, at least before Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses? 2<hi>dly,</hi> Ye are guilty of another great Contradiction, <hi>That because I am a Heretick, and worse, ye must not dispute with me, but reject me;</hi> and now at last ye dispute with me in Print, that is a more open way of dispute, than by word of Mouth; or can ye find any ground in Scripture to warrant you to dispute with me in Print, and yet to forbid you to dispute with me by word of Mouth?</p>

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:000515_0212_0FA6AA18181EC630"/>
to have allowed the time of your Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to a publick Dispute. 2<hi>dly,</hi> If ye had given this Reason for your denyal at first, without all doubt a liberty could have been most readily procured unto you, from the then Government. 3<hi>dly,</hi> Many of the People took a sins greater liberty afterwards, not only to meet openly, without leave of your then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but to do a great deal more, &amp;c. But if it was unlawful to dispute with an <hi>Incorrigible Heretick,</hi> why do ye now insinuate, that had it not been for laying your selves obnoxious to the then Government, ye would have given me a publick Disputation with you? Surely ye do greatly forget your selves, to write such Contradictions. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye say, <hi>Ye knew none of your Hearers had any scruple about your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> But what then? Ye should be ready to give a Reason of your Hope to every one that asketh you, and to convince Gain-sayers, if they be out of the way, and ye in it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ye say, <hi>Ye knew there would be no holding of me to any Law or Rule of Disputation, partly because a</hi> Quaker, <hi>and partly by Reports of me, and that I would bring all to my Revelations, &amp;c.</hi> But who seeth not the weakness and shallewness of these Fig-leaf Reasons?

            <p>I defire the Reader to take notice, That what Testimonies of antient or latter Writers of good esteem among <hi>Protestants,</hi> I have cited in this Treatise, is not for want of sufficient proofs of Scripture Testimony, OR every head of difference betwixt our Opposers and us; for I have brought sufficient Testimonies of holy Scripture to confirm every one of these heads, as the judicious and impartial Reader may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in both my Treatises; but because these men who are our Opposers, thinking to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
