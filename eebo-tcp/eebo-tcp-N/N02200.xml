            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THE Commandment is here given in the moſt auguſt, authoritative and peremptory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002620_0007_0FDB14D0E72919C8"/>
               <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep.</hi> More Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commandment can't well be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fewer words.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, HERE is a ſpecial and moſt weighty <hi>reaſon</hi> annexed, to inforce the precept: <hi>for it is a ſign,</hi> &amp;c. It is great condeſcention and grace in God to us, to annex a reaſon to any of his Commands. His ſovereign Will is the higheſt reaſon. But there is much of Majeſty and much Grace in this reaſon: <hi>It is a ſign between me and you:</hi> And will God in very deed give us ſuch a ſign and token between Himſelf and us? will he in very deed deal ſo with man upon earth? And give a <hi>ſtanding</hi> ſign too <hi>thro' out all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of man on earth? O the favour and grace to duſt, while he humbles himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things that are above!</p>
            <p>BUT what is the Lord's Sabbath a ſign <hi>of</hi> thro' all our Generations? Why it ſignifies and lets us know 1. that he is <hi>the Lord:</hi> Lord of the world, Lord of our time, Lord of our lives; the great Proprietor and abſolute Diſpoſer of them. And 2. that he is the Lord <hi>our Sanctifier:</hi> that I am the Lord <hi>that doth ſanctify you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>how</hi> the Sabbath is a <hi>ſign</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> and why this is a <hi>reaſon</hi> for our keeping and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbath, is to be ſaid under the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,</hi> which are theſe two:
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Great GOD vehemently requires of us the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sabbath.</item>
                  <item>2. That it is a ſign between Him and us that He is the Lord our Sanctifier.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. D. <hi>THE Lord our God has moſt ſtrictly and vehemently required the Obſervation and keeping
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002620_0008_0FDB14D279253238"/>Sabbath. Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep.</hi> Words can't be ſtricter than theſe are. And in this manner the precept is always given: <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths, I am the Lord.</hi> Lev. 19.30 — I ſhall only obſerve to you how ſtrictly and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently this law of the Sabbath is inſiſted on <hi>thro' the whole Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. IT was a Law to man <hi>from the beginning of the world,</hi> and the <hi>firſt Law</hi> (and ſecond Bleſſing) that was given to man, even in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in his ſtate of <hi>innocence.</hi> For if man had never ſinned, yet there would for ever have remained to him the keeping of a Sabbath, every ſeventh day: As you read, Gen. 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Thus the heavens and the earth were finiſhed and all the hoſt of them, ond on the ſeventh day God ended his Work which he had made, and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made; and God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it, becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his work which he had created and made.</hi> So from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the world God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a weekly Sabbath, for the perpetual ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn praiſes of the <hi>Creator</hi> from the Sons of men. He ſanctified the <hi>Day,</hi> 
               <q>to be the ſpecial Time of <hi>their</hi> bleſſing Him and <hi>his</hi> bleſſing them.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. <hi>Patrick.</hi>
               </note> The ſeventh day was ordained <hi>a Univerſal and Everlaſting holy Feſtival</hi> from the Day wherein Man was created. This magnifies the Sabbath and makes it honourable, and ſacred for ever to us, that it was the <hi>firſt</hi> of God's Laws to man. Thus we keep <q>the <hi>Earths birth-day</hi>

               </q> And it leaves us no room to queſtion <hi>Adam</hi>'s keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>THIS ſolemn and <hi>early</hi> Injunction of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to man is a Circumſtance that puts great honour and dignity upon the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi> It was ordained for the ſpecial honour and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual worſhip of the Lord our Maker, immediatly upon the Creation of our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> and in their paradiſaic ſtate.</p>
            <p>WE read of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 8.10, 12. that <hi>he ſtaid yet other ſeven days, and again he ſent forth the Dove out of the Ark.</hi> It appears by this, ſays Bp. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that on the ſeventh day <hi>Noah</hi> expected a Bleſſing rather than on another day; it being the day devoted from the Beginning to religious ſervices.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE ſanctification of the Sabbath was <hi>one of the firſt things given in Commandment to Iſrael upon their leaving Egypt.</hi> God was now gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forming to himſelf a <hi>Church</hi> in the earth, and it was fitting and neceſſary to remember them of his <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon their ſetting out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Type of the everlaſting <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> They had it may be almoſt <hi>loſt</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Sabbaths in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at leaſt many of them; but <hi>Moſes</hi> is directed by God to mind them of it, and that not as a novel but an <hi>ancient</hi> thing. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. It was upon the firſt proviſion of <hi>Manna</hi> for the Camp of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> In the 4 <hi>and</hi> 5 <hi>verſes</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people ſhall gather a certain rate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; but on the ſixth day they ſhall prepare twice
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002620_0010_0FDB14D5B293C4E8"/>as much as on the other days:</hi> Accordingly, as we read on from the 22 <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter, on the ſixth day the people gathered twice as much bread, two Omers for one man; and the Rulers came and told Moſes: Then he ſaid unto them, This is that which the Lord hath ſaid, To morrow is the Reſt of the Holy Sabbath to the Lord; then ye ſhall not find it in the field; ſix days ye ſhall gather it, but on the ſeventh day (which is the Sabbath) in it there ſhall be none: See, for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath; therefore he giveth you on the ſixth day the bread of two days: Abide every man in his place, let no man go out on the Sabbath day. So the people reſted on the ſeventh day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU will eaſily obſerve from the whole of this paſſage, that it ſuppoſes the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> acquainted with the Law of the Sabbath. It was not now Inſtituted, but the Inſtitution was <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> and acted on; firſt <hi>by God</hi> in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the magnifying the Day to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a double portion of <hi>Manna</hi> falling (it is likely) on the ſixth day; and then <hi>by the People,</hi> they gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon the portion of two days.</p>
            <p>THIS was before the peoples arrival at <hi>Sinai,</hi> even upon their entring into the Wilderneſs; and it remained to them thro' it a laſting Sign and Miracle from heaven in honour of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. For if on any other day of the week they left of their <hi>manna</hi> till the morning <hi>it bred worms and ſtank,</hi> but it kept good and ſweet when they laid it up for the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>"THUS the Law of the Sabbath was given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the delivery of the Law from <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Day was kept before the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002620_0011_0FDB14D700774728"/>was given: the Inſtitution was <hi>before</hi> the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. THE Law of the Sabbath was <hi>one of the ten Words, the ten Commandments, given from Sinai,</hi> in that auguſt and fearful manner as you all know. On <hi>Sinai</hi> God repeated this his Law <hi>out of the midſt of the fire.</hi> God himſelf came down that day from Heaven with his mighty Angels; he came down in thick darkneſs and flames of devouring fire: <hi>Sinai was altogether in a ſmoke and the mountain quaked greatly;</hi> the Congregation below were ready to <hi>die</hi> with fear leſt the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſhould conſume them. <hi>Who of all fleſh,</hi> but <hi>they</hi> in that ſingular day, <hi>ever heard the voice of the living God ſpeaking out of the midſt of the fire and lived?</hi> In this manner did the great God give the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> unto his Church, that they ſhould <hi>remember</hi> it and <hi>keep</hi> it for ever, and not dare to forget it. Deu. 4.9, 10. <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thy eyes have ſeen, and leſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thy heart all the days of thy life; eſpecially the day that thou ſtoodeſt before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord ſaid unto me, Gather the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they ſhall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their Children.</hi>—O that we and our Children may ever <hi>remember</hi> how, in what majeſty and terror, God has commanded us to keep holy the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002620_0012_0FDB14D8B61980A8"/>
I need not add, how that after the great God had ſpoken this Law from heaven, he alſo <hi>wrote it on a Table of ſtone,</hi> with his own finger, to perpetuate the Remembrance and obſervation of it; and to imprint it upon <hi>the harder</hi> hearts and conſciences of men: And he only who wrote in the Table of ſtone, can write it on the <hi>fleſhly tables of our hearts.</hi> And that the whole might be yet more reverend and ſanctifying to us, he laid it up within the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> under the <hi>Mercy-ſeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, It pleaſed the Holy God to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large,</hi> in many weighty words, on this Law of the Sabbath, when he came down on <hi>Sinai.</hi> He charged them to <hi>remember</hi> this Law: he call'd it <hi>the Sabbath of the Lord their God:</hi> he told them <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>why</hi> he ſanctified it. There is ſomething very <hi>awful</hi> in God's uſing all theſe obliging and conſtraining words. 'Twas a Law worthy to be thus <hi>ſolemnly</hi> revived and <hi>long</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on: a very <hi>important</hi> point for the <hi>honour</hi> of God and our <hi>Salvation.</hi>—Wherefore let the Majeſty of <hi>that Day</hi> be evermore in the eyes and ears and hearts of the people of God.—To go on,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE Law of the Sabbath was <hi>repeated and inculcated upon the delivery of the Ceremonial and Judicial Law;</hi> yea it was <hi>inſerted</hi> into the latter, as being indeed a line and hedge about all the Statutes and Judgments of God given by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> to keep them all from being broken. For indeed piety and religion, and alſo juſtice and righteouſneſs, flouriſh or decline
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002620_0013_0FDB14D9F744E148"/>among the Covenant people of God, as the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> is ſanctified or profaned among them. A ſpecial honour is put upon the <hi>fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and a ſpecial reverence to it is required from us, by God's repeating it to his Church on theſe great Occaſions. I will name them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE have in my <hi>Text and Context</hi> the Law of the Sabbath repeated <hi>upon the delivery of the Ceremonial Law.</hi> God having finiſh'd here his Orders and directions to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the Tabernacle of the Congregation, the Ark, the Mercy-ſeat, and all the furniture of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; the Table, the Candleſtic, and the Altar of Incenſe, the Altar of burnt-offering, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and his foot; the Holy Garments, the anointing Oil and the ſweet Incenſe; Then the Lord added,— <hi>Speak thou unto the Children of Iſrael, Verily my Sabbaths you ſhall keep; it is a ſign between me and you thro' out your Generations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>NOW the moſt learned <hi>Expoſitors</hi> upon my Text agree, that this Commandment is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated on this Occaſion, that ſo the people of God might not think that <q>even the ſacred work of the Tabernacle might be done upon the Sabbath day.</q> Even that Work of God, of whatever importance, neceſſity and haſte it were, would not warrant them to break the holy Reſt of God's Day. Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> therefore gives the Senſe of my text thus, <hi>Verily my Sabbaths you ſhall keep;</hi> i. e. <q>notwithſtanding the work of the Tabernacle be holy, and diligently and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be done, yet I'll not have any of it done on the Sabbath day. And ſo Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002620_0014_0FDB14DFFA433110"/>Even Tabernacle-work muſt give way to the Sabbath reſt:</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Sic volo iſta fieri, ut nihilominus opifices ceſſent Sabbatho opere. <hi>Pareus in loc.</hi>
                  <p>They might not think this ſacred Work would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to break the Sabbath. Bp. <hi>Patrick.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> It means the work and labour of preparing and rearing the Tabernacle; not the Holy Services of it afterward; for ſo the Prieſts profaned the Sabbath and were guiltleſs; their Labours being in themſelves holy, like the work of Miniſters on the Lord's days under the Goſpel. So God himſelf has given the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between ſervile and holy work or labours. Lev. 23.25.</p>
            <p>BUT the true and great <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as it ſeems to me, why God repeated the Law of his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath unto Iſrael upon his giving the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> to them, was this— Becauſe the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law was originally deſigned by God, and always ſubordinated and ſubſervient unto <hi>the Sanctification of the Sabbath,</hi> in the worſhip and ſervices of the Tabernacle and Temple. It was eminently inſtituted for this one end, the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of the Lord's Sabbaths at the Tabernacle. Then the offerings and ſacrifices were <hi>doubled,</hi> and therefore neceſſarily the Services of the Prieſts. Theſe were made <hi>for the Sabbath;</hi> and therefore no wonder that when theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Law of the Sabbath was repeated. But then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Judicial Law</hi> which God gave to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had the Law of the Sabbath <hi>inſerted into it</hi> This forenſic or judicial Law was for the <hi>Civil Government</hi> of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002620_0015_0FDB14E24F8AE990"/>of God, and contained a <hi>Body</hi> or Syſtem of Laws to be obſerved by the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, for the good order and peaceable and quiet living of the people, in all Godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. Theſe <hi>Judgments</hi> Moſes began to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, by order from God, preſently after the delivery of the moral Law or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. You have a great part of them in the 21, 22, and 23. <hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>Exodus:</hi> And at the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 23. Chapter you find an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the <hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> inſerted thus,—<hi>Six days ſhalt thou do thy work, and on the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt, that thine ox and thine aſs may reſt, and that the Son of thy handmaid and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be refreſhed.</hi> Here, as I take it, the fourth Commandment was made a <hi>Law of the State</hi> to Iſrael, whoſe Legiſlature was properly a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> and their Rulers and Magiſtrates had the Executive power and truſt committed to them. And doubtleſs God thus honour'd the Law of the Sabbath to Iſrael his people, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting it in the Body of their Judicial Laws, to teach <hi>civil Governments</hi> to do the like in all parts and ages of the World, to whom the knowledge thereof ſhould come. And accordingly the good <hi>Government</hi> over us have in their wiſdom and piety Enacted the ſtrict Sanctification of the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> and have forbid the profanation of it under ſuch and ſuch penalties; wherein they have but done the part of a <hi>Chriſtian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS the ſacred Law of ſanctifying the Sabbath ſtands in Scripture as a hedge about the <hi>whole Moſaic Law,</hi> both Ceremonial and Judicial.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002620_0016_0FDB14E3AAD535C0"/>For (as One ſays) where no Conſcience is made of keeping the Sabbath, farewel both Godlineſs and honeſty. God in his wiſdom and gracious care has therefore ſet the fourth Commandment (as it were) between the two Tables of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; and alſo drawn it (as it were) as a line about all his poſitive laws, ſtatutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that none ſhould break over <hi>this</hi> and violate them.— But I go on,</p>
            <p n="5">V. GOD has from the beginning <hi>very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully threatned, and terribly puniſhed the violation of the Sabbath.</hi> Laws are of little force without a Penalty, nor that without an Execution. The Threatnings of God, and his Judgments on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are as a <hi>flowing ſword</hi> to guard his Holy Sabbaths from profanation, and to keep men <hi>in</hi> the way to the tree of life. And here,
<list>
                  <item>1. VERY dreadful are the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God againſt thoſe that profane his Holy Sabbaths. In our Context the threatning is, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Every one that defileth the Sabbath ſhall ſurely be put to death; whoſoever doeth any work thereon, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among his people.</hi> 
                     <q>This was the penalty then incurred by Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and then inflicted by the Lord of the Sabbath.</q> How ſevere a penalty! If any dar'd <hi>openly</hi> to profane the Sabbath in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that the Crime came to the notice of the Judge and were prov'd upon the offender, "the Magiſtrate "muſt cut him off by the ſword of Juſtice: But if the profanation were more <hi>hidden</hi> and cou'd not be prov'd upon him, or <q>if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate were remiſs and did not do his duty,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002620_0017_0FDB14E548327320"/>then God wou'd take the work into his own hand, and cut him off by a ſtroke from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This the Sabbath breaker might juſtly fear, and no doubt often ſuffer'd.</q> But the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Judgment of God and his Eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Sin, is infinitly greater. And if men deſpiſe God's Sabbaths, as it provokes him greatly to <hi>cut them off</hi> from among his people now, ſo without repentance he will <hi>cut them off</hi> for ever.</item>
                  <item>2. VERY dreadful have the <hi>puniſhments</hi> of this Sin been, by the immediate Commandment of God, to <hi>Rulers,</hi> or by the hand of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>BY the immediate and direct Command of the High God the <hi>firſt</hi> open and preſumptuous breaker of the Sabbath was puniſhed with <hi>death.</hi> You have the melancholly and diſmal Story, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. from the 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, to the 36. verſe. <hi>And while the Children of Iſrael were in the wilderneſs, they found a man that gathered ſticks on the Sabbath day: and they bro't him to Moſes and unto Aaron, and all the Congregation: And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, the Man ſhall be ſurely put to death; all the Congregation ſhall ſtone him with ſtones without the Camp: And he died, as the Lord commanded Moſes.</hi> God made him an <hi>Example,</hi> to deter others for evermore from the like Sin.</p>
            <p>BUT then alſo, God has in his <hi>Holy Providence</hi> dreadfully judg'd and puniſh'd for the Sin of Sabbath-breaking. How many he cuts off by <hi>untimely deaths</hi> for this ſin we know not; but there is reaſon to fear they may be many. Read the threatning and warning, <hi>Levit,</hi> 26.31, 34.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002620_0018_0FDB14E70B334F40"/>
               <hi>I will make your Cities waſte and bring your Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into deſolation, and ſcatter you among your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; then ſhall the land enjoy her Sabbaths; as long as it lieth deſolate it ſhall reſt, becauſe ye did not reſt in your Sabbaths when ye dwelt in it.</hi> All this was fulfilled in the doleful ſeventy years <hi>Captivity</hi> of the <hi>Jews in Babylon.</hi> Then the Holy Land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a long and ſad reſt, without a worſhipper or place of worſhip. See the 2. Cron 36.20, 21. <hi>And they burnt the houſe of God, and brake down the wall of Jeruſalem, and carried away the Remnant to Babylon, to fulfil the Word of the Lord, until the Land enjoy'd her Sabbaths.</hi> We read alſo how that when the <hi>Jews</hi> were return'd from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and again fell into this Sin, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> told them that the paſt wrath had been provok'd by this, and that more would ſtill be ſo: <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.17, 18. <hi>Did not your fathers thus? and did not our God bring all this Evil upon us, and upon this City? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael by profaning the Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT this for the fifth head, That from the beginning God did very dreadfully <hi>threaten</hi> and terribly <hi>puniſh</hi> the violation of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>THE holy Prophets of the Lord did in their times vehemently inſiſt on the ſanctification of the Lords Sabbaths;</hi> they complain'd of and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profanation of it, and they made in God's name the moſt gracious Promiſes to the people of God in caſe of their religious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof.

1. I ſay, The Holy Prophets of God did in their times <hi>vehemently inſiſt</hi> on the keeping God's Sabbaths. I ſcarce know a ſtricter precept and fuller direction in this point thro' the whole Book of God, than thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the 58. Chap. and 13. v. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the Holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him; not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words.</hi> Here the Prophet taught the people of God <hi>how</hi> to Sabbatize, and requir'd them <hi>ſo</hi> to keep the Sabbath; and his words are written for our admonition and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. WE muſt <hi>turn away our foot</hi> from the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: from <hi>trampling</hi> on it, (ſays a late pious <hi>Expoſitor</hi>) as profane, atheiſtical people do; from <hi>travelling</hi> on it, as many worldly men are ready to do; and from thoſe <hi>walks</hi> and <hi>diverſions</hi> on it, which men of pleaſure and licence are apt to take.</item>

               <item>3. WE muſt not <hi>ſpeak our own words:</hi> Not give our ſelves that liberty of ſpeech on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, which we may lawfully take on other days. Our words muſt be then guarded, grave, and ſeaſoned with grace. We muſt ſpeak God's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002620_0020_0FDB14ED8E892160"/>word; ſpeak of Him and of his Works, out of his Word: not talk of our worldly affairs and buſineſs as on other days.</item>
               <item>4. IT muſt be <hi>honourable</hi> to us becauſe <hi>the holy of the Lord.</hi> The holy duties of it ſhould be pleaſant and delightful to us.

            </list>
            <p>AFTER this manner <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preſcribes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the keeping a Sabbath: how ſpiritual and reverend! and thus <hi>from one Sabbath to another</hi> ſhould <hi>all fleſh come and worſhip before the</hi> Lord. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.23.</p>
            <p>LET us paſs on to the Prophecies of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and obſerve how he alſo inſiſts on the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath. Jer. 17.20, 22. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord ye Kings of Judah, and all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem that enter in by theſe gates; thus ſaith the Lord, Take heed to your ſelves and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the Gates of Jeruſalem; neither do ye any work, but hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sabbath day as I commanded your Fathers.</hi> This Commandment was to the <hi>King</hi> and all the people together: The higheſt and loweſt are equally under this Law and muſt be obedient. And to the <hi>Rulers</hi> it belongs to ſee to it that the Sabbath be ſanctified by their People.</p>
            <p>A like Order both to Prince and peaſant, for the religious obſervation of the Sabbath we have from the pen of the prophet <hi>Ezehiel,</hi> 46. Chap. 1,2. <hi>The Gate of the inner Court that looketh toward
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002620_0021_0FDB14EEF87CD890"/>the Eaſt ſhall be ſhut the ſix working days; but on the Sabbath it ſhall be opened, and the Prince ſhall enter by it,— and the Prieſt ſhall prepare his burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,— and he ſhall worſhip at the threſhold of the Gate,— and it ſhall not be ſhut until the Evening.</hi> It is the duty of <hi>Princes,</hi> and it is the priviledge of <hi>peaſants,</hi> to go up to the Sanctuary of God on his Sabbaths, then and there to worſhip him with holy reverence, as unworthy to tread the threſhold of his Gates.</p>
            <p>IN this frame and ſpirit we find <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the Princes, Prieſts and Levites with him, <hi>ſigning a Covenant to walk in the Laws of God and to keep his Sabbath.</hi> Nehem 10.31. We cannot walk in God's laws and not keep his Sabbaths; In our Covenanting with God to walk in his laws, we do in a ſpecial manner covenant to keep his Sabbaths. This is a ſpecial <hi>Article</hi> in God's <hi>Covenant</hi> with his People.</p>
            <p>THUS have the Holy prophets <hi>inſiſted</hi> on the Obſervation of the Sabbath in their days and times.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

In like manner the Prophets, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Amos.</hi> Ezek. 22.8. <hi>Thou haſt deſpiſed my holy things, and haſt profaned my Sabbaths.</hi> 20.13. <hi>My
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002620_0022_0FDB157E357257B0"/>Sabbaths they greatly polluted, then I ſaid I would pour out my fury upon them to conſume them.</hi> Amos 8.5, 8. <hi>Shall not the Land tremble for this? and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and will not the end thereof be as a bitter day?</hi>— It is a ſorrowful and fearful Symptom, when peeople are <hi>ſick</hi> of their Sabbaths; weary of the ſacred reſt, and tir'd with the holy work.— But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and to add no more,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE Prophets of the Lord have made <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and precious Promiſes</hi> to the people of God, in caſe of their <hi>religious Obſervation of the Holy Sabbath.</hi> The God who has bleſſed the ſeventh day and put his Name upon it, will bleſs all them that keep it holy. <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> are the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and more natural fruit of Sabbath Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but the <hi>outward</hi> bleſſings of Providence are alſo the reward of it. This is the way to enſure the ſpiritual and temporal Bleſſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Iſai. 56.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that doeth this, that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it.</hi> This brings a bleſſing on all our imployments, but eſpecially upon our Souls. Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE ſpiritual Bleſſing, yea <hi>all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places,</hi> is the promiſe to the <hi>Perſon</hi> that keeps God's Sabbaths. Iſai. 56.4, 5, 6. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord to them that keep my Sabbaths, and chooſe the things that pleaſe me, and take hold of my Covenant; even to them will I give in my Houſe and within my Walls, a place and a name better than of Sons and Daughters; I will give them an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing name that ſhall not be cut off:— I will bring them to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002620_0023_0FDB158201AF1378"/>my houſe of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſhall be accepted upon mine Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTE here, That theſe <hi>three</hi> things go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the religious Obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, the Chooſing the things that pleaſe God, and the taking hold of his Covenant. Look where you will and ſhew me one that keeps God's Sabbaths, and you ſhall find him one that in all other points likewiſe chuſes the things that pleaſe him; And ſuch may and will and do lay hold of God's Covenant. It is from a ſincere univerſal deſire of pleaſing God and glorifying him, that the pious worſhippers of God ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to obſerve and keep his Sabbaths. Such have (thro' grace) conſented and come up to the Terms of God's Covenant, have taken him for their God, his Word for their Rule, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en themſelves up to him, in his holy ways and among his people.</p>
            <p>AND now how great and precious are the <hi>Promiſes</hi> made here to this holy Sabbatizer? even all the Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace are aſſured to him; preſent peace and communion with God and ſupplies of Grace, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love and mercies of our Heavenly Father. They have a <hi>Name</hi> among the Children of God, a Name in the Church on earth, a Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven; an everlaſting Name that ſhall not be cut off.— Thus the <hi>Spiritual Bleſſing</hi> is the Promiſe to the <hi>perſon</hi> that keeps God's Sabbaths. And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Temporal</hi> bleſſing is promiſed to the <hi>People</hi> that do this. To prove this I need only turn you again to the 58. Iſai. 13, 14. <hi>If thou call
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002620_0024_0FDB1583118686C8"/>the Sabbath a delight,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and I will cauſe thee to ride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the Heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Here are the temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; even riches, honour, power, ſafety, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and dignity; to the place and people, the Country or Nation, that keep God's Sabbaths.</p>
            <p>GOD promis'd his <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he wou'd make them high in Name and honour, if they ſought his honour and obſerv'd his will; and that their Nei'bours ſhould ſee him bleſs them. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them to feed 'em, to defend 'em, and to advance 'em. He promis'd that if they would zealouſly and religiouſly keep his appointed <hi>Feaſts,</hi> no man ſhould deſire their Land when they went up unto 'em. He alſo bid them prove him, if he did not open the Heavens over them to pour down Bleſſings, if they duly regarded his Worſhip and Sanctuary. And doubtleſs this will always commend a People to his favour and bleſſing in the courſe of his Providence; and he will be their ſhield and ſtrength, and the lifter up of their head.</p>
            <p>IN a Word, We have the promiſe and the threatning repeated, the Bleſſing and the Curſe; Jer. 17.24, 25, 27. <hi>And it ſhall some to paſs if ye diligently hearken to me, ſaith the Lord, to bring in no burden thro' the gates of this City on the Sabbath day; but if ye hallow the ſame;— then ſhall there enter ſtill into it Kings and Princes ſitting upon the Throne of David, riding in Chariots and on horſes; and this City ſhall remain for ever; and burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices, meat-offerings and Incenſe of praiſe,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002620_0025_0FDB15874EE3A158"/>ſhall ſtill be in the houſe of the Lord:— But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in the Gates of Jeruſalem, which ſhall devour its palaces,</hi> (whereof the <hi>Temple</hi> was a principal one) <hi>and it ſhall not he quenched.</hi>—That is to ſay,</p>
            <p>THE religious Sanctification of God's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths would have been a means of preſerving the <hi>Royal Houſe of David,</hi> and the <hi>Holy City</hi> of God; But for the profanation of the Sabbath both the one and the other were bro't to ruine. The prophet aſſured them from God, that in caſe they would keep <hi>his Day,</hi> He would keep the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Country</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and make all to flouriſh: But on the contrary, if they went on to profane the Lord's Sabbaths, the Lord would deſtroy them <hi>all</hi> together. And ſo it was: The <hi>Enemy</hi> prevailed againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and kindled a <hi>fire</hi> in the Gates of the City, which burnt down the <hi>Palace</hi> of the King and the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of God, and none could quench it.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have ſhewn <hi>thro' Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> how ſtrictly and vehemently the Holy God has required and inculcated the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH was the thing to be prov'd,— <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep.</hi> The <hi>Inſtances</hi> given, from the precept to <hi>Adam</hi> unto and by the laſt of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> are ſo many plain and affecting <hi>proofs,</hi> as well as ſingular <hi>Illuſtrations,</hi> of my <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The <hi>method</hi> which I have taken is, I think, the moſt <hi>ſimple</hi> and natural Expoſition of what the <hi>Scripture</hi> has ſaid upon this head, ſo far as I have gone.— God bleſs what we have heard for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002620_0026_0FDB1588E2A18250"/>the Increaſing in us the <hi>Reverence</hi> of his Holy Day, the <hi>ſtrict</hi> Obſervation of it, and the <hi>fear</hi> of profaning it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

THE laſt time I ſpake in this place, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak to theſe <hi>two Doctrines.</hi> I. <hi>That the Great GOD has moſt ſtrictly and vehemently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Sanctification of the Sabbath day.</hi> II. <hi>That it is a ſign between Him and us that he is the Lord that doth ſanctify us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cou'd not quite get thro' the <hi>firſt Doctrine</hi> on the laſt <hi>Lecture,</hi> namely,</p>
            <p>I. D. <hi>THAT the Lord our God has moſt ſtrictly and vehemently required us to keep his Sabbaths. Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep.</hi>— It was a <hi>Law</hi> to Man from the beginning of the World, and the <hi>firſt</hi> Law that was given to him, even in his ſtate of Innocence. It was one of the firſt things given in Commandment to <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon their leaving <hi>Egypt.</hi> It was one of the <hi>ten Words,</hi> the ten Commandments, given from <hi>Sinai,</hi> in that auguſt and fearful manner. It was repeated and inculcated upon the delivery of the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> and <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> and was indeed inſerted into the latter. Moreover. God has from the beginning very dreadfully <hi>threatned</hi> and terribly <hi>puniſhed</hi> the violation of this Commandment. And by the mouth of all his <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> he has vehemently <hi>inſiſted on</hi> the Sanctification of the Sabbath day, <hi>complained of</hi> and declar'd againſt the profanation of it; and they have made in God's name the moſt gracious <hi>promiſes</hi> to the people of God in caſe of their religious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.— Thus <hi>thro' the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament</hi> we find abundant proofs and plain Illuſtrations of our <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall continue the <hi>proof</hi> of this <hi>great Truth</hi> thro' the <hi>Scriptures of the New Teſtament.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002620_0028_0FDB158E697F7D48"/>and ſtrict Obſervation of the <hi>Lord's day</hi> is <hi>there</hi> alſo directed to, preſcribed and enjoyned; but more by the holy practice and example of our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> than by precepts.</p>
            <p>THE Law of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> was nothing peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. It was before them, even a Law from the <hi>beginning</hi> of the world, and it continues after them, unto the <hi>End</hi> of time. <hi>There remaineth the keeping of a Sabbath to the people of God,</hi> and it will do ſo while the world laſts. The Law is <hi>Moral,</hi> and of perpetual Uſe, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obligation. We <hi>need</hi> the priviledge of a Sabbath now, its uſe and benefit to our Souls; as much as the People of God did heretofore: And we <hi>owe</hi> this homage, honour and ſervice to God as much now as his People of old did. A <hi>weekly Sabbath</hi> is a ſmall rent and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the LORD of our lives, <hi>in whoſe hand all our time is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us look into the holy <hi>Goſpels,</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> and read the mind of <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the religious Obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> And let us bear in mind that the Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles is a <hi>Law</hi> to us in this matter. For (as a late worthy <hi>Writer</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Actions</hi> do certainly make a <hi>Law,</hi> where they ſufficiently <hi>publiſh the Mind and Will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> as much as <hi>words.</hi>
               </q> If then we can find Actions of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, equivalent to a <hi>verbal</hi> Precept, for the Obſervation of the <hi>Chriſtian Shbbath,</hi> we muſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002620_0029_0FDB15900D6DC650"/>needs account it <hi>his</hi> Inſtitution and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us.</p>
            <p>IN the bleſſed Life of our <hi>Saviour</hi> we read once and again of his going into the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> to attend the publick <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath days.</hi> Luke 4.6. <hi>As his Cuſtom was he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day.</hi> This he did to teach and require <hi>us</hi> to keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as he did. He has given us <hi>this</hi> Example that we ſhould follow his ſteps. So he ſerv'd and worſhip'd God, fulfilling all Righteouſneſs, and ſo muſt we. He came not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Law and the Prophets, but to <hi>fulfil</hi> them. Had he put an <hi>end</hi> to the <hi>Sacred weekly Sabbath,</hi> it had <hi>deſtroyed the Law and the Prophets</hi> with a witneſs. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> fulfilled this Law, and kept many a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to the glory of God in a perfect manner, ſo as no meer man, nor all the Holy men of God together, ever did or can do. He has taught us how to Sabbatiſe; how to ſpend our Sabbaths in the ſolemn Aſſemblies, and in works of piety and mercy. Many a high Exerciſe of <hi>devotion,</hi> and many a good work of <hi>charity,</hi> did he upon the Sabbath-day. He fill'd up the Holy time with <hi>work,</hi> and the work with <hi>Spirit.</hi> For theſe very works of God like goodneſs he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reproached as a <hi>breaker</hi> of the Sabbath; but it turn'd to the confuſion of his ignorant and ſuperſtitious, if not hypocritical and malicious <hi>Accuſers.</hi> As in Mark 3. Init. He ſanctified and honour'd the Sabbath by his divine <hi>Sermons,</hi> and by his <hi>miracles of mercy</hi> on that bleſſed day. He made it a Day of <hi>his Bleſſing</hi> to men, both on temporal and ſpiritual accounts. Luk. 13.10, 17.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002620_0030_0FDB1591A8552A30"/>He kept that bleſſed Law for his <hi>Elect,</hi> which Believers themſelves keep ſo <hi>poorly</hi> and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.— He alſo taught his <hi>Diſciples</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to obſerve and keep the Sabbath-day, Indeed ſome of the ſuperſtitious <hi>Phariſees</hi> did ſometimes tax the <hi>Diſciples</hi> with taking <hi>undue liberties</hi> on the Holy Sabbath. But <hi>what</hi> was it? they <hi>plucked an ear of corn and eat of it as they paſſed thro' a field.</hi> They were hungry and it was but a proper and needed taſte, and an ordinary haſty bit, for their ſupport and refreſhment in the ſervices of the day. The <hi>Women</hi> alſo that followed our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and miniſtred unto him, were ſtrict Sabbatizers: Luk. 23. ult. <hi>They reſted on the Sabbath day according to the Commandment.</hi> Tho' they were preparing <hi>ſpices</hi> for the dead body of their dear <hi>Saviour,</hi> yet they laid by the holy care and labour of love till the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was over. <hi>Verily God's Sabbaths did they keep;</hi> even as if the words of my <hi>Text</hi> were then in their remembrance, and they conſidered that as the holy work of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was to give place to the holy Reſt of God's day, ſo their pious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring to <hi>that ſacred Temple of the Deity,</hi> our <hi>Lords Body.</hi>— And <hi>that</hi> was the <hi>laſt Seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> which the Diſciples kept. For <hi>early</hi> in the morning of the <hi>next day,</hi> being the <hi>firſt day of the week</hi> theſe <hi>Women</hi> came unto the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Spices</hi> which they had prepared;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Luk. 24.1, 13, 34, 36. And John 20.1, 16, 19, 26.</note> and <hi>they found not the Body of Jeſus, but had a viſion of Angels who told them of his reſurrection from the dead.</hi>— And that <hi>ſame day</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002620_0031_0FDB15921F8B8020"/>appeared <hi>ſeveral times</hi> to one and another of his Followers; to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> to the <hi>two diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> on their way to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> to <hi>Simon,</hi> and to the <hi>ten</hi> together in the <hi>Evening:</hi> when he <hi>bleſſed</hi> them, <hi>breathed on 'em,</hi> and gave them their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> That day <hi>ſeven night,</hi> being again the <hi>firſt day of the week,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> appeared again unto them, <hi>Thomas</hi> being then preſent, and <hi>ſhewed them his hands and his feet.</hi>— Now by the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt</hi> on the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week, and by his repeated <hi>viſits</hi> to them on this day, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (under the infallible Conduct of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) from thenceforth held their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Meetings, their holy Convocations, on <hi>this</hi> day of the ſeven, and called it the <hi>Lord's-Day.</hi>— On this <hi>firſt</hi> day of the week, the Diſciples <hi>were all with one accord in one place,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Act. 1.1, 2.</note> aſſembled as on <hi>their holy Sabbath,</hi> when ſuddenly there appeared the <hi>cloven Tongues of fire and ſat upon them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt; and ſpake in every language the wonderful works of God;</hi> the proper <hi>ſervice</hi> of the Sabbath day. That this day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was the <hi>firſt day of the week</hi> is eaſily computed and proved. The day after the <hi>Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> was the <hi>firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread;</hi> (ſee Lev. 23.5, 6.) which was as a <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> They were to have an <hi>holy Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on it, and to do <hi>no ſervile</hi> work thereon. On the <hi>next</hi> day was the <hi>Offering of the firſt-fruits unto the Lord:</hi> And from <hi>this</hi> day, (the next but one after the <hi>Paſſover</hi>) they were order'd to count <hi>fifty days,</hi> or <hi>ſeven weeks</hi> complete; and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002620_0032_0FDB1592231EC4B8"/>then was the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> ſo called from the <hi>fiftieth</hi> day. Now ſee how <hi>theſe</hi> things were all fulfilled in the <hi>Dying</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and in the <hi>pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecoſt.</hi>— Our bleſſed Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ſlain at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> which fell that year on a <hi>fryday:</hi> Then was the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> offered, <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover ſacrificed for us.</hi>— That <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> therefore was <hi>the preparation,</hi> as it is called <hi>John</hi> 19.31. ſcil. the preparation both for <hi>the weekly Sabbath,</hi> and alſo for <hi>the Feaſt of unleavened bread;</hi> which made <hi>that Sabbath a high day.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore were earneſt with <hi>Pilate</hi> to have the Bodies taken down <hi>early</hi> from the Croſs. <hi>This</hi> whole Sabbath our Lord's Body lay in the grave. And the <hi>next</hi> morning early, being the <hi>firſt day of the week,</hi> the next day <hi>but one</hi> after the Paſſover, <hi>the day of the offering of the firſt-fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,</hi> he roſe from the dead, and <hi>became the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep.</hi> Now compute juſt <hi>ſeven weeks</hi> from <hi>this</hi> day of our <hi>Lord's</hi> Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>firſt day of the eighth week,</hi> even the <hi>fiftieth day,</hi> was the day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> when the <hi>Spirit, (the promiſe of the Father)</hi> was pour'd out from the aſcended <hi>Jeſus</hi> upon his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as they were aſſembled together for his ſolemn Worſhip. <q>Then (as one ſays) they themſelves received the <hi>firſt-fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and thro' the word of truth begat three thouſand ſouls to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and preſented them as the <hi>firſt-fruits of the Chriſtian Church</hi> unto <hi>God</hi> and to the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
               </q> Thus did our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> honour and hallow the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the week by giving the <hi>Sanctifier</hi> and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> thereon. So did he ſhed Him forth in his
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002620_0033_0FDB1595CAC7C018"/>miraculous <hi>Gifts</hi> and in his ſaving <hi>Graces,</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly on <hi>that</hi> day. He poured out the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> from on high, and bleſſed the <hi>Day,</hi> to be <hi>an holy Sabbath unto Himſelf;</hi> and unto <hi>us,</hi> the day for our "ſeeking and receiving ſpiritual bleſſings. Such <hi>Actions</hi> (ſays <hi>One</hi>) do as fully declare and expreſs the mind and will of <hi>Heaven</hi> as any <hi>words</hi> could do— Eſpecially if we find (as we do) in the <hi>ſacred Writings,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and primitive Chriſtians <hi>did</hi> thenceforth obſerve the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the week for their religious <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> and for the Adminiſtration of the <hi>ſpecial Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> thereon.

               </q> Both the one and other are inſtituted, ſeparated and appropriated unto his worſhip, and the religious remembrance of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.— <hi>The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> Lord of our time and lives.

And there is the ſame reaſon why it ſhould pleaſe the <hi>Lord Redeemer</hi> to take the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the week for his own day, and make it the weekly Sabbath to the Church, upon his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> thereon from the dead; as there was why the <hi>Lord Creator</hi> pleaſed to bleſs the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> day, and the ſeventh part of time, becauſe he <hi>reſted</hi> from his work of Creation after ſix days. For the work of mans <hi>Redemption</hi> is a work of God <hi>equally glorious</hi> with that of his <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and ſo <hi>equally worthy</hi> of a ſacred, inſtituted, perpetual <hi>Memorial.</hi> And the <hi>reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> was really his <hi>reſting</hi> from his work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, having compleated it in his death.

The reaſons to them were, God's <hi>ſpecial propriety</hi> in the ſeventh day, his own <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> and reſting thereon, and his <hi>bleſſing</hi> it. And for <hi>theſe reaſons</hi> we keep the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the week holy to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe of his ſpecial propriety therein, (his reſting on it, and taking it for his
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002620_0036_0FDB72DE0F260570"/>own) his own Example and his bleſſing it. On every Account it is the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> the Chriſtian Sabbath.— <hi>Jeſus has given us this Reſt,</hi> upon his <hi>ceaſing</hi> from his redeeming work as <hi>God</hi> did from his of Creation; and upon <hi>his entring into his reſt.</hi> There remaineth therefore <hi>a Reſt</hi> to the people of God; a ſpiritual reſt <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, and the keeping of a weekly Sabbath <hi>to</hi> him.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have briefly traced thro' the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſome of the things occurring there, <hi>for our keeping holy the Sabbath-day.</hi>— And ſo I diſmiſs the firſt part of my <hi>Text, Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep.</hi>— I come now to the <hi>Reaſon annexed,</hi> which is the other part, <hi>For it is a Sign between me and you thro'out your Generations, that I am the Lord that doth ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify you.</hi>

            <p>INDEED the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was given and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to Man in his State of Innocence, and that even before the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto <hi>Adam.</hi> But Man having <hi>ſinned</hi> and broken the firſt Covenant, had <hi>forfeited</hi> and <hi>loſt</hi> the Priviledge and honour of a Sabbath. There remained <hi>no room</hi> or place for any <hi>Sabbath</hi> to him till it was <hi>reſtored</hi> in the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>— But as it pleaſed God, according to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel and purpoſe, immediately to <hi>reveal</hi> unto fallen man hss Covenant of Grace and Salvation, thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the promiſed Seed of the Woman; So the <hi>Law of the Sabbath</hi> did naturally and in courſe <hi>revive</hi> and take place again.— For it is nothing <hi>peculiar</hi> either to the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> or to the Covenant of <hi>works,</hi> that there ſhould be a <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but it muſt needs be <hi>common</hi> to either, that there be ſome appointed <hi>time</hi> ſacred unto the public and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002620_0040_0FDB72E904797A30"/>ſolemn worſhip of God.— IF then God pleaſed to give a <hi>new Covenant</hi> to Man after his fall, it muſt needs bring him a <hi>new Right and liberty</hi> to worſhip God; and conſequently muſt revive the Priviledge and Law of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to him.— And <hi>other Foundation can no man lay,</hi> for this priviledge and liberty of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than <hi>this</hi> which is laid, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> in and thro' him. It is truly <hi>one</hi> of the Benefits of Redemption, and a <hi>great</hi> and neceſſary one. It is the <hi>Gift of Grace by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> it is the purchaſe of his <hi>Death,</hi> and the fruit of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that there <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the keeping of a Sabbath</hi> to the Children of fallen <hi>Adam.</hi>— This is a Benefit of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> without which there had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>no place</hi> for prayer, praiſe or worſhip to fallen man; and conſequently <hi>no day</hi> ſacred to theſe Duties.</p>
            <p>HENCE the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is ſaid to be given <hi>for a Covenant,</hi> and to be obſerved as ſuch; and the <hi>ten Commandments</hi> are called God's <hi>Covenant:</hi> Deu. 4.13. <hi>He declared unto you his Covenant; even ten Commandments.</hi> But it is the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> which ſtands peculiarly as the <hi>moſt</hi> viſible token of the Covenant of God; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the 16. <hi>v.</hi> of our <hi>Context, Ye ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Sabbath for a perpetual Covenant.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.20. <hi>It is a ſign between me and you, that I am the Lord your God.</hi>— Every Sabbath day we do publickly and ſolemnly confeſs and avouch the <hi>Lord Jehovah</hi> to be the <hi>true</hi> God, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002620_0041_0FDB72EA91B0C730"/>God <hi>alone,</hi> and that he is <hi>our God and Redeemer,</hi> and that we are <hi>his</hi> people and worſhippers, and will be devoted to him for ever. Theſe <hi>two</hi> things are therefore put together by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Iſa. 56.4, 6. <hi>The keeping God's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> the <hi>taking hold of his Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>joyning our ſelves unto the Lord.</hi>— We keep God's Sabbaths as a ſign of our faith in and devotion to the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the great <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> and High Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth. According to what we read in my <hi>Context, v.</hi> 17. <hi>It is ſign between Me and the Children of Iſrael for ever, that in ſix days the Lord made all things, and in the ſeventh he reſted and was refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>— Again, We covenant with God thro' <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Lord our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> in our keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sabbaths. It was to the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and is to the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> a Memorial of <hi>redeeming</hi> Grace and Mercy. When God had redeemed <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he then ſaid to them, Deut. 5.15. <hi>Remember that thou waſt a Servant there, and that the Lord thy God bro't thee out thence with a ſtrong hand and by a ſtretched out arm; Therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.</hi> Here was a ſuper-added and ſpecial reaſon to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their religious obſervation of the Sabbath. Some learned men have argued and inſiſted on it, that the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day from the Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the Red Sea was the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath.</hi> And if it were ſo yet might it be the ſeventh day from the <hi>Creation</hi> alſo. But to be ſure, in memory of this <hi>their Redemption,</hi> as well as of the <hi>World's
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002620_0042_0FDB72EBFA7608B0"/>Creation,</hi> they were to keep their Sabbaths.— Now <hi>this</hi> ſeems to me a plain Prefiguration of our <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> in memory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the work of <hi>our</hi> Redemption. For if the Sabbath was unto the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſign of their Covenant relation and obligations to God as <hi>their Saviour</hi> and Redeemer; is it not more <hi>ſo</hi> unto <hi>us</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and from the day of the completion of the Spiritual and Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the <hi>Son of God?</hi> If that deliverance which was but the <hi>Type</hi> came into a conſtant Remembrance, and was a ſtanding reaſon of the weekly Sabbath till the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſhall not the <hi>Eternal Redemption</hi> by Him, which is the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> be had in a perpetual Remembrance <hi>by us</hi> upon the weekly Sabbath; and be a ſpecial reaſon <hi>to us</hi> for our Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame?— Wherefore no doubt but from the <hi>fall</hi> of Man unto the End of the world, the Sabbath has been ordained, and by the worſhippers of God ought to be obſerved, in memory of Man's Redemption as well as of his Creation, and to the honour of God our <hi>Redeemer</hi> as well as <hi>Creator;</hi> and ſo we keep it, as a redeemed people, bought with his Blood; and every <hi>Lord's-day</hi> we covenant anew with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to glorify him in our bodies and ſpirits which are his.— The <hi>Covenant</hi> ſtands for ever, becauſe the <hi>Redeemer</hi> liveth, therefore the <hi>Sabbath</hi> abides: The <hi>Covenant of his peace</hi> is not removed, and the <hi>God of the whole Earth</hi> is he called, who is the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> the Redeemer.— God openly and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002620_0043_0FDB72F438B4F3D8"/>ſignificantly <hi>covenants</hi> with his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every Sabbath day. He meets them to <hi>bleſs</hi> 'em, as they aſſemble to <hi>worſhip</hi> him. He gives <hi>a name and place within his walls, even an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting name.</hi> He does this (ſays the <hi>Prophet</hi>) Iſa. 56.6. while <hi>we joyn our ſelves unto him, to ſerve him and to love his Name.</hi>— Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> owns his people, as well as <hi>they</hi> him, every <hi>Lord's-day.</hi> He meets them in his own appointed time and ways. He <hi>ſeals</hi> to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and <hi>ſhews</hi> it to them, and his <hi>ſecret</hi> is with them while they <hi>keep</hi> his Sabbath.— The riſen <hi>Saviour</hi> viſits his aſſembled Diſciples from week to week, and is ſtill in the <hi>midſt</hi> of them, and ſays, <hi>peace</hi> be unto you; yea and ſhews them <hi>his hands and his feet</hi> when they come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>break bread.</hi>— Thus the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is the abiding and conſpicuous Sign of a <hi>Church ſtate;</hi> and it is for <hi>Stipulation</hi> and mutual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting between God and his people.— <hi>It is a ſign between Me and you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is an evident token, and bleſſed means, of Man's Salvation in a way of holineſs and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

            <p>GOD's Sabbaths were to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſign of his ſelecting them from other people and conſecrating them unto himſelf, his worſhip and ſervice; to be unto him as <hi>a kingdom of prieſts, a holy nation.</hi> If he had not ſo <hi>ſet 'em apart</hi> for himſelf, he would not have <hi>revealed</hi> to them his Sabbaths, to <hi>ſet up</hi> his Worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: And they that worſhip him muſt be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> muſt ſanctify themſelves hereunto.</p>

He ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them by his <hi>Spirit</hi> in his Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the Means of grace and holineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his <hi>Sabbaths</hi> are ſanctified, and wherein his people apply to him as their <hi>Sanctifier.</hi> If we keep <hi>God's days,</hi> they will be the means of <hi>our ſanctification.</hi> It is a ſign that God has ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us if we love his Sabbaths; and to keep them is the grand means of our increaſe in holineſs.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Holy Sabbaths</hi> of God do exhibit him unto us, not only as the Lord our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> but alſo as the Lord our <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier.</hi> Not only is the Sabbath ordained to ſerve unto the honour and worſhip of God <hi>the Father Almighty,</hi> Maker of Heaven and Earth; and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his only Son our Saviour, but alſo
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002620_0045_0FDB72F628CFB930"/>of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (proceeding from the Father and the Son) our Sanctifier.</p>
            <p>SANCTIFICATION is the ſpecial work of the <hi>Holy and Eternal Spirit of God.</hi> In remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>his glorious deſcent</hi> from the Aſcended Saviour we keep our <hi>Lord's days.</hi> He is in his Word and Ordinances, the which he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and inſtituted, and makes them the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of holineſs unto all ſincere and fervent Worſhippers.</p>
            <p>HE is himſelf the <hi>Holy One,</hi> infinitly holy. He would have <hi>us</hi> holy. He only can make us ſo. His <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and worſhip are holy, and <hi>ſanctifying</hi> to us. We wait on him in them <hi>for</hi> his ſanctifying influences and Operations. He <hi>bleſſes</hi> his Sabbaths and Inſtitutions for this end. He ſanctifies his Elect <hi>thro' his Truth,</hi> his Word is the Truth. We acknowledge him as the Lord our Sanctifier, <hi>apply</hi> to him and glorify him as ſuch, in the <hi>way</hi> of Sabbath Sanctification. And they that do ſo, <hi>find</hi> him to be their Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier. His Sabbaths are under his bleſſing the ſpecial means of that <hi>little Holineſs</hi> that is in the world. Not only is the <hi>form</hi> of Godlineſs kept up in the world by the keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, but alſo that <hi>power</hi> of Godlineſs which is, or ever has been, in the Church of God, is owing hereunto. In this way Sinners muſt <hi>ſeek</hi> after Sanctification, and in this way they experience and <hi>find</hi> it. As it is written in the <hi>Pſalm or Song for the Sabbath-day;</hi> Pſ. 92.13.

               <hi>They that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God; to ſhew that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord is upright;—</hi> A God <hi>faithful</hi> to his Covenant and <hi>true</hi> to his Inſtitutions, to own and bleſs them.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have offer'd ſome <hi>hints</hi> toward the explaining my <hi>Text,</hi> How the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> of God are a <hi>ſign</hi> between Him and his people, <hi>that he is the Lord that doth ſanctify them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Argument</hi> from all is, <hi>That verily his Sabbaths we muſt keep.</hi> And you may eaſily perceive a <hi>variety</hi> of Argument, cogent and very weighty, in what has been ſaid.— The <hi>Lord's day</hi> is unto us the primary, perpetual and univerſal Memorial of the Covenant of Grace, which God has made with fallen man; and ſhall we not thankfully and religiouſly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Memorial of this Grace of God unto us?— It is the badge and livery of our being the Covenant People of God; our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and ſolemn Confeſſion of the <hi>Lord Jehovah,</hi> Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, our glorious Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Redeemer and Sanctifier.— It is the great and ſolemn Profeſſion of our Faith in, our devotion unto, and our covenanting with, the <hi>moſt High God,</hi> Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth.— It is the inſtituted Means to us of Grace here and Glory for ever; of preſent Communion with God and of ſeeing him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; of his having any ſervice and glory from us in this world, and of our finding bleſſedneſs in him in that which is to come.</p>
