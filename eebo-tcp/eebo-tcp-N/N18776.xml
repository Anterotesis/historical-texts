            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>DEDICATION. To JOSEPH WARD, ESQ.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO you, as a deſcendant from the firſt generation of the inhabitants of Newton, permit me to inſcribe the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>IT originated in a deſire of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moral and religious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a people (deſervedly dear to their Paſtor) whoſe fathers have long ſince ſlept in death.</p>
            <p>AMONG theſe, the name of Ward has ſhone with an amiable and conſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous luſtre. The character of your anceſtors, from the beginning of this ſettlement, has engaged the eſteem of their contemporaries, who, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, have choſen them to the firſt civil and religious offices of truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>OF theſe, your late pious father claims a particular remembrance, for the many virtues, which diſtinguiſhed him through life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:024406_0004_0FC70EFF1704AB70"/>YOU, Sir, juſtly eſteem it a greater honour, to derive your deſcent from anceſtors, who feared GOD, and were bleſſings in their day, than from men, who have the blood of princes in their veins.</p>
            <p>YOUR firſt wiſh for the town, which gave you birth, is, that its inhabitants, to the lateſt poſterity, may emulate the virtues of their fathers, who conſidered the religion of JESUS, as the rule of life, and the pureſt ſource of felicity. May you and yours ſhare in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent wiſh! May you long live, and cheriſh thoſe habits of philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which have hitherto ſhed a luſtre on your character, and render you a rich bleſſing to ſociety! May your children, and children's children, to the moſt diſtant generation, continue to adorn the name of <hi>Ward</hi> with every attractive and uſeful virtue,</p>
            <closer>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE book of Eccleſiaſtes is ſuppoſed to have been penned by Solomon in the latter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his life, when he deeply felt the vanity of the world, and his own folly in complying with its temptations. He ſeems to wiſh the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others from theſe temptations, whilſt they eyed his ſad experience, as a beacon, erected to warn them, of the rocks and quick-ſands in the ſea of life. He employs this book, to teach them the vanity of all ſublunary enjoyments, and to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend the love of GOD and obedience to his will, as the moſt ſolid good, and the nobleſt end of their being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024406_0006_0FC70F0548B2FD60"/>THOUGH the ſon of the celebrated David, and king of Iſrael, whoſe throne was the moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did then on the globe, yet he readily undertook the office of a Preacher or religious inſtructor to his brethren of mankind. "Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity," is the leading theme of his diſcourſe. "What profit," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he, "hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the ſun?" He derives no laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bliſs from thoſe toils, which are confined to the preſent life. "One generation paſſeth away, and another generation cometh." His ſtay on earth is tranſient. He paſſes off the ſtage, to make room for his ſucceſſors, who, in their turn, muſt give place to thoſe behind them. "But the earth abideth forever." He is more frail than the globe which he inhabits. For though this is devoted to deſtruction at the appointed cloſe of its ſcenes, yet it ſurvives the wreck of many ſucceſſive generations, and affords its living actors an opportunity to cheriſh and diſplay thoſe virtues, which alone will crown them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
            <p>SOLEMN and deeply intereſting to every mortal is the ſentiment of our text.</p>
            <p>NUMEROUS generations have trodden this earthly ſtage before us. Inſtead of the fathers, have been the children, who have rapidly ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the paternal relation, and then yielded their places to poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE preſent period, which is the concluding LORD's Day of the year, and the commencement of a new century to this town, that received its
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024406_0007_0FC70F08375279C0"/>
name as an incorporated body, Dec. 8, 1691,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The year of the date of the royal commiſſion for the union of Plymouth and Maſſachuſetts as one colony.</p>
                  <p>I find from the public records of the place, that "a committee was choſen in Nov. 1686, to go to the townſmen of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, to treat with them about our freedom from their town, and alſo to join them about making the town's rate."</p>
                  <p>Eleven days (the difference between old and new ſtyle) being added to eight, will make the 19th of Dec. in our preſent calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the anniverſary of Newton's incorporation.</p>
                  <p>The name of the town is written <hi>Newtown,</hi> or <hi>Newton,</hi> in the earlieſt records. It has been diſtinguiſhed by the latter only for many years paſt.</p>
               </note> has led me to the choice of thoſe applicable and emphatic words, "One generation paſſeth away, and another generation cometh."</p>
            <p>SOLOMON, though dead, yet ſpeaks to us by them, and urges us ſo to improve our rapidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving days, as ſhall beſt accompliſh the deſign of life, and embalm our memory upon our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the body.</p>
            <p>WHEN man by his apoſtaſy had ſubjected himſelf to death, the great Arbiter of human life ſaw fit, in the early age of the world, to poſtpone the execution of the ſentence to the diſtance of ſeveral centuries. One generation did not paſs away, and another generation come, with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of following periods.</p>
            <p>THE antediluvians were permitted to ſee ſeven, eight, and nine centuries of years. Their ſlow progreſs to complete manhood, appears to have borne ſome proportion to their longevity. Sixty five, ninety, one hundred and five, and even one hundred and ſixty two, are the advanced years, in which the paternal relation ſeems to be firſt form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Gen. v.</note>

            <p>AGREEABLY to the computation of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text, Adam lived two hundred and forty three years with Methuſaleh of the eighth generation, and fifty ſix years with Lamech of the ninth, and the father of Noah.<note n="*" place="bottom">Adam died A. M. 930. Methuſaleh was born A. M. 687. Lamech was born A.

M. 2006. Abram was born A. M. 2008.</note> And though the age of man was gradually reduced after the flood, and Shem his ſon had his life cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed within ſix hundred years, yet he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been contemporary with Abraham, of the tenth generation from him, till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding days of that patriarch, and to have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived a little beyond the marriage of Iſaac.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Shem died A. M. 2158, Ae. 600. Abraham died A. M. 2184, Ae. 175. Iſaac was married A. M. 2148, Ae. 40.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE duration of the following generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs and leſs, till, in the days of Moſes, three and four ſcore years was the general ſtandard.<note n="§" place="bottom">

                  <p>A woman was living in Marſhfield, in 1790, who perfectly remembered Peregrine White, the firſt born child after the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of our anceſtors in 1620, and often attended public worſhip with him.</p>
                  <p>As an entertainment to the curious, and a proof of frequent longevity in America, it may perhaps be thought not improper to ſubjoin the following liſt of perſons, who died in the years 1789 and 1790.</p>

One generation has paſſed away, and anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has come much within the ſame period.</p>
            <p>THE ancients, among whom we reckon the ſacred hiſtorians, often computed by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Our Saviour's birth has been traced from Abraham in this way: But there has been a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement among writers in fixing the exact num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, which conſtitutes a generation. Job is ſaid to have "lived one hundred and forty years" after his calamities, and to have "ſeen his ſons, and his ſons ſons, even four generations." The ancient poets uſed the term age in the ſame ſenſe with generation. Neſtor, the wiſe Grecian general at the ſiege of Troy, is repreſented by Homer as having lived three ages (i. e. of thirty years each) or ninety years.</p>
            <p>WE have already ſeen that a generation is to be computed longer in the antediluvian, than in the poſtdiluvian world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024406_0010_0FC70F14DB459528"/>IN different climates, at the preſent day, it is to be variouſly computed. In the Eaſt Indies the generations of the natives go off, and come on in a very rapid manner. Thoſe years, which are the vigour of manhood among us, conſtitute old age with them.</p>
            <p>AMONG us thirty three years appear to be a proper mean number, by which we may generally calculate our ſucceſſive generations.</p>
            <p>AMIDST the ravages of the human race, which death continually makes, it is a circumſtance, which requires gratitude to divine Providence, that a whole generation is not ſwept off at once, and that a new generation gradually ſucceeds, and fills up the vacancy, which was made by the removal of their anceſtors. Were it not for thoſe births, which are conſtantly repairing the waſtes of death, the ſcene, which is now acting by the king of terrors, would fill us with ſuch ſurpriſe and diſtreſs, as would entirely unfit us for the buſineſs, the duties, and the innocent enjoyments of life.</p>
            <p>THE removal of the generation of which we are a part, is ſo gradual, that we ſcarcely realize the havoc, which is making by the fell deſtroyer of our race. What our ſenſations would be, if the generation, with which we are converſant, were taken at once from our eyes, we may judge from the following ſtory of an old man, who had groaned in confinement for forty ſeven years between four thick and cold ſtone walls in the late Baſtile of France.<note n="*" place="bottom">His crime was uttering ſome unguarded expreſſions, imply<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing diſreſpect concerning Louis XV.</note>

                  <p>As the whole account of this wretched man is remarkable, the curioſity of the reader may be gratified by ſubjoining in this note the preceding part of it, which, as not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with our ſubject, was omitted in the ſermon.</p>
                  <p>"Hardened by adverſity, which ſtrengthens both the mind and the conſtitution, when they are not overpowered by it, he had reſiſted the horrors of his long impriſonment with an invincible and manly ſpirit. His locks thin, white, and ſcattered, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt acquired the rigidity of iron, whilſt his body, environed for ſo long a time by a coffin of ſtone, had borrowed from it a firm and compact habit. The narrow door of his tomb, turning upon its grating hinges, opened not as uſual by halves; and an unknown voice bade him depart. Believing this to be a dream, he heſitated, but at length roſe up, and walked forth with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſteps, amazed at the ſpace he traverſed. The ſtairs of the priſon, the halls, the court, ſeemed to him vaſt, immenſe, and almoſt without bounds. He ſtopped from time to time, and gazed around like a bewildered traveller. His viſion was with difficulty reconciled to the clear light of day. He contemplated the heavens as a new object. His eyes remained fixed, and he could not even weep. Stupified with the newly acquired pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of changing his poſition, his limbs, like his tongue, refuſed, in ſpite of his efforts, to perform their office. At length he got through the formidable gate. When he felt the motion of the carriage prepared to tranſport him to his former habitation, he ſcreamed out, and uttered ſome inarticulate ſounds; and as he could not bear this new movement, he was obliged to deſcend, and to move by the ſupport of a benevolent arm."</p>
               </note>"AT the acceſſion of the preſent monarch, Louis XVI. this wretched priſoner was reſtored, with ſeveral others, to his liberty. Supported by a friendly arm, he ſought out the ſtreet where he had formerly reſided. He found it, but no trace of his houſe remained. One of the public edifices occupied the ſpot where it had ſtood. The houſes of his neareſt neighbours, which were freſh in his memory, had aſſumed a new appearance. Terrified, he ſtopped, and fetched a deep ſigh. To him, what did it import, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024406_0012_0FC70F1E2C8B3E78"/>
the city was peopled with living creatures? None of them were alive to him. He was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all the world, and he knew nobody; and whilſt he wept, he regretted his dungeon.</p>
            <p>"AT length accident brought in his way an ancient domeſtic, now a ſuperannuated porter, who, confined to his lodge for fifteen years, had barely ſufficient ſtrength to open the gate. Even he did not know the maſter he had ſerved. He informed him, that grief and misfortune had brought his wife to the grave thirty years before, that his children were gone abroad to diſtant climes, and, that of all his relations and friends, none remained. This recital was made with the indifference, which people diſcover for events long paſt, and almoſt forgotton. The miſerable man groaned, and groaned alone. The crowd, which gathered round him, offering only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known features to his view, made him feel the exceſs of his calamities, even more than he would have done in the dreadful ſolitude which he had left.</p>
            <p>"OVERCOME with ſorrow, he preſented himſelf before the miniſter, to whom he owed that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was now a burden to him. Bowing down, he ſaid,</p>
            <p>"RESTORE me again to that priſon, from which you have taken me. I cannot ſurvive the loſs of my neareſt relations, of my friends, and, in a word, OF A WHOLE GENERATION. Is it poſſible, in the ſame moment to be informed of this UNIVERSAL DESTRUCTION, and not wiſh for death? This general mortality, which to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024406_0013_0FC70F21B71EF640"/>
reſt of mankind comes ſlowly and by degrees, has been to me inſtantaneous, the operation of a moment. Whilſt ſecluded from ſociety, I lived with myſelf only; but here I can neither live with myſelf, nor with this new race, to whom my anguiſh and deſpair appear only as a dream. There is nothing terrible to me in dying; BUT IT IS DREADFUL INDEED TO BE THE LAST."</p>
            <p>"THE miniſter was melted. He cauſed the old domeſtic to attend this unfortunate perſon, as only he could talk to him of his family. This diſcourſe was the ſingle conſolation, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: For he ſhunned all intercourſe with a new race, born ſince he had been exiled from the world, and he paſſed his time in the midſt of Paris, as he had done, whilſt confined in a dungeon for almoſt half a century. But the chagrin and mortification of meeting no perſon, who could ſay to him, "We were formerly known to one another," ſoon put an end to his preſent exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence."</p>
            <p>THOUGH ſome of each generation is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dropping into the grave, the more advanced generation is moſt liable to a removal. But the youngeſt generation will ſucceed to the place of their fathers, and ſoon arrive at thoſe boundaries, beyond which they cannot paſs. Our months, our years, roll on in rapid career. Numerous generations have been already houſed in the place of ſilence and darkneſs, appointed for all the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The time will ſoon arrive, when all, in whom the crimſon tide of life now flows, will follow them, and join the vaſt majority of the dead.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:024406_0014_0FC70F25BA5D6800"/>WE ſtand as in a field of battle. Our fathers, our friends, our companions, our children, are cut down on our right and our left, and warn us of our approaching fall "in that war, in which there is no diſcharge."</p>
            <p>THE ſceptred monarch, the privileged cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and the crouching ſlave, are equally expoſed to paſs away. The learned and the illiterate, the rich and the poor, the aged and the young of each generation, muſt alike ſhift the preſent ſcene of things, and diſappear from the view of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The phyſician, whoſe friendly arm has often ſnatched his fellow men from the grave, will find all his knowledge in the healing art vain, to ſecure his own long abode with the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The miniſter of JESUS, who recommends that religion, which alone affords ſolace againſt the approach of death, muſt ſoon bid adieu to the pious and benevolent duties of his office, and leave them to be diſcharged by his ſucceſſors of the following generations. His people are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him to the end of their mortal journey, and the places, which once knew them, in the ſanctuary, on days devoted to religious worſhip, will ſhortly know them no more. A new gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration will riſe up, inſtead of the old, to attend on the inſtitutions of the goſpel, to liſten to the word of life, to offer their joint prayers and praiſes at the footſtool of JEHOVAH.</p>
            <p>WE are prone to congratulate thoſe fathers of antiquity, who ſaw whole centuries revolve over their head, and enjoyed a kind of immortality on earth. But when we remember, that ſuch lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity

would ſerve to lengthen out the woes of the miſerable, which often can be borne with difficulty during the ſhort period of the preſent race, that it would ſtrongly tempt us to forget the momentous truth, that we are pilgrims and ſtrangers on the earth—that it would harden the vicious in their iniquity (which appears to have been its effect on the old world) whilſt they viewed ſuch a long intervening period between them and the end of their courſe, the hour of their judgment; we muſt acknowledge, that life is long enough, to diſcharge the duties aſſigned us by Providence, and to prepare for that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of exiſtence, of which the preſent is the dawn.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD therefore of finding fault with the ſhortneſs and rapidity of human life in our age of the world, it becomes us to improve the portion of it, which may be allotted us, as becomes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, ſocial, and immortal beings.</p>

Do we "ſhew forth the praiſes of HIM, who hath called us out of darkneſs into marvellous light?" Do we, in fine, "believe on the SON of GOD," as glorious, as gracious? We "ſhall never die." When we ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the generations of mortals, our ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its ſhall ſoar to the heavenly paradiſe.

            <p>SUCH, my brethren, were the ſentiments, ſuch the conduct, in general, of the firſt ſettlers of New-England. Love to God, and to apparent duty, dictated their plans, and the execution of them. They deeply felt the frailty of human life, and that true worth, which religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſtamp on it. They believed, that their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, like all the preceding, would paſs away. They ſought therefore, in the wilds of America, a retreat from the impoſitions and perſecutions of the Engliſh hierarchy, that they might ſerve GOD, and their generation, agreeably to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of their conſcience. They wiſhed to hand down the moſt ſacred privileges of freemen and of chriſtians inviolate to the lateſt poſterity. They felt for the generations which were to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, and were careful to enact ſuch laws, as might preſerve the morals, and promote the uſeful and <note n="*" place="bottom">Newton has paid a laudable and increaſing attention to the public ſchools for ſome years paſt.</note> literary education of their children, and children's children, till time ſhould be no more.</p>
            <p>WITH pleaſure we learn, by the well informed tradition of our fathers, that the early ſettlers of this town exhibited, in general, that piety and virtue in their life, which has left an inſtructive leſſon, as a legacy to their children, through fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing generations.</p>

                  <p>The average annual number of thoſe who have died within ten years paſt, is one out of ſeventy. In the year 1786, a year of uncommon mortality (conſumptions and the throat diſtemper prevailing) eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen died. The average number of thoſe who died in the nine other years, is between eight and nine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, or one out of eighty.</p>
                  <p>In the whole town have died in the ten years, one hundred and ninety. A ſeventy-fifth part of the inhabitants of the whole town, died annully for ten years.</p>
                  <p>In London and Paris it is computed that one out of twenty die annually. A thirty-fourth part and three fifths of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Sweden, died annually between 1755 and 1775.—A thirty ſeventh part, and one third died annually in the kingdom of Naples for five years.—The average of annual deaths in the whole kingdom of France, for ſix years, ending 1780, was 834, 865. Reckoning the inhabitants at twenty-ſix millions (the higheſt number ſtated by the National Aſſembly) a thirty-firſt part and one ſeventh die annually.</p>
                  <p>In the Province of Vaud, in Switzerland, perhaps the moſt healthful ſpot in Europe, a forty fifth part dies annually; and in Boſton, it is computed that one out of forty or fifty dies annually.</p>
                  <p>By the bill of mortality it appears, that twenty five (more than a FOURTH part) in the firſt ſociety in Newton, lived to ſeventy years and upwards.</p>
                  <p>A Mrs. Davis died ſome years ſince at Oak-hill, aged upwards of 100 years. She ſuſtained a pious, unblemiſhed character through life, and was ſupported, in her declining years, at the expenſe of the town, with peculiar cheerfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>In my ſociety, which conſiſts of a little more than half of the town, there have been one hundred and ninety-five births within ten years. During the ſame period one hundred and forty-three ſouls (eighty two of them adults) have removed from the ſociety to other towns or ſettlements. About the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has emigrated from the reſt of the town. In the ſame peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od there have been one hundred and three marriages in the whole town.</p>
                  <p>There are now living in Newton, FIFTY NINE perſons, who have ſeen the ſeventieth year of their age, and beyond.</p>
