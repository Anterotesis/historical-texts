            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>ESSAY</hi> now before us, is Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Not only that it may be diſperſed to afflicted Family's, in a Time of <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Sickneſs,</hi> when our <hi>Paſtors,</hi> who would fain <hi>Viſit all the Sick,</hi> have not Strength to go thro' a Service, to which, their <hi>Charity</hi> diſpoſes them, as much as their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> Obliges them. The Publication alſo aims, at a Supply for our <hi>Viſits of the Sick</hi> at any other Time; for we are ſure, <hi>Them we ſhall have always with us</hi>: And we cannot <hi>Speak</hi> unto them, every thing that we mightily deſire to have them <hi>Think</hi> upon. But, You that are the <hi>Tenders</hi> and <hi>Watchers,</hi> may perhaps find your Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity's to Read a few Proper Lines unto your Patients; Which, when tis done, — <hi>O Spirit of Grace, Do thou accompany it, with thy Gracious and Saving Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>!</p>

            <head>A Paſtoral LETTER, UNTO <hi>Family's that have Sickneſs Exerciſing of them, or any one Perſon in them.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOU are ſo well Inſtructed, <hi>O our Afflicted Neighbours,</hi> that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of this Truth; <hi>Sickneſs and Weakneſs carry's in it, very ſtrong Obligations to Duty</hi>: And <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in a <hi>Family</hi> beſpeaks <hi>Duty</hi> from no leſs than all the <hi>Family.</hi> When <hi>Sickneſs</hi> comes into any <hi>Family,</hi> tho' but <hi>One Perſon</hi> ſhould be Viſited, it adminiſters a <hi>Manifold Occaſion</hi> for <hi>Serious Religion</hi> to be Exerciſed by the whole <hi>Family,</hi> even by <hi>every Perſon</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it. We have tho't it therefore a part of our <hi>Paſtoral Watchfulneſs</hi> over you, our Dear Flock, to put into your Hands, (for, alas, how many do <hi>Forget the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> delivered by us, when we manage the Publick <hi>Exhortations</hi>!) a Brief, a Plain, a Faithful <hi>Monitor</hi> of the <hi>Duty,</hi> whereto the Voice of God by <hi>Sickneſs</hi> among us, is
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001630_0004_0FB3EA1BC02D0B40"/>
aloud calling of us. Theſe are the <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,</hi> whereto your Attention is now demanded in the Name &amp; Fear of God.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> There is a <hi>Duty</hi> incumbent upon the whole <hi>Family,</hi> even upon <hi>every Perſon</hi> that can underſtand their <hi>Duty,</hi> when <hi>Sickneſs</hi> comes upon any Perſon in the Family. If any <hi>One Perſon</hi> in a Family be under any <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> there is an Holy Improvement of it, and an Improvement in Holineſs on it, whereof <hi>every Soul</hi> in the Family ſhould be ſtudious. Particularly;</p>
            <p>Firſt. Let the <hi>whole Family</hi> acknowledge, that the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of any one in the Family, is by the <hi>Providence</hi> of the Great GOD bro't upon them. When there was only a <hi>Child Sick</hi> in a Family, it was ſaid, 2 Sam. XII.15. <hi>The Lord ſtrook the Child, and it was very Sick.</hi> Tis <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in us, if we do not own, that a <hi>Sparrow</hi> falls not unto the Ground, without the <hi>Providence</hi> of God; and we are Blinder than the <hi>Owl,</hi> if we ſee not the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in it, when <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> threatens to lay any of us or of ours, in the Ground. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God is to be eyed, as in all the <hi>Comforts</hi> of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001630_0005_0FB3EA1D37830388"/>
ſo in all the <hi>Troubles</hi> of it. When <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> does <hi>Happen</hi> in a Family, it comes not meerly by <hi>Hap.</hi> It was ſaid, Amos III.6- <hi>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> We may ſay, <hi>Shall there be Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a Family, and the Lord hath not ſent it</hi>? When <hi>Health</hi> is taken away from any of us, tis by the Hand of Him, who is, <hi>The God of our Health.</hi> It was the <hi>Creation</hi> of God, which put our Body's in their good Order at the firſt: If <hi>Sickneſs</hi> put our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's out of Order, there is the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, ordering of it. Are we <hi>Sick</hi>? We muſt <hi>Eſteem</hi> our ſelves to be <hi>Stricken and Smitten of God, and Afflicted.</hi> Indeed, there are ſome <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> in which the more <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand</hi> of God, (and of His Angels,) may <hi>Scourge</hi> the Sinful Children of men. The <hi>Leproſy,</hi> as it often Arreſted, firſt, the <hi>Houſes,</hi> and then the <hi>Garments,</hi> and then (upon Impenitency) the <hi>Body's</hi> of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> in the Holy Land, ſeems to have been one of thoſe Diſeaſes. And even the moſt Famous Pagan Phyſician, adviſes the Practitioners of Phyſick, to mind, whether there be no extraordinary Stamp of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand</hi> in thoſe Diſeaſes, which they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001630_0006_0FB3EA1EACEC6978"/>
undertake to meddle with. But <hi>every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,</hi> whatever be the <hi>Next Cauſe</hi> of it, muſt be look'd upon as proceeding from <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Firſt Cauſe</hi> of all. Is any one <hi>Sick</hi> in a <hi>Family</hi>? Let every one there ſay, <hi>'Tis the Hand of God that is now upon the Family.</hi> GOD is now fulfilling that word; Mic. VI.13. <hi>I will make thee Sick in ſmiting thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, Secondly. Should not this <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> be accompanied with a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Humiliation</hi> of the <hi>whole Family,</hi> when <hi>Sickneſs</hi> is in a Family? Tis highly Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that it ſhould be ſo. Where <hi>Sickneſs</hi> comes, the Complaint is that, Pſal. CXLII.6. <hi>I am bro't very Low.</hi> Certainly, it becomes a Family to <hi>lie very Low</hi> before God, when He ſhall ſend <hi>Sickneſs</hi> into it. <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in a Family, does cauſe no little <hi>Sorrow</hi> to the Family. Tis an unſpeakable Encumbrance unto a Family, to have <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in it; it Encumbers a Family with a multitude of Inconveniences. The Pale, the Swollen, the Waſted, &amp; perhaps the Spotted Faces of the <hi>Sick</hi> in the Family, are ſuch as our Heavenly Father has been <hi>Spitting</hi> upon: Shall <hi>He Spit in our Faces, and ſhall we not be Aſhamed</hi>? A Family under the Rebuke of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001630_0007_0FB3EA2034319280"/>
God by <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> is then to take that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, 1 Pet. V.6. <hi>Humble your ſelves under the Mighty Hand of God.</hi> No <hi>Weary Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> I beſeech you, when weary Days, and weary Nights, thro' <hi>Sickneſs</hi> are appointed for you! Tis GOD, that hath appointed 'em. Humbly own the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God; Say, <hi>Lord, Thou mighteſt have made All Sick, as well as One</hi>! Humbly own the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God; Say, <hi>Lord, We all deſerve to be Sick, and are Puniſhed leſs than our Iniquity's deſerve</hi>! Humbly own the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, &amp; Submit unto the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in the Family, as a <hi>Croſs</hi> of His lying upon us. The <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may be called a <hi>Potion,</hi> which our Lord Himſelf has mingled for us: It becomes us to ſay, <hi>The Cup which my Heavenly Father orders for this Family, ſhall not I drink of it</hi>? Imitating the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> [Pſal. XXXIX. 9, 10, 11.] Humbly ſay; <hi>Lord, I will be Dumb, and not open my Mouth, becauſe thou dost what is done in the Family; Tis the ſtroke of thy Hand, that is upon us in our Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; We are conſumed by the blow of thy Hand. Tis thy Rebuke, that makes what is deſirable here to Melt away</hi>!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sickneſs</hi> bringing ſuch an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001630_0008_0FB3EA21AE1AD370"/>
upon a Family, methinks, it ſhould alſo bring a <hi>Reformation</hi> into the Family. When a <hi>Diſtemper</hi> comes into a Family, tis very certain, it ſhould <hi>Cure</hi> every <hi>Diſorder</hi> in that Family. All the Griefs &amp; Groans of a <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon in the Family, are ſo many Pungent Sermons, for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of all that is amiſs; Lively Sermons upon ſuch a Text as that; Job XXII.23 <hi>Thou ſhalt put away Iniquity far from thy Tabernacles.</hi> When <hi>Sickneſs</hi> comes into a Family, it is a <hi>Day of Adverſity,</hi> wherein every one in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould <hi>Conſider,</hi> how they have Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, &amp; Reform all their own Miſcarriages. But eſpecially, it now concerns the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Family, ſo to take the Warning from the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in his Family, as to Reform e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that may be there Provoking to God. My Friend, Let the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> there put thee upon awful Tho'ts, what ſhall now be done, that <hi>Family Piety,</hi> and <hi>Family In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and <hi>Family Government,</hi> may more flouriſh in thy Family, than heretofore. Moſt of all, If any <hi>Maſter</hi> of a Family, hath been ſo very Criminal, as to neglect <hi>Family Prayer,</hi> let him hear the Cry of the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in his Family unto him, thus Articulated;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001630_0009_0FB3EA232DFD7000"/>
               <hi>Oh! Neglect Family Prayer no Longer</hi>! Now call thy Folks together; tell them that thy <hi>Family,</hi> whereto the God of Heaven ſpeaks by the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> now upon it, ſhall be no longer <hi>Prayerleſs</hi>; tell them thou art afraid leſt God go on to <hi>pour out His Fury</hi> in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe than <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> upon a <hi>Family that Calls not on His Name</hi>: Fall down upon thy Knees in the midſt of them, &amp; ſpread the Sins, the Wants, the Fears, &amp; the Deſires of thy <hi>Family,</hi> as well as thou canſt before the Lord. <hi>Happy &amp; Healthy, that Sickneſs, which thus Reforms the Family that it comes into</hi>!</p>
            <p>More than ſo; Fourthly. If it be a Time of <hi>General Sickneſs,</hi> we ſhould all in General joyn in the Methods of Devotion, to obtain a ſtop to the Judgment, by the Efficacy of the <hi>Great Sacrifice for the Congregation.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Sickneſs</hi> rages in a Place; and not one or two, but many <hi>Family's</hi> are Viſited. Now 'tis a Time for all the <hi>Family's</hi> in a Neighbourhood, Unanimouſly to Concur in more than ordinary Supplications. The Cry of a Raging and Spreading <hi>Sickneſs</hi> to a whole Neighbourhood, is that, Jon. III.8. <hi>Faſt, and Cry mightily unto God, and turn every one from his Evil Way.</hi> But that the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001630_0010_0FB3EA24B1996B10"/>
may become Effectual, there is one Signal and Glorious point of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be obſerv'd. There are <hi>Deſtroying Angels,</hi> as with <hi>Drawn Swords,</hi> by a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God, inflicting of ſuch a <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> for the <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Vexation</hi> of the Inhabitants. The way to prevail with God, for the preventing of ſuch a dreadful Commiſſion, is to Bring &amp; Plead a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> It was of old ſaid, Numb XIV.46. <hi>Bring Incenſe, go quickly, &amp; make Atonement; for there is Wrath gone out from the Lord; the Plague is begun.</hi> But what <hi>Sacrifice</hi> have we to Plead in this Caſe? None truly, but the Alſufficient <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We are then to Plead this with God; <hi>O Moſt Glorious God; Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath Suffered that juſt Wrath of thine, which is due to us for our Sins: Let the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſave us from thy Wrath: Oh, Pity us, and Pardon us, and let us be ſaved from horrible Sickneſſes, for the ſake of thoſe Expiatory Sufferings wherein our Lord Jeſus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>; The Believers who ſo Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before God the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, on the behalf of the <hi>Towns</hi> where
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001630_0011_0FB3EA2637D16208"/>
they Live, are the very <hi>Gapmen</hi> of the Towns. And by this <hi>Faith</hi> in that <hi>Great Sacrifice,</hi> we may particularly procure our own <hi>Houſes</hi> to be <hi>Sprinkled</hi> with that <hi>Blood,</hi> be which our <hi>Family's</hi> may be <hi>preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Oh! Nothing ſo Grateful to the Bleſſed God; no Plea ſo Powerful, as to mention the <hi>Blood</hi> of His <hi>Beloved</hi> Son before Him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> There is a <hi>Duty</hi> incumbent on ſuch in the Family, as are not <hi>lying under Sickneſs,</hi> when <hi>Sickneſs</hi> lies upon others in the <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> A <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of any one in a Family, gives many <hi>Healthful Counſils,</hi> to thoſe that are yet in <hi>Health.</hi> For;</p>
            <p>Firſt. The <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of any One in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſhould engage the reſt that are in Health to be very <hi>Thankful</hi> for their Health. It would indeed be worthy of a, <hi>Lord, have Mercy upon us,</hi> on the Door, if all in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſhould be <hi>Sick.</hi> An <hi>Healthful</hi> Perſon, has always very great cauſe to be a <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Perſon.

               </gap> for <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> Our <hi>Health,</hi> when
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001630_0012_0FB3EA27C569B630"/>
others are <hi>Sick,</hi> as 'tis a <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſo 'tis an <hi>Unmerited</hi> Favour. <hi>Why me, Lord</hi>! When others are Pining in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there can be no Reaſon aſſign'd for the Mercy of God, in ſparing our Health, but only the <hi>Meer Mercy</hi> of God. This affords a very cogent Reaſon, why we ſhould be very Thankful for the Mercy! Well then; See thy <hi>Sick</hi> Friend Sweating, Hear thy <hi>Sick</hi> Friend Sighing, under <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> when <hi>Chaſtened on their Bed</hi>: Their <hi>Soul abhors all manner of Meat,</hi> they <hi>Draw near unto the Gates of Death,</hi> they Pant, they Faint, they can hardly Speak: But all this while, they <hi>Cry aloud</hi> unto thee: <hi>Oh! Prize thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Health, and Praiſe Merciful God, for a Mercy that never can be Prized Enough</hi>!</p>
            <p>Secondly. And yet, <hi>Prepare for Sickneſs</hi>! The <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of One in a Family, bids all the reſt, <hi>Prepare to be Sick.</hi> The <hi>Feeble Voice</hi> of the <hi>Sick,</hi> it as Notably, as if they ſhould <hi>Lift up their Voice like a Trumpet,</hi> Speaks unto us, that; Iſa. XL.6. <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs, and all the Goodlineſs thereof, is as the Flower of the Field. Sickneſs</hi> in a Family, is a Lecture upon <hi>Humane Frailty</hi>: And the Language of it, is <hi>Oh! Do with thy Might
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001630_0013_0FB3EA292B648158"/>
what thy Hand finds to do, while thou art in thy Health; and leave not unto a Time of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the doing of thoſe things, for which there is no Time in Sickneſs</hi>! If it be Neceſſary for us, to make, A WILL, that Right and Peace, may not be injured when we are Dead, a <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon in a Family will ſhow us, that we ſhould not have this to do, when we come to be <hi>Sick.</hi> But above all, Tis Neceſſary for us, to make a <hi>Timely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for Eternity.</hi> This PROVISION is made, How? By Conſenting to every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, in the <hi>Covenant of Grace; By</hi> Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as our <hi>Prieſt,</hi> our <hi>Prophet,</hi> and our <hi>King; By</hi> Accepting of, the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which our <hi>Surety</hi> has Wrought out for us, that we may therein ſtand Righteous before the <hi>Judge of All</hi>; And <hi>By</hi> Complying with the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who offers to <hi>Renew</hi> us, and <hi>Poſſeſs</hi> us, and <hi>Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rt</hi> us to God, and <hi>Unite</hi> us to Chriſt, and <hi>Reſcue</hi> us from Sin, and <hi>Prepare</hi> us for Heaven. Immortal Soul; <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon thee to do theſe things, and Wo unto thee, if thou do them not.</hi> But will a <hi>Sick Bed</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a <hi>Proper Seaſon,</hi> for the doing of ſuch things? It may be, you have not heard,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001630_0014_0FB3EA2AAAAEB260"/>
(as I have) the Miſerables upon a <hi>Sick Bed,</hi> Crying out with inexpreſſible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; <hi>In my Health, I made no Preparation for Death! And, O Sir, It is not now too Late? Is it not now too Late?</hi> But the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in your Family, may terribly inculcate this Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon you; <hi>Don't, Oh! Don't put off your Turning to God, until you come to be Sick: You'll make Poor, Mean, Sickly, and moſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Work of it, if you do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thirdly. Have they that are in <hi>Health,</hi> nothing to do for the <hi>Sick</hi> in the Family? Yes; We ſhould <hi>Exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whom we ſee under <hi>Sickneſs; and ſo much the more, as we ſee the Day approaching,</hi> wherein they are to take that Important Step, which their Everlaſting Weal or Wo turns upon. Oh! Drop as many <hi>Sound Words</hi> as we can, upon our <hi>Sick Friends.</hi> And Speak <hi>For</hi> them, as well as <hi>To</hi> them. Carry them to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by our <hi>Prayers</hi> for His Help, as they did of old, and found it not in vain to do ſo. Yea, Pray <hi>With</hi> them too, as well as <hi>For</hi> them, if it may be done with Decency. <hi>Husbands,</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> in the Family, can do no leſs. It is ſaid, Jam. V.16. <hi>The Prayer
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001630_0015_0FB3EA2C36AE0C00"/>
of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick.</hi> Nor ſhould we with-hold any Charitable Aſſiſtences, that we can give towards the Relief of the <hi>Sick.</hi> To Relieve the <hi>Sick,</hi> is an <hi>Angelical</hi> Office and Service! When the Peſtilence made horrid havock in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> 'twas noted, That the <hi>Heathens</hi> ran away from their deareſt Relations, under the dread of the Infection; when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> bravely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Lives in looking after the <hi>Sick,</hi> and with a ſort of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> even <hi>Dy'd</hi> themſelves to ſave others from <hi>Death.</hi> Yea, our Charity ſhould look <hi>Abroad,</hi> as well as <hi>at Home</hi>; and be able to ſay, <hi>My Soul is grieved for the Poor.</hi> The <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in thy own Family, O Good Man, ſhould awaken thy <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the <hi>Sick</hi> Elſewhere, whoſe <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Penury</hi> is greater than thine, and who are deſtitute of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Supports as thy <hi>Sick</hi> ones are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded withal. There is a Wonderful Encouragement; Pſal. XLI. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that Conſiders the Poor, the Lord will De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him in time of Trouble; the Lord will Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, and Keep him Alive, and he ſhall be Bleſſed upon the Earth; The Lord will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him upon the bed of Languiſhing; Thou wilt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001630_0016_0FB3EA2DAD0FC828"/>
make all his Bed in his Sickneſs.</hi> Every Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable is a Cordial, beyond the Richeſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir</hi> in the World! Will you take Notice of it, O ye who <hi>Deviſe Liberal Things</hi>!</p>
            <p>And, Fourthly. With their <hi>Alms,</hi> there ſhould go up the <hi>Prayers</hi> of them that are in <hi>Health,</hi> as a <hi>Memorial before God,</hi> that He may keep them in <hi>Health.</hi> It is a due Courſe, Pſal. XLII. 8. <hi>My Prayer is unto the God of my Life.</hi> Let the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one in a Family, ſet all the reſt a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they may be Preſerved from <hi>Sickneſs</hi>: A Praying, <hi>Preſerve me, O God, for in thee do I put my Truſt</hi>: A Praying, <hi>Lord, Deal bountifully with thy Servant, that I may Live and Keep thy Word.</hi> In thus Praying, we ſhould urge the agreeable <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of our God; ſuch Promiſes as we find in the NINETY FIRST PSALM; A Pſalm, which may be of Singular Uſe to us, eſpecially when Epidemical and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> are formidable among us.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> When <hi>Sickneſs</hi> is in a Family, there is a <hi>Duty</hi> incumbent upon the <hi>Sick</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as upon the reſt in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Perhaps, <hi>O Languiſhing Perſons,</hi> you
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001630_0017_0FB3EA2F470E6198"/>
may hear theſe Leſſons Read unto you, if you are thro' <hi>Sickneſs</hi> not able your ſelves to Read them.</p>
            <p>Firſt; <hi>Repentance! Repentance!</hi> That is the <hi>Sick</hi> Mans main Duty &amp; Intereſt; tho' tis well if <hi>Repentance</hi> then come Soon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to Be Good, or to Do any Good. Now to carry on this <hi>Repentance,</hi> there muſt be ſeveral Actions. If <hi>Sickneſs</hi> be come upon you, Examine the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> I mean, the <hi>Sin</hi> that is the <hi>Moral Cauſe</hi> of it. When <hi>Sickneſs</hi> overtakes us, there is uſually ſome <hi>Cauſe</hi> to be enquired after. God will have us to know, <hi>That He hath not without a Cauſe done all that He hath done unto us.</hi> [See 1 Cor. XI. 30.] Upon the Arreſt of any <hi>Sickneſs</hi> then Conclude, <hi>Here is a Sickneſs come for Something</hi>! And immediately fall to enquiring what <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy</hi> of God with us may be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Cauſe of our <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> Make that Petition, Job X. 2. <hi>Shew me wherefore thou Contendeſt with me.</hi> And then, Let both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> have a fair Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. It is ſaid, <hi>Fools becauſe of their Tranſgreſſions, and becauſe of their Iniquities are Afflicted</hi> with <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> When we have
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001630_0018_0FB3EA30D76CFA90"/>
Diſcovered the <hi>Folly</hi> that has bro't our <hi>Sickneſs</hi> upon us, Oh! Confeſs it and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail it before the Lord, and Ask the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of it, thro' the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, which Cleanſeth from all Sin.</hi> Yea, but the <hi>Sick</hi> Man muſt expreſs this <hi>Repentance</hi> of <hi>Every Sin. Sickneſs</hi> cauſes <hi>Loathing.</hi> O <hi>Sick</hi> Man, Let all <hi>Sin</hi> become of all things the moſt <hi>Loathſom</hi> unto thee. If thou haſt any meaſure of Strength for it, Let the EXPOSITION of the TEN COMMANDMENTS in the <hi>Catechiſms</hi> be diſtinctly Read over unto thee; Make a pauſe upon every Clauſe, and ponder, <hi>Have not I Omitted what is thus Required by God</hi>? And, <hi>Have not I Committed what is thus Forbidden by God? Judge</hi> thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as worthy to be <hi>Judg'd</hi> unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miſery's, for theſe thy Sins. But be ſure to Reflect upon that Fountain and Bundle of all Sins, thy <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and <hi>Know the Plague of thy own Heart.</hi> Thus Mourn for all thy Sins, even till thou doſt <hi>Water thy Couch with thy Tears.</hi> And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Mourn for thy <hi>Loſs of Time</hi>: A Sin big with bitter Lamentations. In <hi>Sickneſs</hi> we loſe much <hi>Time,</hi> and are threatned that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001630_0019_0FB3EA3235196A10"/>
we ſhall have but little more <hi>Time.</hi> Now is a <hi>Time</hi> for us to Mourn, <hi>Lord, I Mourn that I have ſo Sinfully Miſpent my Time.</hi> When the <hi>Ax is laid unto the Root of our Tree,</hi> in <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> what can we do, but Mourn for our <hi>Unfruitfulneſs</hi>? Behold now the Lord JESUS CHRIST, that <hi>Saviour and Great One,</hi> making a Tender of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and of His <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> even unto the <hi>Chief of Sinners.</hi> Oh! Hearken to Him; for now He ſays to thee, Diſtreſſed Sinner, <hi>Look unto Me, and be Saved</hi>! Let ſo Gracious a Tender, Melt thy very Heart within thee; with a Diſtreſſed, an Agonizing, an Aſtoniſhed Soul, declare unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Lord, I fly to thee as my Refuge, my Helper, and my Portion, and by thy Help, I give my Self back unto thee</hi>! Do this once, Do it again, Do it a thouſand times over, Do it as long as thou haſt a Breath to draw in the World. Thy <hi>Life,</hi> the Life of a Never dying <hi>Soul</hi> depends upon it.</p>
            <p>But is it not now altogether <hi>Too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </hi> It is true, A <hi>Death-bed Repentance</hi> is very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom True! Oh! Mourn, That thou haſt made it <hi>So Late.</hi> Let the <hi>Late<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Secondly; It becomes a <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon, Sincerely, Entirely, Chearfully, to Leave unto the Great God, the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of the <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Adore the Great God, O <hi>Sick</hi> Man, as the Abſolute <hi>Lord of thy Life.</hi> Be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Dy</hi> or to <hi>Live,</hi> juſt as the Great GOD ſhall Pleaſe to Appoint.

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God ſhould even <hi>Refer</hi> it unto thee, whether to <hi>Dy</hi> or to <hi>Live,</hi> be ready to Reply, <hi>I would Refer it unto Him again</hi>! Say, Pſal. XXXI. 15. <hi>Lord, My Times are in thy Hand</hi>; And add, <hi>Lord, It is fit, that thou alone ſhouldeſt have the Diſpoſal of all my Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; A <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon ſhould be more Deſirous to be Delivered from <hi>Sin,</hi> than from <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> Be more <hi>Sick</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> O <hi>Sick</hi> Man, than of any <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> About the Rage of thy Sinful Paſſions, Let this

be thy Senſe, <hi>This is worſe than any Feaver.</hi> Let no <hi>Pain</hi> in thy <hi>Fleſh</hi> be ſo Painful as This; <hi>There dwells no Good Thing in my Fleſh. Sickneſs</hi> makes thee <hi>Liſtleſs</hi> and <hi>Feeble</hi>; Oh, Let thy <hi>Liſtleſsneſs</hi> to, and <hi>Feebleneſs</hi> in, the Work of God, be more Uneaſy to thee. It was ſaid, Iſa. XXXIII. 24. <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am Sick; the People ſhall be Forgiven their Iniquity.</hi> Count it better to have <hi>Iniquity</hi> taken away, than to ſay, <hi>I am not Sick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly; If God will have the <hi>Sickneſs to be unto Death,</hi> yet let it be <hi>unto the Glory of God,</hi> by your <hi>Dying in Faith</hi>: A <hi>Faith</hi> whereof the <hi>End</hi> will be <hi>the Salvation of the Soul.</hi> It is an excellent <hi>Epitaph</hi> upon ſome; Heb. XI. 13. <hi>They Dy'd in Faith.</hi> You <hi>Live</hi> by it: Oh! <hi>Dy</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sick</hi> bro't thus <hi>Low,</hi> are doubtleſs now, no longer Able to Read; But let ſome Faithful Attendent, watch an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity now to Read theſe Lines unto them.</p>
            <q>Diſtreſſed Sinner; Behold the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly JESUS, the Man on the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, in whom the Eternal Word and Son of God has Choſen His Everlaſting

Habitation, that <hi>Saviour and Great One,</hi> making a Tender of Himſelf, and of, His <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> even unto the <hi>Chief of Sinners.</hi> Be Amazed at this Grace! Lift up thy Cry to Sovereign <hi>Grace,</hi> for Help to Believe and Embrace this moſt Gracious Tender, which of thy ſelf thou art not Able to do. Then with an Agonizing and an Aſtoniſhed Soul, Declare unto the Glorious JESUS, <hi>Lord, I fly to thee, as my Refuge and my Saviour. Oh! Do thou now apply to my Repenting, Humble and Contrite Soul, the Pardon, which thou didſt by thy Precious Blood Purchaſe for me, while I was yet an Enemy of God. But with a Pardon, Oh! Beſtow upon me that Bleſſing, which my Soul would value as much as any Pardon; The Bleſſing of a New Heart: The Bleſſing of an Heart filled with the Love of God: The Bleſſing of an Heart always to chuſe the Things that Pleaſe the Lord.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Having thus led them into the Path of Life; Let this one more Paragraph be Read unto them.</p>
            <q>O Man; Apprehenſive of <hi>thy Soul drawing near unto the Grave, and thy Life

unto the Deſtroyers</hi>; if God will have thy preſent <hi>Sickneſs</hi> to be <hi>unto Death</hi>; yet let it be <hi>unto the Glory of God,</hi> by thy <hi>Dying in Faith,</hi> even a <hi>Strong Faith, which will give Glory to God.</hi> Thy <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be thy <hi>Life</hi>; and thy Victory over <hi>Death. Dy</hi> like <hi>Stephen,</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a Soul into the Hands of the Faithful JESUS. Let thy <hi>Dying</hi> Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, be with all poſſible Frequency and Fervency in thoſe Terms; Pſal. XXXI. 5. <hi>Lord, Into thy Hands I Commit my Spirit. Dy,</hi> Perſwaded, that thy <hi>Soul</hi> ſhall never <hi>Dy.</hi> Fully Believe, the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi>; Departing hence, think, <hi>I am going to the Immortals. Dy,</hi> Perſwaded that thy <hi>Body</hi> ſhall after <hi>Death</hi> return to <hi>Life.</hi> Strongly Believe <hi>The Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> when thy <hi>Mind</hi> is taking a Farewel of thy Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Body. Dy,</hi> Perſwaded of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bleſſedneſs, which is <hi>Reſerved in the Heavens</hi> for the Righteous. If thou canſt attain to it, Come to that, <hi>I deſire to be Diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is by far the Best of all</hi>! Reckon <hi>Death</hi> which is the <hi>Laſt Enemy,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001630_0024_0FB3EA39AE2E6728"/>
to be turned into a <hi>Good Friend,</hi> by the Influences of the Dear JESUS, who <hi>was Dead and is Alive, and behold, He Lives for evermore</hi> . The Sting of <hi>Death</hi> having been once faſtned on our Surety JESUS, now, even Triumph over it, and ſay, <hi>O Death, Where is thy Sting? Thou wilt only ſtrip me of my Sin, which is my worſt Enemy; and fit me for my Everlaſting Reſt.</hi> Finally, <hi>Dy,</hi> Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the God with whom <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs find Mercy,</hi> will take a <hi>Fatherly Care</hi> of <hi>thine,</hi> after thou ſhalt be Dead and Gone; Perſwaded, for thy <hi>Orphans,</hi> that <hi>when their Father and their Mother forſakes them, the Lord will take them up.</hi> Oh! By <hi>Faith</hi> leave them in the Hands of thy Saviour, and then ſay with the Martyr; <hi>I have Left them with an Able and a Faithful Guardian.</hi> My Friend, May thy <hi>End</hi> be in this <hi>Peace of God</hi>!</q>
