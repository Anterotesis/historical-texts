            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My loving, and moſt tenderly beloved <hi>PARISHIONERS.</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is almoſt needleſs to remind you of the anxious concern, generally attending the final ſeparation of friends, neighbours and acquaintance. This concern is augmented by the uncommon warmth of friendſhip; the intimacy of neighbourhood, and the length of time, wherein the parties have been acquainted with each other.</p>
            <p>Though I have delivered two public diſcourſes to you, upon the occaſion of my removal, ſtill I could not depart without leaving with you ſomewhat further of my ſentiments and advice committed to paper, hoping they will be conſidered as my laſt, and in ſome ſenſe as my dying expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Born as I have been and nurtured among you, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led your devotions almoſt twenty-eight years, of which term, more than twenty-four years I have been in holy orders, and have (within and without my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) adminiſtered the holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, to a great number of devout and exemplary communicants; have admitted into Chriſtianity by Baptiſm no leſs than 122 perſons of riper years, and 1749 infants; have joined in marriage 176 couple; have committed to the ſilent grave in full hope of their riſing again at the laſt day, the bodies of 219 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed perſons; have received by profeſſion, into the boſom of our excellent church 215 heads of families. From the year 1759 to the preſent time, the number of conformiſts to the church has increaſed from 75 to more than 280 families, excluſive of the many that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020835_0003_0FB138BF15802680"/>
have emigrated, and the few that have apoſtatized: Within the before mentioned period, I have (upon a moderate computation) travelled by land and by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more than the extent of three times the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the terraqueous globe.</p>
            <p>The perfect unanimity ſubſiſting for ſuch a length of time both among the people, and between the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and their miniſter, has been extenſively obſerved and mentioned, to the great honour of my people, and ſatisfaction of myſelf. You have indeed exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a laudable example of charity and concord; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which has been admired by all, extolled by many imitated by few!</p>
            <p>How ſhall I find words to expreſs my gratitude for the numerous and eſtimable favours that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at your hands! Your undiſſembled friendſhip— your unremitted benevolence—your unmerited can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour—your unlimited approbation, has made impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions on my mind too deep to be eraſed by the greateſt change of circumſtances—too durable to be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the hand of time: for every mark of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial love, unſhaken fidelity and eſteem, candour and generoſity, zeal for the ſervice of God and his church, be pleaſed to accept of my ſincereſt acknowledgments, my warmeſt gratitude. Whitherſoever Heaven ſhall guide my ſteps, the dear remembrance of my former pariſh will never loſe its place in my mind: a ſenſe of your affection and beneficence, will remain deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves on the fleſhy table of my heart.</p>
            <p>Not is my gratitude confined to thoſe of our own church only, many people of other profeſſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have ſhewn the moſt lively demonſtrations of a derential regard for me, and of courteous benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards me: this regard and benevolence, merit
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020835_0004_0FB138C208220BE8"/>
the warmeſt gratitude of which my heart is ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſhall not be forgotten as long as memory holds a ſeat in my brain.</p>
            <p>Never, perhaps, was a miniſter and people ſeparated with more reluctance on both ſides; never, perhaps, was their mutual regret more equally balanced. As our eſteem and affection have been reciprocal, ſo is the grief of our parting. Nor was I ever ſenſible, till the preſent criſis, to what height your good will and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for me have ariſen.</p>
            <p>But having with much ſatisfaction and undeſerved applauſe expended the prime and beſt part of my life among you, and in your ſervice; it can by no means be expected, that we can much longer remain in the preſent life, reciprocally a comfort and aſſiſtance to each other. Should my life, and the lives of ſuch of you as are nearly coeval with me, be ſo lengthened out as to complete a full century, how ſwiftly would the remaining fifty years glide away! How ſoon would the laſt half of the century expire! And even much the greater part of this ſhort remaining time, would be evil days and years, in which we ſhould truly ſay that we had no pleaſure. Since then the ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſpace, that we can expect or even wiſh for, muſt paſs away and forever diſappear like the wind, or like the chaff which the wind driveth away; ſince time itſelf is as vain and fleeting as a ſhadow, a vapour or a dream, and the remaining part of our lives, can be but as it were, "dream of a dream, and ſhadow of a ſhade." How can the difference be thought very material, betwixt the parting of friends at the preſent time, and their parting twenty or forty years hence? Nay, on ſome accounts, it is more eligible to part from our friends at the middle ſtage of life, when old
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020835_0005_0FB138C2D20D9118"/>
age and infirmities but begin to oppreſs us, than to dwell with them till we become (for reaſons very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious) a burden and vexation to each other. But ſtill it is grievous, it is melancholy, it is painful, for us to be ſeparated; and would it not be as much, or more painful, to be ſeparated after we have dwelt together twenty or forty years longer? Length of time endears friends more cloſely to each other, and the interchange of benign offices, ſtrengthens the bands of amity, in ſome proportion to the time lent us by indulgent Heaven, partly for the purpoſes of exerciſing thoſe offices. The well known brevity and uncertainty of life, teach us the moſt obvious leſſon of reſignation, at bidding adieu to our deareſt friends. For the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and precariouſneſs of life, clearly diſplay to our ſight, the vanity of all temporal enjoyments, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of all friendſhips and connexions on this ſide of eternity, to ſatisfy a rational being, or to afford complete happineſs to a mind immortal. Therefore let us dry up our tears, and like perſons of ſound reaſon, give all theſe arguments their proper weight, and bid farewell to each other with entire ſubmiſſion to the will of Heaven, with a decent chearfulneſs, and a lively hope of meeting again in a better country, in a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>As to the motives inducing me to a removal. There is a general accuſation thrown out againſt the miniſters of all parties and religions (whether in jeſt or earneſt I know not) that they are wholly actuated by worldly intereſt, by an inſatiable deſire of tempor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gain. I hope miniſters of the goſpel do not in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral deſerve ſuch ſevere cenſure. The clergy of our Church I am well convinced do not. To myſelf I know ſuch an obſervation cannot be applied: and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020835_0006_0FB138C9410759F8"/>
hope I have demonſtrated by many years conduct, and ſhall hereafter demonſtrate, that I am not chiefly guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a motive ſo mean and ſordid. And I cannot but query, whether, laymen who are moſt liberal of ſuch reflections on the clergy do not judge us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome avaricious principles lurking in their own breaſts? Whether they would not I ſay (in our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) act from the ſame ſiniſter views, which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to us? It is reaſonable, and a duty incumbent on every man to have regard to his worldly intereſt, in a certain reſtricted degree, it is the will of God that we ſhould by proper means make proviſion for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and even creditable ſupport of ourſelves and our families; and as far as is in our power by honeſt means, to leave ſomewhat behind us for the benefit of our families after our deceaſe. But this temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt muſt not by any means be the ſole or even the chief motive of our actions. God forbid, that any man, much more that any miniſter of the goſpel, ſhould ſet a greater value on this world than on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! on time than eternity! The whole world in competition with one ſoul, is as the ſmall drop of the bucket, the imperceptible duſt of the balance.</p>
            <p>A weighty inducement to my removal aroſe from gratitude to the pious and venerable ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts, who have been my principal and moſt conſtant ſupporters. Reaſon and gratitude bound me to pay an high regard to their commands. They directed me to remove myſelf to Digby in Nova-Scotia.</p>
            <p>What influence the difference of conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Connecticut and Nova-Scotia may have on me, is not proper for me to mention.</p>
            <p>The people of my new miſſion, though earneſtly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020835_0007_0FB138CDA4550E50"/>
deſirous of enjoying the benefits of public worſhip and ſacraments, had no miniſter of any denomination whatever of conſtant abode within the compaſs of eighteen miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more than three hundred families diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through a large extent of country, will receive a ſupply of their ſpiritual neceſſities by my new appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Inſomuch, that there can be no doubt, of my being able to do more for the advancement of God's glory, the kingdom of Chriſt, and proſperity of the church in my new reſidence, than among you; how then can I be blamed for the meaſures I have taken?</p>
            <p>The ſituation of the place, and the diſpoſition of the inhabitants, were ſtrong perſuaſions with me, to expend the remainder of my days here. Every one hath his particular opinion and humour. Let others think and ſpeak as they pleaſe of this place, I never ſaw a place or people more agreeable to me in all points.</p>
            <p>Nova-Scotia is a peninſula, is ſituate in a happy climate, one of their beſt towns is Annapolis, from which Digby is diſtant about eigteeen miles. Digby is ſituate on a riſing ground, upon the Baſon and in the county of Annapolis Royal; and contains perhaps about one hundred families. On one ſide of the town is a moſt amiable proſpect of the Baſon, and a line of houſes and farms, upon the adjacent ſhore, around the whole; on the other ſide is an agreeable walk, through pleaſant woodlands, for about ſix miles to St. Mary's Bay; thence continues an agreeable paſſage by land or water, upon the Bay of St. Mary, for twelve miles further, till we come to Siſſaboo, a fruitful village, poſſeſſed by a courteous, well-diſpoſed people. The ſituation, and air of Digby, is exceeding healthy, and the ſoil is far from barren. I have ſeen ſome inſtances
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020835_0008_0FB138CEE6F54828"/>
of vegetable productions, in that place, ſurprizing and almoſt incredible. The harbour is good; with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high tide, and a plentiful ſupply of fiſh of many kinds.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe circumſtances recommend the country to my choice, ſo much as the worthineſs and good diſpoſition of the Inhabitants. Gentle and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, kind and hoſpitable, muſt every unprejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon allow them to be. Neither are they addicted to ſuch vice and prophaneneſs, as the people of Nova-Scotia are throughout the ſtates repreſented to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. During the whole time of my reſidence at Digby, I have not heard one obſcene word, and but very few prophane words. In paying regard to the times, places and inſtitutions of divine worſhip, they are equal, or ſuperior, to the greateſt part of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or populous towns of New-England. To all this may be added, as a very important benefit to the ſettlers, that much the greater part of the idle, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, litigious and helpleſs people, ſuch as were in all probability likely to become a public charge, ſuch as would not labour, or were inclined to more profligate morals, have emigrated to the ſtates, chiefly to New-York: and there is great hope, that the few of this character remaining among us, will ſhortly follow their example: In whoſe ſtead, honeſt, induſtrious people from Europe, and from the ſtates, charmed with the advantages of the place, and the ingenuouſneſs of the people, are coming in, and bid fair to be uſeful members to the town, and the province.</p>
            <p>The great and eſſential principles of chriſtianity I have ſo conſtantly inculcated in my adminiſtrations, that it is needleſs to repeat them; ſuch as a rational, firm, well eſtabliſhed faith, an uniform holineſs of life,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020835_0009_0FB138D05D944018"/>
purity of heart, charity, mercy, meekneſs, patience, temperance, juſtice, and all other fruits of the ſpirit. Theſe general and well known ſubjects I will omit and give you a few words of advice upon ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matters.</p>
            <p>Let me beſeech you then, by all our paſt friendſhip and preſent regret, to attend conſtantly and devoutly on the public worſhip of God; when you cannot have one in holy orders to officiate amongſt you, ſtill meet together, and read the common prayer and ſome good printed ſermons amongſt yourſelves. I have found it an unexceptionable obſervation, that where ever a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation make a conſtant practice of celebrating God's worſhip upon every Lord's day, they have more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious knowledge, a more active ſpirit of devotion, they have more regard for God, his word, his miniſters and his inſtitutions, than is to be found among other people. In ſmall congregations who can but ſeldom have a man in holy orders among them, the meeting together and worſhipping God, is a laudable and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying practice; a practice which cannot be too much commended or encouraged; and which has preſerved an underſtanding of Chriſtianity, and a ſpirit of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al devotion amongſt the epiſcopal people of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut.</p>
            <p>If my laſt words to you, and as it were my dying ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, can have influence upon you, I intreat you never to admit of any material alterations in your form of public devotion.—Indeed to admit of no other alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, than ſuch ſmall ones, as revolutions may render abſolutely neceſſary. Even ſmall, unneceſſary or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton innovations, are more dangerous, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, than is generally imagined. When a ſpirit of idle innovation is let looſe, none can foretell when
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020835_0010_0FB138D1DD936558"/>
or where it will ceaſe. When a conſtitution in church or ſtate becomes diſſolved or unhinged, it is no eaſy matter to reſettle it.—Your ſafety and your honour, conſiſts in a firm and ſteady adherence to the church of England—ſhould you once looſe that church, you will not eaſily find a better.</p>
            <p>The public has been already preſented with three new books of common prayer, the Methodiſt, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian, and another without a particular name, and more are daily expected. In all that I have ſeen, they appear to have rejected the very beſt parts of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the church of England. Some have reprobat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Creeds entirely, and an eſſential article of the Apoſtle's Creed; ſome have expunged the Gloria Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri and have mended the Lord's Prayer—ſome have aboliſhed all Holidays, becauſe forſooth they have been abuſed; not conſidering that the ſame argument would hold equally concluſive againſt the Lord's Day, both the Sacraments, and all that is good.</p>
            <p>Could the numerous authors of the new common Prayers agree in one, uniform book for divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, like that of the Engliſh Church; they could, with a better face, invite you to comply with them: But ſhould they agree in one form, yet their beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers could not produce a form, by any means, equal to the liturgy of the church, which is the collected wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ages and nations.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould care ſo little for God's worſhip, and be ſo void of the chriſtian temper, as to think the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the church too lengthy, I ſhould think it abſurd to enjoin a ſhorter form upon the Church to pleaſe them. The perſon who thinks an hour and an half in the forenoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an hour and a quarter in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, of one day in the ſeven, too much time for the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020835_0011_0FB138D363CCCF68"/>
worſhip of God would be beſt ſatisfied with no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at all.</p>
            <p>If the liturgy of our church can be altered for the better, how comes it to paſs that the united councils of the church and ſtate in England (the moſt judicious nation in the world) have not found it out and made the requiſite alterations? When you ſhall be enticed to adopt a new form of worſhip, follow the advice of the wiſeſt of men: <hi>Meddle not with them that are given to change, for their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suffer me to exhort you to preſerve unity and godly love among yourſelves, peace with your neighbours, and unity with all men. <hi>Finally, brethren, farewell Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
