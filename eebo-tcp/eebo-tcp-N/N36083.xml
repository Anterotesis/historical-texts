            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WELCOME, ye humble vales! thrice welcome, ye peaceful shades!—here innocence finds a sweet retreat—lone contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation here resides with happiness her guest. The reverend Hermit discovered true wisdom in directing us to such a delightful retreat. Secluded from the world, its folly, pomp and deceit; where daring guilt triumphs over unprotected innocence: where suspicion poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the cup of joy; and pleasure bears the sting of remorse in her bosom, or langour, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety and disgust succeed.—You, my cousin, have ever placed happiness in the rural shades: May I be taught by you, whom I have too long despised, to woo her in these sacred haunts.</p>

                  <p>You need not now, my dear cousin, cease to despise the pursuits I made in search of happiness. My delight was not the peaceful shades of retirement, where no obtruding guest dare enter. The grove, the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047118_0004_1022AD16C6857EA0"/>
rill, had no charms for me, if some sighing Damon did not there breathe forth the praises of Pastorella. But these hallowed groves fill my soul with horror; and I look with shame upon my past life. But who are these? They cannot be the gentle tenants of the forest, for like us they seem the children of despair.</p>

And by these branching oaks which seem coeval with time; by the landscape dressed in every charm of nature, I think the spot not far distant that bounds our wishes:—And look! a lovely form ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, whose innocence and cheerfulness bespeak her an inhabitant of these delightful shades.</p>

                  <p>Fair strangers, for such I am sure you are, these uncultivated fields boast not the courtly manners you possess. May I, without the imputation of impertinent curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity, enquire from whence you came? If, haply, some misfortune brought you to this place, I may afford some assistance; or if your feet unwarily led you astray, I may direct you to regain your weeping friends, who must fear to trace your steps in these unfrequented wilds.</p>

                  <p>Your kind enquiries, fair shepherd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess, far from being impertinent, bespeak the benevolent heart, which, undaunted, through these distant fields we came to seek. Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an aged Hermit, famed for wisdom, we came in search of happiness, who no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er blesses courts or cities with her smiles. He bade us seek the lonely dwelling of Urania, where happiness found a loved retreat, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the pillow of straw, and strewing the thorny path of life with her choicest flowers. The young, the amiable Florella, will give also, by her example, a lively picture of the wise precepts of Urania. If you are, as my heart suggests, if you are Florella—Oh, deign to direct us in the paths to happiness!</p>

But would you ask the council of the truly wise; I will with pleasure conduct you to the hospitable cottage of Urania, which stands in yonder thicket of poplars. Yet, think not, ladies, you will there find rural splendor; poverty has long been her guest; cheerfulness and benevolence her attendants. For, tho' poor, she has much to give; though doomed to earn her daily bread, the unfortunate never left her cottage in sorrow. A soothing tear, a sigh with the distrest; instruction, conveyed in the mildest terms, give releif to the broken, and comfort to the wounded heart.</p>

Your stores are not large; but you can shew the benevolence of your hearts, by being sweet tempered, amiable and kind to your play-mates.—Never wound the feelings of any one.

reflection or content: Each fashionable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musement crowded my time: My fortune and beauty generally procured me admirers suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to please my vanity: I sang and played well; dressed and danced to admiration—my mind knew no higher cultivation. Yet mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic lost its charms, if some sweeter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ball-room, in which I found most delight, oft clouded my face with sorrow, if some more elegant dress or graceful dancer drew the eyes of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude from me. I had been so long addressed with flattery, no other sounds could soothe my ear. If any one gave me the most gentle admonition, they were sure to meet my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment. And while my rank, and the splendor of my appearance at each public place, attracted the emulation and the envy of most of my sex, my heart was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:047118_0011_1022AD4863808428"/>
to possess the various talents which have given renown to the most excellent authors. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry first caught my enraptured soul—I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to unite the sublimity of Milton; the satire of Swift; the graces of Pope; the learning of Jonston; the pensive muse of Gray, and the pleasing softness of Thomson; or the various talents of each, united in Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare. History, Logic and Astronomy, had each their turn to rule; Gibon, Robertson and Hume; Lock, Newton and Halley, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately, inspired my emulation. Thus, while I searched each science, and acquired much fame in all; I found myself an object of dread to one, and contempt to the other half of the world; till, convinced I have yet something to learn before happiness will reside in this breast, I came here for your kind instructions.</p>

Left to cultivate my mind as I pleased, I followed its romantic turn; read nothing but novels, or the most tender poetry, and fancied these painted life in its true colours; contemned

the manners of the world, and flew to silent groves and weeping rills.

But no such swain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; altho', with all my follies, I had many real and deserving lovers—yet they did not possess the ideal virtues I admired. My friendships were equally fallacious: Formed from accident, or adventure, as my romantic heart dictated, they alternately deluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and left me, a prey to grief and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: New profession caught my easy belief—and still I trusted, and was still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

                  <p>Till now, I have passed heedlessly thro' life, without any principle for my guide; careless of the morrow, but ever repining at the present hour. My only misfortune has arisen from ignorance. I never wished to learn any thing that would give me the least trouble to obtain. My aunt, who loved me as a daughter, and undertook my education, was too indulgent to my weakness: I had masters of every kind; who, while they were amply rewarded, did not hesitate to indulge my inclinations, and represent my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and improvements to my aunt, in

the most flattering light. Thus, while my stature attained the size of woman, my soul was but a child. My time passed away in slothful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> busy trifles: Too old to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mused with childish sports; too indolent to read, and too ignorant to be agreeable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, I found myself totally neglected. Visits and public places, filled the drear vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of my mind; tho' these were ever tasteless, by the small share I could take in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the company. Sick of fashion, which has hitherto swayed me, and tired of my own follies, I have learnt enough to be displeased with myself, and submit my future conduct entirely to your direction.</p>

I gave my hand, or rather my father gave it for me, to a man, rich in possessions, but poor in every quality of the soul that can render a woman happy. As my understanding opened, I discovered the despicable character of the man I was united to; possessing no love for me, nor the least deserving my esteem; yet squandering my fortune and his own in fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish bargains and expensive pleasures. Young, gay and thoughtless, I sought those amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments abroad, which would alleviate the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery I felt at home; and, altho' I conducted myself with prudence (as I thought) I found
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:047118_0014_1022AD24DDFB3778"/>
my character injured among my friends, and destroyed with the rest of the world. I am not sensible of any action that deserves severe censure: I mixed with the world; enjoyed its bustle and admiration; and, tho' flattery soothed my ear, I am not conscious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the pleasure I felt, in one instance. But that will not restore my good name; and till that is restored, happiness can only be found in solitudes like this. Here, forgetful of the world, and by the world forgotten, I may rest, till age has despoiled this form of the power to please; and then, perhaps, I may be free from the pursuits of envy and detraction.</p>

I was not obliged to marry a man I could not love: Erastus preferred me to all my sex; I chose him from a thousand lovers: Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion was considered as the certain path to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. But alas! six months has not elapsed, e'er Erastus ceased to pay me the least atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a lover. At first I wept: I tho't my charms diminished, tho' my glass told me they were not; and a crowd of admiring eyes, at each public place, proclaimed it told me true, and my Erastus must be unfaithful. I in vain upbraided him with perfidy. A cold look, that would once have driven him to despair, and the most earnest entreaties of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:047118_0015_1022AD4BC45E7438"/>
was now met with indifference, and sometimes the word childish would escape his lips. At length he returned my reproaches with bitterness—we parted—and I came hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hide my sorrows in your friendly retreat.</p>

                  <p>Your candor, dear ladies, deserves my warmest praise. I pity your follies, and love your merits. How few, oh, sacred vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, follow the paths thy bright foot-steps lead! But since you have sought my humble roof to learn her abode, I will direct you with candor, as far as my imperfect mind will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, what my excellent mother first taught me, and a long series of years, fraught with experience, has shewn to be truth. Know then, that the first sources of good or ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, arise from education. Nature forms but few monsters, and not many unhappy tempers: 'Tis the impression we receive in childhood, that fixes the character: The mind, never at ease, if not implanted with good, will produce evil; and first impressions are seldom effaced. Euphelia sighs for splendor, dress and admiration, the sources of too many women's unhappiness. Would you excell the whole sex in loveliness, bestow not all your attention upon your outward charms. A beautiful woman without a mind, is seen with pleasure at first, but like a novel, once read, is never looked at the second time. Not that I despise the power of beauty; I would only render it more lovely; it is the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047118_0016_1022AD278734C1D0"/>
and if the heart and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing answer the first impression, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irresistable. Beauty casts lustre upon virtue—virtue adds sublimity to beauty. By adorning your mind, you will conquer that impatience of seeing other women preferred before you; as you will then see no woman is formed to conquer all hearts, tho' she may gain universal admiration. It will also teach you to despise the flattery of fools, and wish for the esteem of the good and great.</p>

                  <p>I pity the misfortunes of Pastorella. A soul so tender; an imagination so lively, would, with early culture, and maternal care, have proved a bright ornament to the world. Poetry and novels should be read chiefly for amusement, and not to form our opinions: Life, in those performances, is generally painted in too high colours: By taking our ideas from them, we are apt to look upon the ordinary transactions of life, as insipid—its characters, vulgar. Could you find a man, possessing all the accomplishments of your ideal hero, you could not be happy without firmness of mind. Sensibility is so much the fashion, that those who have it not, affect to possess it; and those who really possess it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their feelings to such excess, that, from a virtue, it becomes a weakness. Fortitude takes nothing from female beauty, or delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but adds lustre to sensibility. Look not on friendship as false, or love deceitful. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver choose a friend from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047118_0018_1022AD2A111FE940"/>
who cannot see your foibles, and treats you rather as an idol, than a friend: Such a lover flatters but to betray—or humbles himself to tyranize as a husband. Nothing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is without alloy, which plainly points to us not to place our whole happiness on this uncertain world, where the fleeting shadows of bliss but hover for a moment in our view, and wing their airy flight to regions beyond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then listen to my councils, and you may yet be happy. A young and beautiful woman, who is not beloved, or who has an abandoned husband, should be particularly watchful of her conduct. Every man looks upon such a woman with pity, which inclines the heart to love. The world is censorious—if you are pleased with flattery, and permit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be paid you, it is a tacit acknowledgement
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:047118_0020_1022AD2CD4CFE950"/>
of the pleasure it gives; and that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement lays you open to censure. Would you be really admired, seek not for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, following the duty of a mother, make your children your happiness; and can there be a greater, than that of forming their young minds to every virtue? Can you regret time spent in so useful and pleasing an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? Without it, they may fall into greater improprieties than their mother, and equal vices with their father. By pursuing this line of conduct, far from receiving cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from the world, you will be held forth, as a pattern of female excellence. A situation like yours, is the only one where merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the fullest praise, unmolested by the shafts of envy: And, perhaps, by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you may reclaim your husband; which, for your children's, if not for your own sake, you must certainly wish.</p>

                  <p>How, my dear madam, shall I ever repay your kind reproofs? Yes, you have indeed enlightened me—I had forgotten I was a wife—I had almost forgotten I was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, while my sweet babes were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to strangers, for a mother's attention, I was, at best, but wasting my life in hearing insipid encomiums on my beauty, and shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tasteless amusements. But the world shall no longer have cause to censure, or my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to complain: I renounce every pleasure for their fake; and will forget every former

                  <p>Your misfortunes, beautiful Sophia, arose from receiving too much adulation. A lady, possessing great personal charms, if she has not more than a common share of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a good understanding, is always unhappy as a wife. Accustomed, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, to the delusive strains of flattery, she expects adoration, instead of common sense. You reproached your husband with inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and knew not, perhaps, or did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that beauty ceases to charm the husband. The reign is over, and sober reason takes her turn to rule. If you wish to regain the love of Erastus, endeavor to obtain those charms which will gain his esteem and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship—shew that you can be sweet—tempered and prudent, as a wife—rational and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a friend and companion. Never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, from your husband, the adulation of a lover—it is inconsistent with human nature. You will, by this conduct, if he has a good heart and understanding, gain a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ascendency over the heart of Erastus, than he ever felt for you in the days of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled beauty.</p>

                  <p>Continue in your good resolutions, dear ladies, and you will certainly be as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as this world will admit of. And would our whole sex pursue this rational plan of happiness, it would reform the errors of man; merit, would direct their choice—reason, the bands of love—and each dwelling rise a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to contentment; then man would no longer affect controul, nor woman sway. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of beginnings: Little differences embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the married life; and if once contention is allowed, adieu to love.

                  <p>Do not deceive yourselves, dear la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Think not retirement the only and certain road to happiness. 'Tis a plant too delicate to flourish in our earthly soil. Tho' the face wears the smile of contentment, it may conceal a sickning heart. Esteem none happy from appearance—all have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of misery. Uranai, my more than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' content and cheerful, has often drank deep of the bitter cup of affliction. Born in affluence, and bred in splendor—united to the best of husbands, fortune seemed to smile upon their wishes. War, cruel and unnatural war, deprived her of all these bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. With a heart torn with anguish for her slaughtered lord, doomed to wander destitute over those fields, once her own—in age oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to earn bread for her helpless babes—Yet patient in distress, she looks forward with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation and hope; she knows the hand that wounds has power to heal.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:047118_0026_1022AD34AC345478"/>
Yet may I ask one question—Florel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, why do you prefer retirement, if you do not find it far happier than a public life?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Flor.</speaker>
                  <p>To me the world is an empty void. My life, tho' short, has been a scene of sorrow. I will briefly relate the painful tale. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left an only brother and myself heirs to a splendid estate. Florio had no prudence; by different follies he became a beggar. My heart, at that time engaged to a worthy youth, felt all his misfortunes as my own; for he wanted only prudence to make him the best of brothers. Eugenius, my disinterested, my generous lover, proposed renouncing my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in favor of my brother, who had learnt prudence from adversity, and wanted only fortune to unite him with an amiable and worthy lady, to whom he had been long ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently attached. I agreed to the proposal with transport, and the next week was to have united us all in the bands of Hymen; when the house where I lodged caught fire; my apartment was high; the flames had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready reached the stair-case; but Eugenius, fearless of danger, rushed thro' the flames, and carried me to a place of safety. But alas, in preserving mine, he sacrificed his life. Never shall I forget the painful hours he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for my sake. When I had paid the last sad rites to his memory, I saught the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my dear Urania, who had bred me from infancy, and with a small share of my
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:047118_0027_1022AD5C9F421340"/>
fortune, to make her days less toilsome, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the world and left my brother the sole possession of the wealth I could not enjoy. Eugenius also bequeathed me his large estate: But as he had worthy and poor relations, I refused it, as to me it would have been merely a loan from the needy; to them it was a source of happiness. My dear mama has taught me patience, and, with her, I wait con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly till the curtain of eternity shall be drawn, and shew me the justice of those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes I have so often repined at feeling. But you have no such melancholy cause to justify renouncing society. You have friends to please, duties to perform, and fortunes to spend in acts of beneficence.</p>

Forgive—forgive, thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful servant, who has so often murmured at her cruel destiny. And oh! wilt thou forgive, if I drop a tear once more to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my child? Why was I not allowed to know she lived—why was I not permitted to enjoy her dear society?</p>

                  <p>My dear madam, restrain your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or they will destroy your weak frame. Repine not at the lot assigned by a being equally just and beneficent.
