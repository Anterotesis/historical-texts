            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005584_0006_10269258E63952F8"/>remarkable and Illuſtrious. His Kingdom at firſt was mainland Territory, without any Sea-Port or Navigation, but by his Conqueſts he extended his Dominions from Sea to Sea, even to the River that is from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to the Red-Sea, and to the River the great River <hi>Euphrates;</hi> ſo that what was ſaid of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on another Occaſion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45. by way of Alluſion, may be applied to <hi>David, And he ſhall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace between the Seas in the glorious holy Mountain.</hi>

            <p>We have an Account of <hi>David</hi>'s Conqueſts and Victory's, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>And after this it came to paſs that David ſmote the Philiſtines, and ſubdued them, and took Metheg-ammah out of the Hand of the Philiſtines. Metheg-ammah,</hi> that is the Bridle of <hi>Ammah,</hi> or according to our modern Way of ſpeaking, a Key of the Country, as <hi>Peluſium</hi> was to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and as <hi>Louiſhourg</hi> is to <hi>Canada.</hi> V. 2. <hi>And he ſmote Moah, and meaſured them with a Line, caſting them down to the Ground: Even with two Lines meaſured he to put to Death, and with one full Line to keep alive.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>David alſo ſmote Hadadezer the Son of Rehob, King of Zobah, as he went ot recover his Border at the River Euphrates.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>When the Syrians of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus came to ſuccour Hadadezer King of Zobah, David ſtew the Syrians Two and twenty Thouſand
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005584_0007_1026925CACF863E0"/>Men.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>And David put Garriſons in Syria of Damaſcus, and the Syrians became Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to David, and brought Gifts; and the Lord preſerved David whitherſoever he went.</hi> He conquered <hi>Edom,</hi> and in him was fullfilled what was propheſied of old concerning the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> This was not true of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> perſonally, but we ſee it was ſo in the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> for we read, Ver. 14. <hi>And he put Garriſons in Edom, throughout all Edom put he Garriſons, and all they of Edom became David's Servants:</hi> He made an entire Conqueſt, and treated them as People reduced, or bro't into Subjection: By this Acquiſition he laid himſelf open to the red Sea, and became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of thoſe two famous Sea-ports or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, viz. <hi>Elath</hi> and <hi>Ezion-Geber:</hi> By his Conqueſt and Trade he amaſſed great Riches ſo as to be able to provide for the building of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Behold now in my Trouble I have prepared for the Houſe of the Lord an hundred thouſand Talents of Gold, and a thouſand thouſand Talents of Silver, of Braſs and Iron without weight.</hi> This Gold and Silver according to the common Account of a Talent is in Quantity ſo great, as Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> obſerves, that if it were melted down into a Maſs it would be more than the hollow Content of the Temple, or as big as the Temple it ſelf: This being
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005584_0008_1026925E37043698"/>a very extraordinary Repreſentation, ſome have endeavoured to ſolve the Difficulty by ſaying that it is probable that we do not know exactly what a Talent is; but this Solution doth not ſeem ſufficient to remove the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; for in the firſt Place the amount or greatneſs of the Sum ariſing from the known Quantity of what a Talent makes, is the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty: We would remove this Difficulty by ſaying, that we may be miſtaken about a Talent, or that we don't know what a Talent is. What ſeems to be a rational and probable Anſwer to this Objection is, that whereas we find in the account of theſe matters, that there is a careful Diſtinction maintained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures between Gold and fine Gold; by Gold we are to underſtand Gold in the Oar, and fine Gold is Gold when purified or refined; it is probable that when the Ships were ſent to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the ſhorteſt and moſt natural Way we can think of: The beſt Oars both of Gold and Silver, yield but one ſixth Part of refined Silver or Gold; when it is conſidered in this Light, this reducing it to one ſixth Part brings it down to ſuch a Sum as one may rationally ſuppoſe that a Prince who had made many Conqueſts, and carried on a great Trade, might provide and lay up for a Deſign in

Jehoſaphat,</hi> and thoſe other Princes who retained their Dominions over <hi>Edom,</hi> continued the Eaſtern Trade from thoſe Ports of <hi>Elath</hi> and <hi>Ezion-Geber;</hi> ſo long they continued to make a conſiderable Figure in the World; but when they loſt this Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were reduced to an inland Trade, they then declined in Power and Wealth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in Sin, and abounded in Iniquity, were dependant on, and tributary to others. It may be laid down as a Rule, that ordinarily no Kingdom, State or Province will ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to any conſiderable Degree of temporal Greatneſs, Polity, Power and Influence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trade and Navigation: It was this, together with the Situation natural and artificial

            <p>What was ſaid of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> may in ſome Meaſure be applyed to that Place of great Strength, which has been lately Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for which we come together this Day to bleſs the LORD for his marvellous Kindneſs ſhewed in the Reduction of ſuch a ſtrong City, <hi>Ezek. 27.3. Say unto Tyrus, O thou that art ſituate at the entry of the Sea, which art a Merchant of the People for many Iſles, thus ſaith the LORD GOD, O Tyrus, thou haſt ſaid, I am of perfect Beauty: Thy Borders are in the midſt of the Seas, thy Builders have perfected thy Beauty.</hi> And, Ver. 25. <hi>The Ships of Tarſhiſh did ſing of thee in thy Market, and thou waſt repleniſhed, and made very glorious in the midſt of the Seas.</hi> And with the Regard to the great Fiſhery of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and Trade ariſing from that Manufacture, we may apply what was ſaid of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Ver. 33. <hi>When thy Wares went forth out of the Seas, thou filledſt many People, thou didſt inrich the Kings of the Earth, with the multitude of thy Riches and of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe.</hi> It is remarkable what GOD has done for us in putting into our Hands ſuch a ſtrong Place happily ſituated for Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to defend our ſelves, and annoy our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: This Fortreſs being ſurrendered to our

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005584_0012_10269267DA79EC70"/>of the Story, and many Things tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Time of this Siege, evidenceth that they lay encamped long, and that it was an Attempt full of Danger, for we read that the Shooters ſhot from the Wall: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this Place was a Thing of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and of ſo much Glory that <hi>Joab,</hi> who was a great General, and inured to Victory and Conqueſts, yet wiſely thought it beſt to ſend for the King to come and take the Honour of reducing the City, ſo <hi>Joab</hi> when he had cut them off from Water, and ſaw the Siege in a hopeful Way to ſucceed, ſent for the King to come with a Reinforcement, as we may ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.26, 27. <hi>And Joab fought againſt Rabbah and the Children of Ammon, and took the royal City: And Joab ſent Meſſengers to David, and ſaid, I have ſought againſt Rabbah, and have taken the City of Waters: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gather the reſt of the People together, and encamp againſt the City, and take it: Leſt I take the City, and it be called after my Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is probable that in this Diſpenſation of Providence, he had ſeen and experienced the marvellous Kindneſs of GOD in the Reduction of this ſtrong City.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD hath ſhewed us his marvellous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in what concerneth the late Expedition, by diſpoſing the Minds of the Country to ingage in that Affair with ſuch Ardor and Zeal.</hi> When the Expedition was projected and ſet on foot, the chief of our Colonies, and His Excellency Governour <hi>Shirley,</hi> who under GOD, was the Spring of that Motion, when he ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, with a general Plan of the Operation to the other Governments, publick Bodies and private Perſons appeared mightily diſpoſed to engage in the important Affair; thus it may be ſaid as with Reſpect to King <hi>David,</hi> in a great

                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.14. <hi>And he bowed the Heart of all the Men of Judah, even as the Heart of one Man.</hi> High and Low, Rich and Poor concurred in the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if any were otherways diſpoſed, yet they were borne down with the ſtrong Torrent of a general Inclination.</p>
               <p>If the upper Orders of Men had not concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Expedition muſt have failed; if the lower Ranks of Men had not been ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, the grand Deſign muſt have come to nothing: So that we ſee that the Head cannot ſay to the Foot, I have no need of you: All Orders and Degrees of Men were ſo united that there was no Schiſm in the Body.</p>
               <p>Such was the united Inclination of People in <hi>New-England,</hi> that notwithſtanding the great Charge of ſuch an Undertaking, and their own Poverty, yet as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Their deep Poverty abounded unto the Riches of their Liberality: For to their Power (I bear Record) and beyond their Power, they were willing of themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Inſtance of GOD'S marvellous Kindneſs in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <hi>That what was Concerted and Projected here, was Acceptable and well Approved by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Powers in</hi> GREAT.

                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005584_0015_1026926F1B2E9A58"/>The Packquet-Boat had a ſafe Paſſage, altho' it was in the depth of Winter; the Meſſenger had a favourable Anſwer from the Board, and (as we have hèard) was diſpatch'd in Twelve Hours; Ships were ordered to aſſiſt in that Expedition. But what is an Inſtance of marvellous Kindneſs was this, That before that time, Commodore <hi>Warren</hi> (whoſe coming was agreeable to the Wiſhes and united Deſires of the whole Country) had received Orders to come with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Ships here to this Country; had this Order been ſent after the Meſſenger ſent from hence did Arrive, it muſt in the common courſe of Things, have been too late; had the Enemy's Store-Ships entred and ſupply'd the City, this would have rendred the Reduction of the Place difficult, if not impracticable: The Ship <hi>Vigilant</hi> was large, in all probability it would have proved that her Sides were too thick, and her Metal too heavy for our ſmall Shipping. That the <hi>Commodore</hi> ſhould be Ordered hither before our deſigned Epedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was known to them who gave that Order, is a wonderful Providence; it is GOD'S Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and not Man's that did direct: <hi>This is the LORD'S Doings, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes,</hi> Pſal. 118.23.</p>

3. Another Inſtance of GOD'S marvellous Kindneſs, was, <hi>That the Affair was managed and carried on with ſuch Secreſy, that it was not known to the Enemy, nor ſo much as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</hi> Very much of the Affair was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, agitated, and carried on in the Winter Seaſon, in a dead Time of the Year, when there is but little Communication either by Sea or Land: Yet after all, we and our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being upon the ſame Continent, it is of GOD'S Kindneſs, nay, it is an Inſtance of his <hi>Marvellous</hi> Kindneſs that this important Deſign was hid from them; it was hid from them even a long time after the Expedition was over, ſo that after the ſtrong Place was Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, they came boldly there as to their own Home; were Enſnared and Taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having opportunity to ſtrike one Stroke: Their caſe was not unlike to that of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> of whom the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Smite them with blindneſs,</hi> 2 King. 6.18. — <hi>And He ſmote them with blindneſs, — And he ſaid follow me; but he led them to Samaria, and they ſaw and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held they were in the midſt of Samaria.</hi> That an Affair of this nature, known to ſo many, about which there muſt be many imployed, and ſo much done in Preparation for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, it is marvellous that the Enemy did by no means come to the Knowlege of it; when it was commonly ſaid among our ſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005584_0017_10269273681951E0"/>That the Enemy knew it 'ere this time: One ſaith to another, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> can never keep a Secret! Well, I believe that before this time, that the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> know all the Affair as well as we. But GOD hath dealt with us not only better than we deſerve, but even better than our fears: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the LORD, who hath ſhewed us his marvellous Kindneſs in a ſtrong City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Inſtance of marvellous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <hi>The fitneſs of the Weather for ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi> It was fine Weather for a long time beyond what was uſual at that time of the Year, nay, beyond what was ever known. In ordering the Seaſon, human Skill fails, and Strength can do nothing: It is GOD who commands the Winds and the Seas and they obey him. Had not GOD had the Winds in his Fiſt, and bound up the Waters as in a Garment, how difficult, how dangerous the Navigation? Had GOD <hi>ſent,</hi> nay, had he not prevented the uſual Storms of the Seaſon and the Roughneſs of the Sea, a great Fleet of Tranſports muſt have been greatly Expoſed: Had not GOD appeared for them, that muſt have been their caſe, which we find painted in ſuch lively Colours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.25. <hi>For he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005584_0018_10269276C69D0228"/>commandeth and raiſeth the ſtormy Wind, which lifteth up the Waves thereof; they mount up to Heaven, they go down again to the Dephts; their ſoul is melted becauſe of Trouble? they reel to and fro and ſtagger like a drunked Man, and are at their wits end.</hi> Our Forces were not only favoured with good Weather in their Paſſage, but alſo when they lay Incamped, which was a marvellous Kindneſs; eſpecially conſidering the early Seaſon, the coldneſs of the Climate and the length of the Siege: And what is very remarkable, immediately upon the Surrendry of the Place, the Heavens gathered to blackneſs, Rain and Cold: Stormy Weather and Goggs was in abundance, and continued long ſuch, as would have rendred the Encampment much more incommodious and difficult. Theſe were ſuch Inſtances of marvellous Kindneſſes, as our Enemies could not but take Notice of; ſo that we may ſay, <hi>Their rock is not as our Rock, even our Enemies themſelves being judges, Deut. 32.31.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Inſtance of GOD'S marvellous Kindneſs in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <hi>That moſt of the Land Army who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this great Enterprize, had not practical Knowlege in the Arts of War.</hi> Incamping, Intrenching, erecting Batteries, Bombarding and Cannonading, was what they had not been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005584_0019_102692791744E0F0"/>acquainted with; yet being uſed to turn their Hands to many ſorts of Work, they ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what was to be done: If they had not ſo much ſkill as regular Forces, yet they had one prime Qualification, they engaged with Reſolution and good Will; they were able-bodied Men, able to endure Labour and Fatigue; they perform'd their duty as Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and did that work which would have imployed many hundred Pioners: They were near to a Country that could ſupply them with a ſufficiency of good, ſtrong and wholſom Food, by which they were kept in heart and high ſpirit. That this is of great importance, we have the Opinion of the beſt of Judges of his time, Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who was wont to receive ſupplies of Soldiers from <hi>England,</hi> of whom he ſaid, he found it beſt to bring them to Engage the Enemy before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beef was diſſolved in their Bellies; finding by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that when they fed on cold and weak Diet, they loſt much of their Vivacity and Courage. All theſe advantages are from Him who is the Author of all good: It was He that inſtructed an undiſciplin'd Army, ſo that they might ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.1 <hi>Thou haſt tought my hands to War and my fingers to Fight.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005584_0020_1026914D30080D10"/>
6. Another Inſtance of GOD'S marvellous Kindneſs in the late Expedition, was, <hi>The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Unanimity and good Agreement between the Sea and Land Forces.</hi> Different Powers make different Claims: There are points not fully ſetled in the oldeſt and beſt eſtabliſhed Conſtitutions as to the extent of Prerogative and Liverty; the extent of Maritine of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty Powers and that of Civil: But in this Undertaking againſt the Enemy, there was an happy Concord, no Jealouſie or Emulation; the Sea and Lond Forces were ready to afford each other mutual Help and Aſſiſtance: How happy and how uſeful is ſuch Agreement? Like that of <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abiſhal,</hi> when <hi>Joab</hi> found himſelf beſet before and behind; he made a double Front, then he makes a ſhort military Oration, enough to warm the hearts and invigorate the minds of every one, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11. <hi>And be ſaid, if the Syrians be too ſtrong for me, then thou ſhalt help me; if the Children of Ammon be too hard for thee, then I will come and help thee: Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the City of our GOD, and let the LORD do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Inſtance of GOD'S marvellous Kindneſs, is, <hi>The protection and ſalvation of GOD in preſerving our Forces from the Shot
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005584_0021_1026938EAC878940"/>of the Enemy.</hi> All the Oppoſition they made at the Landing of our Men was ineffectual and inſignificant: Notwithſtanding all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Ground, the loſs they ſuſtained was greater than the damage they did. GOD in his great Mercy ſo ordered it, that when they expected our Men to Land in one place, they Landed at another place, only becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a better place; which quite diſconcerted the Meaſures and defeaned the Deſign of the Enemy. At the time of the Siege, when the Shooters ſhot from the Wall, it is wonderful that they did no more Execution: How ſhall we ſpeak of it but in the Language of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Let all thoſe that put their trust in thee rejoice; let them ever ſhout for joy, becauſe thou defendeſt them: With favour thou wilt compaſs them as with a ſhield.</hi> Pſal. 140.7 <hi>O God the LORD, the ſtrength of my ſalvation; thou hast covered my head in the day of hattel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">Another Inſtance of marvellous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD in this important Affair, was, <hi>The Health that he afforded to our Army and Pleet.</hi> It is no uncommon thing for Fleets and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, eſpecially if they ly long Incamped, to ſuffer more <hi>from the Peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, and the deſtruction that waſteth at noon-day,</hi> than from the Sword of the Enemy. This we ſorrowfully experienc'd at <hi>Wood
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005584_0022_102693904240A130"/>Creek</hi> ſome Years paſt. What is marvellous Kindneſs indeed, is this, that by the Sword of the Enemy, by the Sea, and by Sickneſs and all Accidents, we did not looſe more Lives, than out of ſuch Number, of which the Fleet and Army did conſiſt, in ſuch a ſpace of Time we have loſt at home when it hath not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a very ſickly Time; ſometimes out of ſuch a Number and in ſuch a ſpace of Times, it is probable that we have loſt many more: So that we may ſay, <hi>GOD hath ſhewed his marvellous Kindneſs in a ſtrong City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the Soldiers gone upon that Expedition with never ſo much Reſolution and good Will, yet if they had been Sick had loſt their Strength, they could not have ſuſtained the Burthen and performed Labour nèceſſary to be done; but having Health, Strength and good Will, they went through all with Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid of their great Works at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuch as were the Wonder and Envy of thoſe round about them; he gives this Reaſon for the uncommon progreſs they made, Neh. 4.6. <hi>So built we the Wall; and all the Wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time would fail to mention all the particular wonders of Providence, either with reſpect to the Expedition in general, or what occurr'd to Parties or particular Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005584_0023_1026914FA585D1D8"/>The <hi>French</hi> Deſerting and Evacuating the Grand Battery, a place of great Strength, whatever induced them to it, whether a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Men, or a Panick that ſeiſed them; whatever was the Cauſe, happy were the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and great the was the Joy on our part.</p>
               <p>The happy ſucceſs of our Cruiſers and Ships of War, in preventing the Enemy in the City from receiving Supplies of Food, Naval or Warlike Stores, was another marvellous Kindneſs conferred on us.</p>
               <p>The Bombs broke ſo near to our Men as to cover them with dirt, yet did them little harm.</p>
               <p>The whole Affairs is ſo replete with Wonders, accompanied with ſuch a train of Providences in what was antecedent or preparatory, in the time of Action, and what hath happed ſince to our Advantage and to the prejudice of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: That were not the Facts a well known Truth, the whole would appear more with the air of a Romance, than a true Hiſtory.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another Inſtance of marvellous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was, <hi>That the full Strength of the Place was unknown to us.</hi> When the great Undertaking was ſet on foot, it was ſuppoſed that the Place was Weak and but ſlenderly Fortified on the Land-ſide; ſo that it was thought that it might be Reduced by a Land Army: The Wall was repreſented on that part as low and unfiniſhed,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005584_0024_10269393C0BEF6B8"/>which was an Encouragement to ingage in the important Affair; and may ſerve as a juſt Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Project from any charge of Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But when our Men ſaw the full Strength of the Place, the heighth of the Walls, the depth of the Ditch, its ſolid Foundations and great Thickneſs; its Furniture to Offend, and the ample Proviſion made to Defend the Place, the Art and Skill with which every part was contrived and done, they were filled with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, like the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.4. And when the Queen had ſeen all <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wiſdom and the Houſe he had built, there was no more ſpirit in her; for ſhe ſaid, <hi>Behold, the half was not told me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As GOD ſometimes confounds the Wiſdom of the wiſe; here in this Affair, GOD in his marvellous Kindneſs, hath turn'd our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Unacquaintedneſs with the true ſtate of the Place to our advantage.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Another Inſtance of marvellous Kindneſs is this, <hi>That GOD hath graciouſly heard our Prayers, which have been inceſſantly put up, and done all theſe great Things for us, notwithſtanding our many repeated Provocations and Offences.</hi> When we conſider our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs for Mercies received, our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs under goſpel Means and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, our Deadneſs and Formality, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005584_0025_10269396C7595CE8"/>Injuſtice, Intemperance; when Iniquity doth ſo much abound and the Love of many waxeth cold, GOD'S Kindneſs is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſo much the more Marvellous.</p>
               <p>At that time when GOD was working Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for <hi>David,</hi> ſubjecting to him the ſtrong City of <hi>Rabbah, David</hi> had Offended greatly in the matter of <hi>Urich the Hittite;</hi> ſo that when he was brought to a due ſight and ſenſe of that great Sin; the goodneſs of GOD in doing ſuch great things for him, might raiſe in him ſo much the more exalted Thoughts of GOD'S marvellous Kindneſs in what related to the Reduction of that ſtrong City.</p>
               <p>PROP. 2. <hi>That for ſuch marvellous Kindneſs we ought to bleſs the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould bleſs the LORD in Humility. We ſhould rejoice with trembling: For he that hath lift us up may caſt us down, and turn his hand againſt us all the day long.

In GOD we beaſt all the day long and praiſe thy Name for ever at dever.</hi> King <hi>David</hi> had Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Skill himſelf, had a number of Worthy's that were famous for their Courage and Skill in War; he alſo took care to have his Subjects inſtructed in military Diſcipline, 2 Sam. 1.18. <hi>Alſo he had them teach the Children of Judah the uſe of the Bow.</hi> The Soldiers having fallen before the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> ſunk in their Courage, &amp; defective in military Skill, he makes it his firſt care to have them trained and inſtructed. It is true, Mr. <hi>Meade</hi> obſerves, in the Original it ſtands thus. He bad them teach the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> the <hi>Bow;</hi> he conjectures, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Elegy being a martial Song, was called the Bow which he would have them learn. But the ſenſe of the Tranſlators is the moſt national and natural.

The more humble any are, the more thankful they will be. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all Mercies.</hi>

We ſhould bleſs the LORD at all Times and with all our powers and faculties, Pſal. 34.1. <hi>I will bleſs the LORD at all times, his praiſe ſhall be continually in my mouth.</hi> Bleſs him when alone and in Company; diligently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe marvellous Things to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Talk of them when we ſit in the Houſe and when we walk by the Way, when we are Aſſembled (as at this Day) <hi>we ſhould Praiſe him in the great Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be our duty to bleſs GOD in the time of our Affliction, as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>The LORD gives, and he takes away, bleſſed be the Name of the LORD;</hi> Let us bleſs him when he is loading us with his Benefits and incompaſſing us with the bleſſings of his Goodneſs. <hi>Bleſs the LORD in the great Congregation.</hi> Let us not only ſpeak, but live his Praiſes. If we are truly Thankful, we ſhall be chearfully Obedient.</p>
               <p>We may <hi>Improve</hi> this in a Uſe of EXHOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION, if we can need any <hi>Exhortation,</hi> beyond what the preſent Occaſion offers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh! Let us bleſs the LORD, who hath given us the Victory, and that with ſo little Effuſion of Blood.</hi>

               <p>At a Council of War, it was Reſolved in a ſhort time to Storm the Place; GOD merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevented this, by a Capitulation and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005584_0028_1026939C78BF6F70"/>Surrender of that ſtrong Hold. Had they been obliged to make a general Aſſualt by Sea and Land, in which whole Ranks might have been cut down and multitudes torn in pieces, this would have damped our Joy, and been a ſad Alloy to all our Pleaſure: It would have been with us, as with them at the Re-building of the Second Temple, the voice of <hi>Weeping</hi> and <hi>Rejoicing</hi> blended together. Oh! Bleſs the LORD for his marvellous Kindneſs in a ſtrong City: For this place being Reduced,<note n="†" place="bottom">The Iſland belong'd Originally to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Was at firſt compriz'd in the general Name and grand Patent of <hi>New-England</hi> in 1620; but in the following Year was ſet off and included in <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> by a ſeparate Event: and ſince, in <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> comprehended in the Royal Charter of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts</hi> Province in 1691.</note> our natural Enemy the <hi>French,</hi> have not one Sea-port on the Continent on this ſide the Bay of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Bleſs the LORD and make him our Boaſt all the day, ſince by GOD'S gracious Aid our Enemy's are Subdued who Threatned, with their Ships to ſweep our Seas and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Fires with Jack-ſtaves taken from us. But bleſſed be GOD, who hath given us to ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 18.40. <hi>Thou haſt alſo given me the recks of mine Enemies, that I might deſtroy them that hate me.</hi>

               <p>We ſhall conclude this <hi>Uſe</hi> of Exhortation to Thankſgiving and Praiſe, with only Three
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005584_0029_102693A042D89F58"/>
                  <hi>Motives,</hi> which we find all laid together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.1 <hi>Praiſe ye the LORD, for it is good to ſing praiſes unto our GOD: for it pleaſant, and praiſe it comely. Good, Pleaſant</hi> and <hi>Comely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is Good:</hi> There is a real Goodneſs in it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.1. <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to ſing praiſes unto thy Name, O moſt high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ways of GOD'S Providence in the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition have been ſuch and ſo remarkable, that the Ignorant and Prophane, Careleſs and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, are obliged to own that this is the ſingers of GOD; and ſhall not the Righteous bleſs his holy Name? If it be ſo good to give Thanks, will good Men be ungrateful? Nay, that is a Contradiction; <hi>Unthankful and Evil</hi> go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Shall all Nature ſpeak forth the high Praiſes of GOD, and ſhall we be ſilent? Let our Mouths be filled with the high Praiſes of GOD; <hi>for it is a good thing to give Thanks unto the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider by way of Motive, <hi>That it is Pleaſant.</hi> Grief compreſſeth the heart, and therefore is an uneaſie thing: But Joy dilates and expands the Soul; is therefore attended with pleaſing Senſations. A Soul ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his own Sin and Unworthineſs, and yet enjoying the Overflowings of divine Goodneſs, and hath his Mind proportionably drawn out in Thankfulneſs, enjoys Happineſs and hath a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005584_0030_102693A1D006B8E0"/>true taſte of Pleaſure. Muſt it not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, ſince ſinging Praiſes to GOD in the happy Imployment and Entertainment of Angels and the ſpirits of juſt Men made perfect, and will be ſo to all Eternity. If therefore it were not pleaſant, Heaven would be no Heaven, but a place of Confinement and Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To excite to Thankfulneſs by way of Motive, conſider, <hi>That Praiſe is Comely.</hi> What is beauty or comelineſs, but a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and due diſpoſition of Parts? where there is no Symmetry or juſt proportion of Features, there is what we call <hi>Homelineſs:</hi> If ſo, then Ingratitude is not only uncomely, but even monſtrous. An ungrateful, unthankful Perſon, makes a frightful Figure; is abhorr'd by GOD and Man. Since GOD has done ſo much for us in the great Deliverances he has wrought, we can do no leſs in decency and duty, than offer up to Him a tribute of Praiſe due to him. Let us all join together and bleſs his holy Name: <hi>Both young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, let them Praiſe the Name of the LORD; for his Name alone is Excellent, his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven, and Praiſe is Comely.</hi> The moſt unexceptionable Evidence of true Gratitude, and that we are Thankful for his marvellous Kindneſs, is, <hi>That we yield to Him ſincere, chearful and univerſal Obedience.</hi>
