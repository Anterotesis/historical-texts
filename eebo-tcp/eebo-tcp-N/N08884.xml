            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FROM the eager welcome with which the former ſeries of this incomparable lady's literary correſpondence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the public, there is no room to doubt whether her poems, with the additional volume of her letters, will meet with a favourable reception.</p>
            <p>Ever lively, witty, eaſy, ſenſible, and elevated above the common level of female capacities and female modes and forms,—nothing dull, nothing inſipid or unentertaining, could poſſibly fall from her pen. She was a philoſopher in ſentiment, a moraliſt in pleaſure, and a voluptuary in taſte: in ſex a woman, in underſtanding a man. Pope gained nothing by his quarrel with this Amazon in wit; who, in return for ſome ill-natur'd inſinuations thrown at her, gave him the ſevereſt poetical chaſtiſement he ever received.</p>

               <p>—BY the publication of this lady's elegant let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, written during her travels in Europe, Aſia and Africa, her name, her wit, her abilities and fame, have been particularly diſtinguiſhed in the polite circle of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental entertainment—Elevated above the preciſion of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery and the little arts of hypocriſy, with which the weakeſt and leaſt virtuous of her ſex are often maſked, ſhe had an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack made on her reputation by an infamous ſtory—

[See Page 19.] How far the acrimony of her pen may be excuſed or even juſtified, we ſubmit to the judgment of the candid reader, for whoſe information we have taken the liberty of ſubjoining an account of the riſe and progreſs of that rancour which ſubſiſted between theſe celebrated rivals, in the words of mr. Ayres, the profeſſed panegyriſt of mr. Pope, the memoirs of whoſe life and writings he publiſhed at London, in 1745—"A certain lady of quality (ſays he, vol. 2d, page 194 and 199) took offence—Now from one ſtep of diſlike and diſguſt to another, there was a total miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mr.

could poſſibly have ever come to their knowledge; for it is to be thought that the lady, for the ſake of her own fame, would never have divulged ſo ſtrange a ſecret.—</p>
               <p>"However, as moſt ſtories of the like nature do, it gained credit, and moſt prodigiouſly exaſperated the lady, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected no opportunity of raiſing whoever ſhe could againſt Mr. Pope and his writings, imagining him the great diſperſer of this tale; and perhaps he was not entirely clear."—From the foregoing quotation, even in the opinion of mr. Ayres, mr. Pope's guilt may readily be inferred.—But if any reader yet heſitates to pronounce our literary heroine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely innocent, mr. Ayres is at no loſs to do it for him, when he adds "we think the lady's anger juſt."—Yea the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>ſwan of Thames</hi> himſelf, according to his above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned panegyriſt, is ſaid to have regretted the part he acted towards this lady: his words are "mr. Pope, towards the latter end of his time, ſaid that, ſetting apart raillery and the love of ſatire, he wiſhed he had never offended this lady."—Henceforward defamation will bluſh at the recital of ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a ſtory, which never exiſted, but in the creative fancy of this fair lady's ungenerous ſatyriſt.</p>

               <salute>My dear Girl,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſo violent a cold, that I never was leſs qualified in my life for inſpecting the heavenly bodies, and muſt content myſelf with the vulgar warmth of my dreſſing room fire, to a corner of which I ſhall be confined all this evening, and very glad to ſee you if you can attend me any time after your more learned employment.</p>
            <p>If the moon is inhabited by mortals like us, and the moſt important tranſactions among them are nothing more than kingdoms turned into common-wealths, and common-wealths into kingdoms, and theſe mighty events are produced there, as they are here, by tyranny or luſt, I have no deſire of being acquainted with its inhabitants, but can look down upon them as they do upon us. I have peeped behind the ſcenes here more than contributes to my eaſe, and by examining the wires and mechaniſm of the ſhew, the entertainment has long ſince ceaſed. Who is any longer entertained with the hocus pocus man, when he knows how the tricks are performed? In ſhort, my dear Girl, our moſt pleaſing purſuits become carrion by the time they are hunted down. I would not put you out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with a world you are but juſt beginning to enter into; but to prepare you to bear thoſe diſappointments common to all, but moſt ſeverely felt by thoſe of your caſt and mine, for I would willingly tack myſelf to any thing that is half ſo good as I know you to be, and wiſh myſelf.</p>

                           <p>Theſe ſevere Verſes owe their birth to two lines in the firſt Satire of the ſecond Book of Horace, imitated by Mr. Pope, which were ſuppoſed to point at Lady Mary Wortley Montague, under the name of Sappho. We find by the Letters of Mr. Pope, vol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, and thoſe of Lady Mary Wortley Montague late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed, that a friendly correſpondence once ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Wits, which probably did not continue much later than her ladyſhip's return into England in the year 1718. But the exact time when the quarrel between them commenced, and the circumſtances relating to it, are not eaſy, at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time, to diſcover. It is ſaid in Mr. Pope's Life, (Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia Britannica, vol. 5, p. 3413) that he was charged with propagating a ſcandalous report concerning her ladyſhip, which, it is added, perhaps he was not quite clear of. The note to that life in which this charge on the poet is to be found, has the name of Dr. Warburton annexed to it, and therefore, on his authority, may well be ſuppoſed not without foundation. If a conjecture may be allowed, it is not improbable that this was the occaſion of their difference. With reſpect to the lines which produced theſe verſes, Mr. Pope, in his letter to Lord Hervey, vol. 8. p. 196. abſolutely diſclaims any intention of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to Lady Montague, <q>In regard (ſays he) to the right honourable Lady, your Lordſhips friend, I was far from deſigning a perſon of her condition by a name ſo derogatory to her as that of Sappho, a name proſtituted to every infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous creature that ever wrote verſe or novels. I proteſt I never applied that name to her in any verſe of mine, public or private, and (I firmly believe) not in any letter or converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> What degree of credit this aſſeveration deſerves, muſt be left to the reader's determination, only obſerving, that Mr. Pope, was not very ſcrupulous in diſowning a character when the opinion of the Public was not in his favour. With equal, or more earneſtneſs, he denied that the deſcription of Timon's Villa was deſigned to expoſe that of a certain nobleman. In which particular, he has been unwarily given up by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, who, in the following note on theſe lines in the edition of 1751, ſeems to acknowledge the fact.</p>

The Editor of his works, as if conſcious that he had done no ſervice to Mr. Pope's moral character, by the above note, has ſince altered it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner: <q>Had the poet lived three years longer, he had ſeen his <hi>general</hi> prophecy <hi>againſt all ill-judged magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence fulfilled in a very particular inſtance.</hi>

                     <head>EPISTLE from Arthur Grey, the Footman,<note n="*" place="bottom">This man was footman to a gentleman whoſe daughter, a married lady, he attempted to raviſh. It appears by his trial, that he went into her room about four o'clock in the morning, armed with a piſtol in one hand, and a drawn ſword in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and advancing to the bed ſide, threatned to murder her if ſhe made any noiſe. Upon aſking him what he meant by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into her chamber in ſuch a manner, he replied, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to raviſh her, for that he had entertained a violent love for her a long time, but as there was ſo great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their fortunes, he deſpaired of enjoying his wiſhes by any means but force. After ſome reſiſtance, the lady wrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the piſtol from his hand (he having laid down the ſword) and rung the bell; upon which he ran away. He was indicted and convicted of a burglary, at the Old Bailey, in December 1721, but the ſentence was not executed, for he was reprieved, and afterwards tranſported.</note> After his Condemnation for attempting a RAPE.</head>

                     <p>I FIND after all, by your letter of yeſterday, that Mrs. D—is reſolved to marry the old greaſy Curate. She was always High Church in an exceſſive degree, and you know ſhe uſed to ſpeak of Sacheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel as an Apoſtolick Saint, who was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſit in the ſame place with St. Paul, if not a ſtep above him. It is a matter however very doubtful to me, whether it is not ſtill more the <hi>man</hi> than the <hi>apoſtle</hi> that Mrs. D—looks to in the preſent alliance. Tho' at the age of forty, ſhe is, I aſſure you, very far from being cold and inſenſible; her fire may be covered with aſhes, but is not extinguiſhed.—Don't be deceived my dear Lady, by that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and ſanctified air—Warm devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are no equivocal marks of warm paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; beſides I know it is a fact, (of which I have proofs in hand, which I will tell you by word of mouth) that our learned and holy prude is exceedingly diſpoſed to uſe the <hi>means,</hi> ſuppoſed in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command, let what will come of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011340_0022_0F86A0DF75A44CC0"/>
Such a red, ſpungy, watry noſe! Such a ſquint! in ſhort, he is ugly beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and what ought naturally to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him peculiarly dipleaſing to one of Mrs. D—'s conſtitution and propenſities, he is ſtricken in years. Nor do I really know how they will live. He has but forty five pounds a year—ſhe but a trifling ſum; ſo that they are likely to feaſt upon love and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical hiſtory, which will be very empty food without a proper mixture of beef and pudding. I have, however, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged our friend, who is the curate's land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, to give them a good leaſe; and if Mrs. D—, inſtead of ſpending whole days in reading Collier, Hicks, and vile tranſlations of Plato and Epictetus, will but form the reſolution of taking care of her houſe and minding her dairy, things may go tolerably. It is not likely that their <hi>tender loves</hi> will give them many <hi>ſweet babes</hi> to provide for.</p>
                     <p>I met the lover yeſterday, going to the alehouſe in his dirty night-gown, with a book under his arm to entertain the club; and as Mrs. D—was with me at the time, I pointed out to her the charming creature: ſhe bluſhed and looked prim; but quoted a paſſage out of Herodotus, in which it is ſaid that the Perſians wore long right gowns. There is really no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the taſte in marriage of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of your neighbour Miſs S—y, who makes ſuch waſte of chalk and charcoal when they fall in her way.</p>
                     <p>As marriage produces children, ſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren produce care, diſputes and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as it is ſaid (at leaſt by old batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and old maids) is one of the <hi>ſweets</hi> of the conjugal ſtate: you tell me that our friend Mrs.—is, at length, bleſſed with a ſon; and that her husband who is a great philoſopher, [if his own teſtimony is to be depended upon] inſiſts on her ſuckling it herſelf. You ask my advice on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and to give it you frankly, I really think that Mr—'s demand is unreaſon, able, as his wife's conſtitution is tender, and her temper fretful. A true philoſopher would conſider theſe circumſtances, but a pedant is always throwing his ſyſtem in your face, and applies it equally to all things, times and places, juſt like a taylor, who would make a coat out of his own head, without any regard to the bulk or figure of the perſon that muſt wear it. All thoſe fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpun arguments that he has drawn from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtop your mouths, weigh, I muſt own to you, but very little with me. This ſame <hi>Nature</hi> is indeed a ſpecious word, nay there is a great deal in it if it is properly underſtood and applied, but I cannot bear to hear people uſing it to juſtify what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe muſt diſavow. Is not nature modified by art in many things? Was it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011340_0023_0F86A0E0586E1AC8"/>
not deſigned to be ſo? And is it not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for human ſociety, that it is ſo? Would you like to ſee your husband let his beard grow until he would be obliged to put the end of it in his pocket, becauſe this beard is the gift of Nature? The inſtincts of nature point out neither tailors, nor weavers, nor mantua makers, nor ſemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>reſſes, nor milliners: And yet I am very glad that we do not run naked like the Hottentots. But not to wander from the ſubject—I grant that Nature has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the mother with milk to nouriſh her child; but I maintain at the ſame time that if ſhe can find better milk elſewhere, ſhe ought to prefer it without heſitation. I dont ſee why ſhe ſhould have more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do this, than her husband has to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ve the clear fountain, which Nature gave him to quench his thirſt, for ſtout Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Port, or Claret. Indeed if Mrs.—was a buxom, ſturdy woman, who lived on plain food, took regular exerciſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed proper returns of reſt, and was free from violent paſſions (which you and I know is not the caſe) ſhe might be a good nurſe for her child; but as matters ſtand, I do verily think that the milk of a good comely cow, who ſeeds quietly in her meadow, never devours ragouts, nor drinks ratafia: nor frets at quadrille, nor ſits up till three in the morning elat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gain or dejected with loſs,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011340_0023_0F86A0E0586E1AC8"/>
I do think that the milk of ſuch a cow or of a nurſe that came as near it as poſſible, would be likely to nouriſh the young ſquire much better than hers. If it be true that the child ſucks in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's paſſions with her milk, this is a ſtrong argument in favour of the cow, unleſs you may be afraid that the young ſquire may become a calf; but how many calves are there both in ſtate and church, who have been brought up with their mother's milk?</p>
                     <p>I promiſe faithfully to communicate to no mortal the letter you wrote me laſt—What you ſay of the two rebel Lords, I believe to be true; but I can do nothing in the matter.—If my projects don't fail in the execution, I ſhall ſee you before a month paſſes. Give my ſervice to Dr. Blackbeard—He is a good man, but I never ſaw in my life ſuch a perſecuting face cover a humane and tender heart. I imagine (within myſelf) that the Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field prieſts, who burned the proteſtants in the time of Queen Mary, had juſt ſuch faces as the Doctor's. If we were papiſts I ſhould like him very much for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor: his ſeeming auſterity would give you and me a great reputation for ſanctity, and his good, indulgent heart, would be the very thing that would ſuit us in the affair of penance and ghoſtly direction.</p>

                     <p>I AM really almoſt tired with the life of Vienna. I am not, indeed, an enemy to diſſipation and hurry, much leſs to amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pleaſure; but I cannot endure long, even pleaſure, when it is fettered, with formality, and aſſumes the air of ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. 'Tis true, I have had here ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable connexions, and what will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſurpriſe you. I have particular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in my Spaniſh acquaintances. Count Oropeſa and General Puebla theſe two noblemen are much in the good graces of the Emperor, and yet they ſeem to be brewing miſchief. The court of Madrid cannot reflect without pain upon the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories that were cut off from the Spaniſh monarchy by the peace of Utrecht, and it ſeems to be looking wiſhfully out for an opportunity of getting them back again. That is a matter about which I trouble myſelf very little; let the court be in the right or in the wrong, I like mightily the two Counts its miniſters. I dined with them both ſome days ago at Count Wurm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand's, an Aulic counſellor and a man of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011340_0024_0F86A0E3E4D43518"/>
letters, who is univerſally eſteemed here. But the firſt man in this court, in point of knowledge and abilities, is certainly the Count Schſick, High Chancellor of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, whoſe immenſe reading is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a fine taſte and a ſolid judgment; he is a declared enemy to Prince Eugene, and a warm firiend to the honeſt hot head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marſhal Staremberg. One of the moſt accompliſhed men I have ſeen at Vienna is the young Count Tarrocco, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the amiable Prince of Portugal. I am almoſt in love with them both and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee ſuch elegant manners, and ſuch free and generous ſentiments in two young men who have hitherto ſeen nothing but their own country. The count is juſt ſuch a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick as you; he ſucceeds greatly with the-devout beauties here; his firſt overtures in gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry are diſguiſed under the luſcious ſtrains of ſpiritual love, that were ſung formerly by the ſublimely voluptuous Fenelon and the tender madam Guion, who turned the fire of carnal love to divine objects; thus the Count begins with the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and ends ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally with the <hi>fleſh,</hi> when he makes his addreſſes to holy virgins.</p>
                     <p>I made acquaintance yeſterday with the famous poet Rouſſeau, who lives here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peculiar protection of Prince Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, by whoſe liberality he ſubſiſts. He paſſes here for a free thinker, and, what is ſtill worſe in my eſteem, for a man whoſe

heart does not feel the encomiums he gives to virtue and honour in his poems. I like his odes mightily they are much ſuperior to the lyrick productions of our Engliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, few of whom have made any figure in that kind of poetry. I don't find that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men abound here; there is indeed a prodigious number of Alchymiſts at Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; the <hi>philoſophers ſtone</hi> is the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of zeal and ſcience; and thoſe who have more reading and capacity than the vulgar, have tranſported their ſuperſtition (ſhall I call it?) or fanaticiſm from religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to chymiſtry; and they believe in a new kind of tranſubſtantiation, which is deſigned to make the laity as rich as the other kind has made the prieſthood. This peſtilential paſſion has already ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral great houſes. There is ſcarcely a man of opulence or faſhion, that has not an Alchymiſt in his ſervice, and even the emperor is ſuppoſed to be no enemy to this folly in ſecret, tho' he has pretended to diſcourage it in publick.</p>
                     <p>Prince Eugene was ſo polite as to ſhew me his library yeſterday; we found him attended by Rouſſeau, and his favourite Count Bonneval, who is a man of wit, and is here thought to be a very bold enter prizing ſpirit. The library, tho' not very ample, is well choſen; but as the prince will admit into it no editions but what are beautiful and pleaſing to the eye, and there
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011340_0025_0F86A0E516D98C60"/>
are nevertheleſs numbers of excellent books that are but indifferently printed, this finikin and fopiſh taſte makes many diſagreeable chaſms in this collection. The books are pompouſly bound in Turkey leather, and two of the moſt famous bookbinders of Paris were expreſsly ſent for to do this work Bonneval pleaſantly told me that there were ſeveral quarto's on the art of war, that were bound with the skins of <hi>Spahis</hi> and <hi>Janiſſaries;</hi> and this jeſt, which was indeed elegant, raiſed a ſmile of pleaſure on the grave countenance of the famous warrior. The Prince, who is a connoiſeur in the fine arts, ſhewed me, with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pleaſure, the famous collection of portraits that formerly belonged to Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and which he purchaſed at an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive price. He has augmented it with a conſiderable number of new acquiſitions, ſo that he has now in his poſſeſſion ſuch a collection in that kind as you will ſcarcely find in any ten cabinets in Europe. If I told you the number, you would ſay that I made an indiſcreet uſe of the permiſſion to lie, which is more or leſs given to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers by the indulgence of the candid.</p>

A Janiſſary who in nine days, and yet without any wings but what a pannick terror ſeems to have furniſhed, arrived at Conſtantinople from the army of the Turks before Belgrade, brought Mr. W—the news of a compleat vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obtained by the imperialiſts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by prince Eugene, over the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman troops.

The conſternation, which this defeat has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, is inexpreſſible; and the Sultan apprehending a revolution from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and indignation of the people, fomented by certain leaders, has begun his goodly precautions after the goodly faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his bleſſed government, by order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral perſons to be ſtrangled who were the objects of his royal ſuſpicion. He has alſo ordered his treaſurer to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſome months pay to the Janiſſaries, which ſeems the leſs neceſſary, as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has been bad in this campaign, and their licentious ferocity ſeems pretty well tamed by the publick contempt, ſuch of them as return in ſtraggling and fugitive parties to the metropolis, have not ſpirit nor credit enough to defend themſelves from the inſults of the mob; the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren taunt them and the populace ſpit in their faces as they paſs.

You entertain me with a moſt agreeable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your amiable connexions with men of letters and taſte, and of the deliſcious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you paſs in their ſociety under the rural ſhade; and I exhibit to you in return the barbarous ſpectacles of Turks and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cutting one another's throats. But what can you expect from ſuch a country as this from which the muſes have fled, from which letters ſeem eternally baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in which you ſee, in private ſcenes, nothing purſued as happineſs but the refinements of an indolent voluptuouſneſs, and where thoſe who act upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick theatre live in uncertainty, ſuſpicion, and terror.

Veins of wit, elegant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation eaſy commerce, are unknown among the Turks; and yet they ſeem ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all theſe, if the vile ſpirit of their government did not ſtifle genius, damp curioſity, and ſuppreſs an hundred paſſions, that embelliſh and render life agreeable. The luſcious paſſion of the Seraglio is the only one almoſt that is gratified here to the full, but it is blended ſo with the ſurly ſpirit of deſpotiſm in one of the parties, and with the dejection and anxiety which this ſpirit produces in the other, that to one of my way of thinking it cannot appear otherwiſe than as a very mixed kind of

enjoyment. The women here are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſo cloſely confined as many have related; they enjoy a high degree of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty even in the boſom of ſervitude, and they have methods of evaſion and diſguiſe that are very favourable to gallanty; but after all, they are ſtill under uneaſy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of being diſcovered; and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery expoſes them to the moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs rage of jealouſy, which is here a monſter that cannot be ſatiated but with blood. The magnificence and riches that reign in the apartments of the ladies of faſhion here, ſeem to be one of their chief pleaſures, joined with their retinue of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſlaves, whoſe muſick dancing and dreſs amuſe them highly; but there is ſuch an air of form and ſtiffneſs amidſt this grandeur, as hinders it from pleaſing me at long run, however I was dazzled with it at firſt ſight. This ſtiffneſs and formality of manners are peculiar to the Turkiſh ladies; for the Grecian belles are of quite another character and complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; with them pleaſure appears in more engaging forms, and their perſons, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, converſation, and amuſements are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from being deſtitute of elegance and eaſe,—</p>

he declined it, and I really believe that he would have done well to have declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it now. Such a poſt as that, and ſuch a wife as the Counteſs, do not ſeem to be, in prudence eligible, for a man that is aſthmatick; and we may ſee the day when he will be heartily glad to reſign them both. It is well that he laid aſide the thoughts of the voluminous dictionary of which I have heard you or ſomebody elſe frequently make mention. But no more on that ſubject; I would not have ſaid ſo much, were I not aſſured that this letter will come ſafe and unopened to hand.

                     <p>I SET out from Bologna the moment I had finiſhed the letter I wrote you on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, and ſhall now continue to inform you of the things that have ſtruck me moſt in this excurſion. Sad roads—hilly and rocky—between Bologna and Fierenzuola. Between this latter place and Florence I went out of my road to viſit the monaſtery of <hi>La Trappe,</hi> which is of French origin and one of the moſt auſtere and ſelf-denying orders I have met with. In this gloomy retreat it gave me pain to obſerve the infatuation of men, who have devoutly reduced themſelves to a much worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that of the beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Folly, you ſee, is the lot of humanity, whether it ariſes in the flowry paths of pleaſure or the thorny ones of an ill-judged devotion.

fate; and I cannot well form a notion of that ſpiritual and extatick joy that is mixed with ſighs, groans, hunger and the other complicated miſeries of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick diſcipline. It is a ſtrange way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work for happineſs to excite an enmity between ſoul and body, which nature and providence have deſigned to live together in union and friendſhip, and which we cannot ſeparate like man and wife when they happen to diſagree. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence that is enjoined upon the monks of <hi>La Trappe,</hi> is a ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of their unſociable and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcipline; and were this injunction ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be diſpenſed with, it would be needleſs to viſit them in any other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter than as a collection of ſtatues; but the ſuperior of the convent ſuſpended, in our favour, that rigorous law, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'one of the mutes to converſe with me, and anſwer a few diſcreet queſtions. He told me that the monks of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in France are ſtill more auſtere than thoſe of Italy, as they never taſte wine, fleſh, fiſh or eggs; but live entirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vegetables.

gloom of devotion By the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. His affairs obliged him to abſent himſelf, for ſome time, from a lady with whom he had lived in the moſt intimate and tender connexions of ſucceſsful love. At his return to Paris he propoſed to ſurpriſe her agreeably, and at the ſame time, to ſatisfy his own impatient deſire of ſeeing her, by going directly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony to her apartment by a back ſtair, which he was well acquainted with—but think of the ſpectacle that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf to him at his entrance into the chamber that had ſo often been the ſcene of loves higheſt raptures! his miſtreſs dead—dead of the ſmall pox—disfigured beyond expreſſion—a loathſome maſs of putrified matter—and the ſurgeon ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the head from the body, becauſe the coffin had been made too ſhort! He ſtood for a moment motionleſs in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and filled with horror—and then retired from the world, ſhut himſelf up in the convent of <hi>La Trappe,</hi> where he paſſed the remainder of his days in the moſt cruel and diſconſolate devotion.—Let us quit this ſad ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget to tell you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came to this monaſtery I went to ſee the burning mountains near Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzuola, of which the naturaliſts ſpeak as a great curioſity. The flame it ſends
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011340_0030_0F86A095F6131FD8"/>
forth is without ſmoke, and reſembles brandy ſet on fire. The ground about it is well cultivated, and the fire appears on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one ſpot where there is a cavity, whoſe circumference is but ſmall, but in it are ſeveral crevices whoſe depths are unknown. It is remarkable that when a piece of wood is thrown into this cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho it cannot paſs thro' the crevices, yet it is conſumed in a moment, and that though the ground about it be perfectly cold, yet if a ſtick be rubbed with any force againſt it, it emits a flame, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is neither hot nor durable like that of the volcano. If you deſire a more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial account of this phenomenon, and have made a ſufficient progreſs in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian to read father Carazzi's deſcription of it, you need not be at a loſs, for I have ſent this deſcription to Mr. F—, and you have only to ask it of him. After obſerving the volcano, I ſcrambled up all the neighbouring hills, partly on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, partly on foot, but could find no veſtige of fire in any of them; though common report would make one believe that they all contain volcano's,</p>
                     <p>I hope you have not taken it in your head to expect from me a deſcription of the famous gallery here, where I arrived on Thurſday at noon; this would be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a volume inſtead of a letter; beſides I have as yet ſeen but a part of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe

treaſure, and I propoſe employing ſome weeks more to ſurvey the whole. You cannot imagine any ſituation more agreeable than Florence. It lies in a fertile and ſmiling valley watered by the Arno which runs thro' the city, and nothing can ſurpaſs the beauty and magnificence of its publick buildings, particularly the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, whoſe grandeur filled me with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment. The palaces, ſquares, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſtatues, bridges, do not only carry an aſpect full of elegance and greatneſs, but diſcover a taſte quite different, in kind, from that which reigns in the publick edifices in other countries. The more I ſee of Italy, the more I am perſuaded that the Italians have a ſtile (if I may uſe that expreſſion) in every thing, which diſtinguiſhes them almoſt eſſentially from all other Europeans. Where they have got it,—whether from natural genius or ancient imitation and inheritance, I ſhall not examine; but the fact is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I have been but one day in the gallery, that amazing repoſitory of the moſt precious remains of antiquity, and which alone is ſufficient to immortalize the illuſtrious houſe of Medicis, by whom it was built and enriched as we now ſee it. I was ſo impatient to ſee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Venus of Medicis, that I went haſtily thro' ſix apartments in order to get a ſight of this divine figure, purpoſing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011340_0031_0F86A07A3658E338"/>
when I had ſatisfied this ardent curioſity, to return and view the reſt at my leiſure. As I indeed paſſed thro' the great room which contains the ancient ſtatues, I was ſtopped ſhort at viewing the Antinous, which they had placed near that of Adrian, to revive the remembrance of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous loves, which I ſuppoſe the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines rather look upon as an object of envy, than of horror and diſguſt. This ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, like that of the Venus de Medicis, ſpurns deſcription: ſuch figures my eyes never beheld—I can now underſtand that Ovid's comparing a fine woman a fine woman to a ſtatue, which I formerly thought a very diſobliging ſimilitude, was the niceſt and higheſt piece of flattery. The Antinous is entirely naked, alll its parts are bigger than nature; but the whole, taken together, and the fine attitude of the figure carry ſuch an expreſſion of eaſe, elegance and grace, as no words can deſcribe. When I ſaw the Venus I was wrapt in wonder,—and I could not help caſting a thought back upon Antinous. They ought to be placed together. They are worthy of each other—If marble could ſee and feel, the ſeparation might be prudent,—if it could only <hi>ſee,</hi> it would certainly loſe its coldneſs and learn to feel, and in ſuch a caſe the charms of theſe two figures would produce an effect quite oppoſite to that of the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011340_0032_0F86A07CEDE8A7B0"/>
head, which turned fleſh into ſtone. Did I pretend to deſcribe to you the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, it would only ſet your imagination at work to form ideas of her figure, and your idea's would no more reſemble that figure, than the Portugueſe face of Miſs N—who has enchanted our knight, reſembles the ſweet and graceful countenance of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—his former flame. The deſcription of a face or figure is a needleſs thing as it never conveys a true idea, it only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the imagination with a fantaſtick one, until the real one is ſeen. So, my dear, if you have a mind to form a true notion of the divine form, and features of the Venus and Antinous, come to Florence.</p>
                     <p>I would be glad to oblige you and your friend Vertue by executing your commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with reſpect to the sketches of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaels cartoons at Hampton-Court; but I cannot do it to my ſatisfaction. I have, indeed, ſeen in the Grand Dukes collection, four pieces, in which that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful artiſt had thrown freely from his pencil the firſt thoughts and rude lines of ſome of theſe compoſitions; and as the firſt thoughts of a great genius are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, theſe pieces attracted my curioſity in a particular manner; but when I went to examine them cloſely, I found them ſo damaged and effaced, that they did not at all anſwer my expectation.

ſay; I mention the lattter, becauſe it is notorious that many of the modern painters have diſcovered ignoble marks of envy at a view of the inimitable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ancients. Inſtead of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their art to preſerve the maſterpieces of antiquity, they have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and efface many of them. I have ſeen with my own eyes an evident proof of this at Bologna, where the greateſt part of the paintings in freſco on the walls of the convent of <hi>St. Michael in Boſco,</hi> done by the <hi>Carracci,</hi> and <hi>Guido Rheni,</hi> have been ruined by the painters, who after having copied ſome of the fineſt heads, ſcraped them almoſt entirely out with nails.

                     <p>The word Malignity, and a paſſage in your letter, call to my mind the wicked waſp of Twickenham: his lies affect me now no more; they will be all as much deſpiſed as the ſtory of the ſeraglio and the handkerchief, of which I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was the only inventor. That man has a malignant and ungenerous heart; and he is baſe enough to aſſume the mask of a moraliſt in order to decry human nature, and to give a decent vent to his hatred of man and woman kind.—But I muſt quit this contemptible ſubject, on which a juſt indignation would render my pen ſo fertile, that alter having fatigued you

                     <head>TO Mr. P—.</head>
                     <p>I Have been running about Paris at a ſtrange rate with my ſiſter, and ſtrange ſights have we ſeen. They are at leaſt ſtrange ſights to me, for after having been accuſtomed to the gravity of Turks, I can ſcarcely look with an eaſy and familiar aſpect at the levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and agility of the airy phantoms that are dancing about me here, and I often think that I am at a puppet-ſhew amidſt the repreſentations of real life. I ſtare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly but no body remarks it, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body ſtares here; ſtaring is alamode—there is a ſtare of attention and <hi>interét,</hi> a ſtare of curioſity, a ſtare of expectation, a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011340_0033_0F86A07D626F2B98"/>
ſtare of ſurprize, it would greatly amuſe you to ſee what trifling objects excite all this ſtaring. This ſtaring would have rather a ſolemn kind of air, were it not alleviated by grinning, for at the end of a ſtare there comes always a grin, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the entrance of a gentleman or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into a room is accompanied with a grin, which is deſigned to expreſs compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſocial pleaſure, but really ſhews nothing more than a certain contortion of muſcles that muſt make a ſtranger laugh really, as they laugh artificially. The French grin is equally remote from the chearful ſerenity of a ſmile, and the cordial mirth of an honeſt Engliſh horſe-laugh. I ſhall not perhaps ſtay here long enough to form a juſt idea of French manners and characters, tho' this I believe would require but little ſtudy, as there is no great depth in either. It appears, on a ſuperficial view to be a frivolous reſtleſs and agreeable people. The Abbot is my guide, and I could not eaſily light upon a better; he tells me that here the women form the character of the men, and I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the perſuaſion of this by every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into which I enter. There ſeems here to be no intermediate ſtate between infancy and manhood; for as ſoon as the boy has quit his leading-ſtrings, he is ſet agog in the world; the ladies are his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they make the firſt impreſſions, which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011340_0034_0F86A07E024EE1A0"/>
generally remain, and they render the men ridiculous by the imitation of their humours and graces, ſo that dignity in manners is a rare thing here before the age of ſixty. Does not King David ſay ſomewhere, that <hi>Man walketh in a vain ſhew?</hi> I think he does, and I am ſure this is peculiarly true of the French man,—but he walks merrily and ſeems to enjoy the viſion, and may he not therefore be eſteemed more happy than many of our ſolid thinkers whoſe brows are furrowed by deep reflection, and whoſe wiſdom is ſo often clothed with a miſty mantle of ſpleen and vapours?</p>
                     <p>What delights me moſt here is a view of the magnificence often accompanied with taſte that reigns in the King's palaces and gardens; for tho' I don't admire much the architecture, in which there is great irregularity amd want of proportion, yet the ſtatues, paintings and other deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations afford me high entertainment. One of the pieces of antiquity that ſtruck me moſt in the gardens of Verſailles was the famous Coloſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>Tranſlated from the French.</head>
                     <p>I AM charmed, ſir, with your obliging letter; and you may perceive by the largeneſs of my paper, that I intend to give punctual anſwers to all your queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at leaſt if my French will permit me; for as it is a language I do not underſtand to perfection, ſo I much fear, that, for want of expreſſions, I ſhall be quickly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to finiſh. Keep in mind, therefore, that I am writing in a foreign language; and be ſure to attribute all the impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and triflings dropping from my pen, to the want of proper words for declaring my thoughts, but by no means to dulneſs or natural levity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conditions being thus agreed and ſettled, I begin with telling you, that you have a true notion of the Alcoran, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Greek prieſts (who are the greateſt ſcoundrels in the univerſe) have invented out of their own heads a thouſand ridiculous ſtories, in order to decry the law of Mahomet; to run it down, I ſay, without any examination,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011340_0035_0F86A07EB9B57FA0"/>
or ſo much as letting the people read it; being afraid that if once they began to ſift the defects of the Alcoran, they might not ſtop there, but proceed to make uſe of their judgment, about their own legends and fictions. In effect, there is nothing ſo like as the fables of the Greeks and of the Mahometans; and the laſt have multitudes of ſaints, at whoſe tombs miracles are by them ſaid to be daily performed; nor are the accounts of the lives of thoſe bleſſed Muſſelmen much leſs ſtuffed with extravagancies, than the ſpiritual romances of the Greek Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas.</p>
                     <p>As to your next enquiry, I aſſure you 'tis certainly falſe, though commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in our parts of the world, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet excludes women from any ſhare in a future happy ſtate. He was too much a gentleman, and loved the fair ſex too well, to uſe them ſo barbarouſly. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he promiſes a very fine paradiſe to the Turkiſh women. He ſays, indeed, that this paradiſe will be a ſeparate place from that of their husbands; but I, fancy the moſt part of them won't like it the worſe for that; and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of this ſeparation will not rende their paradiſe the leſs agreeable. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to tell you, that the virtues which Mahomet requires of the women, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the enjoyment of future happineſs, are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011340_0036_0F86A07F8DAC88B8"/>
not to live in ſuch a manner as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs to the world, but to employ themſelves as much as poſſible, in making little Muſſulmans, The virgins who die virgins, and the widows who marry not again, dying in mortal ſin, are excluded out of paradiſe: For women, ſays he not being capable to manage the affairs of ſtate, nor to ſupport the fatigues of war, God has not ordered them to govern or reform the world; but he has entruſted them with an office which is no leſs honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even that of multiplying the human race: and ſuch as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of malice or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, do not make it their buſineſs to bear or breed children, fulfill not the duty of their vocation, and rebel againſt the commands of God. Here are maxims for you, prodigiouſly contrary to thoſe of your convents. What will become of your St. Catharines, your St. Thereſas, your St. Claras, and the whole bead roll of your holy virgins and widows? who, if they are to be judged by this ſyſtem of virtue, will be found to have been infamous creatures, that paſſed their whole lives in the moſt abominable libertiniſm.</p>
                     <p>I know not what your thoughts may be concernin a doctrine ſo extraordinary with reſpect to us; but I can truly inform you, ſir, that the Turks are not ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as we fancy them to be, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of politicks, or philoſophy, or even
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011340_0036_0F86A07F8DAC88B8"/>
of gallantry. 'Tis true that military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, ſuch as is now practiſed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, does not mightily ſuit them. A long peace has plunged them into an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſloth. Content with their condition, and accuſtomed to boundleſs luxury, they are become great enemies to all manner of fatigues. But to make amends, the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences flouriſh among them. The effendis (that is to ſay, the learned) do very well deſerve this name: They have no more faith in the inſpirations of Mahomet, than in the infallibility of the Pope. They make a frank profeſſion of deiſm among themſelves, or to thoſe they can truſt, and never ſpeak of their law but as of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick inſtitution, fit now to be obſerved by wiſe men, however at firſt introduced by politicians and enthuſiaſts.</p>
                     <p>If I remember right, I think I have told you in ſome former letter, that at Belgrade we lodged with a great and rich Effendi, a man of wit and learning, and of a very agreeable humour. We were in his houſe about a month, and he did conſtantly eat with us, drinking wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple. As I rallied him a little on this ſubject, he anſwered me, ſmiling, that all creatures in the world were made for the pleaſure of man; and that God would not have let the vine grow, were it a ſin to taſte of its juice: but that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the law, which forbids the uſe
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011340_0037_0F86A083E47E3578"/>
of it to the vulgar, was very wiſe, becauſe ſuch ſort of folks have not ſenſe enough to take it with moderation. This Effendi appeared no ſtranger to the parties that prevail among us: nay, he ſeemed to have ſome knowledge of our religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and even of our writers, and I was ſurpriſed to hear him ask among other things how Mr. Toland did?</p>
                     <p>My paper, large as it is, draws towards an end. That I may not go beyond its limits, I muſt leap from religions to tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, concerning which you ask me news. Their mixture produces ſurprizing effects But what is to be obſerved moſt ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the experiments of which you ſpeak concerning animals, and which is tried here every day. The ſuburbs of Pera, Jophana, and Galata, are collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſtrangers from all countries of the univerſe. They have ſo often intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that this forms ſeveral races of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the oddeſt imaginable, there is not one ſingle family of natives, that can va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue itſelf on being unmixed. You fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee a perſon, whoſe father was born a Grecian, the mother an Italian, the grandfather a Frenchman, the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother an Armenian, and their anceſtors Engliſh, Muſcovites, Aſiaticks, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This mixture produces creatures more extraordinary than you can imagine: nor could I ever doubt, but there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011340_0037_0F86A083E47E3578"/>
different ſpecies of men; ſince the whites, the woolly and the long hair'd blacks, the ſmall-eyed Tartars and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, the beardleſs Braſilians (and to name name no more) the oily-skinned yellow Nova Zemblians, have as ſpecific differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the ſame general kind, as grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, maſtiffs, ſpaniels, bull dogs, or the race of my little Diana, if nobody is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the compariſon. Now as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intermixing of theſe later animals cauſes mungrels, ſo mankind have their mungrels too, divided and ſubdivided into endleſs ſorts. We have daily proofs of it here, as I told you before. In the ſame animal is not ſeldom remarked the Greek perfidiousneſs, and the Italian diffidence, the Spaniſh arrogance and the French lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity, and all of a ſudden he is ſeized with a fit of Engliſh thoughtfulneſs, border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little upon dullneſs, which many of us have inherited from the ſtupidity of our Saxon progenitors. But the family which charms me moſt, is that which proceeds from the fantaſtical conjunction of a Dutch male with a Greek female. As theſe are natures oppoſite in extremes, 'tis a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obſerve how the differing attoms are perpetually jarring together in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even ſo as to produce effects viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their external form. They have the large black eyes of the country, with the fat, white, fiſhy fleſh of Holland, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011340_0038_0F86A08460453B00"/>
a lively air ſtreaked with dullneſs. At one and the ſame time, they ſhew that love of expenſiveneſs, ſo univerſal among the Greeks, and an inclination to the Dutch frugality. To give an example of this: young women ruin themſelves to purchaſe jewels for adorning their heads, while they have not the heart to buy new ſhoes or rather ſlippers for their feet, which are commonly in a tattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; a thing ſo contrary to the taſte of our Engliſh women that it is for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how neatly their feet are dreſſed, and for ſhewing this only they are ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately enamoured with their hoop-peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats. I have abundance of other ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities to communicate to you, but I am at the end both of my French and my paper.</p>

                     <p>We may conſider the gifts of fortune as ſo many ſteps neceſſary to arrive at fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which we can never attain, being obliged to ſet bounds to our deſires, and being only gratified with ſome of her frivolous favours; which are nothing more than the torments of life, when they are conſidered as the neceſſary means to acquire or preſerve a more exquiſite felicity.</p>

                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011340_0039_0F86A084C7C08AF8"/>
This felicity conſiſts alone in friendſhip, founded on mutual eſteem, fixed by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſupported by inclination, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the tender ſolicitudes of Love, whom the ancients have admirably deſcribed under the appearance of a beautiful infant: it is pleaſed with infantine amuſements, it is delicate and affectionate, incapable of miſchief, delighted with trifles; its pleaſures are gentle and innocent.</p>
                     <p>They have given a very different repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of another paſſion too groſs to be mentioned, but of which alone men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are ſuſceptible. This they have deſcribed under the figure of a Satyr, who has more of the brute than of the man in his compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By this fabulous animal they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a paſſion, which is the real founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the fine exploits of modiſh gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and which only endeavours to glut its appetite with the poſſeſſion of the object which is moſt lovely in its eſtimation: a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion founded in injuſtice, ſupported by deceit and atttended by crimes, remorſe, jealouſy and contempt. Can ſuch an affection be delightful to a virtuous mind? Nevertheleſs ſuch is the delightful attendant on all illicit engagements; gallants are obliged to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all thoſe ſentiments of honour which are inſeparable from a liberal education, and are doomed to live wretchedly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant purſuit of what reaſon condemns to have all their pleaſures embittered by
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011340_0039_0F86A084C7C08AF8"/>
remorſe, and to be reduced to the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of having renounced virtue, without being able to make vice agreeable.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to taſte the delights of love in perfection, but in a well aſſorted marriage; nothing betrays ſuch a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind as to be governed by words. What though cuſtom, for which good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be aſſigned, has made the words <hi>husband</hi> and <hi>wife</hi> ſomewhat ridiculous? A husband in common acceptation, ſignifies a jealous brute, a ſurly tyrant; or at beſt a weak fool, who may be made to believe any thing. A wife is a domeſtic terma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant who is deſtined to deceive or torment the poor devil of a husband. The conduct of many married people too much reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes theſe two odious characters.</p>
                     <p>But as I ſaid before, Why ſhould words impoſe upon us? A well regulated marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is not like theſe connections of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or ambition. A fond couple attached to each other by mutual affection, are two lovers who live happily together. Though the prieſt pronounces certain words, though the lawyer draws up cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inſtruments; yet I look on theſe preparatives in the ſame light as a lover conſiders a ladder of ropes which he faſtens to his miſtreſs's window: if they can but live together what does it ſignify at what price or by what means their union is accompliſhed? Where love is real and well
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011340_0040_0F86A085768ECC00"/>
founded, it is impoſſible to be happy but in the quiet enjoyment of the beloved object and the price at which it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained does not leſſen the vivacity and delights of a paſſion ſuch as my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination conceives. If I was inclined to romance, I would not picture images of true happineſs in Arcadia. I am not pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh enough to confine the delicacy of affection on to wiſhes only I would open my romance with the marriage of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple united by ſentiment, taſte and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Can we conceive a higher felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the blending of their intereſts and lives in ſuch an union? The lover has the pleaſure of giving his miſtreſs the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Can they exchange more dear and affectionate pledges? Is it not natural, to give the moſt inconteſtable proofs of that tenderneſs with which our minds are impreſſed? I am ſenſible that ſome are ſo nice as to maintain that the pleaſures of love are derived from the dangers and difficulties with which it is attended; they very pertly obſerve, that a roſe would not appear a roſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thorns.

                     <p>Two married lovers lead very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lives; they have the pleaſures to paſs their time in a ſucceſſive intercourſe of mutual obligations, and marks of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and they have the delight to find that each forms the entire happineſs of the beloved object. Herein conſiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicity. The moſt trivial concerns of oeconomy become noble and elegant when they are exalted by ſentiments of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to furniſh an appartment, is not barely to furniſh an apartment; it is a place where I expect my lover: to prepare a ſupper, is not merely giving orders to my cook; it is an amuſement to regale the object I doa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> on. In this light a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conſiders theſe neceſſary occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as more lively and affecting pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than thoſe gaudy ſights which amuſe the greater part of the ſex, who are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of true enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>A fixed and affectionate attachment ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every emotion of the ſoul, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders every object agreeable which preſents itſelf to the happy lover (I mean one who is married to his miſtreſs.) If he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes any employment, the fatigues of the camp the troubles of the court, all become agreeable when he reflects that he endures theſe inconveniencies to ſerve the object of his affections. If fortune is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011340_0041_0F86A086A8692378"/>
favourable to him, for ſucceſs does not depend on merit, all the advantages it procures are ſo many tributes which he thinks due to the charms of the lovely fair; and in gratifying this ambition, he feels a more lively pleaſure, and more worthy of an honeſt man, than that of raiſing his fortune, and gaining public applauſe. He enjoys glory, titles and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es no farther than as they regard her he loves; and when he attracts the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſenate the applauſe of an army, or the commendation of his prince, it is her praiſes which ultimately flatter him.</p>
                     <p>In a reverſe of fortune, he has the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of retiring to one who is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his diſgrace; and locked in her embraces he has the ſatisfaction of giving utterance to the following tender reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <q>My happineſs does not depend on the caprice of fortune; I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant aſſylum againſt inquietude. Your eſteem renders me inſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of a court, or the ingratitude of a maſter and my loſſes afford me a kind of pleaſure, ſince they furniſh me with freſh proofs of your virtue and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of what uſe is grandeur to thoſe who are already happy? We have no need of flatterers, we want no equipag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, I reign in your affections, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy every delight in the poſſeſſion of your perſon.</q>
                     </p>

In ſhort there is no ſituation in which melancholy may not be aſſuaged by the company of the beloved object. Sickneſs itſelf is not without its alleviation, when we have the pleaſure of being attended by her we love. I ſhould never conclude, if I attempted to give a detail of all the delights of an attachment, wherein we meet with every thing which can flatter the ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with the moſt lively and diffuſive rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But I muſt not omit taking notice of the pleaſure of beholding the lovely pledges of a tender friendſhip, daily grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and of amuſing ourſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our different ſexes, in training them to perfection We give way to this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtinct of nature, refined by love. In a daughter we praiſe the beauty of her mother: in a ſon we commend the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the appearance of innate probity which we eſteem in his father. It is a pleaſure which according to Moſes, the Almighty himſelf enjoyed, when he beheld the work of his hands, and ſaw that all was good.</p>
                     <p>Speaking of Moſes. I cannot forbear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the primitive plan of felicity infinitely ſurpaſſes all others, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not form an idea of Paradiſe, more like a Paradiſe than the ſtate in which our firſt parents were placed: that proved of ſhort duration, becauſe they were unacquainted with the world, and it is for the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011340_0042_0F86A0874F2FFC38"/>
reaſon that ſo few love matches prove hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Eve was like a ſilly child, and Adam was not much enlightened. When ſuch people come together, their being amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is to no purpoſe, for their affections muſt neceſſarily be ſhort lived. In the tranſports of their love they form ſupper-natural ideas of each other. The man thinks his miſtreſs an angel becauſe ſhe is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and ſhe is enraptured with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of her lover, becauſe he adores her. The firſt decay of her complexion depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves her of his adoration, and the huſb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and being no longer an adorer, becomes hateful to her, who had no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for her love. By degrees they grow diſguſtful to each other, and after the example of our firſt parents they do not fail to reproach each other with the crime of their mutual imbecillity. After indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence contempt comes apace, and they are convinced that they muſt hate each other, becauſe they are married. Their ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſwell in each other's view, and they grow blind to thoſe charms which, in any other object would pleaſe them. A commerce founded merely on ſenſation can be attended with no other conſequences.</p>
                     <p>A man, when he marries the object of his affections, ſhould forget that ſhe appears to him adorable, and ſhould conſider her merely as a mortal, ſubject to diſorders, caprice and ill temper; he ſhould arm himſelf
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011340_0042_0F86A0874F2FFC38"/>
with fortitude, to bear the loſs of her beauty, and ſhould provide himſelf with a fund of complaiſance which is requiſite to ſupport a conſtant intercourſe, with a perſon even of the higheſt underſtanding and the greateſt equanimity. The wife, on the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould, not expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued courſe of adulation and obedience; ſhe ſhould diſpoſe herſelf to obey in her turn with a good grace; a ſcience very difficult to attain, and conſequently the more eſtimable in the opinion of a man who is ſenſible of the merit. She ſhould endeavour to revive the charms of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, by the ſolidity and good ſenſe of the friend.</p>
                     <p>When a pair, who entertain ſuch rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſentiments, are united by indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bonds all nature ſmiles upon them, and the moſt common objects appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. In my oppinion, ſuch a life is infinitely more happy and more volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, than the moſt raviſhing and beſt regulated gallantry.</p>
                     <p>A woman who is capable of reflection can conſider a gallant in no other light than that of a ſeducer who would take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her weakneſs, to procure a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſure at the expence of her glory, her peace her honour, and perhaps her life. A highwayman who claps a piſtol to your breaſt, to rob you of your purſe, is leſs diſhoneſt and leſs guilty; and I have
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011340_0043_0F86A087C6293988"/>
ſo good an opinion of myſelf as to believe that if I was a man, I ſhould be as capable of aſſuming the character of an aſſaſſin, as that of ſeducing an honeſt woman, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world and happy in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by attempting to inſpire her with a paſſion to which ſhe muſt ſacrifice her honour, her tranquillity and her virtue.</p>
                     <p>Should I make her deſpicable, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears amiable in my eyes? Should I reward her tenderneſs, by making her abhorred by her family, by rendering her children indifferent to her, and her husband deteſtable? I believe that theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections would have appeared to me in as ſtrong a light, it my ſex had not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them excuſable in ſuch caſes; and I hope that I ſhould have had more ſenſe than to imagine vice the leſs vicious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the faſhion.</p>
                     <p>N. B. I am much pleaſed with the Turkiſh manners: a people, though igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet, in my judgment, extremely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite. A gallant convicted of having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched a married woman, is regarded as a pernicious being, and held in the ſame abhorrence as a proſtitute with us. He is certain of never making his fortune, and they would deem it ſcandalous to confer any conſiderable employment on a man ſuſpected of having committed ſuch enormous injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>What would theſe moral people think
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011340_0043_0F86A087C6293988"/>
of our anti-knights-errant, who are ever in purſuit of adventures to reduce inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent virgins to diſtreſs, and to rob vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous women of their honour; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard beauty, youth, rank, nay virtue itſelf as ſo many incentives, which inflame their deſires, and render their efforts more eager; and who, priding themſelves in the glory of appearing expert ſeducers, forget that with all their endeavours, they can only acquire the ſecond rank in that ignoble order the Devil having long ſince been in poſſeſſion of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Our barbarous manners are ſo well calculated for the eſtabliſhment of vice and wretchedneſs, which are ever inſeparable, that it requires a degree of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſenſibility infinitely above the common, to reliſh the felicity of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſuch as I have deſcribed. Nature is ſo weak and ſo prone to change, that it is difficult to maintain the beſt grounded conſtancy, in the midſt of thoſe diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which our ridiculous cuſtoms have rendered unavoidable.</p>
                     <p>It muſt pain an amorous husband to ſee his wife take all that faſhionable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it ſeems harſh not to allow them and to be conformable he is reduced to the neceſſity of letting every one take them that will, to hear her impart the charms of her underſtanding to all the world, to ſee her diſplay her boſom at
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011340_0044_0F86A088852E8DA8"/>
noon day, to ſee her bedeck herſelf for the ball, and for the play, and attract a thouſand and a thouſand adorers, and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the inſipid flattery of a thouſand and a thouſand coxcombs. Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preſerve an eſteem for ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or at leaſt muſt not her value be greatly diminiſhed by ſuch a commerce?</p>
                     <p>I muſt ſtill reſort to the maxims of the Eaſt, where the moſt beautiful women are content to confine the power of their charms to him who has a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them; and they are too ſincere not to confeſs, that they think themſelves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of exciting deſires.</p>
                     <p>I recollect a converſation that I had with a lady of great quality at Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, (the moſt amiable woman I ever knew in my life and with whom I after wards contracted the cloſeſt friendſhip.) She frankly acknowledged that ſhe was ſatisfied with her husband. What libertines ſaid ſhe you Chriſtian ladies are! You are permitted to receive viſits from as many men as you think proper, and your laws allow you the unlimited uſe of love and wine. I aſſured her that ſhe was wrong informed, and that it was criminal to liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to, or to love, any other than our husbands. <q>Your husbands are great fools ſhe replied ſmiling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be content with ſo precarious a fidelity. Your necks, your eyes, your hands, your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011340_0044_0F86A088852E8DA8"/>
are all for the publick, and what do you pretend to reſerve for them? Pardon me, my pretty Sultana, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, embracing me, I have a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to believe all that you tell me but you would impoſe impoſſibilities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me I know the filthineſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; I perceive that you are aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I will ſay no more.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I found ſo much good ſenſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in what ſhe ſaid, that I knew not how to contradict her, and at length I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that ſhe had reaſon to prefer the Mahometan manners to our ridiculous cuſtoms which form a confuſed medley of the rigid maxims of Chriſtianity, with all the libertiniſm of the Spartans: And notwithſtanding our abſurd manners, I am perſuaded that a woman who is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to place her happineſs in her husbands affections, ſhould abandon the extravagant deſire o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> engaging public adoration; and that a husband who tenderly loves his wife ſhould in his turn, give up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being a gallant. You find that I am ſuppoſing a very extraordinary pair; it is not very ſurprizing therefore, that ſuch an union ſhould be uncommon in thoſe countries, where it is requiſite to deſpiſe eſtabliſhed cuſtoms in order to be happy.</p>

                  <head>The CHARACTER of a LOVELY WOMAN.</head>
                  <p>I DO not know a woman in the world who ſeems ſo much formed to render a man of ſenſe and generoſity more happy in the married ſtate than Amaſia.</p>
                  <p>Amaſia never ſaid, or attempted to ſay, a ſprightly thing in all her life; but ſhe has done ten thouſand generous ones; and if ſhe is not the moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous figure at an aſſembly, ſhe never envied or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned thoſe who are, her heart is all tenderneſs and benevolence: no ſucceſs ever attended any of her acquaintance, which did not fill her boſom with the moſt diſintereſted complacency; and no misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ever reached her knowledge, that ſhe did not relieve or participate by her generoſity. If ever ſhe ſhould fall into the arms of a man ſhe loves (and I am perſuaded ſhe would eſteem it the worſt kind of proſtitution to reſign herſelf into any other) her whole life would be one continued ſeries of kindneſs and compliance.</p>
                  <p>The humble opinion ſhe has of her own uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon merit, would make her ſo much the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her huſband's; and thoſe little ſubmiſſions on his ſide, which a woman of more pride and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would conſider only as a claim of right, would be eſteemed by Amaſia as ſo many additional mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to her love and gratitude.</p>

                  <head>THE ADVENTURES OF TOM DREADNOUGHT, Who ſerved as a SOLDIER, and alſo as a SAILOR, in the late WAR.</head>
                  <p>NO obſervation is more common, and at the ſame time more true, than, That one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declamation; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble ſufferers: the great, under the preſſure of calamity, are conſcious of ſeveral others
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011340_0058_0F86A09ADA6A44A0"/>
ſympathizing with their diſtreſs; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in ſuch circumſtances will act bravely even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of obſcurity, can brave adverſity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indifference is truly great: whether peaſant or courtier, he deſerves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and ſhould be held up for our imitation and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>While the ſlighteſt inconveniencies of the great are magnified into calamities! while tragedy mouths out their ſufferings in all the ſtrains of eloquence, the miſeries of the poor are entirely diſregarded; and yet ſome of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hardſhips in one day, than thoſe of a more exalted ſtation ſuffer in their whole lives. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable what difficulties the meaneſt of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſailors and ſoldiers endure without murmuring or regret; without paſſionately declaiming againſt Providence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity. Every day is to them a day of miſery, and yet they entertain their hard fate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining.</p>
                  <p>With what indignation do I hear an Ovid, a Cicero, or a Rabutin, complain of their misfortunes and hardſhips, whoſe greateſt calamity was that of being unable to viſit a certain ſpot of earth, to which they had fooliſhly attached an Idea of happineſs. Their diſtreſſes were pleaſures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They eat, drank, and ſlept, they had ſlaves to attend them, and were ſure of ſubſiſtence for life: while many of their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are obliged to wander without a friend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011340_0059_0F86A09C0BA7A098"/>
or aſſiſt them, and even without ſhelter from the ſeverity of the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>I have been led into theſe reflections from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally meeting, ſome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dreſſed in a ſailor's jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and induſtrious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his preſent ſituation. Wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I deſired to know the hiſtory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his preſent diſtreſs. The diſabled ſoldier, for ſuch he was, though dreſſed in a ſailor's habit, ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head, and leaning on his crutch, put himſelf into an attitude to comply with my requeſt, and gave me his hiſtory, as follows.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>As for my misfortunes, maſter, I can't pretend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the loſs of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any reaſon thank Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that I have to complain; there is Bill Tibbs, of our regiment, he has loſt both his legs, and an eye to boot; but thank Heaven, it is not ſo bad with me yet.</p>
                     <p>I was born in Shropſhire, my father was a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, and died when I was five years old, ſo I was put upon the pariſh. As he had been a wandering ſort of a man, the pariſhioners were not able to tell to what pariſh I belonged, or where I was born, ſo they ſent me to another pariſh, and that pariſh ſent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept ſending me about ſo long, that they would not let me be born in any pariſh at all; but, at laſt however, they fixed me. I had ſome diſpoſition to be a ſcholar, and was reſolved, at leaſt, to know my letters; but the maſter of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe put me to buſineſs as ſoon as I was able to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011340_0059_0F86A09C0BA7A098"/>
handle a mallet; and here I lived an eaſy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true I was not ſuffered to ſtir out of the houſe, for fear, as they ſaid, I ſhould run away; but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole houſe, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I eat and drank well, and liked my buſineſs well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for myſelf, ſo I was reſolved to go ſeek my fortune.</p>
                     <p>In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and ſtarved when I could get none: when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a juſtice of peace, I ſpyed a hare croſſing the path juſt before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my ſtick at it:—Well what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the juſtice himſelf met me, he called me a poacher and villain; and collaring me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired I would give an account of myſelf: I fell upon my knees, begged his worſhip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, ſeed and generation; but, though I gave a very true account, the juſtice ſaid I could give no account at all; ſo I was indicted at ſeſſions, found guilty of being poor, and ſent up to London to Newgate, in order to be tranſported as a vagabond.</p>
                     <p>People may ſay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to laſt for ever; ſo I was taken out of priſon, after five months, put on board a ſhip and ſent off with two hundred more
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011340_0060_0F86A09CB642B770"/>
to the plantations. We had but an indifferent paſſage, for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of ſweet air; and thoſe that remained were ſickly enough God knows. When we came a-ſhore we were ſold to the planters, and I was bound for ſeven years more. As I was no ſcholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I ſerved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</p>
                     <p>When my time was expired, I worked my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage home, and glad I was to ſee Old England again, becauſe I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I ſhould be indicted for a vagabond once more, ſo I did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when I could get them.</p>
                     <p>I was very happy in this manner for ſome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then bid me ſtand. They belonged to a preſs gang: I was carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the juſtice, and, as I could give no account of myſelf, I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war, or liſt for a ſoldier. I choſe the latter; and in this poſt of a gentleman, I ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two campaigns in Flanders, was at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Val and Fontenoy, and received but one wound, through the breaſt here; but the doctor of our regiment ſoon made me well again.</p>
                     <p>When the peace came on I was diſcharged; and as I could not work, becauſe my wound was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times troubleſome, I liſted for a landman in the Eaſt-India company's ſervice. I here fought the French in ſix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that, if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal; but it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I ſoon fell ſick and ſo got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011340_0060_0F86A09CB642B770"/>
of the preſent war, and I hoped to be ſet on ſhore, and to have the pleaſure of ſpending my money; but the government wanted men, and ſo I was preſſed for a ſailor, before ever I could ſet my foot on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The boatſwain found me, as he ſaid, an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fellow; he ſwore he knew that I underſtood my buſineſs well, but that I <hi>ſhammed Abraham,</hi> to be idle; but God knows, I knew nothing of the ſea-buſineſs, and he beat me without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what he was about. However I had ſtill my forty pounds, and that was ſome comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ſhip was taken by the French, and ſo I loſt all.</p>
                     <p>Our crew was carried into Breſt, and many of them died, becauſe they were not uſed to live in a jail; but for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was ſeaſoned. One night as I was ſleeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, for I always loved to lie well, I was awakened by the boatſwain who had a dark lanthorn in his hand; Tom, ſays he to me will you knock out the French centry's brains? I don't care, ſays I, ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep myſelf awake, if I lend a hand. Then follow me, ſays he, and I hope we ſhall do buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French becauſe they are all ſlaves, and wear wooden ſhoes.</p>
                     <p>Though we had no arms, one Engliſhman is able to beat five French at any time; ſo we went down to the door, where both the centries were poſted, and ruſhing upon them, ſeized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the quay, and ſeizing the firſt boat we met, got out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011340_0061_0F86A09DDC8D7E78"/>
and put to ſea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dorſet priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer who were glad of ſo many good hands; and we conſented to run our chance. However we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; ſo to it we went yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight laſted for three hours, and I verily believe we ſhould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had ſome more men left behind: but unfortunately, we loſt all our men juſt as we were going to get the victory.</p>
                     <p>I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Breſt: but by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that in that engagement, I was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two places: I loſt four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was ſhot off. If I had had the good fortune to have loſt my leg and the uſe of my hand on board a kings ſhip and not a-board a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer, I ſhould have been entitled to cloathing and maintainance during the reſt of my life: but that was not my chance: one man is born with a ſilver ſpoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, bleſſed be God, I enjoy good health, and will forever love liberty and Old England. Liberty property and Old England, for ever, huzza!</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus ſaying, TOM limped off, leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content: but I could not avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with miſery ſerves better than philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to teach us to deſpiſe it.</p>
