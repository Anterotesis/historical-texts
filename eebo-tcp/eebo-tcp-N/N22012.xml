            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THERE are few ſituations more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting to the human race, than that which the people of America this day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. The temples of the living God are every where, throughout this riſing empire, this day, crowded, I truſt, with worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, whoſe hearts, impreſſed with a juſt and lively ſenſe of the great things, which he hath done for them, pour forth, in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the grateful tribute of praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Yes, this day, brethren, the voice of rejoicing and ſalvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous; and with reaſon, for the hiſtory of nations doth not exhibit a people who ever had more cauſe to offer up to the great author of every good the moſt fervent expreſſions of gratitude and thanks-giving. Let, my brethren, the ſons of irreligion, wrapped in their dark and gloomy ſyſtem of fatality, refuſe to open their eyes to the great luminous proofs of providential government, which America diſplays; let them turn from a light, which their weak viſion cannot bear; but let the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029016_0004_0FE3474A1513A528"/>
righteous, let thoſe who truſt in God, who can trace in that good and glorious being, the relations of father, friend and governor, let them, with eagle eyes look up to that full blaze of ſalvation, which he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to this new world. Permit me then, upon this occaſion, to turn your attention to thoſe great things, which the Lord hath done for us, to thoſe manifold diſplays of divine providence, which the hiſtory of America exhibits; and let the ſubject afford an opportunity to revive within us ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of lively gratitude, and excite ſincere reſolutions to fear the Lord, and to ſerve him; in a word, to increaſe daily in piety, and in all thoſe noble affections of the ſoul which dignify the chriſtian and the patriot.</p>
            <p>I. Who can tell how many ages had been ſwallowed up in the all-abſorbing gulph of time, before the bold navigator firſt eſſayed to viſit theſe diſtant regions of the earth? Who can tell how long this weſtern world had been the habitation of the liſtleſs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, or the wild beaſts of the foreſt? At theſe queſtions Chronology drops her epochs, as incapable of conducting her to periods ſo remote, and which have eſcaped her graſp. The ways of Heaven muſt oft appear to us, weak mortals, dark and intricate. But the firſt ſuggeſtion, which here preſents itſelf, is, that providence ſeems to have thrown a veil over this portion of the globe, in order to conceal it from the eyes of the nations of the caſt, until the deſtined period
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029016_0005_0FE3473B9258FDB0"/>
had arrived for the regeneration of mankind, in this new world, after thoſe various other means, which the wiſdom of the Almighty had permitted to operate, in the old, had proved ineffectual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In vain had reaſon, the hand-maid of pure religion, long attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convince men of the reciprocal duties, which equality and fraternity impoſe. Still there would ariſe ſome one,
<q>
                  <l>of proud ambitious heart, who, not content</l>
                  <l>with fair equality, fraternal ſtate,</l>
                  <l>would arrogate dominion undeſerved</l>
                  <l>over his brethren, and quite diſpoſſeſs</l>
                  <l>concord and law of nature from the earth.<note n="†" place="bottom">

In vain had even thy diſpenſation of love and peace, bleſſed Jeſus! long eſſayed to diſarm ambition of the enſanguined ſword, and to diffuſe benevolence, equality and fraternity among the human race. Millions ſtill groaned under the heavy preſſure, which tyranny impoſed. Yes, even thy goſpel of love, of univerſal fraternity, had been, too often, perverted into the moſt formidable ſyſtem of oppreſſion; and mankind, inſtead of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it diffuſe the heavenly rays of philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, too frequently beheld it as impoſing a yoke, to degrade and enſlave them. The princes of the earth ſought not for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred duties, which it enjoined; but they ſought to render it the ſanction of their exterminating vengeance, or their deep laid ſyſtems of uſurpation. Is not the hiſtory
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029016_0006_0FE34750AA0FAF58"/>
of almoſt all Europe pregnant with proofs of this calamitous truth? If you can point to ſome ſmall portion, where the religion of the bleſſed Jeſus, untrammeled with political uſurpations, was left to operate its happy effects upon the paſſions and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men; or where toleration extended wide her arms of mercy to embrace the whole family of Chriſt, the ſpot appears like a ſolitary ſtar, which in the midſt of night, beams forth alone, whilſt clouds and thick darkneſs obſcure the reſt of the innumerable hoſt of Heaven. Alas! what avails the voice of reaſon or religion, when the luſt of domination has uſurped the ſoul! At the ſhrine of this fell demon, the human race was ſacrificed by thouſands Nay, too many of the ſons of Europe are ſtill bound with cords to the altars of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and there immolated, not only by thouſands, but by tens of thouſands Do you doubt the aſſertion, afflictive as it ſeems to our brethren of the old world? The laſt four years have, in their flight, ſcarcely wanted a moment to teſtify the melancholy truth.—I will not add the long catalogue of thoſe innumerable ſcourges, which, from time to time, have viſited Europe; I will not ſpeak of thoſe various tempeſts, which, by divine command, have ſo often ſhaken the guilty nations of the eaſt, but which ſeem in vain to have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the voice of warning and reproof: Domination ſtill rivetted her iron chains:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029016_0007_0FE34752314E9EA0"/>
the fangs of governments, avaricious, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and vindictive, entered even into the ſouls of the ſuffering people. The heritage of the Lord were only as ſheep deſtined to be ſhorn or ſlaughtered, whilſt the unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpot exacted in return, not obſequious obedience only, but even profeſſions of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the innumerable bleſſings, which flowed from his hallowed protection.—How were theſe chains to be burſt aſunder? How was the human race to be reſtored to their inherent rights, rights, which the God of nature conſecrated at the birth of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual? How was the dignity of man to be vindicated? How were thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of equality, benevolence and frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which reaſon, and religion, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoin, to reaſſume their ſovereignty over the human ſoul, and to daſh againſt the heads of uſurpers the chains, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, the oppreſſions, which had ſo long brought down the grey hairs of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with ſorrow to the grave? How could the principles of a revolution ſo important, ſo eſſential for the happineſs of the human ſpecies, be generated, but by raiſing up, as it were, a new race of men, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, ſome bleſſed clime, where, from their infancy, unfettered by thoſe errors, which time appears to ſanctify, they ſhould be trained not only to a knowledge, but to a juſt ſenſe of the duty of aſſerting and maintaining their rights; and above all, where the love of equality, the baſis of all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029016_0008_0FDE95D740584D78"/>
rights and all ſocial happineſs, ſhould be congenial to man? This favoured region, favoured indeed of Heaven, is America. It is here, a knowledge of thoſe political truths, which the immortal Sydneys and the Lockes of former years inveſtigated with philoſophic eye, burſts ſpontaneous forth. It is here, that men, led by the hand of nature, their minds unawed and unobſcured by opinions and cuſtoms as barbarous and unfriendly to ſocial rights as the dark chaotic ages, which gave them birth, ſee and acknowledge as axioms, what philoſophers have toiled to eſtabliſh by deductions, long and intricate. It is in America, that the germs of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal redemption of the human race from domination and oppreſſion have already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be developed; it is in America, that we ſee a redintegration of divine love for man, and that the voice of Heaven itſelf ſeems to call to her ſons, go ye forth and diſciple all nations, and ſpread among them the goſpel of equality and fraternity.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Terms have their days of faſhion, like many other things. The term,</hi> Equality, <hi>ſeems to be in the wane; it has its enemies even in America. But whoever will read Dr. Brown's excellent eſſay upon the</hi> natural equality of men, <hi>will there find this grand principle juſtly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated; he will find, that it is the only baſis on which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal juſtice, order and freedom, can be firmly built, or permanently ſecured. The view, ſays the writer, exhibited in this eſſay, ſo far from looſening the bands of ſociety, or weakening that ſubordination, without which no government can ſubſiſt, will draw more cloſely every ſocial tie, and more ſtrongly confirm the obligations of legal obedience, and the rights of legal authority. Certainly this principle is one of the hinges upon which the chriſtian ſyſtem turns.</hi>

II. Theſe conſiderations preſent to our minds the firſt traces of the beneficent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of providence in the hiſtory of this new world. Nor ought it, in the 2d place, to be here forgotten, that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or general tendency of providence is alſo to be traced back to the ſource, whence the preſent free and enlightened race of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſprung. For ſurely, our fore-fathers, amidſt the wreck of human rights, and the convulſive tempeſts with which ambition had ſo often overwhelmed the nations of the eaſt, ſtill evinced, at times, no ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that etherial ſpirit, that ardent love of liberty, which glows in the American breaſt. It was this indomitable ſpirit, this attachment to the inherent rights of man, ſtronger infinitely than the fear of thoſe ſtorms, which agitate the immenſe atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, or of the fierce and cruel tenants of the howling wilderneſs, or the ravages of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and famine and death itſelf, which urged our fore-fathers to theſe diſtant ſhores. Yes, brethren, it was this noble principle, this love of liberty, which defying all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, conducted our fore-fathers to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; but who doth not ſee, that this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whilſt it only could prompt to the bold enterprize, was no where to be found ſo pure, ſo energetic as in Britain? Who doth not ſee, that thus to have tranſported it to America, thus to have incorporated it with the primary ſocial inſtitutions of this country, may be juſtly deemed an event
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029016_0010_0FDE95DDF5B38730"/>
moſt fortunate for mankind, nay, moſt worthy of providence itſelf? Had this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple been equally tranſported to the fertile plains of Mexico, or Peru, inſtead of the <hi>Auri ſacra fames,</hi> they alſo would have had their Apoſtles, nay, their martyrs to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yes, even Maxico, and Peru, e're this diſtant period, would have had their Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, would have unfurled the banners of liberty, and would have fought, and bled, and conquered. If then we dare attempt with mortal eye to trace thoſe cauſes, by which the Almighty operates, it will not be thought preſumptuous, I truſt, not only to aſcribe to his directive wiſdom the introduction of a principle, which here foſtered, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the captive nations of the earth; but alſo, the introduction of it, at a time, when its active, but daily increaſing energy ſhould accelerate the great and glorious revolution, which it has already effected in America, which it has commenced in Europe, and which will not be arreſted in its progreſs, until the complete reſtoration of the human race to their inherent rights be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, throughout the globe. Let the tyrants of the earth ſet themſelves in array againſt this principle; 'they ſhall be chaſed as the chaff of the mountain before the wind, and like the down of the thiſtle before the whirlwind.'—<note n="†" place="bottom">

ſhine equally refulgent in war as in peace; and laſtly, had ſhewn to them, the faireſt portion of the old world, by the example of America, by the influence of that ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic principle, which ſhe had nurtured and matured, awaking as from a dream, putting on ſtrength as in the antient days, in the generations of old, uprooting the deep founded ſyſtems of uſurpation, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the oppreſſed under the wings of liberty and fraternity: And whilſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the glorious, the animating proſpect, ſhould ſay to them, all theſe events, my ſons, great and aſtoniſhing as they are, ſhall come to paſs within the ſhort period, of a patriarchal life; would they not have fallen down upon their faces, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping the God of their fathers, exclaimed. This is the Lords doing, and it is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in our eyes? We, brethren, fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as we are, have lived to ſee this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal day. And is there a ſoul here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is there one throughout this riſing empire, who doth not trace, in the eventful hiſtory of America, the conſpicuous diſplays of the hand of providence? Is there one, who is not ready alſo to exclaim, it is the Lords doing? Where, in what records of mankind, will he diſcover a progreſs from infancy to manhood, ſo accelerated, ſo aſtoniſhing in all its ſtages, ſo ſuperior to all thoſe ordinary means, by which empires are matured?

               </note> I will not retrace thoſe ſcenes of blood, of horror and deſolation, through which the patriot ſons of America once tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant paſſed. Miniſters of the Goſpel! be it yours to bind up and to heal the wounds, which contentions and wars inflict. But ah!—who does not remember, when the fate of this riſing empire, nay of mankind, hung trembling between the fury of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, and the weakneſs of the oppreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how many were our prayers to the God of battles! how often did we look forwards upon the mightineſs of the adverſary; how often backwards upon our own imbecility, upon our wives and our tender infants? In that awful criſis, who does not remember, that in God alone was our truſt? Yes, O people, ſaved by the Lord, it was his right hand and his holy arm, which reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued thee from the ſtrength of the Lion and the Bear; it was the ſame wiſe and gracious providence, which delivered the youthful unarmed David from the hands of Goliah,

accoutred as he was, with a ſword, and with a ſpear, and with a Shield, which alſo delivered thee, from the hands of the mightieſt of nations.</p>
            <p>Do theſe our concluſions appear to ſome to favour of preſumptive arrogance, or do we diſcover to the philoſophic mind an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic imbecility in aſcribing theſe events, ſo peculiar to the annals of America, to the particular direction of providence? Let ſuch bethink themſelves, if ſuch there be, that it is a juſt reliance upon the ſuperintending providence of God, a reliance dictated by the concurrent voice of reaſon, of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and religion, which compels the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the grateful and the wiſe to conſider all thoſe diſpoſitions or events, which ſo remarkably coincide with the general plan of the moral government of the world, as indications of the deſign and direction of omnipotence. Cauſes and effects are, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in the hands of him who willed their connexion. But his will is the general happineſs. They who indulge this idea, ſo conſolatory to man, will therefore conſider it as the homage which is due to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, regenerator and preſerver of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, to aſcribe to his ſuperior direction, effects ſo concordant with his goodneſs, and which ſo greatly tranſcend all human means. Yes, brethren, if the effects, which we have, in your hearing, thus ſlightly traced; if the period of time when America was diſcovered, the neceſſity and the conſequent

            <p>IV. But, my brethren, to reſt contented with merely viewing the hand of providence, or in acknowledging the plan of divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is here operating for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral felicity, would be to halt at the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the temple of God. Gratitude, warm and fervent, united to a ſincere reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution 'to fear and to ſerve him,' is the return, which the Almighty beneficence claims from every worſhipper. It is the firſt ſacrifice of a heart capable of being touched by acts of unbounded love, by deeds of mercy and kindneſs ſo eminently extended not to us only, but, through our agency, to the whole human race. I confeſs to you, brethren, who deteſt ingratitude even to man, as the ſure but melancholy ſymptom of a heart, dark, gloomy, and void of every virtuous ſenſibility, when I recall to mind the paſt, contemplate the preſent, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the confederacy of cauſes, look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to thoſe bleſſings of peace, of order, of juſtice and of liberty, which are daily advancing with an accelerated progreſs, my ſoul becomes ſublimed with the grand idea of the undeviating love of God to man; I tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

world, the evident veſtiges of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, all wiſe, all merciful, and all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: my hopes, temporal as well as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, inſtead of fluctuating in the uncertain ocean of thoſe degrading ſentiments, which overwhelm the ſoul with fear and deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, are anchored even at the footſtool of the throne of God. Yes, brethren, ſtruck with the awful image of a goodneſs ſo generous and ſo extended, my heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows with gratitude, I form new reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to fear and to ſerve him, I exclaim with the Pſalmiſt—'Let the people praiſe thee, O God; let all the people praiſe thee. O let the nations be glad and ſing for joy; for thou ſhalt judge the people righteouſly, and govern the nations upon earth.'</p>
            <p>But, brethren, important conſiderations ſtill demand our attention. Has Heaven been thus propitious; are we poſſeſſed of all thoſe bleſſings which flow from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments founded in wiſdom, juſtice and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; doth the morning of America break forth refulgent with unclouded glory? Then it behoves us, above all things, to inquire, how are theſe bleſſings to be preſerved? how ſhall we enſure to her a meridian ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, worthy of ſuch a morning?—This inquiry immediately reſolves itſelf into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What is there in this ſublunary ſtate, that can attract the ſmiles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or enſure political happineſs, but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Never was there a mortal ſo deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never was there a conſcience ſo deaf to

that internal voice, which always whiſpers truth, but muſt acknowledge, that virtue only gives a title to hope for the favour of that high and lofty one, who inhabiteth eternity. Fellow-citizens, let virtue then, I entreat you, be the ruling principle, the polar ſtar, which ſhould influence every ſentiment, and guide every action, ſince it alone will conduct us into the Haven of felicity.—But will you truſt, for the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of virtue, to that political morality, which a vain philoſophy would ſubſtitute in the room of thoſe leſſons, which the heavenly teacher delivered? Shall virtue trickle from the oozy bed of political ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms, or ſhall it guſh, pure and in full ſtream, from the rock of our ſalvation? Ah! brethren, the moment that we drop the idea of a God, the remunerator of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but the avenger of iniquity; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we abandon that divine ſyſtem of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, fraternity, and univerſal benevolence, which the bleſſed Jeſus taught and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified; the moment that religion, the pure and undefiled religion, which Heaven, in compaſſion to the infirmity of human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vouchſafed to mortals, loſes its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over their hearts, from that fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, farewell to public and private happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, farewell, a long farewell to virtue, to patriotiſm, to liberty! Virtue, ſuch as republics and Heaven require, muſt have its foundation in the heart; it muſt pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the whole man; it muſt derive its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029016_0019_0FDE95F8B4DE7068"/>
and its <hi>Sanctions,</hi> not from the changeable ideas of the political moraliſt, or the caprice of the wiſeſt of human le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators, but from the unchangeable father of the univerſe, the God of love, whoſe laws, and whoſe will we are incited to obey by motives, the moſt powerful that can actuate the human ſoul. Men muſt ſee and feel, that it is God himſelf, their maker and their judge, who demands obedience to duties, which conſtitute their individual, their ſocial, their eternal happineſs. Then, and not till then, will virtue reign tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in the hearts of citizens; then will ſhe have her ſacrifices in the midſt of the deepeſt obſcurity, as well as in the open day, in the moſt private and ſecret retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as upon the houſe tops.</p>
            <p>There is, we will grant, a ſublime phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which may form her ſages, and even her virtuous and heroic ſages. But, will her abſtract doctrines concerning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation, ſtript of thoſe awful <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which religion annexes, touch the hearts of an entire nation, the poor, the ſimple, the unlettered, as well as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the wiſe? No, brethren, theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of philoſophy will appear, once perhaps, in a century; her leſſons of wiſdom, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to poſſeſs the efficacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, can be extended but to a few; whilſt religion diffuſes her ſoul-ſaving lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thro' the whole political maſs. It is not for the learned and wiſe only, that ſhe

reſerves the knowledge of her heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; they are addreſſed to the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of mankind; the whole univerſe is her ſchool. She has, moreover, this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing advantage; ſhe lays her divine hands upon the infant, and whilſt ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces him with the arms of mercy, ſtamps upon his tender, ſuſceptible mind, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible, but juſt and awful idea of a God, the judge as well as the creator of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, a God, whoſe all-ſeeing eye delights only in virtue, a God, who has promiſed thro' Jeſus Chriſt, a glorious and ever bleſſed immortality as the reward of well-doing, whilſt the torturing hour of ſhame, remorſe and miſery is ſhewn to await the impious and the wicked. Thus taught by religion, man becomes acquainted with his real character; inſtead of being amenable only to human laws, whoſe utmoſt vigilance he may and often does elude, he ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accountable to a being, as juſt as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, as omnipotent as omniſcient.

And yet, great God! how many are there among the ſons of men, urged, we hope, rather by the deluſive phantoms of their imaginations, than by the luſt of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſions, who would tear from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, proſtrate in the duſt, nay obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate from the face of the earth every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige of that divine, that beneficent ſyſtem of juſtice, fraternity and equality, which Jeſus Chriſt delivered!—raſh, unthinking mortals! liſten, at leaſt, to the prayer which that divine ſyſtem, ever breathing charity and compaſſion, ſtill offers up for its vindictive enemies; 'Father! forgive them, for they know not what they do!'</p>
            <p>Fellow-citizens, it is an eaſy taſk for thoſe who may have the honour of addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an American audience this day, to point out the excellencies of our civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to ſhew their ſuperior aptitude for the promotion of political happineſs, to evince that obedience to laws, conſtitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally enacted, is the only means of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty, and that every expreſſion of the public will is obligatory upon every citizen; to prove, that repreſentative republics, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being the prolific parents of anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and confuſion, are, on the contrary, of all the forms of government, under which men have yet aſſociated, either thro' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or choice, the moſt promotive of private and public happineſs, the moſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of that energy, which is equally capable of curbing the licentiouſneſs of the

Certainly, my brethren, it is a fundamental maxim, that virtue is the ſoul of a republic. But, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the proſperity of my country, I will repeat, and in theſe days, it is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite moment to inſiſt, that without religion, I mean <hi>rational religion,</hi> the religion which our Saviour himſelf delivered, not that of fanatics or inquiſitors, chimaeras and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are ſubſtantial things compared with that virtue, which thoſe who reject the authority of religion would recommend to our practice.—Ye then who love your country. if you expect or wiſh, that real virtue and ſocial happineſs ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among us, or, that genuine patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and a dignified obedience to law, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that ſpirit of diſorganizing anarchy, and thoſe falſe and hollow pretences to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, which are ſo pregnant with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, inſurrections and miſery, ſhould be the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans; or, that, the ſame Almighty arm
