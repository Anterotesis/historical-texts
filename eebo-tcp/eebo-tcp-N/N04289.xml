            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Exaimner, Examined, OR GILBERT TENNENT, HARMONIOUS.</head>
            <p>IT is ſtrange to think how the moſt generous and noble Actions, thro' the Force of ſome Craft and Artifice, aſſiſted with Prejudice and Falſhood, may be repreſented in the darkeſt Dreſs, as if they were Vices of the moſt ſordid kind.</p>
            <p>Seeing I am called to ſpeak in my own Defence, I hope the Reader will excuſe my ſaying as follows, <hi>Viz.</hi> That I never undertook any Thing with a deeper Senſe of my own Weakneſs, and a Sincerer Intention, to God's Glory and his Kingdoms Good; then my Journey to <hi>New-England:</hi> And never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent ſuch hardſhips by Reaſon of the intenſe Cold, frequent Travel, and continual Labours as there. So that I am like to feels the Effects thereof to my Death, having thereby contracted a hardneſs of hearing, with other bodily Diſorders. But that which Comforts me under thoſe Infirmitys is this, that the Eternal God was viſibly with me in that Journey, in ſealing my Labours with ſurprizing and manifold Succeſſes, (GLORY to his Name) in the <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of many Sinners to GOD; which ſome of the moſt eminent for <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> have already born ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Teſtimony to, and many Thouſands more can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:005297_0004_1016F5345F95C8F0"/>But behold the Reward our Anonymous Author is pleaſed to confer unpon me, and that under the guiſe of CHARITY, is <hi>ridicule, ſlander,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective.</hi> What, could not his Charity extend to ſpeak one favourable Word of that Journey, for which ſo many have with good Reaſon praiſed the bleſſed GOD? It ſeems not! However, it is my Support and Solace under all that load of Calumny, that is caſt upon me by the Oppoſers of GOD'S WORK, that Faithfulneſs to God and Succeſs in his Service, will appear in their own proper Light ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Day.</p>
            <p>It is no new Thing for the Servants of God to be traduc'd and repreſented as the Off-ſcouring of the Earth. Neither is it unuſual for his Work to be cover'd with <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> and aſcrib'd to a bad Cauſe: And conſidering the native Enmity of the Unregenerate againſt God and Goodneſs, and the Multitude of ſuch that are in the World of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Order, we needn't be ſurpriz'd at ſuch Events.</p>
            <p>If we will approve ourſelves Diſciples of CHRIST indeed, we muſt expect to bear his Croſs: And truly, according to the common Courſe of Things, the more extenſive Good we are enabled to do, we muſt expect to bear the more Reproach. What tho' we be ſound in Principle, Sincere in Heart, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious in Life to promote CHRIST'S Kingdom, yet with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and other primitive Servants of God, we ſhall be look'd upon as <hi>deceivers, diſturbers</hi> of the Peace and <hi>diſorderly</hi> Perſons. For as it was of old ſo it is now, <hi>He that was Born after the Fleſh, preſecuted him that was Born after the Spirit.</hi> Did not <hi>Cain</hi> hate his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe his own Deeds were Evil and his Brothers Righteous? And has not our Lord told us, that <hi>We ſhall be hated, becauſe we are not of the World?</hi> It is true ungodly Perſons in every Age, cover and colour their ſordid Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to goodneſs and uſefulneſs, with artful and plauſible Apoligy's, to prevent the Odium, that wou'd otherwiſe juſtly fall upon their Character.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005297_0005_1016F539802389A8"/>
They pretend Diſorders in Conduct, and Error in Principle, are the Grounds thereof; but if ſo, why don't they exert their Zeal againſt ſuch Evils, as well as Impieties of the groſſeſt Kind, which are flagrant in the Practice of ſome of their Brethren? No, ſuch Things, becauſe of the Relation ſubſiſting between them, are paſt over with ſilence and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence! While the Vertues of good Men, are put in the Dreſs of the moſt crimſon Impietys, &amp; their minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Foibles agravated by the Force of Sophiſtry, into maſſy Mountains; as well as the moſt Falſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious Charges invented and propogated, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Characters and Uſefulneſs at a Stroke! But the true Cauſe of all the mighty Buſtle, which is rais'd in every period of Time, againſt the Work and Servants of God, is induſtriouſly concealed, and that is, the Native Enmity of natural Men, of every Tribe and Order againſt God and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>Well, ſeeing the Caſe is ſo, we muſt therefore with Courage and Patience, follow our deareſt Lord, thro' <hi>good Report</hi> and <hi>bad Report,</hi> and conſider him <hi>who endur'd the Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf, leaſt we be weary and Faint in our Minds.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of our Maſter's Love to us, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of our own integrity, together with the believing Expectation of that exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, which is ſet before us, does and will ſweeten all the Sorrows of our State of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage! And therefore we may Anſwer the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious Oppoſers as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> the threatning Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Empreſs <hi>Eudoxia, that we fear nothing but Sin. (nil niſi peccatum timeo.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not diſturbed at the Author of this Pamphlet, for examining my Sentiments and Conduct, if either of them upon an impartial Tryal, be found cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, let them be condemned in the moſt open Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But I truſt it will appear by what follows, to every intelligent and impartial Reader, that the Method this Gentleman has us'd in the Compoſure of his <hi>Examiner,</hi> is exceptionable and partial. I hope
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005297_0006_1016F53B07058BE0"/>
I may ſay to the Glory of God, without the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of vain Boaſting, that I am ſo indifferent for the moſt Part, reſpecting the Opinion of the World, as to my Perſon and Performances, and ſo fully convinced of the Vanity, both of the Praiſes and Cenſures, of the moſt of Mankind, that I ſhould have given myſelf no Trouble to oppoſe the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Falacies of this Performance, had I not been convinc'd that it was my Duty to appear now in the juſt Vindication of Gods Work and Servants, which are therein traduc'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiner</hi> offers ſome Aſperſions concerning my Journey to <hi>New-England,</hi> which I know in my Conſcience to be Falſe, which being perſonal I tho't I was under a greater Advantage to detect.</p>
            <p>I am engag'd in other Work for God, from which I am with ſome degree of Reluctance di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by thorny Controverſy, but herein I muſt deny my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candid Reader,</hi> I muſt beg leave to obſerve <hi>(en paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)</hi> that our Caſe of late and at preſent, (in this Country) reſpecting the Promotion of vital Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſeems very much to reſemble that of <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and the other Builders of the Wall of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who were much oppos'd and ſomewhat interrupted in their Work, by the unreaſonable Fury and low Arts of <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> and his Aſſociates, who ſcoff'd at, and rag'd againſt the Builders, as well as rais'd falſe Reports reſpecting their Deſign and Conduct. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Heathen ſaid they, and <hi>Gaſhmu</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, <hi>that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cauſe thou buildeſt the Wall:</hi> They likewiſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to enſnare them by Craft, and enter'd into a deteſtable Conſpiracy to ſtop the Progreſs of the Work! May we who are thro' pure Grace upon God's Side, be enabled to follow <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in ſupplicating Heaven in this Immergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and we may hope for the finiſhing of the Wall, notwithſtanding all that the Oppoſers have done,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005297_0007_1016F53CE2020E00"/>
or can do, and ſeeing we are encompaſs'd with Enemy's of various Forms, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Prophane, Formaliſts, Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> let us with thoſe primitive Builders work in the Wall with one Hand, and hold a Weapon in the other. See <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.2.4. &amp; 6. chap.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer to the Subject of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enquirys, I can ſafely declare, that I have read this <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Performance, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of like nature ſet out by my Opponents, with a willingneſs to be convinced of Error in Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Practice, if I was guilty of either, and with a Reſolution to acknowledge them publickly, if I found the Caſe ſo. For I think that Maxim is moſt juſt <hi>viz. fas eſt, et ab hoſte doceri, It is lawful to be inſtructed even by an Enemy.</hi> And a Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Errors in Judgment, or Evils in Practice, is certainly a Debt we owe to Truth and Piety. But after the moſt calm and impartial Enquirys I am capable of making, I have not met with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction by their Arguments, or rather Reflections, unleſs it be of the Falſehood and Injuſtice of their Charges, the badneſs of their Cauſe, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of their Way of managing it.</p>
            <p>In particular I leave it to the Readers Judgment, whether the <hi>Examiner</hi> has not acted a diſingenuous Part in his labouring to expoſe my Name to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, while in the mean Time he conceals his own. Let him ask his own Conſcience, whether he has done in this, <hi>as he would be done by?</hi> Is this the Charity, which he ſays he put on in his firſt Page, then truly it is a very ſelfiſh Stamp, for it both begins and ends at home?</p>
            <p>Here let me obſerve, that I cannot but admire that a Perſon of our Authors Penetration, ſhould make ſo groſs a Blunder in the Choice of his Name, why ſhould he call himſelf <hi>Philalethes</hi> or <hi>a lover of Truth,</hi> while he makes it his Buſineſs to confute his Name, by his Practice in this Performance, to which it is prefixed? The repeated Falſhoods
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005297_0008_1016F540720DCC08"/>
with which his labour'd Sheets are ſtuff'd, ſuit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I humbly conceive, a contrary Name and Character, namely <hi>Miſalethes,</hi> or <hi>a hater of Truth;</hi> but the beſt Apology I can make for our Author, is that his Name is not proper but feign'd, and that perhaps his Deſign was better than his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, poſſibly he might be lead into ſome Miſtakes, by Miſinformation, Inconſideration, or by the force of Prejudice and Paſſion.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, the <hi>Examiner</hi> tells us in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Performance, <q>When I had read Mr. <hi>G. Tennent</hi>'s three firſt Sermons, on <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. repreſenting the neceſſity of holding faſt the Truth, with the Appendix, relating to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravian</hi> Errors, &amp;c. I immediately reviewed and compar'd them with his famous Sermon preach'd at <hi>Notingham, upon the Danger of an unconverted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> on <hi>Mark</hi> 16.44. and muſt confeſs, it is as impoſſible to reconcile them upon Principles of common Senſe, as to unite the two Poles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Were I of this Gentleman's Opinion, I wou'd immediately retract, in the moſt open Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but being perſwaded that there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in the Matter. I ſhall therefore eſſay to ſhew the Harmony that is between them, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what our Author has ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſomething odd, that immediately after the <hi>Examiner</hi> had put on as he tells us (<hi>Pag.</hi> 1.) <hi>Charity which is not eaſily provok'd, and hopeth all Things;</hi> that he ſhould uſe ſuch Terms of Contempt as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And becauſe it ſeems hard for a <hi>High Prieſt</hi> to confeſs his Errors once a Year, tho' he may love to be Father Confeſſor himſelf, and bring others to the Stool.</q> It ſeems by what has been ſaid, that the Cloak was not but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd very cloſe upon him; whether this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be a Miniſter or not, which he diſdainfully terms High Prieſt, perhaps not only to give vent to his Prejudice, but the better to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005297_0009_1016F544618FCFE8"/>
I know not, but methinks he might have at preſent wav'd his ſarcaſtical Fleer about bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to the Stool, while this very Thing is, at leaſt in Pretence, the Buſineſs of his preſent Performance; which is like to fail of Succeſs, for the want of a juſt Foundation. But whether, when our Author reads the juſt Charges that are offer'd againſt his Conduct, in the following Pages, he will like to be brought to the Stool himſelf and make publick Retractations with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> according to his own Advice to me, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. Time muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover?</p>
            <p>As to the reprinting of my <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon at <hi>Boſton,</hi> I had no hand in it, but if I had, I ſee no Reaſon that I ſhould have to repent of ſuch an Action. I have not ſeen that Sermon for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time, before the other Day, but hearing ſo many Outcries againſt it; I was induc'd to read it over and over, with calmneſs to ſee if there was a Foundation for the mighty Oppoſition made againſt it; but upon enquiry I could not but think that as to the Matter and Subſtance of it, it was but <hi>the naked Truth,</hi> and ſuch as, if fairly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all its Adverſaries will never be able to confute.</p>
            <p>But why does this Author, bring in the Rev. Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> upon this Occaſion; ſeeing that many Thouſands have approv'd of the Sermon as well as he, doubtleſs it was to expoſe him to contempt among the Ungodly; becauſe that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon has much irritated natural Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
            <p>Since Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> (ſays he) has judged it an unanſwerable Piece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It appears to be ſo yet, notwithſtanding what has been ſaid againſt it. The <hi>Queriſts</hi> in their third Part, which is level'd againſt this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, expreſs as little regard to Truth, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, as to Religion and fair Reaſoning; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Men of a wild and luxuriant Turn of Thought, who are diſpoſed to deride and burleſque
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005297_0010_1016F5475ECDD188"/>
with prophane irreverence, what is moſt ſacred and ſerious; and therefore what they offer in their Performance, hardly deſerves any Notice from ſuch as are inclined to Truth, Sobriety, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And had not the aforeſaid gloomy Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients been frequent and flagrant in their Writings, they would have been long ſince replied to. But it is an uncomfortable Task to deal with Men that will hardly ſtick at any Thing. In ſhort the <hi>Queriſts</hi> Compoſure upon which the <hi>Examiner</hi> lays ſo great a Streſs, in his preſent Performance, is but a Voluminous Bundle of confident Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and rude Billingſgate, wherein the true State of the Queſtion is perverted. To make this evident, I would obſerve that the two Particulars in the Sermon againſt which their Reaſonings would ſeem principally to turn, are theſe <hi>viz.</hi> 1. what I have ſaid in the 7. <hi>pag.</hi> concerning natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men, that they have no Call of God to the miniſterial Work, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation. And 2. What I have ſaid from <hi>pag.</hi> 18. to 29. reſpecting Perſons going ſtatedly from hearing one Miniſter to another, for greater good. What they have offer'd againſt me concerning thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, are the main Pillars of that Performance, which if they be overſet, the whole Fabrick falls.</p>
            <p>Here let the <hi>Reader</hi> obſerve, that the Plan I went upon in the Sermon, and Aſſertion aforeſaid, was this <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a two fold Call to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward</hi> the firſt conſiſting princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in, or rather evidenced by the pious Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Aims of the Perſon, and the latter in his regular external Separation to the Miniſterial Work. It is evident from the Words of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, that I meant the <hi>inward</hi> Call.—The Words are theſe, <q>Is it not a Principal Part, of the ordinary Call of God to the miniſterial Work, to aim at the Glory of God, and in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination thereto, the good of Souls; as their chief Marks, in their Undertaking that Work.</q>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005297_0011_1016F54AED136208"/>
I cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed to mean the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Call, by the aforeſaid Words, except I was intirely void of common Senſe, and ſo unable to diſtinguiſh between what is <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward.</hi> But ſurely the <hi>Queriſts</hi> didn't take me to be <hi>non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> otherwiſe they have reflected upon their own Underſtandings, by writing ſo much againſt me, and yet the <hi>Queriſts,</hi> have diſingenuouſly apply'd them to the <hi>outward Call,</hi> and ſo miſrepreſented my meaning, and the true State of the Queſtion, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. in their 5. Queſtion, they ſignify, <q>what they take to be the <hi>Call</hi> of God to the Miniſtry, and ſay that it is ſome publick and authoritative Declaration, of Gods Will, &amp;c.</q> Which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews that they mean the <hi>external</hi> or <hi>outward</hi> Call only. And in the following Paragraph, they ſay in anſwer to my Queſtion in the Sermon, namely, <hi>Is it not a principal Part of the ordinary Call of God to the Miniſterial Work, to aim at Gods Glory, and in Subordination thereto the Good of Souls?</hi> They anſwer, <hi>That it is no Part of Gods Call to the Miniſtry, much leſs a principal Part of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It's true, it is no Part of the <hi>external</hi> Call; here they endeavour to repreſent me, as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the aforeſaid good Diſpoſition, gives Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to exerciſe the Miniſtry; which was ever far from my Thoughts, and which there is not one Word of in that Sermon, which they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to oppoſe. What I have ſaid reſpecting the <hi>inward</hi> Call they apply to the <hi>outward</hi> and thus they miſrepreſent, and miſapply, what I have ſpoken, and ſo do not reaſon againſt my Opinion chiefly but their own Miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>That my <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon was fram'd upon the Plan or Notion of a two fold Call, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more clearly by comparing what has been already mentioned, from the 7 <hi>pag.</hi> of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with what is ſaid <hi>pag.</hi> 31. where I obſeve that <q>
                  <hi>Phariſaick,</hi> or unconverted Miniſters are no Shepherds, (no faithful Ones) in CHRIST'S Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005297_0012_1016F54ED88AD640"/>
There it is plainly intimated, that I own'd them to be Miniſters, true and lawful ones in the ſight of the Church, but not faithful ones in the Account of CHRIST. Yea the Caſe is ſo plain, that the <hi>Queriſts</hi> themſelves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. in theſe Words, <q>doth it not ſeems that the vulgar Diſtinction, between the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> Call, the Call of God and the Call of Man to the Miniſtry, is the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the above Miſtake in Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' the <hi>Queriſts</hi> deny the aforeſaid Aim, &amp;c. to be any Part of the Call of God to the Miniſtry; yet they own it to be a Qualification requiſite in the Perſons call'd, to render them fit, for the Work they are call'd to <hi>pag.</hi> 55. <hi>queſt</hi> 6. <q>Whence then doth this Confuſion in which Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> ſeems to labour, ariſe? Doth it not proceed from his jumbling and mixing many Things together, which are of a quite different Nature and Order, as if they were one and the ſame Thing? For doth not he confound the authoritative Call, Commiſſion or Command of God, which is the divine Act, either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or mediately, with the Qualifications requiſite in the Perſons called, to render them fit for the Work they are called to, as if they were the ſelf ſame Thing?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No! I have not confounded them, I have never ſaid nor tho't that any Perſon, by reaſon of his good Diſpoſitions or Aims, had Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Authority, to exerciſe the miniſterial Office. And do not the <hi>Queriſts</hi> contradict themſelves in this Charge? While they elſewhere own as I have already obſerv'd, <q>that the vulgar Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> Call, was the Foundation of my Miſtake.</q> How could I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them, and yet confound them? But here let it be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Queriſts</hi> do own the Unfitneſs of natural Men for the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was the principal Thing I deſign'd to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005297_0013_1016BA3B0FF9AD08"/>
prove in the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon. And what if I had given a wrong Name, to what is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves to be neceſſary, why would they make me ſo great an Offender for a Word? <hi>Under</hi> this <hi>Conſideration,</hi> what is their Debate but a meer <hi>Logomachy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, I did not ſo fully and expreſsly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my Propoſition, in the 7. <hi>pag.</hi> as I might have done, and this is all the Shadow for caviling upon the Call to the Miniſtry, which the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts,</hi> probably to anſwer ſome private Deſign, have us'd all the Arts of Sophiſtry in improving; but it is plain to any that read that Sermon with Attention, that in conſequence of the aforeſaid Diſtinction of an <hi>outward</hi> and an <hi>inward</hi> Call, I diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and faithful Miniſters. See <hi>pag.</hi> 31. where it is ſaid, <q>there is no probability (<hi>i. e.</hi> as to many of them) of getting good, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of <hi>Phariſees:</hi> For they are no Shepherds (no faithful ones) in Chriſts Account.</q> Thoſe that have an <hi>outward</hi> Call only, may be ſaid to be true Miniſters in the Sight of the Church, their Miniſtrations are valid, yea they may be ſaid to be true Miniſters <hi>in the Sight of God in this Reſpect,</hi> namely, that they come into the Miniſtry <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules or Orders,</hi> which God has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Church; But they cannot be ſaid to be faithful Ones, ſeeing they have no Faith.—If they are not faithful in the Affairs of their own Souls, how can they be ſuppos'd to be faithful in the Affairs of others?</p>
            <p>Now when I ſay in that Sermon, that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Men are not ſent of God into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, I mean theſe Things following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. that they are deſtitute of an Aim at Gods Glory above all, and other pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſpoſitions, without which they are not well qualified for the Miniſterial Work; and therefore (comparatively at leaſt) are unlikely to do much good in it. And 2. I do not find under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005297_0014_1016F55075371F88"/>
Diſpenſation, that unconverted Men are mov'd or inclin'd by the Spirit of God to undertake the miniſterial Office, but by their own or by a worſe Spirit. And 3. that Almighty God does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his Word, nor approve of, unconverted Men taking upon them the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; theſe Things the Scriptures and Reaſonings in the Sermon plainly prove; and indeed ſuch as oppoſe them, oppoſe the true Intereſt of vital Godlineſs, which are not like to be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted without a pious Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The anonymous <hi>Queriſts</hi> betray a bad Temper of Mind, in their labouring to enervate, what I have ſaid in the aforeſaid Sermon, reſpecting the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortableneſs of the Miniſtry of natural Men to gracious Souls; herein they oppoſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe of the Faithful; and in their cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at what is offer'd in the Sermon, concerning the unprofitableneſs of the Miniſtry of graceleſs Men, for the moſt Part; in reſpect of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Converſion of Sinners, they not only manifeſt an evil Diſpoſition, but contradict the plaineſt Teſtimony's of Scripture and Experience. Theſe Things are ſo ſelf evident, that it is ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to find profeſſors of Religion oppoſing them.</p>
            <p>Is not this the plain Tendency of the <hi>Queriſts</hi> reaſoning upon this Head? Namely, to encourage ungodly Men to take upon them the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, as well as to encourage People to an indifferency in their Choice of Miniſters, and are not both theſe Things fatal to the Church of God, ſhould not Extreams be avoided on every Hand?</p>
            <p>That there is an <hi>outward</hi> and an <hi>inward</hi> Call to the Goſpel Miniſtry, is aſſerted by many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of principal Note, among the reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; to this Effect ſpake the Rev. Meſſ <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Bracle.</hi> Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> in his <hi>Panſebia</hi> repreſents this to be the Opinion of all the <hi>Preſbyterians;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I thought it had been ſo too, till I met with
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005297_0015_1016F5525FCC84A8"/>
the <hi>Queriſts</hi> Performance, which is done by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are fond of that Name. I could wiſh for their own Sakes, that they were as fond of the Thing ſignify'd by it, in this as well as in other Particulars. But the Caſe is ſo plain, reſpecting the Diſtinction of an <hi>outward</hi> and an <hi>inward</hi> Call to the Miniſtry, being held by many; That the <hi>Queriſts</hi> themſelves are forc'd to confeſs its Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity. <hi>pag.</hi> 55. <hi>queſt.</hi> 7. <q>Doth it not ſeem, that the imbibing and improving the falſe tho' vulgar Diſtinction between the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> Call, the Call of God and the Call of Man to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, is the Foundation of the above Miſtake in Mr <hi>T?</hi>
               </q> Here they own it to be vulgar, <hi>or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received;</hi> and indeed ſo it is; for this is the Opinion of the whole Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as appears from her Directory, which they and we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, as the Standard of our Proceedings and Sentiments, reſpecting the Affairs of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Under the Head of Ordination, are theſe Words, <q>Which being conſidered by the Presbytery they ſhall proceed to enquire touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grace of God in him, and whether he be of ſuch holineſs of Life, as is requiſite in a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and to examine him, touching his Learning and Sufficiency, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Evidences of his calling to the Holy Miniſtry; and in particular his fair and direct calling to that Place.</q> Here it is evident, that they aſſert a Call to the Miniſtry, before Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore an <hi>inward</hi> Call. This is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as with a Sun Beam in thoſe Words, and therefore the <hi>Queriſts</hi> ſhew either little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their own avowed Principles, or little regard to them, by denying it. And indeed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they offer much Reaſon to ſuſpect their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the Miniſtry. Alas what ſuperficial Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt they be, who deny the <hi>inward</hi> Call, is it becauſe they han't it themſelves, or is it to run down with the Cry of <hi>Error, Error,</hi> ſuch as
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005297_0016_1016F55411F15E58"/>
think it neceſſary to hold the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples contain'd in our excellent Directory? If ſo their Caſe or Courſe is miſerable. And do not the Church of England in their Ordination Office, propoſe theſe Queſtions to the Candidate, before Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Do you truſt that you are <hi>inwardly</hi> moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon you this Office and Adminiſtration? And are you called according to the Will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Laws of this Realm?</q> This is ſo plain and poſitive to the Point in diſpute, that there is no need of any Addition to explain it. The <hi>Reader</hi> may herefrom eaſily perceive, what ſort of a Spirit the <hi>Queriſts</hi> are of, who labour to caſt Contempt upon the avowed Principles of the <hi>Body</hi> of the Proteſtant Churches, reſpecting this Point under debate.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing I did not aſſert the Neceſſity of an extraordinary Call, in the ordinary Times of the Goſpel; conſiſting in Viſions, and Voices and the like, or that good Diſpoſitions and Aims, were ſufficient to conſtitute a Miniſter, or give a Right to exerciſe that Office, without a regular external Separation thereto, according to the Order of God, neither of which, I ever believ'd or expreſs'd; what neceſſity was there then for ſo long and warm a Diſpute, againſt our and their excellent Directory, unleſs it was to amuſe the Ignorant, and prejudice them againſt thoſe whom they hated, and wanted to pull down?</p>
            <p>But the Truth of the Caſe is this, ſome of theſe Men have been leſs eſteemed, by ſome of their Hearers, after the Work of God ſpread among them, than before; and others whom they diſlik'd have been eſteem'd above them; neither of which they could brook, they have therefore taken up Arms againſt Gods Work and his Servants, whom he has us'd in promoting it, and have endeavour'd by all Means, <hi>(per fas neſaſ<expan>

the ignorant Populace, they have rais'd the <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Diſorder,</hi> againſt thoſe whom they diſdain, and have put their Wits upon the Tenters, to find out Matter to ſupport the Charge, partly by invidious and falſe Gloſſes, upon the Writings of their Opponents, and by artfully magnifying ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Indiſcretions in Conduct, and partly by either Inventing or Propagating notorious Falſhoods concerning them.</p>
            <p>That God, whoſe we are, and whom we ſerve, knows, that it was our Intention in travelling to bring poor Sinners to CHRIST JESUS, as well as to build up Saints in him, and not to divide Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they do falſly Charge us, it is they that are the proper Cauſes of the Diviſions among us, by their oppoſing that bleſſed Work of Conviction and Converſion, that has not long ſince been ſpreading in their Borders! Had they join'd with us as they ought to have done, in promoting that Work, and as they will wiſh one Day they had done, there would have been no Diviſions among us: But inſtead of this, they have us'd ſly and ſophiſtical Methods, in abuſing every ſeemingly or really exceptionable Incident, to caſt odious Colours upon the whole Work, they have likewiſe oppos'd God's Work, by their falſe and dangerous <hi>Moravian</hi> Doctrine, about Conviction. Witneſs, Mr. <hi>Thompſons</hi> deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inconſiſtent Performance, entitled, <hi>The Doctrine of Convictions ſet in a clear Light;</hi> which divers Miniſters of that ſchiſmatical Party, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their Appobation of: Hardly any thing can be invented, that has a more direct Tendency, to deſtroy the common Operations of God's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to keep Men from JESUS CHRIST, than what Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> has expreſs'd in that Performance.</p>
            <p>C. E. G. <hi>pag.</hi> 2.7. He ſays, <q>Firſt, as to theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory ungracious Convictions, as I may call them, which are held to be ſo neceſſary, by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for Converſion. I apprehend that if their Nature and Tendency be duly conſidered, it will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005297_0018_1016BA385CB32330"/>
appear, that all ſuch Convictions, as are void of true Grace, are ſo far from being neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives for Converſion, that they, are rather an Impediment to it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. That theſe common Convictions may be ſometimes ſucceeded with true Converſion, I do not deny, but when it is ſo, the Converſion following cannot be juſtly reckon'd the proper Effect of theſe Convictions, altho' it may be occaſion'd by them, as it may be by the Commiſſion of ſome groſs Sin, which deeply wounds the natural Conſcience. <hi>Pag</hi> 33.34. It is evident that whatever Convictions, may be rais'd in a Perſons Mind, which are void of the foregoing Marks of ſaving Conviction, or whatever Fear or Terrors may follow or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſuch Convictions, can have no native Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to lead or prepare Perſons for Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What nearer to Converſion is a Perſon, or better prepar'd for it, by his being convinc'd of Sin and Guilt, while ſtill his Heart, Love and Affections are under the reigning Power of it? Nor is he humbly affected, with a Senſe of its Vileneſs. How much was <hi>Judas</hi> prepar'd for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by his Convictions and Terrors? Yea ſuch ungracious Convictions tend rather to ſcare a Perſon from Chriſt, than draw him unto him: <hi>pag.</hi> 39. From which it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Convictions which are neceſſary to Converſion, are in Truth a Part of the Work it ſelf, or to ſpeak more diſtinctly, nothing elſe, but that very Principle of Grace, implanted in and by Converſion; puting forth it ſelf in the Exerciſe of Conviction, or Perſuaſion of the Perſon's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſinful and miſerable State, according to the Word. The Heart and Conſcience bearing Witneſs thereto.</q> For the Confutation of this nonſenſical <hi>Moravian</hi> Notion, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to my Sermons againſt the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravians pag.</hi> 3. 4. 5. and to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi>'s
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005297_0019_1016F55EDE321270"/>
ingenious Dialogues, wherein this Point is more largely diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>Our Oppoſers, as I am credibly inform'd, have done much Injury to Religion by indiſtinct and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Diſcourſes upon this Point, <hi>viz. That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have Grace and not know it.</hi> This was inſiſted upon at a Time, when Multitudes were under Convictions, and the Conſequence was, that many relapſed into their former Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>They have likewiſe, as has been obſerv'd, rais'd the Cry of Order, and ſet it in ſuch a Light, as has had a Tendency to blacken the Characters of ſome of God's poor Servants, in the Opinion of ſome, and its probable that this was their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; this has likewiſe been a plauſible Mean of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing God's Work in the Land.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is the Artifice and Trick which the Oppoſers of Religion have uſed againſt God's faithful Servants of old. <hi>Elijah</hi> was charged by <hi>Ahab</hi> as a <hi>Troubler of Iſrael, Paul</hi> repreſented as a <hi>Mover of Sedition,</hi> and our LORD himſelf was faulted for not obſerving the Tradition of the Fathers. And thus while our Oppoſers contend for what is comparatively but the tything of <hi>Mint,</hi> and <hi>Annies,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> they neglect the weightier Matters of the Law.</p>
            <p>But the 2d Particular, againſt which the <hi>Queriſts</hi> Reaſonings (if they may be ſo called) are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally directed, is reſpecting what I have ſaid in the 18 and 19 <hi>pag.</hi> of the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If the Miniſtry of natural Men be, as it has been repreſented, then it is both lawful and expedient, to go from them to hear Godly Perſons; yea it is ſo far from being ſinful to do this, that one who lives under a pious Miniſter of leſſer Gifts, after having ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly endeavour'd to get Benefit by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and gets little or none, but doth find real Benefit, and more Benefit elſewhere, I ſay he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005297_0020_1016F562DCA920B0"/>
may lawfully go, and that frequently, where he gets moſt Good to his precious Soul after regular Application to the Paſtor where he lives for his Conſent, and propoſing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof, when this is done in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs without contempt of any, as alſo without raſh Anger or vain Curioſity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Queriſts</hi> do moſt unjuſtly repreſent my Meaning, in the aforeſaid Paragraph, as appears from the 95 <hi>pag</hi> of their Pamphlet, where they ſay, as to the fourth Inference, <q>which ſeems to have been the main ſcope of the Performance, <hi>viz.</hi> To diſſolve all relative Bonds and Ties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Paſtor and People, at leaſt to proclaim them null and void, as to the People's Obligation therefrom to attend upon the Adminiſtrations of their own fixed Paſtors ſtatedly; ſo that if we take Mr. <hi>T.</hi> up right, his declared Judgment here is, that People, after the Choice of a Miniſter to be their ſtated Paſtor, are at their free Liberty to abſent themſelves from his Miniſtry, as far and as often as they, or any of them pleaſes, whether the Miniſter be godly or graceleſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What they have ſaid is as contrary as any Thing can be, to my expreſs Declaration in the preceeding Paragraph: If I thought, as the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts</hi> ſuggeſt, that People may abſent themſelves as far and as often as they pleaſe, I would not have expreſsly guarded againſt it, by mentioning a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious regular Application, and thus it is evident, that the <hi>Queriſts</hi> do not argue againſt my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fairly ſtated, but firſt miſrepreſent it, and then oppoſe with much earneſtneſs their own Figment, and therefore all their Reaſonings on that Head fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>Let my Opinion be fairly ſtated as it is in the Sermon, and this Exception from that general Rule added, namely, that they ſhould go where they get the moſt Good ſtatedly, after regular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Miniſter, or Church Seſſion, whereto
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005297_0021_1016F5646445E768"/>
they belong, unleſs their particular Good endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or obſtructs the general Good of the Society, whereto they have a Relation, in this we ought doubtleſs to prefer the general before our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Good, <hi>e. g.</hi> it may ſo happen, that if a Perſon of great Importance and Influence in a little Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſhould go ſtatedly elſewhere, it would break the Society. This and ſuch like Caſes we muſt deny ourſelves.</p>
            <p>As to going elſewhere after Application,— I mean no more, and no leſs than this, that we ſhould pay all that Deference to Church Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which is conſiſtent with the Right of private Judgment, in Matters of Conſcience. Any who carry the Matter farther, as it ſeems the <hi>Queriſts</hi> do, by what I have mentioned from them and others, paſs under the ſpecious Names of Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they erect a Tyranny upon the Ruins of every Thing that is valuable in human Nature. Now let my Opinion be ſtated as aforeſaid, and I may bid Defiance to the <hi>Queriſts</hi> and all of their Stamp to overthrow it.</p>
            <p>But to ſet my Opinion in a more clear and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Light, I ſhall take leave to mention the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars, which are either expreſs'd in, or plainly deducible from, the 19 <hi>pag.</hi> of my <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, I do not aſſert or maintain, that Perſons may or ſhould go from their own Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to others at all, much leſs frequently, meerly in order to tickle an exorbitant Fancy, or for the ſake of vain Curioſity, No! No! Upon the contrary I believe, it is ſinful to go from a more plain awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Soul ſearching and ſavoury Miniſtry, to a leſs plain, leſs awakening, leſs ſavoury one, meerly to get carnal Eaſe to a labouring Mind, or Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to a Diſtemper'd Palate, by affected Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſt or gingle of Language, Nor</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do I profeſs or maintain, an irregular Seceſſion to be lawful or laudable? I mean that Perſons
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005297_0022_1016F5671C4B7050"/>
ſhou'd go frequently to other Churches, without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to their own Miniſter or Church Conſiſtory, for Leave in this Affair, rendring the Reaſons of their Requeſt. If their Reaſons are not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valid, and the Caſe be really ſo, they ought to deſiſt, but if they are wrong'd, they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to a higher Judicatory; but if the Caſe ſhould ſo happen, that after all the Appeals they can make, and moſt humble and impartial Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Affair, they firmly believe they are wrong'd by the Church Judicatories, and are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bound in the Matter, they ought to judge for themſelves, and act according to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: For ſurely we are not bound to implicite Faith in, and Obedience to, Church Rulers; No, we are only to be ſubject to them in the Lord, as our excellent <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith</hi> inſtructs us. Nor</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do I approve of an angry Seceſſion, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, thro' Envy, Malice or Contempt, from the hearing of our Pariſh Miniſter: For this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly oppos'd to the bleſſed Law of Love, which is the ſummary and compend of the divine Precepts, and looks with a frowning Aſpect upon the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of Chriſtianity: When People do withdraw, it ought to be in the Spirit of Meekneſs with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Love, avoiding unjuſt and invidious Reflections, and on the contrary, as much as may be, conſulting the juſt honour of the Miniſter, we withdraw from. Nor</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do I approve of a haſty Seceſſion, without conſiderable Tryal, to get Good under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of thoſe we are related to: For that may be followed with unhappy Conſequences. Doubtleſs, Extreams on both Sides of the Queſtion ſhould be avoided, as the People ſhould not be enſlaved on the one Hand, and brought to the fatal Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of acting contrary to their Conſciences, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the moſt edifying Means: So the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Comfort and Support of the Miniſtry, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005297_0023_1016F568A3734588"/>
Safety of particular Societies, ſhould be conſulted and regarded on the other. Nor</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do I approve of withdrawing from a Church, meerly to avoid the juſt Cenſures of it, for this tends to diſanull its Government, and introduce Confuſion and Anarchy.</p>
            <p>Here it muſt be confeſs'd, that as Miniſters are apt to be under the Influence of a Partial Byaſs, when their Honour or Intereſt is or ſeems to be touched, having like Paſſions with other Men; ſo the People are liable to the following Extreams, namely, either to make no Difference at all among Miniſters, or to make too much: The former they are inclined to, while under the Power of a deep Security, and the latter they are in great Danger of, when they are awakened, and for ſome Time after their Converſion. Now both theſe Evils ſhould be oppos'd and corrected, for indeed both are very hurtful. Duty lies here (as Philoſophers ſay of Vertue in general) in a mediocrity or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between thoſe Extreams. Miniſters ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſlighted or idolized. But poſitively what I believe and profeſs in the preſent Caſe is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is lawful for a Perſon, who lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Miniſter of leſſer Gifts, (even tho' really religious) that after having, with Simplicity and Uprightneſs, us'd his utmoſt Endeavours, (ſo far as aſſiſted by God) to gain Benefit by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and yet gets little or none, but doth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where get Good, or more Good, (eſpecially by one of the ſame Perſuaſion) after regular Application, to go where he gets moſt Good to his Soul. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Much more from a Chriſtleſs Miniſter under the aforeſaid Circumſtances, both lawful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, after the Application before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Here let the Reader obſerve, that the aforeſaid more particular and diſtinct Account, which I have now given of my Opinion, reſpecting that Point which the <hi>Queriſts</hi> and <hi>Examiner</hi> principally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is but a Tranſcript of what I had written
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005297_0024_1016F56A673B7500"/>
as my Sentiments upon this Subject many Years before the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon was preach'd.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould take the ſame trifling ſophiſtical and voluminous Method's with the <hi>Queriſts</hi> Performance, as they have done with my Sermon, the Book would ſwell to a Quarto, if not a Folio Volumn perhaps, and this would be much for Edification, woudn't it? It would be no hard Task to tell of 11 yea of 20 Maxims of ſelfiſh Policy, and falſe Doctrine, that ſeem to be at the Bottom of their Arguings, but I have ſomething of more Importance to manage. Why don't theſe wondrous wiſe and learned Men, the <hi>Queriſts,</hi> and others of their Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, take famous Dr. <hi>Voetius,</hi> one of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lights of the Reformed Churches to task, and confute his accurate Diſſertation upon this Subject, in his Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy, pag.</hi> 68. <hi>queſt.</hi> 17. and likewiſe in his Book of <hi>Aſcetic Theology, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 222. 3. There they may find their petty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms and unlearned Cavils fully baffled I would adviſe them to do it in <hi>Latin</hi> for the Benefit of all the Churches: Such great Men ſhoudn't lie conceal'd. If they take the ſame Method of quibbling and ſaying a great deal beſide the Point in Diſpute, as they have done with me, they'll be ſure of confuting him, in the Opinion of their graceleſs and Ignorant Admirers eſpecially. And after they have done this in order to compleat a large Volumn upon the Subject, they may likewiſe take to task, <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> and <hi>Fener,</hi> two learned and pious Britiſh Divines, who are alſo of my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (ſee <hi>Hilder</hi> Lectures <hi>pag.</hi> 271. and <hi>pag.</hi> 253 4.) and confute them too; which if they purſue their uſual Method, they may eaſily effect as aforeſaid; they are ſuch Dabſters at diſputing, or cavilling ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I queſtion whether any Writing in the World can ſtand them in their Way.</p>
            <p>One Inſtance of which under the preſent Head I am diſcourſing upon, I ſhall take leave to mention is, their making the Relation of a Miniſter to his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005297_0025_1016F56C595F8F48"/>
People, the ſame with that of a Husband to his Wife, in reſpect of their Obligation to attend ſtatedly upon his Miniſtry; <hi>ſee pag.</hi> 133.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. <q>Tho' we allow Men ſhould ſeek the greater Good; yet we would ask, Whether this greater Good be moſt likely to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Way of God's Appointment, and in the Uſe of regular and not irregular Means? Or whether the Notion that ſtolen Bread is ſweet, be a true or a falſe Notion? Or to uſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s own Phraſe, <hi>Doth not he act like a Fool,</hi> who forſakes his own chaſte Wife, in Hopes of getting more Pleaſure in the Embraces of a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Former agrees well with what they ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 116. thus, <q>Is it not ſome Affront to ſay, in the open Parlour, that <hi>Doll is as good as my Lady;</hi> but muſt ſhe be better too?</q>
            </p>
            <p>That there is an Obligation upon the People to attend upon their Paſtors Miniſtrations ſtatedly, I do not deny but affirm; but in the mean Time, I abhor the Notion of the <hi>Queriſts, viz. That, that Obligation is equal to the Marriage Contract:</hi> For if ſo, it will neceſſarily follow, that every Time the Miniſter preaches to any beſides his own People, he commits Adultery, and every Time the People hear another, they likewiſe commit Adultery. At this Rate a Miniſter would be no Miniſter, but in his own Pariſh, and every Time he Steps over the Line, his Right to exerciſe his miniſterial Office evaniſhes.</p>
            <p>Beſides, according to this Plan, the Presbyterian Churches, by maintaining the Lawfulneſs of the tranſporting of Miniſters from one Place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to exerciſe their Paſtoral Office there ſtatedly, and that purely to promote the greater Good of the Church; and their acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly is a maintaining and practiſing of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and do not the <hi>Queriſts</hi> profeſs this very Doctrine, while they aſſume the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> name,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005297_0026_1016F5734755F1E8"/>
and have they not acted according to it, in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſocial Manner not long ſince? Well then don't they according to their own Plan of Reaſoning avow and practiſe Adultery? Beſides it may be here obſerv'd, that the <hi>Queriſts</hi> have ſo far forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plan of Government, that they have in this Point under debate, adobted the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Notion of the rigid <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Browniſts,</hi> what little Reaſon have theſe Men to glory in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Name?</p>
            <p>Seeing the Relation between Paſtor and People is mutual, muſt not what they Term a Breach of it be upon both Sides equally Criminal? If a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may go from the People to whom he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and preach ſtatedly to others, after a regular Diſmiſſion, in order to do more Good to the Souls, of Men, why then mayn't the People go ſtatedly to get greater Good to their Souls, after the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Application, ſhoudn't we be as careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our own as anothers Good? And pray why are not the <hi>Presbitery</hi> as capable to judge of Peoples getting Good, as of the probability of a Miniſters doing Good?</p>
            <p>I have not Leiſure nor Inclination, to offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Remarks upon the Prophanity of the <hi>Queriſts,</hi> their begging the Queſtion in debate, and many other Abſurdities, which are contain'd in what I have but now cited from them. And therefore I ſhall only take leave at preſent to add: That theſe Oppoſers of God's Work, thro' their Selfiſhneſs, and the Heat of their Prejudice have endeavour'd to confute virtually and conſequentially their own profeſſed Opinion and Practice, as well as the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches univerſally. What a Shame is it, that theſe Men ſhould caſt Scandalous Reflections upon the <hi>Body of the reformed Churches,</hi> and labour to prove them all to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Adultery as well as themſelves?</p>
            <p>Pray hasn't every ordained Miniſter, an habitual Relation to the whole viſible Church? And muſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005297_0027_1016F574CE0EE080"/>
not this be brought into Exerciſe as to particular Societies, in a regular Manner, as the greater Good of the whole requires, is it not contrary to common Senſe, to immagine that ſeeing every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, has an habitual Relation to, and is a Member of the whole viſible Church, and is by Conſcience and Office oblig'd to promote the greater Good thereof, that his actual Relation to any particular Branch of it, ſhould continue any longer than is conſiſtent herewith? As the common Maxim is <hi>ex ungue Leonem, by the Claw the Lyon is known,</hi> So the Reader by this Inſtance may gueſs at the Temper of the <hi>Queriſts,</hi> and their manner of trifling in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. But enough of this</p>
            <p>I return to our <hi>Examiners</hi> Performance, and beg his Pardon that I have interupted by ſo long a Digreſſion, my remarks upon it; and doing it the Juſtice it deſerves. But ſeeing it was only to pay ſome Complements, to a Work of his dear Friends, which he has in ſo high Eſteem; I hope he will have me excus'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiner</hi> ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 4 <q>That Mr. <hi>T's</hi> zealous Advocates here, and elſewhere, have by Way of Charity, diſpers'd about the Country, great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the laſt Edition, (meaning of the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon) tending to corrupt the Minds of People, from the Simplicity which is in CHRIST, and to promote that Confuſion and ſeperating Spirit, which he himſelf has been inſtrumental in raiſing in many Places.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What this Author Means, by the Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty "which is in CHIST, I cannot tell, but ſure I am that inſtead of corrupting Mens Minds, &amp;c. it tends to prevent their being corrupted, to inform them of the Danger of an ungodly Miniſtry; and to direct Men to the beſt Means, has a direct Tendency to bring them to CHRIST, and to the Simplicity that is in him. Both which Particulars are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Scope of that Sermon, (which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor oppoſes) and therefore it was an act of true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005297_0028_1016F578C76BD378"/>
in thoſe whom he calls my Advocates, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe them. But on the Contrary to excite People to an Indifferency in their Choice of Miniſters, or to encourage unconverted Men to come into the Miniſtry, or to be offended at the odious Characters the Scriptures give them, or to befriend them in their ſordid Oppoſition to Gods Work and Servants, is a ſinful Simplicity, and horrid Cruelty! And that the Examiner is Guilty of all theſe Things, either expreſly or virtually, will appear I truſt thy the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pages.</p>
            <p>The Sermon rightly underſtood, has no tendency to promote Confuſion and a ſeparating Spirit. If I had aſſerted, that a certain Knowledge of the States of others was attainable, or that unconverted Miniſters were never us'd as Means of doing Good, or that it was a Sin to hear them, or that it was lawful to go ſtatedly from the hearing of that Miniſter whom we are under a Relation to, at our Pleaſure, there would be ſome Umbrage or Reaſon for the Charge; but ſeeing I have ſaid neither of theſe, but on the contrary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the neceſſity of previous Application, &amp;c. the Charge is without any real Foundation.</p>
            <p>This Author farther adds, <q>that I my ſelf have been inſtrumental, of raiſing in many of their Places, Confuſion and a ſeparating Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a notorious Falſhood, <hi>Thouſands</hi> in <hi>N. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> can witneſs that I ſpake ſeldom of the Miniſtry at all; not one Word came out of my Lips, in Favour of ſeparating from them. But if this Author means by Confuſion and a ſeparating Spirit, a Scriptural and rational Diſtreſs of Soul for Sin, and a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from it in Affection and Practiſe, he in that Senſe ſpeaks the Truth, theſe Things I confeſs I was (thro' Grace) inſtrumental in raiſing, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Places.</p>
            <p>But to confirm his awful Charge he adds this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Argument viz. <q>For many are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Sermon, and practice upon it, have ſown the Seeds of all the Diſcord, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005297_0029_1016F57BD47601B0"/>
Confuſion, Separaion, Hatred, Variance, Emulation Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſys, &amp;c. that have been ſpringing up, in ſo many of the Towns and Churches thro' the Province for two Years paſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> A dreadful Inditement indeed if true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of eleven Particulars, and yet behold and wonder there's ſomething left behind unexpreſs'd, for there is an <hi>&amp; cetera</hi> at the Heels of it! But it is my Comfort that his Libel is falſe and ridiculous. Methinks if the <hi>Examiner</hi> has any remains of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience left, it muſt needs make him uneaſy and aſhamed, that he has utter'd eleven Falſhoods at a Breath; but pray Sir, why didn't you favour us with the whole Catalogue of Crimes, was you aware that you had already mentioned more than you could prove, if ſo it was diſcreet in you not to proceed farther, but to make an <hi>Et cetera</hi> ſupply the Place of Particulars. Terrible, and have I ſown the Seeds of Hereſy and Treaſon too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you. Alack and alas a-day? Why did n't you charge me with Murder and Blaſphemy alſo? For you had as much Reaſon for theſe as for the others, aye Treaſon! Is this your Charity? do you want the civil Sword to be drawn againſt me as a Rebel to the State for preaching Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſucceſsfully? wou'd you embrue your Hands in my Blood, that travel'd thro' the Winter Cold to do your Country Good? But pray Sir, where are the Proofs of the aforeſaid Charge? <hi>Why this,</hi> 
               <q>That many are fully perſwaded, that my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Practice upon it, have ſown the Seeds, &amp;c. as aforeſaid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And what if they be? It's either thro' the Force of their Prejudice, or by falſe Information. Many more in <hi>New-England,</hi> know the unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and falſhood of that Perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>The Charge of my practiſing upon the Sermon, ſuppoſes in my Apprehenſion, that that Sermon was generally known by the People of <hi>New-England,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005297_0030_1016F57E8BF89EF8"/>
either before or when I was among them, which is falſe; unleſs our Author takes preaching <hi>Original Sin, Faith, Repentance, Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST <hi>alone, the Conviction of Sin, the New Birth, and the neceſſity of a holy Life,</hi> to be ſowing the Seeds of Diſcord, I am not guilty. Multitudes know that theſe were the Doctrines which I principally preach'd upon in <hi>New-England.</hi> I may add likewiſe, that it is well known that there was no ſuch Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in <hi>N. England</hi> when I was in it, as have ſince happened. But ſuppoſing there had been, it would not have prov'd the Charge of Confuſion, much leſs of Hereſy, except I had ſpoken ſomething that had a Tendency thereto. Would not it be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to charge the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> with all the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults which ſometimes attended his Preaching of which it was not the Cauſe, but innocent Occaſion only. Would the <hi>Examiner</hi> Charge our Lord, with being the Author of Confuſion, becauſe he tells us that he came not to <hi>ſend Peace, but fire and Diviſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Author proceeds to repeat his Charge in the following invidious Terms, viz. <q>Who hath been ſo Inſtrumental to hatch the Cockatrice, as himſelf, tho' at the ſame Time he could grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adviſe others, to cruſh it in the Egg.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This would be very inconſiſtent if true, but in as much as it is Falſe, it muſt be laid at his own Door. I beſeech the <hi>Examiner</hi> to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly the following Lines, in the 14. <hi>pag.</hi> of that Sermon he ſo much Diſlikes. <q>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, for ye neither go in your ſelves, nor ſuffer thoſe that are entering to go in Phariſee</hi> Teachers will with the utmoſt Hate, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the very Work of Gods Spirit upon the Souls of Men, and Labour by all Means to blacken it as well as the Inſtruments, which the Almighty improves to promote the ſame, if it come near their Borders, and Interferes with their Credit or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; thus did the <hi>Phariſees</hi> with our Saviour.</q>—
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005297_0031_1016F5801AF9AB90"/>
May Almighty God incline our Author, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine impartially, if this be not his Caſe and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice?</p>
            <p>But the Examiner proceeds to ſay, <q>Whoever will take Pains to conſider the main Scope of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Sermon at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> will find the Principles of it, ſubverſive of Goſpel Order, the publick Miniſtry, and publick Means of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation; and what have we more? What could touch the Apple of our Eye, like this fatal Blow? It is a Blow at the Root!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Charge was true, that Sermon wou'd deſerve the moſt ſpeedy Condemnation. But where is the Proof? Why the <hi>Examiners</hi> Aſſertion, or <hi>ipſe dixit:</hi> But will this ſuffice the Impartial, no ſurely! What can't the Danger of an unconverted Miniſtry be repreſented, and private Seminaries of Learning be erected, eſpecially where there are no publick ones, without endangering the publick Miniſtry, and publick Means of Education? Strange! What Notion then muſt this Gentleman have of the Miniſtry? Does he think they are all unconverted? If ſo, he is very uncharitable indeed! I'm ſorry, it ſhould touch him ſo near as the Apple of his Eye, to have the Danger of an unconverted Miniſtry ſet forth as in my <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon; if he were not too nearly related to them, methinks it wouldn't touch him in ſo tender a Part, but on the contrary it would make him glad, to ſee their Picture ſo juſtly drawn, that ſo they might ſee their Faces in that Glaſs, and be convinc'd and aſhamed. If the Sermon be a Blow at the Root, as our Author obſerves, it is at the Root, of an ungodly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and is our Author ſorry, that that Root of Bitterneſs ſhould be ſtruck at? When I compos'd it, I expected it would be judged by that Tribe it detected, as guilty of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Bonds and of Death.</hi> I ſuppos'd, it would be like rouſing a Waſps Neſt, and I have found it according to my Expectation. The Oppoſers of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005297_0032_1016F582EE08FD08"/>
God's Work, have dip't their Tongues and Pens in Gall, and by their Malignant Invectives, have endeavour'd to bury its Author in Ruins; but peradventure it may have a Reſurrection to their Terror and Shame. What's the matter that theſe Men, can find nothing agreeable in that Sermon, that ſo exactly deſcribes <hi>the naked Truth,</hi> the very Character Caſe and Pranks of the ungodly Clergy? Suppoſing ſome Things in it were worded in too ſtrong Terms, what then, ſhou'd they condemn all for this, and want to commit it to the Flames? Indeed I think this Method of Proceeding, looks very ſuſpicious and Points out who they are?</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to produce the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of a Schiſmatical Party whom he calls the Synod, wherein they condemn my Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Notingham,</hi> as a notable Inſtance of our ſowing Seeds of Diviſion, <q>And we charge him <hi>ſay they,</hi> with perverting Scripture, uncharitable raſh judging the Body of the Clergy of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in the Lump, and encouraging Factions and Diſorders therein!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Perhaps this Gentleman thinks to grace and ſtrengthen his ſide of the Queſtion, by the Name of <hi>Synod.</hi> But I would have him to conſider, that <hi>adhuc ſub judice lis eſt.</hi> The Point is in diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Party he ſpeaks of, be the Synod of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> or not, I humbly conceive they will not be found ſo in the Iſſue, being but a minor Party to thoſe whom they condemn.</p>
            <p>As to the Charge of Perverting Scripture in that Sermon, I deny it, I have better Interpreters, than them on my Side, that juſtify the Senſe I have given of the Scriptures in that Sermon. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures produced anſwer the Deſign I bro't them for. Namely, to ſhew the Danger of an unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſtry. And that the Almighty does not approve of natural Mens taking upon them the Miniſtry in the ordinary Time of the Goſpel. It is they that have perverted my Meaning, and ſo in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005297_0033_1016F585CE4EC7E0"/>
thereof, would Charge upon me a pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>As to what they call, uncharitable judging of the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, I would ask them, what they think themſelves? Do they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that the greater Part of the Miniſters of this Generation, are pious? Let them ſpeak out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Head. Are not the greateſt part of the Clergy of this Generation Papiſts, and is it unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſay that ſuch are unconverted? And are not many of the Proteſtant Clergy very unſound in Principle, and unholy in Life? And is there not a great Number of others, who have a Form but hate the Power of Godlineſs? Have not many thoſe Marks of Impiety that are mention'd in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which they oppoſe?</p>
            <p>Truly I muſt confeſs, that the more I have had to do with them, and perceiv'd the Malignant Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome of them, againſt God's Work and Servants, the more my Opinion has been ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened reſpecting the greatneſs of the Number of graceleſs Miniſters. As to their Charge of ſowing Seeds of Diviſion.</p>
            <p>I would anſwer them in theſe Words of the <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> Sermon <hi>pag.</hi> 25 <q>the proper Cauſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diviſions, is that Enmity againſt God and Holineſs, which is in the Hearts of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men of every order, being ſtirr'd up by the Devil and their own proud and ſelfiſh Luſts; and very often natural Men, who are the proper Cauſes of the Diviſions aforeſaid, are wont to deal with God's Servants, as <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wife did by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they lay all the Blame of their own Wickedneſs at their Doors, and make a loud Cry. <hi>This is truly the preſent Caſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Fruit of our Authors ſtrong Prejudice, to repreſent me as holding in my <hi>Notingham</hi> &amp; <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermons, two Principles as oppoſite as the Heathen Principles, of a good and evil God, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear I truſt by the Sequel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:005297_0034_1016F589B5295C18"/>But to proceed, our Charitable <hi>Examiner,</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the Rev. Miniſters of <hi>Boſton,</hi> for ſpeaking honourably of my Perſon, and late Performance, reſpecting the <hi>Moravians,</hi> it ſeems, as if he grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any ſhou'd think or ſpeak well of me, where now is our Authors Charity, which he ſaid he put on in his firſt <hi>pag.</hi> dosn't it ſeem as if he had drop't the Cloak quite?</p>
            <p>What if theſe Rev. Gentlemen, had ſeen the <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> Sermon, as he ſuggeſts; its like they woudn't have ſo dreadful an Idea of it, as our Author (what their Opinion of the Sermon is I know not.) But on the Suppoſition, that one or more of them were of Opinion, that there were ſome unguarded or exceptionable Expreſſions in it, yet might they not conſiſtent with the Simplicity that is in CHRIST, forbear expreſſing this, when they were not call'd to it. They were not prefacing the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon, but others, which this Author himſelf does not object againſt; had they expreſs'd a Commendation of theſe, together with a Cenſure becauſe of ſuppos'd Exceptions in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, wou'd it not have tended to mar the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of what they recommended, ſhou'd not what a Perſon does well, be commended, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his ſuppos'd or real Defects?</p>
            <p>It muſt appear evident to every impartial Mind, that the Rev. Miniſters of Boſton, have acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Simplicity that is in CHRIST, by recommending a Performance which was ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and had ſome Tendency to prevent, the Spread of <hi>Moravianiſm</hi> in this Land; and by giving the Author of it that Honour, which they thought was juſt, in order to make the Performnace of more Service.</p>
            <p>But how to reconcile our Authors Conduct, in this Affair with the Simplicity that is in CHRIST, I profeſs I am at a Loſs? If he has any Love to the Truths of God, which are now ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd in this Land, why does he come out with ſuch Virulence againſt me when I am appearing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005297_0035_1016F58C6C964A98"/>
for them, and endeavouring as well as I can to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. Why is he utterly ſilent, about what I have ſaid in Defence of the main Truths of the Goſpel? Doesn't it ſeem as if ſome <hi>Moracian</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit</hi> had hir'd his Pen, to attempt by Hook and Crook to render me Ridiculous, that thus the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of my late Performance againſt them might be fruſtrate?</p>
            <p>This Author farther betrays the badneſs of his Cauſe, and Spirit, by deriding thoſe Rev. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who are above his Contempt, by inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that they believ'd, ſome Perſon to be infallible in theſe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If they think as Proteſtants generally do, that Infalibility may be miſtaken.</q>—But afterwards, in the ſame <hi>Page,</hi> he grows more warm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and ſays, <q>it ſeems that ſuch a Prime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Work, that has been going on in the American Provinces, for the two laſt Years muſt be judged infallible, and ſupported with the higheſt Encomiums of ſix moſt Rev. Miniſters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why has this Author charg'd ſuch a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Falſhood, upon theſe worthy Gentlemen, namely, that they have judged me infallible, for the which he has not the leaſt Foundation; can they not commend what they judge to be Praiſe Worthy in any, without ſuppoſing him to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible? To what Lengths will Men's Rage and Prejudice carry them?</p>
            <p>And How falſe and ungenerous is it in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to charge thoſe Gentlemen in the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> with having Men's Perſons in Admiration, becauſe of Advantage. With a Relation to me; his Words are theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <q>But it ſeems no Man dar'd, or car'd to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, why doſt thou ſuch Things, ſuch is the Danger of having Mens Perſons in Admiration becauſe of Advantage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, What Advantage could theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men propoſe by a poor Stranger, who was to be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005297_0036_1016F58F4E5B3F48"/>
among them but a few Weeks, and probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to ſee their Faces any more in this World? And who as our Author tells the Story, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. <q>Came with a great Troop of 20 or 30 Horſe, entring into other Men's Labours, and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Livings.</q>— <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, It was Love to Gods Work which this Man deſpiſes, that excited their Eſteem of an Inſtrument, whom it pleaſed the Sovereign God to improve, in promoting of it! But if no Mans daring or caring to ſay to me, <hi>why doſt thou ſuch Things?</hi> would prove the Charge of having Men in Admiration, becauſe of Advantage; as our Author inſinuates, then the preſent Oppoſers of Gods Work in <hi>N. England,</hi> wou'd be as guilty of it, as thoſe whom they now unjuſtly deſpiſe: For where is there one of them, that ſuggeſted to me the leaſt doubt of the Reality of it then? neither did I meet with the leaſt Oppoſition againſt the Doctrines of Grace, which I preach'd, except in one or two ſmall Towns. The Truth is, the Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Converſion of Sinners, was attended with ſuch Majeſty and Power, as aſtoniſhed and terrified thoſe ungodly Creatures, which were not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So that for a Time hardly any of them durſt move his Tongue, much leſs his Pen againſt it; but after a While the Influences of the Divine Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawn, and ſome Stumbling Blocks falling in the Way, obſtinate Tranſgreſſors grow profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bold in oppoſing God's Work, and in traducing and contemning his Servants.</p>
            <p>Obſerve Reader, how this Author diſcovers his Antipathy againſt the Work of God, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lines. <q>I heartily wiſh (ſays he) he was more worthy, for whom they have done this, and that they themſelves had not in this Labour of Love, to their dear and honoured Brother, betray'd too great a Liking, of what is commonly call'd this Work.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I joyn with this Author in the firſt part of his Petition, but have Reaſon to doubt from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005297_0037_1016F5920E9CC0D0"/>
Performance, that if it was anſwered, he wou'd like me leſs, if poſſible than he does! but as to the latter part of it, I muſt declare my diſſent, altho' I queſtion not his Sincerity therein. But on the contrary, I bleſs God who has excited thoſe worthy &amp; famous Miniſters, to appear as Witneſſes to his Truths and Work, in a day of Degeneracy, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and Rebuke; this is their Honour, and will be their unſpeakable Advantage in a future World; whatever the Ignorant or Prejudiced may ſay to the contrary. The World may ſee by this, what ſort of a Perſon this <hi>Examiner</hi> is, who attempts to wound my Character and Uſefullneſs, namely, that he is one, who diſlikes the late Revival of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this Land.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to obſerve, upon the PREFACE thus. <q>Theſe Rev. Gentlemen ſay, This our dear Brother viſited us at <hi>Boſton</hi> two Years ago; and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> entred into his Labours.</q> Upon which he ſays, <q>It's true Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> viſited theſe Parts about that Time, and the Viſit was full of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries, his progreſs thro' the Province, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd more of worldly Pomp and Grandeur, than the Humility of the meek and lowly JESUS, he came eating and dringink, gallopping over the Country with his <hi>Congregatio de propoganda &amp;c. mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na comitante caterva,</hi> with a Troop of twenty or thirty Horſe, entring into other Men's Labours and devouring their Livings, having all Things in common.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What Envy appears in this Repreſentation? It's true ſome Perſons did of their own meer Motion, without any Invitation of mine, accompany me in my Travels, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs in Number; and for what I could learn, with a Deſire to receive Benefit to their Souls by my Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and what wou'd our Author have me to do in ſuch a Caſe? Would he have me to drive them
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005297_0038_1016F594C81D9F18"/>
away? Why does he ſay that this ſavour'd more of worldly Pomp, than of the Humility of the meek and lowly JESUS? Didn't Multitudes follow Chriſt, to attend his itinerary Labours? And didn't he come eating and drinking? Wou'd our Author have me live without Victuals and Drink? Or wou'd he have me ſtarv'd to Death? But perhaps the Emphaſis of the Charge, conſiſts in <hi>gallopping</hi> over the Country. Really the Snow was ſo deep during a good Part of my Travels, that it was no proper Seaſon for gallopping. I don't remember for my Part, that I gallop't any, but if I had, I don't ſee the Harm of it. Methinks our Author's trifling in his Charges againſt me for the Want of proper Materials, turns to my Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and therefore his futile Reflections, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Deſign, are proper Panegyrick upon me, and a Satyre upon himſelf. O! but he ſays that I enter'd into other Men's Labours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its true I preach'd in other Miniſters Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, but not without their Conſent, and where was the Harm of this? But he adds devouring their Livings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's true, when I was invited by Miniſters or others, to ſtay in their Houſes for a Night or ſo in my Paſs, I generally comply'd, and partook of what they ſet before me, and ſo did any that were pleaſed to travel with me. I defy this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer</hi> to prove that I did either without Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and where was the Harm of complying as before? dosn't the <hi>Examiner</hi> remember the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>volenti nulla fit injuria, to a willing Perſon no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is done.</hi> What does he mean by <hi>devouring</hi> then? Does he intend that I, or any of my Companions in Travel, eat or drank to exceſs? If he does let him prove it if he can? But here I muſt beg leave to obſerve, with all due gratitude that much Kindneſs and Reſpect, was ſhewn me by many in <hi>N. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in hoſpitable generous Entertainments; and does our Author grudge &amp; grumble at this? If it were
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005297_0039_1016F59778654950"/>
not too rude and uncivil, I would remember him of a coveteous Perſon, that long ſince begrudged expenſive Reſpect ſhewn to our LORD. But it was not to his Honour.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> adds another Article of Charge, in this Paragraph, namely, having all Things in common.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As before he had reſembled me to the Papiſts in theſe Words, with his <hi>Congregatio de propaganda &amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe the word left out is <hi>Faith;</hi> ſo that his Meaning is, that I went gallopping about with my Companions, to propagate <hi>the Faith.</hi> What Faith? Does he inſinuate the Roman Catholick, as his Form of Expeſſion ſeems to point to? This is exceeding invidious, doesn't this Author know in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the Doctrines of Faith which I preach'd in <hi>New England,</hi> were no other than what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith, and the Doctrinal Articles of the Church of England? I ſay as before he reſembled me to the Papiſts, ſo here in the laſt Words of the Paragraph, to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, by ſaying we had all Things in common. I will ſay no more to this than that it is another no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Falſhood, either of this <hi>Examiners</hi> Invention or Publication.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiner</hi> farther obſerves, in the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, p. 8. <q>He came in the Spirit of Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> indeed, when Procalmation was made before him as Viſitor or Vicar-General, The Rev. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> deſigns to preach in ſuch a City or Church to-day, and to-morrow in another, and continue in a Third <hi>and get Gain,</hi> without the leaſt Regard to the ſtated Paſtors of the Churches, <hi>volens, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens;</hi> pleading Extraordinaries for ſuſpending Scripture Rules.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This is an unfair Repreſentation of the Caſe, I ſent no ſuch Word to any one Place in <hi>N. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that I would preach in their Churches or Towns, whether the Paſtors would or not. When I came to any Place, where there was a ſetled Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005297_0040_1016F59938B04888"/>
I never preach'd without firſt apprizing him of my Inclination, and if I was not prevented by his Invitation, asking his Leave, and this I every where obtain'd, before I preach'd in any Place, excepting one, where I came in the Evening, the Miniſter declined letting me preach in the Meeting Houſe that night, for Reaſons which I thought were not relevant, and being invited by ſome to preach that Night, in a private Houſe, I comply'd, at which the Miniſter of the Place was preſent, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe People as I was inform'd, had come to the Meeting Houſe, expecting Sermon, and I thought it was a pitty they ſhould be diſappointed, without ſufficient Cauſe, and here it ſhould be likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that the Miniſter did not forbid my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a private Houſe, but on the contrary ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified before ſeveral Perſons, that if I came on a Lecture Day, he would invite me to preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; but thought that ringing the Bell in the Night, might ſurprize the People, with an Alarm of Fire, and that the People not having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Warning there wou'dn't be a valuable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. But the ſame Gentleman invited me to preach in his Pulpit the next Day, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with much Kindneſs and Courteſie.</p>
            <p>As to what the <hi>Examiner</hi> ſays about <hi>getting Gain.</hi> It is exceeding invidious, I neither needed, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, nor deſir'd any Thing for my Labours in <hi>N. England,</hi> if our Author can prove any of theſe, let him do it as ſoon as he pleaſes, was there any Collection made for me, in any one Place in <hi>N. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> for near ſix Months that I travell'd in it, and preach'd daily? Nor was there any Thing given me, excepting in ſeven or eight Places in all <hi>N. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and that by ſome Gentlemen of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and was it a Fault in me to accept of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity? What I have now ſaid is with no Deſign of reflecting upon the Gentlmen of <hi>N. England,</hi> No, far be it from me, I hope ever to retain a grateful Senſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005297_0041_1016F59D80635998"/>
of their Kindneſs, but only to confute this ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cavil.</p>
            <p>The next Article of Charge is, that I plead <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries for ſuſpending Scripture Rules.</hi> This Phraſe the <hi>Examiner</hi> ſeems to have borrow'd from his dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by the Way, to which I anſwer, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether falſe! I had no need of uſing any ſuch Plea, for I don't know that any Scripture Rule was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by my preaching in <hi>New England,</hi> however I muſt ſtill aſſert that the Plea is in ſome Caſes law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whatever Contempt may be caſt upon it by ſome. To ſay that <hi>ordinary Rules, or Rules for ordinary Caſes</hi> ſhould not be ſuſpended in <hi>extraordinary</hi> Caſes, is a bare fac'd contradicting of an antient Maxim conſented to by the common Senſe of Mankind, viz. <hi>That every general Rule admits of Exceptions,</hi> unleſs it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Caſes are the ſame; which from the nature of Things is impoſſible, the Meaſures in every thing cannot be proper in both, and to ſay the contrary is in other Words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the lawfullneſs of the Reformation from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the Time of <hi>Swinglius, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> and if we mayn't judge for our ſelves when theſe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Caſes happen, we are Slaves indeed of the moſt ſordid kind, and rob'd of every Thing that's worth keeping of a Religious Nature. Hereby a Church Tyrany is erected, and the hateful Romiſh Doctrines of implicite Faith and blind Obedince, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. God forbid that we ſhould caſt away the Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free, and ſuffer Men to lord it over our Conſciences, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave us with their plauſible Pretext of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Order! Order, Order</hi> was the Cry of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Beginning of the Reformation from Popery, with a View to ſtop its Progreſs. The Text they trump'd up upon every Occaſion, as Doctor <hi>Voetius</hi> obſerves was <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.3. <hi>All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do, omnia, omnia, all, all,</hi> they muſt obſerve, all the holy Traditions of the Roman Catholick Church, all the holy Cannons
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005297_0042_1016F5A06D8C1090"/>
and Orders, or be curs'd with Bell, Book and Candle Light as diſorderly and contemptuous Perſons, Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and what not? But the bleſſed Reformers better underſtood the Scriptures and their Duty from them, than to mind their ſelfiſh impertinet Cant, or to be ſcar'd from it by their invidious and groundleſs Anathemas. And has not the Epiſcopal Church excommunicated all that diſſent from her, by her Cannons. Now all that make them, (I mean the Cannons) will ſay that they are agreeable to the Scriptures. And ſo Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean Time it muſt be obſerv'd, that we ſhould with equal Care avoid both Extreams, viz. TYRANNY upon the one hand, and the abuſe of CHRISTIAN LIBERTY upon the other, TRUTH and DUTY lye between both, as we ſhould abhor with a perfect Hatred the enſlaving Schemes of <hi>High Church Bigots,</hi> ſo on the contrary, we ſhould equally abhor and avoid, the <hi>Plea of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries,</hi> except the Caſe be evidently ſo.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to ſay in the next Paragraph, <hi>pag.</hi> 8 <q>He came in the Spirit of Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> when he treated the Body of the Miniſtry in this Province, with ſo much Neglect and contempt as he did, not only in not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to hear any of them, no not in <hi>Boſton</hi> itſelf, except once or twice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Charge is likewiſe a notorious Falſhood! I never treated the Body of the Clergy in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New England,</hi> with Neglect and Contempt. I have a Witneſs in Heaven and in my own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom that my not hearing mnay of the Miniſters of <hi>New England,</hi> did not proceed from any Contempt of them. The Caſe was plainly this, I was ſtirr'd up at that Time by the Almighty to uncommon Zeal and Love for the Salvation of Mankind, ſo that unuſual Labours became natural to me, daily preaching was pleaſant and deſirable like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of my ſtated Meals. I was therefore loath to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005297_0043_1016F5A375ABA790"/>
Opportunities of preaching, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my full Perſwaſion, that God was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with me, and ſealed my Labours. The worthy and Rev. Miniſters of <hi>Boſton,</hi> perceiving that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing attended my Miniſtrations, did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and lovingly invite me to preach frequently in that Metropolis, being willing and glad that Gods Work ſhou'd be carry'd on, by any one the Lord wou'd pleaſe to ſend by; their condeſcending In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations I accepted with an affecting Senſe of my own Unfitneſs and Unworthineſs, as the Searcher of all Hearts knows, as well as Admiration at the Humility, the Candor and Coureſie of theſe Rev. Gentlemen, which I hope I ſhall ever bear thankful Remembrance of.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to ſay, <q>but alſo in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly cenſuring them (meaning the Miniſters of the Province) in general, and raiſing Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the Minds of People of their faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, even to that Degree as hath ended in a Spirit of dreadful Separation in many Places.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is likewiſe a notorious Falſhood. I did not cenſure the Miniſtry of their Provinces in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or raiſe Jealouſies in the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their faithful Miniſters. I ſpake but little of the Miniſters at all in <hi>New England,</hi> but never in the Manner our Author mentions, the Almighty knows that it was far from the Thot's of my Heart, and far from the Speeches of my Lips, to raiſe Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the Minds of People about their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters. O unmerciful Man! Who thus by repeated Falſhoods and Miſrepreſentations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſtab my Character and Labours in the Dark. And, thro' me, the Work and Servants of the great God. What is your Name, I know not, but the God of Truth and Righteouſneſs knows you, and remember he will bring you to Judgment, your falſe Gloſſes will be then remov'd. May God of his Mercy forgive your Wickedneſs, and have Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on your poor Soul for his Names ſake. The
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005297_0044_1016F5A5528F05B8"/>
Deſire of my Heart, and the Tendency of my Labours in <hi>New England</hi> was only to bring poor Sinners to CHRIST, and to build up Saints in him. I profeſs to the World, that my Eſteem of the Miniſtry of <hi>N. England,</hi> was much encreas'd by acquaintance with them. I am fully perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there is a conſiderable Body of worthy and faithful Labourers, in that Part of the Lords Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
            <p>As to what our Author ſays, of the longneſs of my Journey to <hi>N. England;</hi> for brevity's ſake I ſhall refer to the Letter I printed in <hi>New England,</hi> reſpecting the Occaſion of my travelling that Way. And only add, that I had no Intention to affront any Body by my Travels, I had no ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Journey as our Author repreſents, otherwiſe I would not have undertaken it, neither was it in my Heart to imagine that there was no Body like minded, <hi>or capable to water where the Rev Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>had planted,</hi> as our <hi>Examiner</hi> obſerves. Pray why mayn't one Miniſter preach in another's Place, by his Conſent, without a barefac'd affront to him? And isn't the Caſe the ſame as to many Places? To think otherwiſe as I humbly conceive, is contrary to common Senſe, and denotes an odd Turn of Mind?</p>
            <p>But let us attend to our Author, in his 9 <hi>pag.</hi> He goes on thus <q>but then are theſe Rev. Meſſ. of the ſame Mind, Spirit and Judgment, did they come in the ſame Spirit, when Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> in his Journal, <hi>part</hi> 3d <hi>pag.</hi> 63. ſayeth, <hi>Theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Convulſions, I believe come from the Devil; who, now the Work of GOD is going on, wants to bring an evil Report upon it?</hi> And ſeeing that nothing is more evident, than that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> is the grand Inſtrument of promoting thoſe animal Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into which many of our new Converts have fallen, and upon which ſo great a Streſs is laid by many in the Work of Converſion.</q>

               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:005297_0045_1016F5A705AA7080"/>
               <hi>Anſ</hi> The Heat of our Authors Prejudice, has confus'd him much in this Paragraph, he Shifts about this Way and that Way, in order to caſt his Squibs at Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> the <hi>Boſton</hi> Miniſters, and my ſelf. And firſt he gravely, but impertinently, asks the Miniſters of <hi>Boſton, whether they are of the ſame Mind, Spirit and Judgment with Mr.</hi> Whitefield? How childiſh is this, theſe Rev. Gentlemen ſo far as I know, have never ſo much as inſinuated, that they or I were of his <hi>Judgment,</hi> in every circumſtantial or minute Point; but both of us may be juſtly ſaid to be of, or in the ſame Spirit, when we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him in the fundamental Doctrines of Religion, and are diſpos'd to promote and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the ſame vital Godlineſs with him. And this I believe was their Meaning, in theſe Words of their Preface which our <hi>Examiner</hi> criticiſes ſo much upon. But his ſarcaſtical enquiring of the <hi>Boſton</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>whether they came in the ſame Spirit?</hi> When Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> as has been related, conſider'd in Connection with that Paſſage in the Preface, which he grumbles at, cannot well be reconcil'd to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe to which he appeals in his Title Page: For the Rev. Miniſters, whom our ill natur'd Author fleers at, were in <hi>Boſton</hi> at that Time he refers to. This was the Place of their fix'd Reſidence. See the Force of Prejudice, it will ſometimes drive Men of Wit and Addreſs, into Impertinence and Nonſenſe, as well as Falſhood; in order to gratify its Rancour. 'Tis like our Author is a Man of Senſe, <hi>Sed aliquando bonus dormitat</hi> Homerus, <hi>Sometimes</hi> Homer <hi>ſleeps.</hi> His unhappy Prejudice is ſo ſtrong, that it ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to diſturb his Judgment, ſo that he talks od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like a Man juſt wak'd out of Sleep, who had been dreaming of ſome dreadful Events: Witneſs the frightful Catalogue of Crimes, which he put in his Indictment againſt me, before mentioned, namely, <hi>Diſcord, Intruſion, Confuſion, Separation, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> &amp;c. ſee pag 5. And here he is fond to bring
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005297_0046_1016F5AC11E2E738"/>
in abruptly, a Paſſage of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> about <hi>bodily Convulſions,</hi> which was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently guarded, that he might offer ſome matter of Reflection and Triumph. However if the Affair be examined, there will be found little Reaſon for either. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has not ſaid that he believes, <hi>that all theſe bodily Convulſions came from the Devil,</hi> and if he had, neither the Rev. Miniſters of <hi>Boſton</hi> (ſo far as I know) or my ſelf, have ever been of that Opinion Theſe Things may be other ways accounted for, conſiſtent with the animal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. What if that dear Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had been miſtaken in a circumſtantial Point? Shall his Spirit, his State and Temper of Mind, be condemned for this? Or the State and Temper of others, becauſe they agree not with him herein? Is this our Author's Charity, which he talks ſo much of?</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to ſay, <q>And ſeeing nothing is more evident, than that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> is the grand Inſtrument of promoting thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Convulſions, into which many of our new Converts have fallen, and upon which ſo great a Streſs is laid, by many in the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Nothing is more evident, than that this is a notorious Falſhood, <hi>viz. That I am the grand Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of promoting thoſe animal Convulſions.</hi> This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny is invented by the Father of Lies, <hi>the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Brethren,</hi> in order to caſt odious Colours, upon the Work of God, and me his Servant. All my Congregation, and Multitudes more, can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I never encouraged thoſe Things, but on the contrary, that I have from the firſt Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ſuch Appearances, in this Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (which was long ſince) endeavour'd in the openeſt Manner to diſcourage and check them, yea ſometimes to ſuch Degree, as has griev'd ſeveral religious People. I have repeatedly done this before many thouſands of Hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:005297_0047_1016F5AD96FC1FF0"/>But our Author farther adds, <q>That great Streſs is laid upon <hi>theſe animal Convulſions,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Work of Converſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What does the <hi>Examiner</hi> mean by that Phraſe <hi>in the Work of Converſion?</hi> Does he think that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction ſtrictly conſidered is gradual, then he is an <hi>Arminian;</hi> and its no wonder he diſlikes my Diſcourſes againſt the <hi>Moravians,</hi> and indeed this is the moſt natural and eaſie Senſe of his Words. Or does he ſpeak of Converſion in a larger Senſe as including the preparative of Order <hi>viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, as well as the Fruits thereof, and mean thus, that ſome depend upon thoſe <hi>bodily Convulſions</hi> as a Sign of Converſion. In the firſt Senſe his Charge cannot be true, becauſe Converſion in that reſpect is inſtantaneous; and tho' the latter may be true, yet I have great Reaſon to believe it to be falſe: The Notion is abſurd and ridiculous, contrary to common Senſe, and therefore improbable to be true. Beſides I never met with one Man in any Part of America, that was of that Opinion; or that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me that he or they knew any one to hold it. But if our Author only means by the aforeſaid Phraſe, that many imagin'd thoſe outward <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,</hi> or the exceſs of Paſſion that occaſion'd them, were in any reſpect Helps to Converſion, I will not undertake to be the Patron of ſuch: For I think it is an unreaſonable and ridiculous Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Poſſibly ſome few ignorant Perſons, have been of this Opinion, but if ſo what then? Shall their Folly be imputed to the whole Body? Or is it reaſonable to reflect upon the whole Work, becauſe of the Weakneſs of ſome of the Subjects of it? Some of the Oppoſers in diverſe Parts of the World, have of late inſiſted much upon this Topick, theſe <hi>bodily Convulſions</hi> being ſomewhat uncommon, and ſurpriſing, they have harp'd much upon this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible String; in order (as it ſeems) to amuſe and prejudice the People againſt the Work of God!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:005297_0048_1016F5B053F6B7C0"/>While the Woman the Church has been in Travail among us, the Dragon has ſpeu'd out Floods, Multitudes of Slanders and Calumnies, in order to deſtroy the Woman and her Child. This is truly the Caſe, notwithſtanding of all the artful Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and deceitful Blinds that are put upon it by crafty Men.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to ſay, <q>Do they not take the Devils Part, who uſe Methods to farther ſuch ſad Appearances, and condemn them for oppoſers of Gods Work, who labour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive People about theſe Fits, by aſcribing them to an inferior Cauſe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If any do uſe unſcriptural Methods, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Appearances I think it is blame worthy, and have always been of this Mind; but I know of none who condemn Perſons, as Oppoſers of God's Work, meerly for their <hi>labouring to undeceive People about the aforeſaid Fits, &amp;c.</hi> Our Author with much Art and Sophiſtry, miſrepreſents the true State of the Caſe, both ways, firſt by inſinuating that there are many Perſons, who take Pains to promote <hi>animal Convulſions,</hi> as their principal Aim; this I cannot think is true. Any that have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged ſuch Appearances, have had chiefly in their View the increaſing and fixing that Soul Concern, which preceeds Converſion in the Adult: And is ſometimes accompany'd with ſuch Appearances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a greater degree of Diſtreſs which ſome endure in their Minds, which from the nearneſs of the Union between Soul and Body, muſt needs have greater Influence upon it. If a ſudden View of ſome great temporal Imergent does ſometimes Occaſion the greateſt bodily Diſorders Why then ſhou'd it be tho't ſtrange, if Things of infinitely greater Weight and Moment when view'd in equal Points of Light, do produce equal Effects?</p>
            <p>And on the other Hand, he wou'd inſinuate, as if the chief Cauſe why many are condemned, as Oppoſers of the Work of God, is becauſe they
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005297_0049_1016F5B456452C00"/>
only endeavour, to give Perſons a juſt Notion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe bodily Commotions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Caſe is not ſo, we are glad that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have juſt Notions about ſuch Appearances, we know the Work of God is very diſtinct from them. But we charge this <hi>Examiner,</hi> and others of his Stamp, with oppoſing of God's Work, becauſe they ſpeak diminutively of it altogether, and uſe the aforeſaid bodily Commotions artfully, as an Engine to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the whole Work. This Charge ſticks ſo faſt to the <hi>Examiner</hi> and others of his Brethren; that tho' <hi>they waſh them with Nitre and take much Sope, yet their Iniquity is mark'd before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we are prepared, to liſten to what the <hi>Examiner</hi> offers in his next Paragraph, which is as follows. <q>But is it not Matter of Fact, when many of the Hearers of ſome Preachers fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Convulſion-like Fits, and roar'd, that the uſual Note of ſuch Preachers then was, <hi>will any of you come to Chriſt?</hi> When at the ſame Time they pronounc'd heavy Curſes upon ſuch, as took not ſuch fits, as being hard hearted Phariſees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to the firſt Part of the Charge, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of eminence in Religion do think the Method therein arraign'd is juſtifiable, but for my own Part, I cannot ſee the expediency of it.</p>
            <p>As to the latter Part of it, it is ambiguous, <q>It is ſaid they pronounc'd heavy Curſes upon ſuch, as took not ſuch Fits, as being hard hearted Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Objector means all ſuch, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a falſe Charge: For it has never been ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo far as I can learn, even by oppoſers, that any who favour'd God's Work believ'd, that the Regenerate muſt undergo ſuch bodily Commotion; and can it be tho't that any but mad Men wou'd pronounce Curſes upon the Regenerate! But madneſs has not yet, that I remember been charged upon the late awakening Preachers, (this way) If the

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Admirable! That a Man of ſo much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as our Author pretends to, could not find a more favourable Gloſs upon that Paſſage, of the Rev. Miniſters of <hi>Boſton,</hi> will not the Words bear this eaſy Senſe, namely, <q>that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> was us'd by the Almighty, as a Mean of reviving Religion remarkably in <hi>New-England,</hi> and that it pleas'd the Sovereign God, to uſe me alſo in carrying on the ſame begun Work?</q> Is it not contrary to common Senſe, to which our Author appeals in his Title Page, to imagine that the worthy Gentlemen mean't otherwiſe? It is very croſs grain'd in the <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> to caſt ſo much Dirt at the Miniſters of <hi>Boſton,</hi> who are above his Diſdain (and will be eſteem'd by the Devout and Judicious whether he will or not) and that meerly becauſe they have a favourable Opinion, of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and my ſelf, and that bleſſed Work of God, which we thro' pure Grace have been inſtrumental to promote. But me thinks the <hi>Examiner</hi> had better be good Humour'd, for tho'
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005297_0051_1016F5B9EB5D9BB8"/>
he ſhou'd fret himſelf never ſo much while there is Piety in <hi>New-England,</hi> there will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome, among both the Clergy and Laity, who will think and ſpeak honourably of that Work, which he deſpiſes!</p>
            <p>But I haſten to conſider our Authors next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, and this he has tho't proper to borrow, from the Lucubrations of the malignant Oppoſers of Religion this Way. The Words are theſe, <q>but pray, will Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> tell the World, what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> or himſelf, but where they had Opportunity, to enter into other Men's Labours, and who planted and watered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations for them, to crow of their Succeſſion: For in <hi>Maryland, Virginia</hi> and <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> where Miniſters are comparatively ſcarce, what News Mr. of <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s great Succeſs?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doubtleſs our Author approv'd of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, otherwiſe he would not have borrow'd it. Here let the Reader obſerve in theſe Words, a Teſtimony to the great Succeſs of Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and my ſelf, extorted from the Pens of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that even at a Time, when they were endeavouring to run us both down, and the bleſſed Work of <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> which we have been endeavouring to promote. This puts me in mind of an old Proverb, viz. <hi>magna eſt veritas &amp; preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebit,</hi> i. e. <hi>great is the Truth and will prevail.</hi> But in the mean Time ſet the Reader obſerve, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid conſtrained Teſtimony, is contrary to what theſe Men have ſaid in other Parts of their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one Example of which, I ſhall only mention at preſent for brevity's ſake, expreſs'd in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of my Remarks <hi>pag.</hi> 107. 8. 9. thus <q>We ſhall not be ſo raſh as to pretend to judge Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the Time, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether there be Truth in the Account as to ſome Inſtances: For that is no Part of our Debate; for we know but our Part of what is manifeſt. Secrets we leave to God, nor ſhall we pretend to determine, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005297_0052_1016F5BD14616458"/>
there be ſuch a <hi>Eutopia</hi> as Mr <hi>Tennent</hi> here deſcribes, ſomewhere in diſtant Parts; for we live at Home: But yet if Men will allow us the Rights of private Judgment, we think it is but juſt we ſhould be allow'd to ſuſpend our Belief in the Point, till we hear ſome valid Proofs, or elſe are invited to come and ſee: For a Partyman's <hi>Say ſo</hi> in one Ear, when Experience contradicts it loudly in both, is too feeble to beget Faith. For tho' we ſhould grant that in Times of yore, when Men were all that is good and deſireable, ſubject to no Miſtakes, and ſpoke no Falſhoods in their own or their Friends Behalf, if ever there was ſuch a Time; Men's, own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Declarations for themſelves, might paſs for valid Proofs of their inward Graces; and it might be counted a daring Piece of Preſuming Boldneſs, to oppoſe an Argument which depended upon ſuch ſtable Maxims, which like the <hi>koinai enoiai,</hi> are never to be denied, ſuch as are, <hi>ask his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whether he be a Thief,</hi> &amp;c. But ſince <hi>Pando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s Box is opened, our Saviour has broke down this Claim, by ſaying, <hi>If I bear witneſs of my Self, my Witneſs is not true.</hi> And when Experience tells us, that in this Iron Age, a fluent Orator with his orient Colours, will inſtantly fill the Wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of the moſt furrow'd Face, and again deform the moſt beautiful Complexion, juſt as Mr <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> pleaſes, or as <hi>good Will</hi> or <hi>ill Will</hi> prompts him. Seeing therefore we have not a large Stock enough of Time and Candles to run thro' the Woods to find out Mr. <hi>Tennent's Eutopia:</hi> For it is the Cry of many, and that in many different Places, that ſolid Religion ſeems to looſe Ground faſter, &amp; Vice and Debauchery ſeem to gain more Ground in one Year, ſince this new Commotion, than they gain before in Ten; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who appear debauch'd there are more than a few of thoſe who were lately famous for their being Cryers, and Fallers, and Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005297_0053_1016F5BEB0DE9AD8"/>
to Convictions, &amp;c. We hope therefore, that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> will in his next tell us, where to find this fine Reformation, otherwiſe we deſpair of coming at it. For when we ask ſome of Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s Party where it is? We are told, it is in <hi>New England;</hi> and probably when enquir'd of in <hi>New England</hi> it is here; and we are much miſtaken, if Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s <hi>Eliſian Fields</hi> be not a meer <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeek,</hi> if not a <hi>Babel,</hi> in the Eſteem of many as judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as ever he was, or is like to be. And we appeal to Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> and his Party, whether they have not been much diſappointed in many Inſtances that have made as great Boaſtings and as glaring Shows as any of the reſt for a Time? And can Men rationally expect, while they judge of Men's gracious States by their own Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and vain Boaſtings, but that their Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will multiply in Proportion with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in number.</q>

            <p>It is not my Buſineſs, at preſent, to expoſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Abſurdities of this Paragraph, only the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may plainly ſee, that it is full to the Purpoſe that I brought it for. Yet I confeſs it is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with it ſelf, for while theſe Men pretend, that they will not be ſo raſh as to pretend to <hi>judge Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time,</hi> i. e. whether there be Truth in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as to ſome Inſtances, while they pretend to ſuſpend their Belief in the Point, in the mean Time, they call the late glorious revival of God's Work in the Land, of which I had given ſome Account, in my Remarks upon their Proteſt, (to which they refer) my <hi>Eutopia,</hi> (or Fiction) they prend to be at a Loſs where to find it, they ſay that Iniquity has gain'd more Ground in one Year, ſince this new Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than in ten before and that ſolid Religion looſes Ground faſter. They call it my <hi>Elyſian-Fields,</hi> (or vain Fancy and Notion) and reckon it to be a <hi>Meſech</hi> if not a <hi>Babel.</hi> May God have Mercy upon thoſe unhappy Men, that thus riſe up in Arms againſt God himſelf, by ſlandering the Work of his Holy Spirit.</p>

               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:005297_0054_1016F5C292EA7BC8"/>And this Author that I am now more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering, does hereby contradict himſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what he adopts as aforeſaid, with what he ſays <hi>pag.</hi> 30. <q>Strip this Work of its <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> and you will diſcern what is the Work of God, from that which is added to it, by Art and Man's Device, pray what is <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> on one Side more than 'tother? But what is juſtly to be exploded, viz. <hi>Extraordinary Errors, Diſorders, Intruſions, raſh Cenſures, clamorous Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vain glorious Boaſtings, Fits, pretence of Sights, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Roarings, Tremblings, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words are likewiſe borrow'd probably from the ſame dear Friends, —If our Author had been pleas'd to favour me with his proper Name, and Sir Name, I might have ſet them in a real Oppoſition to each other, in different Collumns, for his own Conviction and the Readers Edification; but not knowing his Name, I cannot gratify him in that particular for the preſent; and perhaps our cautious Author was afraid of this, and ſo prevented me, (by concealing his Name) of the Opportunity and Pleaſure of obliging him as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s little Succeſs, in the Places before mentioned, it may be obſerv'd, that next to the Pleaſure of a Sovereign God, who blows by his Spirit where it liſteth; the Occaſion thereof, was his ſhort Stay in thoſe Places; but in St. <hi>George</hi>'s near to <hi>Maryland,</hi> which was, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd a very Ignorant Place, where he made a longer Stop, his Labours were crown'd with remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Succeſs.</p>
            <p>But God forbid, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> or my ſelf, ſhould rob the Miniſters of the Churches, of their juſt Honours. No doubt, a number of them, has been us'd as Inſtruments of converting Sinners to God, and building up Saints and others in Faith and Holineſs, as well as of preparing Men for Converſion, by inſtructing them in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine Truths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:005297_0055_1016F5C4635D5070"/>But to proceed, our Authors finiſhing Stroke, in Relation to the <hi>Boſton</hi> Miniſters (<hi>pag.</hi> 9. 10) is as follows <q>We beſeech our aſcended Saviour, the Head of the Church in particular, to uſe this faithful, judicious, and ſeaſonable Endeavour of his Servant, for a Guard and Defence about his ſacred Truths, and his glorious Work in the Midſt of us; which too many are ready to ſpeak evil of, and oppoſe.</q> Upon which the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer</hi> obſerves as follows, viz. <q>I would charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope, that that theſe Rev. Divines don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by the laſt Paragraph, to patronize all the <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> that they have paſs'd current for the Work of God, in this Time of Strife of Tongues, and Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> or oppoſe all with the black Character of Oppoſers to his Work, who are Enemys to Enthuſiaſm and Deluſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here's a little Charity, exerciſed by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer</hi> towards the Rev. Miniſters of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but a little; for obſerve, how he ſpeaks, <hi>I would charitably hope,</hi> &amp;c. Aye poor Man! He ſeems to be put hard to it about them, to clear them, of what he calls <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Deluſion.</hi> He exerciſes a little Charity towards them, and indeed but a little, he would willingly hope, but ſcarce can; his Charity is bro't juſt to the laſt Gaſp as it were. But pray don't theſe Rev. Gentlemen, underſtand what is <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Deluſion</hi> as well as he? What <hi>magnus Appollo</hi> is this Gentleman in his own Eyes? Here you may ſee, the extent of his Charity and Humility. The aforeſaid Miniſters have ſhewn, what they take to be the Work of God, and what they mean to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize; in their Preface to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Jonathan Dickenſon</hi>'s excellent DIALOGUES; lately printed at <hi>Boſton;</hi> which are a rational and nervous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, of the late revival of Religion in this Land. Theſe Rev. Gentlemen ſhew in the aforeſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, that they are againſt all real <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Diſorders, but for that ſcriptural and rational Conviction of Sin, and Converſion from it, to God in Heart and Life,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005297_0056_1016F5C71FFCEF30"/>
and Communion with God; which is falſely branded with the odious Name of</hi> Enthuſiaſm, <hi>by the ignorant profane, and ſome dead dry Formaliſts.</hi> From this it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows who they judge to be Oppoſers of it.</p>
            <p>But this Author proceeds to ſay, <q>there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wild <hi>Diſorders</hi> and <hi>Confuſions</hi> in ſome of our Churches, at this Day; which really reſemble the <hi>Corrinthian Diſorders,</hi> in the Times of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is likely to be true, and the Caſe is much to be lamented! but are not the proper Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof, the Enmity, and Policy of <hi>Satan,</hi> and evil Men in oppoſing the Power of Religion? <hi>This, this,</hi> is the real Cauſe! And the Ignorance, Blunders, and real Imprudencies of ſome Friends to Religion, have doubtleſs contibuted hereto; which is for a Lamentation! Now in order to a Cure, the Cauſe ſhould be removed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiner</hi> farther adds, <q>Neceſſity is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid upon the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt; to bear publick and ſeaſonable Teſtimony againſt them; and pity thoſe Rev. Gentlemen, let ſlip ſo good an Opportunity, as this to do it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt it is a Duty, to bear publick Teſtimony againſt <hi>Diſorders</hi> and <hi>Confuſions;</hi> and that of oppoſing God's Work, among the firſt of them: For that is the <hi>proton pſeudos,</hi> the firſt fatal Source of the other Abominations; and this, theſe Rev. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have done, as well as given their explicite Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, to the labouring Truths of God, in this Day of Degeneracy and Error. But has our Author, when he had ſo good an Opportunity? No not a Word of that; but he is griev'd, that they have not reproved me, in their Preface, for <hi>Diſorders, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, &amp;c.</hi> "Pity it is ſays he." Poor Man! He ſeems to much diſtreſs'd on my Account, that I ſhould eſcape Cenſure: Aye, well, has not he out of the Abundance of his (pretended) Faithfullneſs, made up their (ſuppos'd) Deficiencies, in that Point?</p>

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:005297_0057_1016F5CB024F2BD8"/>But, before I proceed to any other Matter, I muſt here beg, of the Rev. and honoured Miniſters, who wrote that <hi>Preface;</hi> which this anonimous Author, has drawn his Structures upon; <hi>as he calls them;</hi> that they wou'd pleaſe to pardon my Boldneſs, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any Thing in their Defence, who are bleſt with much ſuperior Capacities, to baffle the Cavils of Opponents; but in as much as the <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Reflections, are intermix'd with many Charges, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Conduct in <hi>New England;</hi> which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I may be ſuppos'd to have a more perfect Knowledge of, than others.

Of which is, that they have Holes, Mr. <hi>Helenbrook</hi> adds, <hi>Foxes</hi> that they may the better conceal themſelves, ſubſiſt not ſo much above Ground, as in Holes and Caverns, under the Earth. —Hereticks and Seducers always endeavour to hide their Doctrines, and Opinions, and keep them as ſecret as they can, certain it is, that they don't preſently and openly appear to the World, but know how to hide themſelves, under ſly Shifts.</q> Thus far he.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to the World, whether I have not acted a very contrary Part? I have appear'd open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Stage of the World, and declar'd the Truths of Chriſt freely and plainly, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing. I have fairly and above board, ventur'd my Name and Character, in the Defence thereof, and of vital Religion; who can with any juſtice ſay, that I have endeavour'd, to conceal my Opinions or Name? But as for our <hi>Examiner,</hi> does he not Sculk in a Hole, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern as it were; and ſcrene his Name behind the Curtain; while he is labouring to deſtroy mine? and is he not very backward, as to the Diſcovery of his Doctrines? It may be likewiſe here obſerv'd, that the Oppoſers of Religion, while the bright Day of the Power of Divine Grace ſhin'd forth in the late rivival of Piet, they like other noxious Animals of the Night, cautiouſly and craftily kept their Holes, for Fear of the Worſt, ſo that hardly any of them dars't appear to oppoſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Day; but ſo ſoon as a Night of ſpiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion came on, in reſpect of God's withdrawing the Influences of his Spirit,; as well as of the Falls of ſome Profeſſors; into erronious Opinions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005297_0061_1016F5D63A1D51C0"/>
Conduct, or bad Practices. I ſay, ſo ſoon as the Darkneſs came on, what Crouds of <hi>Foxes</hi> came out of their Holes, and fill'd the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air with their bold Barkings, as if it would be always Night? But ſtay, may be a gracious God may cauſe the Sun to break out with his ſalutary Rays, and frighten the <hi>Foxes</hi> to their Holes again; which may God grant for Chriſt's ſake Amen, let all Chriſt's Sheep and Lambs, ſay Amen.</p>
            <p>Another Character of <hi>Foxes,</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Examiner</hi> is, that they have many Ways and Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to come out at, &amp;c. It depends upon our Author to prove, wherein I have us'd Reſerves, Backdoors, and Equivocations; which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious he will never be able to do, and therefore is a falſe Accuſer: The harmonious Syſtem of Truths, which I have, and do ſtill believe, has laid me under no Temptation, to uſe ſuch mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices.</p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>Examiner,</hi> I will not undertake to clear him of theſe Things, ſeeing he favours a Party of Men, that are famous for them, and does what has a direct Tendency, to obſtruct the Uſefulneſs of a Book fram'd to hinder their corrupt Influence. It is an old Saying that <hi>(Simile ſimili gaudet) like rejoyces in like.</hi> Do not Birds of a Feather-flock together?</p>
            <p>The next Character of <hi>Foxes,</hi> is Craft and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which our Author gives no proof of as to me, and which I am ſure he cannot, and is therefore a falſe Accuſer. I may with juſtice apply to my Manner of Proceeding, what the Apſtole <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 6. <hi>For our Exhortation was not of Deceit, nor in Guile, even ſo we ſpeak not as pleaſing Men, but GOD, which tryeth our Hearts: For neither at any Time, uſed we flattering Words, as ye know, nor a Cloak of Coveteouſneſs, God is Witneſs, not of Men ſought we Glory.</hi> My <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon, which the <hi>Examiner</hi> is ſo much diſpleas'd with, is a Proof of this. If I had been a deceitful Flatterer, or Men pleaſer,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005297_0062_1016F5D8ED1E1C20"/>
I wou'd not have uſed ſuch Plaineſs and Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in that Sermon, as I knew according to the common Courſe of Things, would expoſe me to much ill will, and Reproach from the ungodly. But I ſhall leave it to the Reader to judge, whether this <hi>Examiner</hi> has not us'd, much <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> in the falſe Charges I have already ſpoke to, as well as in repreſenting the State of the Caſe, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Friends and Oppoſers of the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of Religion, while he endeavour'd to tear down the Life of it with all his Might, <q>and has not this a Tendency to cheat and decoy leſs harmleſs Creatures, and make a Prey of them? As Mr. <hi>Helenbrook</hi> obſerves, concerning the <hi>Foxes, pag.</hi> 9.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next particular our Author mentions, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. is this, <q>
                  <hi>Foxes,</hi> that they may not be ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſnared, ſeldom run right forward, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I bleſs God, that I have the Teſtimony of my Conſcience, that in Simplicity, and Godly Sincerity; I have had my Converſation in the World. I truſt it will appear, by my Anſwers to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Objections; that this Charge is without Foundation. But I believe it will be hard, if prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, to clear our Author of this Property of the <hi>Fox:</hi> For ſometimes in this Pamphlet, he profeſſes Charity and blames me for the Want of it; and yet betrays a ſeries of the moſt virulent Malignity, in publiſhing notorious Falſhoods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, ſeveral of which have been already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: In one Place <hi>pag.</hi> 9. he owns Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s, and my great Succeſs, and <hi>pag.</hi> 24. he denies that we had any Succeſs at all, but <hi>pag.</hi> 30. he owns that we had ſome. As to the <hi>Moravians, pag.</hi> 11. he ſpeaks againſt them, in reſpect of their wild and frightful Errors, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. he makes an Apology for them <hi>pag.</hi> 26 he acknowledges their unfair Dealings; and yet the Tendency of his whole Performance, is to hinder the Influence of that Book, which I
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005297_0063_1016F5DBA6A49018"/>
wrote againſt them; from giving check to their peſtilent Notions. As to the Work of God, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. he ſhews his Regret, that the <hi>Boſton</hi> Miniſters betray'd too great a likeing to it, and yet <hi>pag.</hi> 10 and 30. he owns the Reality of it, in ſome degree; but in <hi>pag.</hi> 10. he again denies it all together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Pranks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I haſten to conſider, the next Character; and that is a ſly Way <hi>of creeping into other Holes, and of turning other Animals; out of their rightful Poſeſſions;</hi> this the Accuſer himſelf, as conſcious of his Guilt, ſtops as it were half way in the Application of, and no wonder, for the Charge is falſe and ſlanderous. I have not ſlyly crept into the Congregations of orthodox Miniſters, <hi>and turn'd them out of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions by poiſonous Errors,</hi> as <hi>Helenbrook</hi> Expreſſes it. I have been invited by them, to preach where I have preach'd, and have never us'd ſly Methods, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Poſſeſſions. My late Letters that have been printed in <hi>New England,</hi> as well as thoſe Sermons, againſt the <hi>Moravians,</hi> will witneſs for me; that I have oppos'd irregular withdrawing from the Miniſtry of Perſons, ſound in Principle, regular in Life, and approves of Gods Work. What is this Authors Practice as to this, I know not? For I can't tell who he is, and am therefore under a Diſadvantage, in drawing his Character.</p>
            <p>This Author asks my Excuſe in a mannerly Way, while he turns the Key of the <hi>Fox</hi> upon me. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that his uſing this Method with me gives no uneaſineſs, being conſcious thro' pure Grace of my Integrity, I look upon his unjuſt Reproaches, as an honour done to me, and expect they will be Pearls in my Crown at laſt.</p>
            <p>As to the Ground of our Author's Expectation, that I ſhou'd uſe <hi>Fox</hi> like Shifts, to evade the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. namely, my ſecond printed Letter in the <hi>Penſylvania Gazette, Sep.</hi> 2. 1742. I muſt tell him, that it ſerves only to manifeſt the Strength of his Prejudice. Thro' Divine Mercy, I am not afraid of

the brighteſt Light, but that this may appear the more plainly, I ſhall take leave to inſert the Letter here.</p>

                  <p>FORASMUCH as a Letter of mine to Mr. <hi>Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon,</hi> the laſt of February, together with a Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, lately printed in the <hi>Boſton</hi> weekly News-Paper, has occaſioned various Reflections; I have tho't it not improper (being thereunto excited by ſome Friends) to ſhew my Intention in ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages contained therein, which are more liable to Miſconſtruction. I profeſs that when I wrote the aforeſaid Letter and Poſtſcript, I had not the leaſt Thought of their Publication; neither have I at any Time conſented thereto; and truly, the Poſtſcript was wrote in much Haſte.</p>
                  <p>As to my Confeſſion of Miſmanagment in the Affair of Debate with the Synod, it reſpected on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Defects which I conceived attended my Manner of Performing, what I did then and do ſtill look upon to be Duty. I was not then, nor have not been ſince, convinced that the Matter or Subſtance of what I contended for was Wrong, and the Words of the Letter conſidered in their Connection, will eaſily bear this Senſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the Poſtſcript, altho' I queſtion not Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi>'s Piety and Integrity, and hope that he has been an Inſtrument of ſpecial Good to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Perſons; yet I cannot approve of ſome of his Methods of Proceeding (according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation which many give of them) and, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, all the Inſtances in the Poſtſcript, are in my Opinion very exceptionable and of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tendency.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me very unreaſonable that any thing ſhould be made a Term of Communion which cannot certainly be known by the Church; and ſuch doubtleſs, are Men's gracious Experiences, the ſecret Receſſes of the Heart, and Springs of Action, are only open to the all penetrating Eye
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005297_0065_1016F5E4146E3598"/>
of God: Yet ſeeing a probable Knowledge of Men's States towards God, may be attained by an Examination of Men's Principles, Experiences and Practice, Miniſters no doubt ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the State of their Flock, and deal faithfully and diſcreetly with Perſons in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Way according as Things appear to them.</p>
                  <p>As to the Practice of ſetting up ſeparate Meetings, upon the ſuppoſed Unregeneracy of the Paſtors of Places, it is, in my Judgment, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Conſequence to the Church's Peace and Purity, when the Miniſters, ſuppoſed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, are ſound in Principle, regular in Practice, and Favourers of the Work of God.</p>
                  <p>But when Miniſters conſpire to blacken and oppoſe habitually the late memorable Revival of God's Work in this Land, and brand the Whole of it with Terms of the utmoſt Contempt and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy; then; I ſee not how any that fear God can ſit contentedly under their Miniſtrations (if they perſiſt as aforeſaid) without becoming acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their crimſon Guilt.</p>
                  <p>Altho' there be no Probability of unconverted Miniſters being near ſo ſerviceable to the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind, as Perſons of another Character; yet, doubtleſs, the ſovereign God makes their Labours of ſome Uſe, at Times, for the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reformation of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>As to the Practice of openly expoſing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſound in Doctrine, blameleſs in Life, and Favourers of God's Work (who are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome to be unconverted) in publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, in their own Pulpits, by calling of them by their Names pronouncing Sentence againſt their internal State, and exhorting their People to forſake their Miniſtry; this, I think is a very extraordinary and unaccountable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Proceeding, without any Precedent, that I know of, in Scripture, or Church-Hiſtory; it directly tends to tear the Body of Chriſt in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005297_0066_1016F5E5A67B22A0"/>
and to procure a manifold and pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to all the valuable Intereſts of ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>As to the Practice of ſending out unlearned Men into the Miniſtry, in ordinary Caſes, upon the Suppoſition of their Piety, it has been always, and ſtill is my Sentiment concerning it, that it juſtly deſerves the Character given it in the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, I cannot perceive either Decency or Expediency, in ſinging in the Streets; but on the contrary, it ſeems to miniſter Occaſion to the Adverſaries of Religion to revile and blaſpheme.</p>
                  <p>In fine, altho' I freely own the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuppernatural Illumination and divine Energy, in order to the ſaving Inſtruction of Men's Minds and Renovation of their Hearts; yet I cannot but diſclaim all Pretence to immediate Inſpiration or objective Revelation, all following of immediate Impulſes without Conſulting the Word of God, and the Dictates of right Reaſon, as an enthuſiaſtical and perilous <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> which may lead its delued Votaries into the ſtrangeſt Abſurdities in Opinion, and moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Evils in Practice.</p>

yourſelf Sir, and that from a better Foundation; it is you Sir, who is deſtroying the Vines and tender Grapes, who is artfully and cruelly aſperſing Gods Work and Servants; and in the mean Time excuſing <hi>Hereticks, Enthuſiaſts</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> may God forgive your Iniquity.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> goes on to ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. <q>I ſhall follow the ſame Method Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> has taken with the <hi>Moravians,</hi> and compare his Sermon preach'd at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> with his late <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> and <hi>Appendix,</hi> in <hi>diſtinct Columns;</hi> or, in other Words, ſet <hi>Gilbert</hi> againſt <hi>Tennent,</hi> for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders eaſe in finding out the Truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Either the <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Underſtanding, or his Veracity fails him here; I have not taken the ſame Method, with the <hi>Moravians</hi> which he takes with me, in ſetting Paſſages of any of their Writings, in a ſuppos'd Oppoſition to each other, in Diſtinct Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns. I have only ſet the COUNTS Words in one Collumn, and ſome Obſervations of my own, upon the other: But its like this Author wanted ſome Umbrage, true, or falſe, for his contemptuous Manner of treating me.</p>
            <p>And now we are arriv'd at his Collumns, in which as he ſays <q>We are to meet with contradictions, as impoſſible to be reconcil'd, as to unite the Poles; and with two ſet of Principles, as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to each other, as the Heatheniſh Principles, of a good and evil God.</q> Well, tho' the Time of working Miracles be ceas'd, yet I'll put on a little Courage, and try to unite the Poles.</p>
            <p>The firſt Inſtance, of pretended Contradiction is this, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. 12. borrow'd from the 47. <hi>pag.</hi> of my <hi>Mor. Serm.</hi> The Words are theſe, <q>In my Opinion a Diſpoſition to ſeparate from a true Church, becauſe many of her Members are unconverted, and ſome are under Deadneſs, is a ſign of a proud Spirit; were not the Phariſees of old proud Separatiſts? See this apply'd to the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 63.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:005297_0068_1016F5EC38A24A80"/>Compare his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham, pag.</hi> 12. of the laſt Edition under the ſecond Inference, <q>we may learn, that ſuch who are contented under a dead Miniſtry, have not in them, the Temper of that Saviour, they profeſs, it is an awful Sign, they are as blind as Moles, and as dead Stones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpiritual Taſte or Reliſh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, where is the Contradiction? I ſuppoſe our Author thinks, it lyes in this; that in one of thoſe Sermons, I ſay, that a Diſpoſition to ſeparate from a true Church, &amp;c. is a Sign of a true Spirit, and in the other, that ſuch who are contented under a dead Miniſtry, have not the Temper of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour they profeſs. Here is ſcarce any Appearance of Contradiction, much leſs Reality.</p>
            <p>But that my Meaning in the <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, may be the better underſtood, let this Paragraph be added, which immediately follows, what was cited by the <hi>Examiner,</hi> namely, <q>Our Lord allows, the Wheat and Tares to grow together, 'till Harveſt; but ſome raſh Zealots, are for parting them, or plucking them up directly, altho' they thereby riſquo the Safety of the Wheat.</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which I oppos'd in this Sermon, was ſuch an uncharitable and irregular Breach of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, from the viſible Church, as the <hi>Labadiſts</hi> were guilty of formerly in <hi>Holland;</hi> who pretended to form a perfect Church, as to its Members, i. e. to admit none but ſincere Perſons to Communion. And this they tho't they cou'd certainly know, and therefore made their Knowledge as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal State, a Term of Communion. They ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves from the Church of <hi>Holland,</hi> as to make a new Sect. The aforeſaid Paragraphs I wrote with a Deſign to give Check as far as I could, to a cenſorious and diviſive Temper, which I was inform'd was like to obtain, and do much Miſchief in <hi>New England,</hi> which gave me great Uneaſineſs, for a long Time.</p>

               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:005297_0069_1016F5EEEEFA0040"/>As to the Paſſage cited from my <hi>Nottingham</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is in the 18th <hi>pag.</hi> of the firſt Edition (for I have not ſeen the others) the following Words of the Paragraph, explain my Meaning fully, which are theſe, <q>And alas is not this the Caſe of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, if they can get one, who has the Name of a Miniſter, with a Band, and a black Coat or Gown, to carry on a Sabbaoth Day among them, tho' never ſo coldly and inſucceſsfully. If he is free from groſs Crimes in Practice, and takes good Care to keep at a due Diſtance from their Conſciences, and is never troubled about his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs. O think the poor Fools, that is a fine Man indeed, our Miniſter is a prudent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Man, he is not always harping upon Terror, and ſounding Damnation in our Ears, like ſome raſh headed Preachers, who by their uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Methods, are ready to put poor People out of their Wits, or to run them into Deſpair: O! How terrible a Thing is that Deſpair! Ay, our Miniſter honeſt Man, gives us good Caution againſt it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, and is not this a real Truth, as well as what is ſaid in the other Paragraph? Does not our Author ſhew, what ſort of a Spirit, he is of, by <hi>muttering</hi> againſt it?</p>
            <p>The Paſſages of thoſe two Sermons, cited by our <hi>Examiner</hi> don't reſpect the ſame Thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there cannot be a Contradiction in them. The one relates to an <hi>irregular uncharitable Separation,</hi> from a Church, becauſe of the ſuppoſed or real Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy of ſome of her Members. The other relates to <hi>Contentedneſs</hi> uner a <hi>dead carnal</hi> careleſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, who do not preach cloſely to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or endeavour to awake Sinners at all. And wou'd our Author have People to be contented under ſuch a Miniſtry? O ſhame! If our Author ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds no better in his after Attempts, it wll ceaſe to be a Miracle to <hi>unite the Poles.</hi> The</p>

            <p>The ſuppos'd oppoſite Inſtance, to what has been now mentioned is taken from the 19 <hi>pag.</hi> of the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon. The Words are theſe, <q>If the Miniſtry of natural Men, be as it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, then it is both lawful and expedient to go from them to hear godly Perſons, yea it is ſo far from being ſinful to do this, that one who lives under a pious Miniſter, of leſſer Gifts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having honeſtly endeavour'd to get Benefit by his Miniſtry and gets little or none, but doth find real Benefit, and more Benefit elſewhere, I ſay he may lawfully go, and that frequently, where he gets moſt Good to his precious Soul.— let who will oppoſe it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to ſhew the Harmony of theſe Paſſages, I muſt more generally obſerve; that our Author uſes very unfair Methods, in order to make a Contradiction between them <hi>e. g.</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he produces, out of the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon; he leaves out of purpoſe, theſe following Lines of the Paragraph, which fully clears up my Meaning, and free me from the falſe Charge of dividing Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, in which I ſuppoſe, our Author immagined, to ſhew a Contradiction, between this and the other Sermon. The Words left out are theſe, <q>After regular Application to the Paſtor where he lives, for his Conſent, propoſing the Reaſons thereof, when this is done, in the Spirit of Love and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005297_0071_1016F5F2119AB6C0"/>
Meekneſs, without contempt of any, as alſo without raſh Anger and vain Curioſity.</q> Theſe Lines, our Author knew well enough wou'd ſpoil his Boaſt of a Contradiction, and therefore with more Art than Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, he left them out.</p>
            <p>Another Piece of unfair Dealing, under this Charge; is this, inſtead of the foregoing Words, which concluded the Paragraph in the Sermon, he skips like a <hi>Fox</hi> from the 19 to the 30 <hi>pag.</hi> and takes a Scrap of a Sentence from thence, which he adds to the other, namely, theſe Words, <hi>let who will oppoſe it,</hi> In order to repreſent me, as ſpeaking directly contrary, both to my Intention and Expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. The Words cited in the 30 <hi>pag.</hi> I never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in any Senſe inconſiſtent, with the Explication of my Opinion in the 19 <hi>pag.</hi> at this rate of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Author might form Contradictions, in all Writings under the Sun, yea in the very ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves! It is likewiſe I think unfair in him, under this Charge, to put his own Words in in one of the Collumns, in Oppoſition to mine: His Words are theſe, <q>and it is the Language of ſeveral Pages, under his 4th Inference, be ye ſeparate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, where is the Contradiction, between the Paſſages aforeſaid, of theſe Sermons? Becauſe I aſſert, the Lawfulneſs, of a <hi>Peacefull charitable</hi> and <hi>regular withdrawing</hi> from the Stated hearing of one Miniſter to another, of the ſame denomination, when greater Good is got: Does this juſtify an <hi>irregular uncharitable Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> from a true Church? And the making of a different Sect? How triffling, and invidious is this Inſtance? And thus I truſt the Reader perceives, that the Poles again are united. We ſhall not be put to much Difficulty, if our Author does not bring more weighty Objections. A</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Inſtance of pretended Contradiction, is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd <hi>pag.</hi> 48 of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, where I ſpeak thus <q>It is alſo an Inſtance of Pride, to deſpiſe
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005297_0072_1016F5F7848AA8A0"/>
and ſlight Miniſters or People, that are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or ſuproſed to be ſo, is it not the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſuch a Practice, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>ſtand off for I am koliar than thou.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſuppos'd oppoſite Inſtance, to what has been mentioned, is as follows, <q>alas how could Mr <hi>T.</hi>— preach and print this, after printing his Sermon at <hi>Notingham,</hi> without expreſſing deep Repentance for the hard contemptuous Speeches he has there pour'd upon the Body of the Clergy of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? Doth not this ſavour of Pride, and Uncharitableneſs? I ſhall beg Leave here to lay before my Readers, ſome of the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Language, he has plentifully beſtow'd upon the Body of the Clergy, of this Generation; as the Synod of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> has lately collected it to my Hand, out of the ſame Sermon. (<hi>ſee Examin. pag.</hi> 149) they are repreſented herein, as <hi>Hirelings, Caterpillars, letter learned Phariſees,</hi> Men that have the Craft of <hi>Foxes,</hi> &amp; cruelty of <hi>Wolves,</hi> plaiſter'd Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Varlets, the Seed of the Serpent, fooliſh Builders, whom the Devil drives into the Miniſtry, dry Nurſes, dead Dogs that cannot Bark, blind Men, dead Men, Men poſſeſs'd with the Devil, Rebels, Enemies to God, Guides that are ſtone-blind, and ſtone dead, Children of Satan, that like their Father, may do Good to Men's Souls by chance medly, Daubers with untemper'd Mortar; moral Negroes, Salt without ſavour, that ſtink in the Noſtrils of God and Men, <hi>Judaſses,</hi> whoſe chief Deſire is to finger the Penny, and carry the Bag, Hirelings, murderous Hypocrites, that are to take Care, leaſt we feel the Force of a Halter in this World, or an aggravated Damnation in the next, ſubtil ſelfiſh Hypocrites, that would not let an honeſt Man come into the Miniſtry, if they could help it, Swarms of Locuſts crouds of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, that have as covetouſly as cruelly crept into the Miniſtry, in this Adulterous Generation, who as nearly remſemble the Character given of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005297_0073_1016F5FA423C0968"/>
the Phariſees, as one crows Egg does another, whoſe Hearers are as blind as Moles, as dead as ſtones. Succeſſors of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> blind leaders of the blind Formaliſts, dead Drones, Sons of Sceva, with a fine long ſtring of Prayers, falſe Apoſtels, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workers, Miniſters of Satan &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The pretended Contradiction, between the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paſſages, I conceive to be <hi>this,</hi> that in one of the Sermons, I ſay that it is an Inſtance of Pride, to ſlight Miniſters or People, that are unconverted, &amp;c. And in the other I am ſaid to have given them ſuch hard terms as have been expreſs'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlight them. I Anſwer, by denying the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. It is no evidence either of Pride, or Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, to give unconverted Miniſters their proper Titles, and Characters; for if ſo, our Lord himſelf muſt be guilty of the aforeſaid Crimes; for he gave them hard Terms or Names alſo. See Mat. 23. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, becauſe ye build the Tombs of the Prophets, and garniſh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the Righteous, and ſay if we had been in the Days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the Blood of the Prophets, ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> Mat. 23 27.28. <hi>Wee unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye are like whited Sepulchres, which indeed appear beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful outward, but are within full of dead Bones, and of all Uncleaneſs: Even ſo ye alſo appear righteous to Men, but ye are within, full of Hypocriſie and Iniquity.</hi> Matt. 23:16.17.19. <hi>We unto you ye blind Guides, ye Fools and Blind; ye Fools and Blind; ye Fools and Blind.</hi> Verſe 24. <hi>Ye blind Guides, which ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel.</hi> Have not falſe Teachers, the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Wolves, Dogs and Foxes,</hi> given them by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in the Word? <hi>Act</hi> 20.29. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: <hi>Cant:</hi> 2:15. Are they not likewiſe call'd, <hi>Wells without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> 2. Peter 2 17. <hi>Clouds without Rain,</hi> Jud. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>Deceivers.</hi> 2 John 3.7. And are not many unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Miniſters falſe Teachers! Are not the habitual Oppoſers of Gods Work, ſuch with a witneſs who
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005297_0074_1016F5FCF18907C0"/>
Teach that to be Enthuſiaſm and Deluſion, in which the Finger of God evidently appears? And who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clucate new Doctrines reſpecting a call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and the Conviction of Sin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Pray why mayn't the ſame ignominious Epithets be given to unconverted Miniſters, as to unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men of another Station? does their Station ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their Hearts, no ſurely! See then how the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in the Scriptures ſtigmatizes the wicked, they are termed <hi>Captives,</hi> Iſ. 61.1. <hi>Rebels,</hi> Rom 8.7. <hi>Bondſlaves,</hi> Acts. 8.23. <hi>Sluggards,</hi> Pro. 6.9. <hi>Blind Men,</hi> Mat 23.26. <hi>thou Blind Phariſee, Fools,</hi> Pſ. 14.1. <hi>Dead Men,</hi> Ephe. 2.1. <hi>Madmen,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.3. Luke 15.17.</p>
            <p>They are compar'd to <hi>Bulls,</hi> Pſ. 22.12. to <hi>Lyons,</hi> Pſ. 57.4. to <hi>Foxes,</hi> Luke 12.32. to <hi>Goats,</hi> Matt. 25.33. to <hi>Dogs,</hi> Rev. 22.15. to <hi>Swine,</hi> Matt. 7.6. to <hi>Tares,</hi> Matt. 13 38. to <hi>Chaff,</hi> to <hi>Thorns,</hi> Joſ. 22.13.</p>
            <p>And are not Men ſaid, <hi>to be of their Father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</hi> John 8.44. to be <hi>poſſeſſed by the Devil,</hi> Luk. 11.21. Yea is not that wicked Miniſter <hi>Judas,</hi> call'd a <hi>Devil</hi> expreſly? John 6.7.</p>
            <p>Of all human Creatures wicked Miniſters, who habitually oppoſe the very Work of Gods Spirit, and mask their Enmity with Religious Pretences, are the Worſt, eſpecially if this is done againſt Conviction and with Malice, aſcribing it to a bad Cauſe! This as I humbly conceive, is the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which ſhall not find forgiveneſs in this Life, or that to come. This was the Sin of the Phariſees, <hi>thoſe orderly Hypocrites;</hi> againſt which the Zeal of our Lord, the meek Lamb of God burned and ſparkled with ſo great Flame! as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready expreſs'd.</p>
            <p>Now Reader obſerve, what tho' I have given unconverted Miniſters bad Names; yet ſeeing they deſerve them, it is no more but an Act of Juſtice in one reſpect; but under another Conſideration it is an Act of Love to God and Man, or rather a ſigh thereof: It manifeſts Love to God, while in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:005297_0075_1016F5FE9B98C9F0"/>
to him we riſque our Reputation, in detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppoſing his Enemies, and eſpecially when they are diſhonouring his Name and Work, and endeavouring to deſtroy his Kingdom: Beſides, Love to Man is hereby diſcover'd, in ſhewing to ungodly Miniſters, their own dreadful Picture: For this has a Tendency to awaken and humble them, and turn them to God. I have no Prejudice againſt any of them upon the Face of the Earth, tho' they have labour'd to deſtroy my Character and Uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>I would to God, I could do them Good by Night or Day: My Heart within pities them; neither have I us'd harſh Epithets out of Indignation to their Perſons, but their Ways, as I have obſerved in the Preface to this <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon, in theſe Words. <q>So far as I know my Heart it is Grief for the Injurys that have been done to the Church of God by natural Miniſters, that has extorted ſuch Acrimony from my Pen.</q> The Oppoſition that ſome, this Way, have made againſt the Work of God in this Land, their murdering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of divers Perſons, their thruſting out, as I am credibly informed, unexperienced looſe Men into the Miniſtry, and their oppoſing the coming in of Pious Candidates into the Church, has long diſtreſſed my Soul, and fill'd me with Sorrow and Indignation both.</p>
            <p>And by repreſenting the juſt Characters of the ungodly Clergy, Love is hereby expreſſed to Mankind, in warning them of their Danger, and exciting them, to their Duty, in choſing of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the beſt Means. Our Author doubtleſs knows that the Meaning of the Word Charity (agape) is Love.</p>
            <p>Neither does it Savour of Pride, to give ungodly Miniſters ſuch Names as ſuit their <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Courſe:</hi> For this is out to follow the Example that our Lord Jeſus, and the Eternal Spirit have ſet before us,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:005297_0076_1016F6029B342068"/>
as well as divers of Gods faithful Servants of Old, ſuch as <hi>Jeremiah, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. And thus the pretended Contradiction is remov'd</p>
            <p>But to make this Caſe appear the more Plain, I ſhall take leave to obſerve, how unfairly our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and his Friends have treated me, under this 3d Inſtance. For 1ſt. he puts his own Words in one of the Collumns over againſt mine, it ſhould have been my own Words and not his; for his Buſineſs was, according to his Propoſal, not to ſhew a difference between him and me, for that probably is wide enough, but between me and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A 2d unfair Method our Author uſes here, is his citing after his own Words, a Collection of Words, pick'd up here and there out of the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon by my Opponents; he ought to have cited my own Words, in compleat Sentences in the Order I put them, and not broken ſhreads marſhald by my Enemys, in ſuch a Shape as might appear moſt formidable, in order to render me odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among graceleſs Creatures, who are very fond of a blind Charity, upon a ſelfiſh Account, namely, to ſave their Bakon. A 3d. Inſtance of unfair Dealing in our Author under this Head, is his aſſerting that I beſtow reproachful Language, upon the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, his manner of Expreſſion, together with his Artful concealing of the Word <hi>unconverted,</hi> plainly intimates that I, according to his Repreſentation, charg'd the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Epithets, abſolutely and directly, which is Falſe and Sophiſtical, I have charg'd unconverted Miniſters with them directly and abſolutely; but as to the Body of the Clergy, the Charge comes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them indirectly and hipothetically, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Opinion about their State. I cannot but ſtill think that the greater Part of the Clergy is unconverted, and that for Reaſons mention'd in that Sermon. <hi>Strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it, not
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005297_0077_1016F605599DBD40"/>
many Wiſe, not many Noble, are call'd, the Harveſt truly is Plentious, but the Labourers are few.</hi> Saint <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> has expreſs'd his Tho'ts of the Paucity of fatihful Miniſters, in a much ſtronger Light than I have done, for he tho't that Scarce any Miniſters at all wou'd be ſav'd.</p>
            <p>Graceleſs Perſons have a general Superficial groundleſs Notion concerning others Goodneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they themſelves are awakned and made to feel the Difficulties of Religion: But then their way of thinking of Chriſtianity, is alter'd in this Point, they neither weigh others nor themſelves in ſuch light Scales as they were wont to do before.</p>
            <p>But let it be here obſerv'd, that I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a like certainty, as to both theſe Points, namely; charging the aforeſaid Epithets upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Miniſters, and the Knowledge of the greatneſs of their Number, the firſt is of undoubted certainty from the Word of God and right Reaſon; but the other is only highly probable. As to this Point I ſhould be glad to be miſtaken in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but I am perſwaded it is too true. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Another unfair Method of our Author and his Friends under this Head, <hi>is,</hi> their aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I charge all the particular Epithets they mention upon the Body of the Clergy of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; which is falſe, and cannot be prov'd from the Sermon: Indeed I believe they are all applicable to ſome of them; but they are not applicable to all of them. In ſeveral Paragraphs of the Sermon are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Words, which clear me from the aforeſaid Charge. In <hi>pag.</hi> 12. are theſe Words, <q>many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. many Phariſee Teachers, have got a long String of Prayer.</q> And in the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> the Word <hi>generally</hi> is likewiſe uſed, namely, <q>take them firſt and laſt, and they generally do more Hurt than Good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It would be contrary to common Senſe, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that Character of <hi>Letter-learned</hi> to all, for ſome are ignorant. Or that of <hi>plaiſter'd Hypocrites</hi> to all,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005297_0078_1016F6094A025CD8"/>
for ſome declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and refuſed to be aſhamed. Or that of <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Satan to all, I have apply'd that Scripture, which contain theſe Epithets only to ſuch of them, as riſe up in Arms againſt the Life of Piety, when it comes near their Borders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, combine, and contrive againſt it in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claves, as a common Enemy; and who with Art, Rhetorick, and Appearances of Piety, varniſh their Oppoſition againſt the Kingdom of CHRIST; and who imitate the Apoſtles of CHRIST, as the Magicians did the Works of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are theſe following Characters univerſal in reſpect of the ungodly Miniſtry. Namely, the <hi>Craft</hi> of <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> of <hi>Wolves,</hi> for ſome of them are doubtleſs as weak as their Neighbours, tho' di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them it muſt be confeſſed are wiſer in their Generation, than the Children of Light; and ſome are good temper'd, and are not rouſed to Arms by the near Approach of vital Religion. Nor are theſe Words following, to be apply'd univerſally to every graceleſs Miniſter, namely, <q>that they would not let a faithful Man come into the Miniſtry, if they cou'd help it!</q> No its chiefly thoſe of them that have their natural Enmity rous'd, and whetted, by the ſearching nearneſs of Gods Work to them, as well by the faithful Dealings, and holy Living of godly Miniſters, by which they are detected and condemn'd; that are ſo cautious to keep pious Men out of the Miniſtry, upon ſelfiſh Accounts, namely, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Trouble to themſelves, and the Loſs of their Credit among the People.</p>
            <p>But as to the reſt of the Characters, which our <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Friends, have with ſo much Care collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they belong to all unconverted Miniſters, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolutely, or comparatively, properly or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and for the Proof of this, I appeal to the Scriptures and common Senſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:005297_0079_1016F60AD3E24948"/>I might add to what I have ſaid, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that divers of the Epithets and Cenſures charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon unconverted Miniſters, in the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon are borrow'd, from the Writings of <hi>Calviniſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Divines, famous for their Learning and Piety, ſuch as Meſſrs. <hi>Hilderſham, Pool, Burgeſs, Baxter, Brackle, Fenner</hi> Beſides what are expreſsly ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo that the Cenſure the <hi>Queriſt</hi>'s labours to caſt upon me, rather falls directly upon thoſe Worthies of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>Indeed I have heard People, of Piety and good Senſe obſerve, upon this <hi>Popular Paragraph,</hi> that the Gentlemen who had put it together, in its preſent Form, had taken a pretty deal of Pains, to draw their own Picture: But whether the main <hi>Strokes,</hi> of this unhandſome Draft, do exactly ſuit thoſe Men, I will not at preſent determine, but leave to their farther Enquiry's. But in the mean Time, I would ask them, whether a Conſciouſneſs of Guilt, made them apply to themſelves in particular, what I only ſpoke in general, without Application to any, Their Words are theſe <hi>murderous Hypocrites,</hi> that are to take Care, leaſt <hi>we</hi> feel the Force of a Halter &amp;c. If they find themſelves guilty, they ſhoudn't take ſuch Characters ill, but humble themſelves before God, for their Wickedneſs in <hi>murdering</hi> the <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of poor Sinners, and repent! A</p>
            <p n="5">5th. Inſtance of unfair Dealing, under the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Charge, is this, that while they are pretending to give an Account of my Repreſentation, of the Characters of unconverted Miniſters, they <hi>ſlyly</hi> and <hi>ſophiſtically</hi> bring in their Hearers. The Words they cite are theſe, <q>Whoſe Hearers are as blind as Moles, and as dead as Stones.</q> What then are the People that hear the ungodly Clergy, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters too? O ſtrange! by bringing in this broken Scrap of a Sentence of my Sermon; they would ſeem to inſinuate, that it is my Opinion, that all the ſtated Hearers of unconverted Miniſters, are blind as Moles and dead as Stones, which is falſe.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005297_0080_1016F60F876543C8"/>
In that Paragraph, from whence this Scrap is taken, I there explain my ſelf, that it is ſuch who content themſelves, with a cold, careleſs, general unawak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Miniſtry; who are blind, &amp;c. One may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive without the help of Spectacles, that their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Deſign, in bringing the aforeſaid <hi>Scrap</hi> Head and Shoulders, was to alarm the angry Reſentments of the People againſt me, and my Rev. Brethren thro' me who are cordial in God's Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But I muſt here obſerve in the mean Time, that I think it ſomewhat odd, that thoſe dear Brethren of the <hi>Examiner,</hi> ſhould have left out one import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Branch, of the Characters of many graceleſs Miniſters, which is mentioned <hi>pag.</hi> 6. of the <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> Sermon in theſe Words. <q>It may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved that the Phariſee Teachers in CHRIST'S Time, were great Biggots to ſmall Matters in Religion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23 23. <hi>Woe unto you, Scribes, and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye pay Tyth of Mint, Annis, and Cummin, and have omitted the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith?</hi>
               </q> Was it, becauſe it plainly diſcovers the Vanity of their <hi>thread bare cant</hi> and cry, about <hi>Order, Order, Order;</hi> while they are labouring with both Hands, to tear down Gods Work and Servants. If ſo, they are more cautious, than candid.</p>
            <p>Another particular, that I would juſt mention here, is the altering of the Word <hi>faithful-Man</hi> to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-Man.</hi> If this Gentleman or his Friends have done this of Purpoſe, it is very baſe. The Paſſage I referr'd to, is <hi>pag.</hi> 17 of the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon, where it is ſaid, in the firſt Edition, <q>That if they cou'd help it, they woudn't let a faithful Man come into the Miniſtry.</q> But in the <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Performance, I find the Words are, <hi>Honeſt Man,</hi> which a Perſon may be, and yet intirely grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>But tho' I hope by this Time, the <hi>Reader</hi> is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that there is no Contradiction in my Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:005297_0081_1016F61244CB99A0"/>
under this third Inſtance, yet I believe, it will be difficult, to vindicate our Author from what he charges upon me therein, which is Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs <hi>e. g.</hi> is it not uncharitable in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor? When he has no ſufficient Foundation from my Words related by him, to charge me with the Evils before mentioned? Doſn't this look like an aſſuming of the incommunicable Prerogative of God, who alone is <hi>Kerdiognoſtos.</hi> For him to judge as aforeſaid, without any Foundation from my Words, yea contrary to them; (as appears from the Preface to the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon where I ſolemnly declare the Reaſon, why I us'd ſuch Acrimony) isn't this raſh judging with a Witneſs, and doth it not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Uncharitableneſs? Alas! How cou'd our Author print this, after printing an Account of his Charity, in the firſt <hi>pag.</hi> of his Performance?</p>
            <p>Is it not likewiſe uncharitable in our Author, to appear ſo much in Defence of ungodly Miniſters, many of whom, do ſo much harm to the Church of God. Why is the <hi>Apple</hi> of his <hi>Eye</hi> touch'd? And why does he <hi>ſigh</hi> ſo heavily <hi>alas,</hi> when they are painted in their own Colours?</p>
            <p>I may add, doesn't it ſeem as if the <hi>Examiner</hi> himſelf judg'd the Body of the Miniſtry of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to be unconverted? If it be obſerv'd, that after he cites my Words in the 48 <hi>pag.</hi> of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon before related, he ſays, <q>I ſhall beg leave to lay before my Readers, ſome of the Reproachful Language he has plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd, upon the Body of the Clergy of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</q> I had ſpoken thoſe Things or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractes of unconverted Miniſters, and behold he applys them to the Body of the Clergy of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; I leave it to the Reader to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Author, and his dear Friends, be conſiſtent with themſelves herein.</p>
            <p>As to what is mention'd in the Margin <q>about ſome Rev. Gentleman's putting me to ſilence, by obſerving that he had heard me twice or thrice,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005297_0082_1016F613CAB1B778"/>
but found that he had got ſuch a ſhort String of Prayer by heart, that he could almoſt repeat it verbatim.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is falſe, I know nothing of it, thoſe that are us'd to hear me frequently, can witneſs that I am far from uſing the ſame Words often, unleſs it be the LORDS Prayer that the Objector means, that indeed I uſe frequently. Perhaps the <hi>Examiner</hi> and his Friends take this in <hi>Dudgeon,</hi> if they do, I can't help it, for my Part I think it is a very laudable Practice, I don't know what better Order or Words we can uſe in Acts of Religious Worſhip, than thoſe our Lord has taught us?</p>
            <p>But that which I ſpoke againſt, was the long Strings of lifeleſs, ſapleſs, ſpiritleſs formal, Prayer, which ſome are generally guilty of, who tire their Audience with their long and dead Acts of Devotion, &amp; who ſeem not to ſtrive after the Breathings of the Spirit; but whatever the Frame of their Souls be, their Words are much the ſame, and their Prayers of an equal Length. I have had credible Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Miniſter in <hi>Boſton,</hi> now a no better Friend of God's Work, than our Author; who about 17 or 18 Years agone was then a Candidate for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and fam'd among ſome, for the Neatneſs and Elegancy of his Prayers; whoſe Prayers were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally an Hour long, and in many Times upon Tryal by the Watch did not vary ſcarce a Minute under or over. Perhaps our Author will ſay, that this is orderly, I ſhall not at preſent diſpute the Point with him, but only obſerve, that ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in this Particular, does not ſuit me, I do not care to be ſo ſtrait laced. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="4">4th Inſtance of ſuppoſed Contradiction, contain'd in his 14, 15, and 16. <hi>pages,</hi> which is cited from <hi>pag.</hi> 48 of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon thus, <q>And here I muſt take leave to obſerve, that the Practice of ſtaying at home, rather than their going to hear ſuch Miniſters, (ſound in Principle and regular in Practice) as are judged by ſome to be unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005297_0083_1016F6168E742260"/>
is unſcriptural and of dangerous Tendency, in my Opinion; for it hangs the whole Weight of the publick Worſhip of God upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Judgment of Men, tho' unconverted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not likely to do ſo much Good, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet ſeeing that many of them doubtleſs do preach the ſame Word of God, which others do, why may not the Soverign God who permits them by his Providence to come into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, bleſs the Word deliver'd by them for the Good of Mankind?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Beſides, the aforeſaid Practice of ſtaying at Home, &amp;c. opens a Door to Deluſion by falſe Teachers, as well as to Confuſion and Schiſm in the Church of God.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Now the ſuppos'd oppoſite Inſtance, to what has been mentioned, in the preceeding Paragraph, is taken from <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon which is introduced thus, <q>he ſcarce owns a poſſibility of profiting under an unconverted Miniſtry, when he ſays, is a dead Man fit to bring others to Life? Sad experience verifies the unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Miniſtry of unconverted Men. Look into the Congregations of unconverted Miniſters, and ſee what a ſad Security reigns there, not a Soul convinced that can be heard of for many Years together! What if ſome Inſtances could be ſhewn, of unconverted Miniſters, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in convincing Perſons of their loſt State, the Thing is very rare and extraordinary, and for what I know, as many Inſtances might be given of Satans convincing Perſons by his Temptations, it is a kind of Chance Medly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and his Children, when any ſuch Event happens. And is not this the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a Work of Conviction and Converſion has been ſo rarely heard of for a long Time, in
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:005297_0084_1016F61959B43340"/>
the Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Bulk of her ſpiritual Guides, are ſtone blind and ſtone dead.</q>

I beſeech you my dear Brethren to conſider, that there is no probability of your getting Good by the Miniſtry of Phariſees, for they are no Shepherds, (no faithful ones) in CHRIST'S Account, they are as good as none, nay worſe than none upon ſome Accounts, for take them firſt and laſt, and they generally do more Hurt than Good. <hi>See the Note at the Aſteriſm</hi> *</q>

               <q>* This Declaration, is much like that in the 27 <hi>pag.</hi> of the aforeſaid Examination, &amp;c. Where Mr <hi>Tennent</hi> declares, as to what is alledged of our encouraging, the Flocks of our proteſting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to forſake their Miniſtry. <hi>I know nothing of this, neither do I know any of our Number that has.</hi> They anſwer, it ſeems very ſtrange to us, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> of all Men alive ſhou'd have the Face to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf thus, after writing, preaching and printing his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham;</hi> for did not his own Party underſtand that Sermon, as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to forſake our Miniſtry, and have not their Adherents at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and many other Places, ſet up ſeparate Meetings in compliance with ſaid Sermon, and others of the ſame Kind? <hi>Moreover they affirm,</hi> that the whole Country knows, that it is a notorious Falſehood, and that he has encourag'd them, both from the Pulpit and Preſs to forſake their Miniſtry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here let the Reader obſerve, that the <hi>Examiner</hi> according to his Cuſtom, uſes unfair Methods, in repreſenting my Words, in order to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He of Purpoſe leaves out ſuch Sentences, as ſerve to explain my Meaning, and ſhew a Harmony in my Writings <hi>e. g.</hi> what our Author cites, from the 49 <hi>pag.</hi> of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, is but a little Piece of a Sentence, broken off from a large Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, more than two Thirds whereof are left out. The whole Paragraph runs thus <q>I muſt declare
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:005297_0085_1016F61D42FD0B90"/>
to the World, that I dread the Tho'ts of Schiſms and Separations in the Church of God <hi>(this was all our Author cited, now the Words immediately following are,)</hi> becauſe of the diſmal Handle, that is thereby given to Seducers, to promote their erronious Tenets; as alſo becauſe of the Diſhonour that is hereby caſt upon God's Name, Ways, and People. Hereby wicked Men are ſtrengthned in their Prujudices againſt Religion; hereby Profeſſors are diverted from promoting Gods Work to perſonal Controverſies of no Moment. therefore when the Caſe ſo happens, that People are diſatisfied with their Miniſter, and can't get Edification by his Miniſtrations, after long and impartial Labours. To this End it ſeems moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable for them, humbly and peaceably (in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Manner) to ſeek to get an Aſſiſtant with him, if the Place be able to ſupport two; but if not, to ask Leave of their Paſtor, and other Church Officers, to go where they are more edifyed; in the mean Time laying aſide all raſh Cenſures. And ſhould not Miniſters alſo for Peace ſake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves, and conſent to the reaſonable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of their People? waving all exaſperating Reflections upon their diſatisfy'd People, and more eſpecially in their publick Performances. O! may the God of Peace incline us to ſtudy, and purſue the Things that are for Peace.</q> Now I leave it to the Reader to judge if the remaining Part of the aforeſaid Paragraph, does not fully explain my Meaning, and ſhew a harmony in my Writings, and whether it was not unjuſt in our Author to leave in out? And,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. As to the Inſtance taken out of the <hi>Noting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Sermon; our Author deals unfairly alſo, the firſt Words he mentions, namely theſe, <q>Is a dead Man fit to bring others to Life?</q> is a Sentence taken out of the Middle of a large Paragraph, which you may find chiefly in the 11 <hi>pag.</hi> the reſt of which is wholly omitted. To the aforeſaid Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005297_0086_1016F620526770E8"/>
our Author joyns ſix Lines taken out of the beginning of another Paragraph in the 12 <hi>pag.</hi> without giving the leaſt Notice of this to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and leaves out all the Reſt, of a large Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, and then adds another Paragraph in the 31ſt <hi>pag.</hi> (of the firſt Edition) and there takes a little and leaves the reſt. What Writings can ſtand before ſuch partial Proceeding? But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another unjuſt Method of our Author is this, in order to oppoſe the Declaration I have made in the 43d <hi>pag.</hi> of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, namely of my <q>dreading the tho'ts of Shiſms, and Separation in the Church of God.</q> He doſn't bring my Words only, which he ought to have done, but refers to, and cites the Words of my Enemies; who oppoſe the Work of God in this Part of the Country: What, does their differing from me ſhew a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and myſelf? which our Author was to prove. Are then they myſelf? if ſo, our Author has proved his Point, otherwiſe not. Alas! what ſorry ſhuffling is here? The Examiner ſeems to be aware of this, and therefore he does not put their Words in the oppoſite Collumn to mine, which would be too bare Fac'd and too eaſily diſcovered; but ſets an <hi>Aſteriſm</hi> there, referring to them, and gives his reader a Hint to ſee the note at the <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm;</hi> and thus he leaves a Blank in the Column, and cites their Words in the Margin. What ſneaking petty Sophiſtry is this? It would not only have look'd better to have ſet them in the Collumn, but have ſhewn a little more Honeſty in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to what this Gentleman cites, from the Writings of my Opponents, in contradiction to another Declaration of mine, before related, (which is mention'd in my Remarks, on their Proteſt; which Declaration, harmonizes with that in the <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon.) I ſhall only ſay at Preſent, that I affirmed nothing therein but the very Truth; however ſtrange they may pretend it is to them.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005297_0087_1016F6224CD40EC0"/>
And that I hope the Almighty will always give me Boldneſs to expreſs, whoever oppoſe it, either to gratify their Spleen, or guard their Credit and worldly Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Neither does the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon oppoſe the Declaration aforeſaid, for it only aſſerts a <hi>regular withdrawing,</hi> from the ſtated hearing of one Miniſter to another (in ordinary Caſes) for greater Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the General, without particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any. The <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon as to the Subſtance of it, upon that Head they refer to (and others alſo) I had wrote as my Opinion and preach'd, a matter of ten Years before I ever was at <hi>Notingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not accountable for any Senſe that Perſons may put upon my Words, for which they have no Foundation in them. The Sermon gave no more Encouragement to leave their Miniſtry than my own, on Condition it was as it ſhould be, and if it was not how could I help that? It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, divers Perſons after they were awakned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they could not find any <hi>Reliſh</hi> under the Miniſtry of ſome of their Number, nor get any Benefit by it, and were therefore diſpos'd to go elſe where, where they did get Good to all Appearance. And that which ſtrengthned the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of many godly Perſons to their Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was their ſlighting of Gods Work, together with the Inſtruments <hi>Jehovah</hi> was pleas'd to uſe in promoting of it. And here give me Leave to propoſe this Querie to Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> and his Aſociates, whether it was becauſe that ſuch as were convinc'd of Sin, had generally a leſs Eſteem of his Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of ſome of the reſt of his Party, that he and ſome (at leaſt) of them, have ſo fiercely oppos'd the bleſſed Opperations of the Holy Ghoſt, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming and convincing a ſecure World of Sin, Righteouſneſs and Judgment? If ſo is not it ſelfiſh and ſordid with a Witneſs, and a blow at the Root of Piety? For my own Part I muſt ſay, That I
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005297_0088_1016F624068F88F0"/>
humbly conceive that to be the Secret of the Story of their Oppoſition, the Bottom of the Miſtery, the true Spring of their Malignant contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vital Godlineſs, the Falſe and ungenerous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, as well as long Continuance of their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Work of God, under ſo much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Light and Evidence in favour of it, together with their dangerous Errors before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, frees me from the juſt Imputation of Raſh judging in thinking, as I have expreſſ'd.</p>
            <p>As to what they ſay of, <q>our Adherents ſetting up ſeparate Meetings at <hi>Nothingham</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places, in complyance with ſaid Sermon, and others of the ſame Kind.</q> This is Falſe; there is not a Word in that Sermon that encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſeparate Meetings from any Miniſtry, merely becauſe they are unconverted. No, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is expreſs'd <hi>pag.</hi> 15. in theſe Words. <q>Dear Sirs, we ſhould moſt earneſtly pray for them, that the Compaſſionate Saviour may preſerve them by his Mighty Power thro' Faith unto Salvation, ſupport their ſinking Spirits under the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Uneaſineſs of a dead Miniſtry, ſanctify and ſweeten to them, the dry Morſels they get under ſuch blind Men, when they have none better to repair to.</q> No, it was their bitter Oppoſition to the Power of Religion, that gave Riſe to ſeparate Meetings, together with their irregular and unjuſt attempt, to caſt us out of <hi>Synodical</hi> Communion; neither have I or any of my Brethren that I know of, ever preach'd any Sermon of that kind they Mention.</p>
            <p>Their affirming that the whole Country knows, that it is (meaning my Declaration aforeſaid) a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Falſehood: And that I have encourag'd People from the Pulpit and Preſs, to forſake their Miniſtry, is a dreadfull Inſtance of <hi>effronted Impiety.</hi> O ſhame! What ſort of Men are theſe? Who not only aſſert an egregious Falſehood, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the whole Country to prove it. To confront
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005297_0089_1016F6291EE1F5C8"/>
their Charge, I do appeal to the numerous Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, where ever I have preach'd the Goſpel of CHRIST, if what they have alledged be not a groundleſs and crimſon Calumny, which thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Power of Religion, do impute to me? It is the Neceſſity of their wretched Cauſe, that ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thoſe unhappy Men, to take ſuch ſinful and ſcandalous Methods, in order to cloak their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Wickedneſs, <hi>in oppoſing Gods Work,</hi> which has been the real Cauſe of the Diviſions ſubſiſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; which they without Foundation aſcribe to me.</p>
            <p>Neither does what I have ſaid, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. of my Remarks, on their <hi>Proteſt,</hi> contradict what I have now alledged. The Words are theſe <q>No doubt there is a Relation, between a Paſtor and his People, but the Deſign of this being to promote their Good, we think it unreaſonable, that it ſhould ſubſiſt to the Prejudice of that which it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to procure, however in ordinary Caſes, we think it to be the Peoples Duty, to make regular Application to their Paſtors to go where they get the greateſt Benefit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But when Miniſters conſpire to oppoſe, the Work and faithful Servants of God, in the moſt open and flagrant Manner, we ſee no Harm in this Caſe, in uſing an extraordinary Method.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve; that the aforeſaid Remarks, were compos'd and publiſh'd after Things were brought to the utmoſt criſis and Confuſion among us; by their ſtrange and unaccountable Conduct: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Rupture was forc'd between them and us, by their Proteſt; and therefore nothing I have ſaid therein cou'd poſſibly be even the Occaſion of either.</p>
            <p>As to that of extraordinary Caſes, I have ſpoken to it before, and therefore ſhall not now add, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting this, that if Miniſters conſpiring to oppoſe the Work and Servants of God, as aforeſaid,—be not an <hi>extraordinary Caſe,</hi> I know not what is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:005297_0090_1016F62AC5B24468"/>But to return from this digreſſion, to the 4th In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuppoſed Contradiction, in my Sermons, which I was diſcourſing upon: I ſhall juſt take leave to add, to what has been already obſerved, theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> particulars following, namely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Occaſions upon which they were written, were different. The Paſſages referr'd to in the <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon were occaſioned by reports of a ſeparating Diſpoſition obtaining in <hi>New-England:</hi> I was inform'd that ſome were ſeparating from the Miniſtry of ſuch as were ſound in Principle, regular in Life, and approvers of God's Work; and that ſome ſtay'd at Home, rather than they would hear ſuch, <hi>meerly</hi> becauſe they judg'd them unconverted! This diſtreſſed me in Mind much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to this Caſe the fore-cited Paragraphs, in the 48 and 49 pages of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, directly refer.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon was occaſioned by the View I had of the Danger of unconverted Miniſters in general, and the Miſchief that I was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, ſome of them had done to the Souls of Men in particular, <hi>eſpecially of late!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, let it further be obſerved, that in both thoſe Sermons, I acknowledge theſe Things following.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That unconverted Miniſters <hi>might</hi> be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in doing Good. And</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That they ſhould be heard, when we have no better. See <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon, page 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. I aſſert in both, That we ſhould not leave their Miniſtry in ordinary Caſes, without regular Application.</p>
            <p>Therefore the only appearance of Contradiction is this, that in the <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon I ſeem'd to ſpeak more favourably of unconverted Miniſters doing Good; then in the Inſtances our Author alledges or cites from the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon.</p>
            <p>But to remove this apparent Difficulty, let it be conſidered, that it is only of ſuch of them as <hi>preach ſound Doctrine,</hi> are <hi>regular in Life,</hi> and <hi>favour God's Work,</hi> that I have ſpoken ſo mildly of in the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005297_0091_1016F62FD929B620"/>
Sermon, and not of all. And that in the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham Sermon, in the Pages referred to by our Author, there are exceptions admitted, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by theſe Words. "p. 11. the Miniſtry of natural Men is for the moſt Part unprofitable, and <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <q>for take them firſt and laſt, and they generally do more hurt than Good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain that unconverted Miniſters are of different Sorts. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Some of them are unſound in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, theſe every one muſt acknowledge, are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do do good, but much hurt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Some are Prophane in Practice, theſe are not likely to do Good, but Hurt.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Some are malignant Oppoſers of God's Work, theſe are not likely to do good but much Hurt,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Some are quite Secure, unacquainted with Conviction, and the Similiar Workings of the Spirit of God, now there is no Probability that ſuch will do Good, in reſpect of the Conviction and Converſion of Sinners, tho' they may be means of Inſtructing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Knowledge of ſome doctrinal Points of Religion, which is doubtleſs Good in its Place and neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Some are under Conviction, and the Similiar Workings of the Spirit, ſound in Doctrine, and favourers of God's Work. There is indeed <hi>ſome</hi> Probability, that ſuch will be means of awaking and converting Sinners.</p>
            <p>Beſides it may be farther obſerv'd, that when in the Nottingham Sermon I have ſpoke diminitively of the uſefulneſs of unconverted Miniſters, it was chiefly in reſpect of <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Converſion. See p.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Now altho' what I have offer'd does fully remove the Appearance of Contradiction, objected by our Author; yet becauſe one of the Paſſages he cites, from the 13th. p. of the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon about <hi>Satans Temptations,</hi> and <hi>Chance Medly,</hi> as before related, has been frequently us'd and much triumph'd in by oppoſers this Way, I have thought it neceſſary

to ſignify my meaning, more fully in thoſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt I do not, nor never did intend by theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to put the <hi>Temptations of Satan</hi> in reſpect of Tendency, to convince, upon a par with the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an unconverted Miniſter, when he preaches ſound Doctrine, according to the Scriptures; No! God forbid, I abhor the thought! But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Particulars therefore, that I there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, are theſe namely, that the Inſtances of Conviction, by the Miniſtry of unconverted Men, are (for the General) very rare and Extraordinary, and ſo they are as appears from what has been ſaid before. And 2dly I do not poſitively aſſert, that as many are convinced by <hi>Satans Temptations,</hi> as by the preaching of unconverted Miniſters, I only ſay for what I know the Number may be equal. I have met with ſome myſelf, that have been awakned, by the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Enemy; which gave me ſome Room to ſay, what I have ſaid. But whither the Number be equal I will not aſſert, however I may ſafely ſay, that I don't know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly but it may; if others do, let them declare it and prove their Aſſertion if they can, but as for myſelf, I muſt profeſs Ignorance in this Point. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. As to that of <hi>chance medly,</hi> between the Father and his Children, I mean no more but this, viz. <q>That when Perſons happen to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by <hi>Satan's Temptations,</hi> he doſn't intend it; and that it is ſo alſo, with many unconverted Miniſters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For Illuſtrations ſake, I ſhall beg leave to tell a Story or two. I remember to have heard of a graceleſs Miniſter, that was once preaching in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and it happned that a Gentlewomans Maid was convinc'd by his Sermon, (who underſtood as little of the Nature and Neceſſity of Conviction as the Miniſter) and therefore ſhe came to the Miniſter, and told him in a frett, <hi>that he had ſpoil'd her Maid by his preaching, for the Maid was ſo diſtreſs'd that ſhe
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005297_0093_1016F632E647C630"/>
coud'nt work.</hi> He told her, <q>
                  <hi>that</hi> he was very ſorry for it, and that he intended no ſuch Thing.</q> Now Sir, was not this <hi>chance medly?</hi> The good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Miniſter intended no Harm to the Girle, (as he recon'd it) but it fell out ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily to him, poor Man!</p>
            <p>Another ſuch Inſtance, as I have been credibly inform'd, has hapend lately in Holand. A certain Miniſter not long ſince, was raiſing againſt ſome pious Miniſters in the Neighbourhood; becauſe they brought People into diſtreſs by their Preaching: And in the mean Time, one came and told him, <q>That a particular Perſon was brought into diſtreſs by his preaching,</q> which ſurpriz'd him, (as well it might) and ſoon ſtop'd his Mouth, poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman! How could he help it? For Accidents will ſometimes happen, whatever care be taken to prevent them.</p>
            <p>I might come nearer home, and tell you a ſhort Story, that has happened not long agone, in this part of the Country, as I have been inform'd by divers Perſons; which take as follows, A certain Preacher took up one of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Sermons, and read it in a Family where he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, (the Heads of which had a conſiderable Reſpect for him) by reading the Sermon aforeſaid, the Man and Woman were convinced; who had afterwards leſs regard for him, when their Minds were enlightened then before, the Preacher came afterwards to the Houſe, and expreſs'd his uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at what had happened, as to their being brought under Trouble by the Sermon.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be glad that Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> for his own ſake, as well as on the Account of the poor Souls, he deludes with his falſe and dangerous Doctrine about <hi>Conviction</hi> before related, might meet with ſome ſuch Inſtances of <hi>chance-medly</hi> in his Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Perhaps it might ſtop his Mouth, and check his Pen, from uttering ſuch ſophiſtical and unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005297_0094_1016F6359E8CE858"/>
againſt the Convincing Operations of God's holy Spirit. I proceed to the,</p>
            <p n="5">5th, Inſtance of ſuppos'd contradiction, which is as follows, <q>
                  <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, p. 53 in order to preſerve our ſelves, and our Poſterity, from the Infection of Error, I think it is needful to uſe (in our proper Spheres) all ſuitable Means, to obtain a godly learned and regular Miniſtry; when ignorant Novices are admitted into the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial order, they are apt to be puff'd up to the Churches great Prejudice, as well as their own, and to ſpread Error when they know it not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To ſay that theſe Qualifications may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily attain'd, without human Learning is notoriouſly Enthuſiaſtical, and Fooliſh. In ſhort human learning is neceſſary, or there muſt be Inſpiration to ſupply the want thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſuppos'd oppoſite, is drawn from the 11 p. of the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon; which runs thus, viz. <q>The moſt likely Method to ſtock the Church, with a faithful Miniſtry, <hi>(not learned)</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Situation of Things, the publick Academy's being ſo much corrupted and abus'd generally, is to encourage private Schools, or Seminarys of learning, which are under the Care of skilful and experienced Chriſtians, in which thoſe only ſhould be admitted, who upon ſtrict Examination, have in the Judgment of a reaſonable Charity, the plain Evidences of experimental Religion. This Method has in my Opinion a noble Tendency, to build up the Church of God, don't think it much if the Phariſees be offended at ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, &amp;c.</q> To what has been mentioned, the <hi>Examiner</hi> anexes ſome Lines of a Writing of the Oppoſers in <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> which runs thus,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Some of Mr. <hi>Tennents</hi> very good Friends have confeſſed, that this Propoſal has a friendly aſpect on his Fathers <hi>Log-Houſe:</hi> But it's generally tho't, if that ſhould be built upon the ruin of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Academy's, neither Religion nor learning
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005297_0095_1016F637662C6A48"/>
would be greatly ſerv'd thereby. <hi>See the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pag.</hi> 13. 52.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here it will be only neceſſary to remove, what our Author has added, and to add what he has left our, and then the Contradiction evaniſhes. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>Examiner</hi> adds to what he cites from the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon theſe Words of his own, in a Parentheſis, in <hi>Italick</hi> Characters, namely <hi>(not learned)</hi> ſo that the Sentence runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi> The moſt likely "Method to Stock the Church, with a faithful, "(nor learned Miniſtry) here indeed if the Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is included, as our Author doubtleſs deſigned, by inſerting of it, it is a real Contradiction, for faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs is oppos'd to learning, but it is entirely of our Authors making: if he Thinks that Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Learning cannot conſiſt together, I pity him, but beg to be excus'd from concuring in ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Notion. No Conjunction is more amiable in its ſelf, and uſeful to the Church of God, then of thoſe habits or Qualities, which our Author labours to ſet at an unfriendly Diſtance.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The <hi>Examiner</hi> leaves out the following Sentence, viz. <q>Pious and experienced Youths, who have a good natural capacity, and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, after the Miniſterial Work from good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, might be ſought for, and found up and down the Country; and put to private Schools of the Prophets, eſpecially in ſuch Places where the Publick, ones are not.</q> Here let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obſerve, that what our Author cited, was immediately before and after this Sentence, and yet it was left out, which muſt be of Purpoſe; what unjuſt Treatment is this? And yet the <hi>Examiner</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes <hi>Charity,</hi> and now let the Reader judge, if we don't need the Collums again, after this Union of the Poles.</p>
            <p>As to what our Author borrows from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, this way. I think it only needful to ſay, briefly as follows, viz. What it the Propoſal had a favourable Aſpect upon the <hi>Log-Houſe,</hi> where is the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005297_0096_1016F63C926C00E0"/>
Harm of it? Mayn't Perſons be taught as well in a <hi>Log-Houſe</hi> as in a <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Brick-Houſe?</hi> in the mean Time every Eye may ſee, that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reſpects not one Houſe more than another, where both Piety and Learning are regarded. The Inſinuation of building the <hi>Log Houſe</hi> upon the ruin of publick Academys, is Invidious and without Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as appears from what has been already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; the Diſtance between this private School and any publick Academys, is ſo great that their is no danger of its interferring with them.</p>
            <p>Whatever contempt theſe Men, from whom our Author borrows the aforeſaid Paſſage, are pleas'd to caſt upon the School, under my honoured Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Tuition; yet Multitudes of Pious People in this Land can witneſs, that divers who have come out of it, have been eminently ſucceſsful in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the truly noble Intereſts of vital Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; as the Deſign of its Inſtruction, was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce more faithful Miniſters into the Church, that thereby experimental and pactical Religion, might, together with human learning, be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo it has pleas'd a gracious God, (adored be his Name) to crown with auſpicious Smiles, the humble Eſſays, that have been made to ſerve his Glory and his Church. The,</p>
            <p n="6">6th, Inſtance comes now to be conſidered, (p. 17) which is taken from <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon p. 62. <q>For any Men to pretend to know certainly, who are gracious, as one of the <hi>Moravian</hi>'s did in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to aſſume an incommunicable Prerogative of God, and to run upon this Plan in Church Matters, is to turn all into the wildeſt Confuſion and Diſorder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſuppos'd oppoſite to what has been mentioned is this, <q>The <hi>Queriſts</hi> pertinently obſerve, p. 10. part 3. That the Scope of the whole Sermon at <hi>Notingham,</hi> ſeems to imply that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> would have Men to believe, that they may know a converted from an unconverted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005297_0097_1016F63F9CDB4C70"/>
or elſe would not the main Part of the Fabrick fall?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here let the Reader obſerve how our charitable Author deals with me again, <hi>viz.</hi> inſtead of my Words he ſets the <hi>Queriſts</hi> Words in one of the Collums, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Judgment of the Scope of the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon, that Men may know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, well what then, ſo they may know fallibly and probably a converted from an unconverted Miniſter, and thus the Fabrick of the Sermon is ſupported, without any unfriendly Oppoſition to the other Column; except our Author makes fallible and infallible Knowledge to be the ſame, which will prove a herculian Labour.</p>
            <p>But the Examiner proceeds to ſay thus, <q>The <hi>Moravians</hi> ſpeak out what is more artfully conceal'd by Mr. <hi>Tennent,</hi> under the Guiſe of a near Gueſs, a probable Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Mens State to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, by an Examination of Mens Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Experience, and Practice. Who made thee a Judge of Mens inward Experiences and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Well, ſaid Mr. <hi>Examiner,</hi> you are realy in a fair Way to commence <hi>Moravian,</hi> if you are not one already. The <hi>Moravians</hi> ſpeak out, what I artfully conceal you ſay, ſo, ſo, they are then in your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion candid and open, but I reſerv'd and Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; well, I ſee you are ſtill as charitable to me as you was, juſt when you put on the Cloak, in the beginning of your worthy Performance. I ſee you are no Changeling in reſpect of your ſort of Charity! I am oblig'd to you Mr. <hi>Examiner,</hi> for the largeneſs of your Love to me. You ask <hi>who has made me a judge of Mens inward Experiences and ſecret State?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I pretend not to judge of Mens Experiences and State, immediately or infallibly, but only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and fallibly, by the outward Signs of Speech and Action; and this our Savour allows of, when he tells us, <hi>that the Tree is known by its Fruit.</hi> And is not the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> commended for trying thoſe
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005297_0098_1016F64253788710"/>
that ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were nor, and for finding or diſcovering them to be Lyars <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. And is not the Shepherd more particularly bid <hi>to know the State of his Flock.</hi> Prov. 27.23. How can we love the Brethren in particular, except we judge them to be ſuch? The Truth is, a Judgment of one kind or other, concerning the States of thoſe with whom we converſe, we cannot avoid; and therefore it is our Wiſdom to uſe Caution in forming of it: And one Thing, among others, that helps a judicious Chriſtian much in this Affair, is Perſons relating what the Lord hath done for their Souls, or their Experiences of a Work of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> upon their Hearts: If their Experiences be agreeable to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and they be alſo Sound in the main Doctrines of Religion, and both be confirm'd by a holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, then ſhould we judge charitably of their State, otherwiſe we have not Reaſon for it. What tho' ſome ſhould be ſound in Principle, and regular in Life, yet if, according to their own Account, they are utterly Ignorant of the due influence of the Law and Goſpel upon their Hearts, or of Conviction of Sin, Communion with God, and a heavenly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Byaſs of Heart, we have Reaſon to think that their regular Practice is but a dead Form. And doubtleſs great Caution ſhould be uſed in expreſſing our Opinion concerning others States towards God, leaſt by raſh judging, we ſtrengthen the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and diſcourage the Sincere-Hearted, hurt their Characters and hender their uſefulneſs in the World! Our Judgment of a Perſons bad State, ſhould not be expreſs'd, except there be ſome ſufficient Cauſe for it, and ſome valuable End can be anſwered by it. The contrary Practice tends to Confuſion and Diſcord.</p>
            <p>But in the mean Time may I crave leave to ask our Author this Queſtion, viz. <hi>Who made him a Judge of my ſecret Thoughts?</hi> Is it not inconſiſtent in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer</hi> to find fault with my judging of the preſent States of Men towards God by outward Signs, while
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005297_0099_1016F6440DB96D80"/>
in the mean time he judges my Tho'ts or State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, yea contrary to them? For dosn't he in effect ſay, I am of the <hi>Moravian</hi> Opinion, as to judging, tho' I ſay the contrary, and conceal my Opinion under the guiſe of a near Gueſs?—Dosn't he herein aſſume God's unalianable Prerogative?</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to to cite a Paſſage from the Writings of our Oppoſers in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> pag. 115, 116. which runs thus, <q>Will Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> tell us where God required it of Ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or People, to make poſitive Judgment of the ſecret States of orderly Profeſſors, or to ſet up a Court of Inquiſition to pry into one anothers ſecret State, any farther than it appears in their Profeſſion and Practice?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Beſides what has been already obſerv'd upon the Point of Juding, for Brevity's ſake, I ſhall only add, that I have profeſſ'd no more than what our excellent Directory inculcates, under the Head of Ordination of Miniſters, in theſe Words, <q>which being conſidered by the Presbettery, they are to proceed to enquire touching the Grace of God in him, and whether he be of ſuch Holineſs of Life as is requiſite in a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I think ſeeing thoſe Gentlemen profeſs ſo great a regard to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have adopted her <hi>Directory</hi> in this, as well as other Points, they ſhould have forbore comparing her with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Account of enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mens ſecret States, or as our excellent <hi>Directory</hi> better expreſſes it, <hi>touching the Grace of God that is in them,</hi> invidiouſly terming it <hi>ſetting up a Court of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> hereby alluding to the Spaniſh Inquiſition: It's a pitty that theſe Men don't endeavour to be better acquainted with their profeſs'd Principles! Its ſtrange that they will neither act according to themſelves, or ſuffer us to do ſo without Reproach? Why are they ſo fond of appropriating the Presbyterian Name to themſelves, While they take ſo much Pains to confute Presbyterian Principles? They would act
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005297_0100_1016F678BA4E0680"/>
a more conſiſtent Part, if they either renounc'd their Practice or Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Their oppoſing all enquiries into Mens ſecret State, as they term it, gives Reaſon to ſuſpect their want of experimental Religion, as well as unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the miniſterial Work! Thoſe who have Chriſtian Experience, are ſo far from thinking that the relating thereof is like a Spaniſh Engine of torture, that they take gaeat Pleaſure, with the Pſalmiſt of old, in telling to thoſe that fear God, what the Lord has done for their Souls; and in rendering a Reaſon of the Hope that is within them, to every one that asketh a Queſtion —What a ſuperficial ſort of Miniſters muſt thoſe be who oppoſe all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enquiries into the State of their Flock? for without <hi>this,</hi> how can they ſpeak ſuitably in a particular Manner, to the various Caſes of their Hearers? For Miniſters to try to convince or comfort Perſons in their private Diſcourſe, before an Enquiry into their State, is like a Phyſician's giving Doſes of Phyſick at random, without enquiring into the Nature of the Diſeaſe that the Patient labours under. Whether ſuch a Practice dosn't tend to kill rather than cure People, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add at preſent, to what has been ſaid under this Head, this Sentece from my <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon, which I think is juſt, tho' ſome, for their own Ends, deſpiſe it, namely, "That Thieves flee "a Search, leaſt their ſtolen Goods ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. <hi>See John</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>And this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that Light is come into the World and Men loved Darkneſs rather then Light, becauſe their Deeds were Evil; for every one that doeth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leaſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that loveth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made Manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi>

            <p>I haſten to the 7th Inſtance of pretended Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, p. 18. which is borrow'd from Moravian Sermon p. 66. <q>Do any eſteem this new upſtart

            <p>
               <q>Some of the Heads of that Party have ſpoken reproachfully at <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant reformed Churches. One of them, in my hearing compar'd them to <hi>Babel:</hi> Is this Humility to imagine themſelves more advanced in Grace, then all the World beſides?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſuppos'd oppoſite Inſtance, is taken from the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon p. 11. 12. where he ſays, <q>I condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as ſwarms of Locuſts, crowds of Phariſees, that have as covetouſly as cruelly crept into the Miniſtry, in this adulterous Generation; who as nearly reſemble the Character given of the old Phariſees, as one Crows Egg does another.</q>

            <p>Again p. 9. <q>the Bulk of her ſpiritual Guides, are ſtone Blind and ſtone Dead.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This reproachful Cenſure of the Body of the Clergy of the <hi>Proteſtant reformed Churches,</hi> is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed by Mr. <hi>Ts</hi> reply to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Propoſal for an Accommodation in Behalf of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and adherents, ſays he, <q>We are informed, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is in a very declining, degenerate State, many of her Members corrupt in Principles, and more void of the Power of Religion; as alſo that the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> (I mean the Presbyterian) is notoriouſly corrupted. They ſeem to be, as far as we hear, ſunk into a deep and dreadful Security.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We are informed that the Presbyterians in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> have generally but little of the Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among them; and that ſeveral of them are corrupted with groſs and damnable Errors. And by the beſt Information we can get, a dead For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality generally prevails too much in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and many other Places of <hi>New-England.</hi> Indeed we are of Opinion that the Majority of Church-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, almoſt every where, are dead For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts,

if they have got that length; and therefore we incline to make no more Application to Men in the Affair aforeſaid.</q>

That <hi>Charity</hi> which inclines to Mildneſs, Candour and Courteſe in Speech and Behaviour, it <hi>behaveth itſelf not unſeemly.</hi> That <hi>Charity</hi> which prefers a publick Good to a private Intereſt, <hi>it ſeeketh not her own Things.</hi> And <hi>that Charity</hi> that inclines thoſe that poſſeſs it to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, <hi>it vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up. Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thyſelf?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Well we have had a long Story, but where is the Contradiction? Why I have faulted the <hi>Moravians</hi> for their undervaluing all but themſelves, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproachfully of all the Proteſtant reformed Churches. And this our Author labours to make me Guilty of, by muſtering up again the thread bare Story of Names, which has been before conſidered;
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005297_0103_1016F64AF518ED10"/>
but what a poor Proof is this? Both the Paſſages cited do not reſpect the ſame thing, and therefore there cannot be a Contradiction in them. The one reſpects the Proteſtant reformed Churches in particular; and the other the unconverted Clergy in General, of all forts of Chriſtian Societies. If our Author believes that the Clergy is the Church, as it wou'd ſeem he does, by pretending a Contradiction in thoſe Paſſages, then he is a <hi>Papiſt</hi> (at leaſt in that Point) but if he thinks that the unconverted Clergy of all the Churches in general, are the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in particular, (which is neceſſary to make out the Charge againſt me) then he has loſt <hi>Common Senſe:</hi> And if he thinks that the Body of the Clergy of all Denominations are Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, (as it would ſeem by his charging directly upon the Body of the Clergy, thoſe Epithets which I charg'd directly upon the Unconverted, and but indirectly and hypothetically upon the Body of the Clergy of this Generation) I ſay, if the Caſe be ſo, the <hi>Examiner</hi> does himſelf what he finds fault with in me.</p>
            <p>But be that as it will, our Author repreſents my Mind unfairly, while he trys to make his Reader believe that I Charge the aforeſaid Characters upon the Body of the Clergy directly, and carefully leaves out the Word <hi>Unconverted</hi> (as it would ſeem) leaſt the Reader ſhould form a juſt Notion of my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</p>
            <p>And when our Author mentions ſome part of my reply to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi>'s Propoſals, he art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turns what I had ſaid in the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon againſt unconverted Miniſters of every Church in general, to the Body of the Clergy of the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches in particular, which tends to heighten the Charge, without a juſt Ground, againſt that Sermon, as if I had intended in it, only the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Miniſters of the reformed Churches, ſtrictly ſo called, which is really falſe. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Sermon are indefinite and general,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005297_0104_1016F64DAD087528"/>
and therefore cannot, without a force upon them, be reſtricted, as our Author ſuggeſts. I mention in the Sermon the Badges of different Kinds of Clergymen, namely, not only Bands and Black Coats, but Gowns, (<hi>See p.</hi> 18.) which ſhows that I had in View the Clergy of different Churches in the Compoſure of it.</p>
            <p>Well and what do I ſay in the aforeſaid Reply, but relate a credible Account, which we have had of the declinging State of Religion in general, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Presbyterians in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>New-England;</hi> and was not the Relation true at that Time? If not, let the <hi>Examiner</hi> favour us with a juſter Account of the Matter, and we ſhall be obliged to him. I ſhould be exceeding glad to be miſtaken on that ſide of the Queſtion. I ſay what is there in the reply, but the aforeſaid Relation, excepting that Paſſage of <hi>the Majority of the Church Judicatory's being dead Formaliſts,</hi> &amp;c. But it ſhould be obſerved, that the following qualifying and limiting Terms are added to it, namely, that it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a Matter of abſolute Certainly, but of Opinion only; and that the Words <hi>almoſt every where,</hi> are added thereto. Our mentioning this, after the aforeſaid Relation of what we had been informed of, ſhews that it was bottom'd thereupon, in ſome Meaſure.</p>
            <p>Our Author next adds, ſeveral Lines of his own in the middle of the Paragraph he cites from me, which has a tendency to marr my meaning. But what is it that he is ſo eager to utter, why this ſilly Satyr, namely, <q>
                  <hi>Where then is Wiſdom and the Power of Godlineſs to be found?</hi> Why truly among the little <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Party, that little Flock. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Proteſtants are but dead Formaliſts, at beſt, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why does the <hi>Examiner,</hi> without any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, inſinuate, that I confine <hi>Wiſdom and the Power of Godlineſs</hi> to my ſelf and Brethren, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ourſelves to other <hi>faithful</hi> Miniſters of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005297_0105_1016F650776D4520"/>
Churches, when there is not a Word of this Tendency in all our writings; God forbid, that we ſhould entertain ſuch an unreaſonable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Opinion of ourſelves; no we deſire, as we have great Reaſon, to prefer others before our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Love, and do judge of ourſelves, (and are willing to be tho't ſo of others) <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will the Foundation our Author goes upon in the Inſinuation aforeſaid, bear the Streſs he lays upon it. What if we had ſaid, <hi>That the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Proteſtants are but dead Formaliſts at beſt.</hi> Will nor the Scripture ſupport ſuch an Aſſertion, while they inform us, That <hi>many are call'd and few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> That <hi>Strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and that few find it,</hi> That <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able.</hi> And dons't the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Sower give farther Light and Force to this Argument? For therein, but one in four received the Word aright. Doſn't the <hi>Examiners</hi> offering the aforeſaid particular, as an Objection againſt us, betray groſs Ignorance of the Scriptures, and look like an utter unacquaintedneſs with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Religion?</p>
            <p>Our Author adds another Paragraph of his own to this Effect. <q>Where is Mr. <hi>Tennent's</hi> Charity to himſelf and his Party ſhewn here? and this is the Gentleman, that has the Face to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Charity to others in his 5th Sermon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſee no uncharitableneſs in aſſerting that to be the Cauſe of God, which we were then and are ſtill endeavouring to promote; namely, <hi>experimental and practical Religion,</hi> and in a reſolute oppoſing of two Acts made by a Majority of the Synod, which we were and are ſtill perſwaded had a Tendency to obſtruct the ſame, tho' doubtleſs they appeared to others of our Brethren (ſome of whom we believe are heartily engag'd in promoting experimental Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) in another Light. Theſe Acts which I have mentioned in my Remarks upon their proteſt, gave
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005297_0106_1016F6532F7713C8"/>
riſe to the uneaſineſſes which ſubſiſt among us. Our reaſonings againſt which, mention'd in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Remarks, our oppoſers have not tho't proper yet to make any particular reply to.</p>
            <p>I ſtill approve of the Deſcription of <hi>Charity,</hi> which our Author cites from my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon: And am perſwaded that I have acted according to it, in ſetting forth the Danger of an ungodly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; but this I have ſpoke upon before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not inſiſt here.</p>
            <p>Only I muſt beg leave to ask our Author, who profeſſes ſo much Charity, how he can reconcile therewith his manifold unjuſt dealing with me, and his patronizing the ungodly Miniſtry, his grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and taking it ill that they ſhould have their juſt Characters? while in the mean Time he favours heretical <hi>Moravians,</hi> and other Shiſmaticks this way, and adopts their invidious Character of me, viz. <q>That I appear in my <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> among the Body of the Clergy of this Generation.</q>— While in the mean Time he ſlights and oppoſes thoſe pious Miniſters in general, who have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in promoting the late Reformation. To oppoſe and detect ungodly Miniſters, does it not look more like the Practice of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Micajah,</hi> then of <hi>Iſhmael?</hi> And now Sir, I beg you wont take it amiſs, if in the Concluſion of this Paragraph, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn your Queſtion, <hi>thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now conſidered our Authors Charges as to pretended Inconſiſtencies in Doctine, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine his Compariſon of the Converſion, and after Experiencies ſaid to be propogated by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party; and this our Author is pleaſed to introduce, with an Apoligy for Count <hi>Zinzendorff</hi> and Mr. <hi>Betener's</hi> contradicting of themſelves, p. 20. He asks, <q>Why I deny to thoſe Moravian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, the Liberty I take to my ſelf to ſay and unſay Things as it liketh me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="unknown:005297_0107_1016F655E8279250"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have never taken ſuch a Liberty, and I hope never ſhall, and as our Author has not nor cannot prove his malignant Charge, it is ſlanderous cruel Calumny, which may God of his infinite Mercy forgive.</p>
            <p>And now we come to our Authors Charge, p. 21. which is as follows, quoted from <hi>p.</hi> 103 of the <hi>Apendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The <hi>Converſion</hi> of the moſt of them, is very ſlighty, done in a Moment; have we not reaſon to fear their Converſion is but a ſtrong flight of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, a Satanical Deluſion?</p>
               <p>And we have more reaſon for the Fear afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, when we conſider how eaſie they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, after their ſuppoſed Converſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Fears,</hi> without <hi>complaints of Sin, &amp;c.</hi> did not the Seed ſown on the ſtony Ground, <hi>ſpring up quickly;</hi> but on the Contrary, did not the good Ground <hi>bring forth fruit with Patience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we will believe the Scriptures, does not their Converſion and after Experiencies, look like <hi>Preſumption</hi> and <hi>Deluſion?</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>In the oppoſite Collumn are theſe Words, <q>If we are to judge of the <hi>unſoundneſs</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> by the Suddainneſs thereof, have we not as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, that the <hi>Converſion</hi> of many among the <hi>N. Brunſwick</hi> Party, is a ſtrong flight of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a Satanical Deluſion?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Even ſuch is the eaſy, quiet, happy State of Multitudes of the late Converts, without fear, without Complaints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why then ſhould the State of the one, be better and ſafer then that of the other?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is invidious in our Author ſtill to keep up the contemptuous title Page over the Heads of his Collumns; while in the mean Time he puts his own Words in one of them, and not mine; but to paſs this.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to obſerve that our Author is very partial and defective in his Repreſentation of the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005297_0108_1016F657C82F0C08"/>
Reaſons of my Fears, reſpecting the <hi>Moravian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, he picks up a piece of a Sentence here and there, and leaves out the chief Part; to make this appear I will cite the whole Paragraphs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to, and they are theſe.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>As to their Converſion and after Experiencies, the Converſion of the moſt of them (if we credit the <hi>Count's</hi> Aſſertion, and we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that he knows pretty well the State of his own Sect) is very ſlighty, its without any Preparatory Law Work, done in a Moment. If they have received the aforeſaid Doctrines, have we not Reaſon to fear that their Converſion is but a ſtrong flight of Imagination, or a Satanical Deluſion. And we have the more Reaſon for the Fear aforeſaid, when we conſider how <hi>Eaſy</hi> they are generally after their ſuppos'd Converſion, without Fears, without Complaints of Sin, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Spiritual War, Stangers to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their own Hearts, always in one ſort of Frame, or as it were put to Sleep and happy, as the <hi>Count</hi> expreſſes it. did not the Seed ſown on the Stony Ground <hi>ſpring up quickly?</hi> but on the Contrary, did not the good Ground <hi>bring forth Fruit with Patience?</hi> did not the poor Man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>bewail his unbelief?</hi> And are we not commanded <hi>to fight the Fight of Faith?</hi> If we will believe the Scriptures, does not their Converſion and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences look like <hi>Preſumption</hi> and <hi>Deluſion?</hi> Their Ignorance about the Nature of a true and ſaving Faith, adds awful weight to what has been now obſerv'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Reader may eaſily perceive, that what I have ſaid reſpecting the Suddainneſs of their Con-Converſion, is join'd in the ſame Sentence with their want of a Preparatory law Work, upon which the principle Streſs is laid.—</p>
            <p>Beſides what I have ſaid of their <hi>Eaſe</hi> after <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> is join'd with the Account of their being Strangers to the ſpiritual War, and the Knowledge
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005297_0109_1016F65A7A82D608"/>
of their own Hearts; my Fears reſpecting their Converſion, are likewiſe bottom'd upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their receiving or embracing the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Doctrines contain'd in the Apendix, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their aſſerting <hi>hiſtorical Faith to be ſaving,</hi> and their rejecting of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doſn't our Author know in his Conſcience, that theſe things can't be juſtly charg'd upon us, God knoweth that we abhor them. What a wicked and ſhameleſs Part does the <hi>Examiner</hi> then Act, in his partial deceitful Application? And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable is his Query from thence, viz. <hi>Why then ſhould the State of the one be better and ſafer than the other?</hi> Has our Author then no regard to the precious Doctrines of Chriſtianity which the <hi>Moravians</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Has he no reſpect for the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and a <hi>preparative</hi> Work of it?</p>
            <p>As to what our Author ſays concerning Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the late Converts, being in an eaſie, quiet and happy State without Fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That ſome are deceiv'd reſpecting their State towards God, who have been under good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions during the late revival of Religion in this Land, I doubt not. This is but a uſual Event, and therefore no way diſparages God's Work, <hi>Preſumption</hi> flows from the Sophiſtry of Satan, who blinds the Eyes of thoſe that believe not, and from the <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Mens Hearts, which are <hi>deceitful and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked.</hi> It cannot be therefore charg'd upon Miniſters, except they preach Doctrines that tend thereto; which we defy the <hi>Examiner</hi> to prove upon us. If our Doctrines had been of a <hi>preſumptious</hi> Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is it probable that ſo many Thouſands would have been alarmed by them, out of their Security? And therefore the <hi>Examiner</hi> is guilty of a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſehood, when he ſays, p. 21. That ſuch a <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Experiencies</hi> as he deſcribes, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogated by me and my Party. Whereas the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty knows and many of his People, among whom we have labour'd, that it has been our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:005297_0110_1016F65F95FBD2A8"/>
endeavour to ſap the Foundations of a Falſe hope.</p>
            <p>Our Author muſt excuſe me if I can't ſo eaſily credit his Aſſertion, as to the multitudes of the late <hi>Converts being without Fear,</hi> &amp;c. he has ſo often fail'd in his Charges againſt me, that I can't but Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Veracity, eſpecially when he is prejudiced, as he certainly is againſt the late revival of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſee p. 24. What good do the <hi>Itenerants</hi> do by "their Traveling, unleſs it be to ſow Tares to "corrupt and devide religious People?</p>
            <p>Here the Examiner abſolutely denys, that any good was done by <hi>Itinerary preachers.</hi> And yet he owns p. 27. That ſome were brought under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Work of the Law by my Miniſtry (who am doubtleſs intended us one of them) in theſe Words, <q>It notioious that he himſelf not only ſmil'd but laugh'd heartily over his Converts, while they were under a preparatory Work of the Law.</q> Now the <hi>Examiner</hi> muſt either acknowledge that it is doing no good to bring (inſtrumentaly) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners under a preparatory Work of the Law, or confeſs his Contradiction. Beſides a Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the aforeſaid paſſage is imply'd, in his Words that I am now conſidering: For while he ſays, That <hi>Multitudes of the late Converts are without Fear,</hi> this plainly ſuppoſes that ſome of them are not. And ſo that there has been ſome good done by the <hi>Itinerary</hi> Preachers, who have been us'd as Principle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in promoting the late Converſions. And indeed this, the <hi>Examiner</hi> in ſome ſort confeſſes in relation to my ſelf, while he calls me <hi>a Principal mover and promoter of the paſſionate Religion now prevailing among ſo many, p.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>It is not probable that our Author wou'd converſe with ſo many of the late Converts as he talks of, conſidering his preſent Prejudice, and therefore his knowledge muſt come by the Information of others, who its like were as much prejudiced as himſelf. I belive I have had an opportunity of converſing
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005297_0111_1016F6611CB30FA8"/>
with more of them then our Author, by Reaſon of my Travels. And I muſt declare to the Glory of divine Grace, that I have met with Multitudes, who in the Judgment of a Scriptural and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charity, had the plain Signatures of a ſpecial Work of God upon their Souls.</p>
            <p>The principal Members of the Presbytery of <hi>New-York,</hi> have the laſt Year in their Proteſt, given their ſolemn ſufferage to the reality of the late revival of Religion in this Land, and this Year both our <hi>Presbyteries</hi> viz. of <hi>New-Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> have given a unanimous Declaration in behalf of God's Work, which has been ſweetly ſpreading among us lately. Bleſſed be <hi>Jehovah</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>And now let us proceed to our Authors, 22d. p. and here he obſerves that I ſay in <hi>p.</hi> 8. of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon thus. <q>What is the <hi>Moravian</hi> Faith, but a ſorry muſhroom, of a nights growth unworthy of the name of Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the oppoſite Collumn to which the <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> inſerts theſe Words of his own. <q>Yea and all ſuch like ſuddain Converſions, are equally Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and Deluſive, but as a ſorry muſhroom of a Nights Growth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here let the reader obſerve, that the <hi>Examiner</hi> wrongs me in not repreſenting my true Senſe and Meaning. He only cites a ſhort Concluſion, which I drew from certain Premiſes, in which my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was explain'd without mentioning the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes themſelves, <hi>E. G.</hi> He has (as it ſeems) purpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left out the following Lines, which do immediately go before what he related, and fully ſhew my meaning, namely, <q>What then can we reaſonably ſuppoſe that Faith to be, which has no humbling Preparatives, no after Conflicts and Troubles, and conſiſt not in a receiving of CHRIST, and reſting upon him for Salvation?</q> And then follow the Words he has cited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:005297_0112_1016F66422688478"/>The reader may eaſily ſee, how partial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt his compariſon is, and therefore Inconcluſive, whatever ſuddain Converſions there be, attended with the aforeſaid Characters; we reject them and believe them to be but <hi>ſorry Muſhrooms;</hi> but we dare not reject <hi>Converſions</hi> meerly becauſe of their Suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if theſe Perſons have had humbling Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, have been enabled to receive CHRIST, and reſt upon him for Salvation; have after conflicts, and a general free bent of Heart, and Practice Godward and Heavenward.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> we have the fulleſt Evidence, that the Nature of ſuch Things can admitt of, is the Caſe of many who have been, during the late glorious revival of Religion, brought from a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a State of Grace in this Land. We dare not preſume to bound Omnipotence, or ſet limits to the Operations of an infinitely ſovereign God, in his bringing fallen Creatures to an intereſt in his Love. His Spirit blows when and where he liſteth.</p>
            <p>And indeed I can't but think the <hi>Examiner</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely bold in doing ſo, in thoſe Lines of his which I but juſt now mentioned. At this rate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the moſt of the <hi>Converſions</hi> in the Apoſtolick Times, muſt be condemned as <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> for was not the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>three Thouſand</hi> as well as of <hi>Paul, Zacheus</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſuddain?</p>
            <p>And what tho' ſuddain <hi>Converſions</hi> be followed with Raptures, if they have the Antecedents, Concom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants and Effects, before mentioned, they ſhould not be rejected on the Account of them. For are we not told, That <hi>the Kingdom of God conſiſts in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> And didn't ſome in the primitive Times receive the Word with <hi>Joy,</hi> yea <hi>rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> and what can be greater than this?</p>
            <p>If Perſons after much ſorrow and uneaſineſs, upon their meeting with ſome unexpected and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant temporal Good, have been ſo overcome with

Joy and Rapture, that they have fainted away; is it any wonder that divine Things ſhou'd affect as much, which are of infinitely greater Weight and Conſequence, when they are beheld by that <hi>Faith which is the Subſtance of Things not ſeen, and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things hoped for.</hi> Certainly the greater Diſtreſs Perſons are in before they receive Comfort, thro' a ſight of God's Juſtice and Holineſs, as well as of their own Vileneſs, together with the Fears of impending Vengeance, the more in Proportion they are wont to be affected with a Senſe of pardoning Mercy.</p>
            <p>I remember to have heard in the famous Story of <hi>Maſſianello</hi> the <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> that during his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, ſome poor Man that had received certain valuable temporal Preſents, was ſo tranſported there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that he cry'd out frequently in the open Street, before a great Concourſe of People, <hi>all this is mine, all this is mine.</hi> And when ſome Body preſent deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be ſtill, telling him that ſuch behaviour was unſeemly, he reply'd, <hi>That he needn't wonder that he cry'd out ſo, but rather that he didn't take up Stones and throw at him</hi> He was ſo mad for Joy.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Archimedes</hi> when he had found out ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Demonſtration, was ſo tranſported with it, that he cry'd out, <hi>Eureca, Eureca, I have found, I have found.</hi> Is it ſtrange that ſome of ſofter and ſtronger Paſſions, who after a view of their forlorn State, upon finding the <hi>Pearl of great Price;</hi> ſhould be ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Senſe of God's imerited and immenſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as that they coud'nt refrain crying out with the Spouſe in the Song of Songs. <hi>I have found him whom my Soul loveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of one who was condemn'd to be hang'd for ſome notorious Crime, in conſequence of which after Impriſonment, he was carried to the Gallows; but behold a Pardon being brought to him, while he was within view of the awful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Execution, overcame him with ſuch an exceſs of joy, as made him expire in Death.

What I have ſaid elſewhere concerning the Souls near union to the Body, and its conſequent Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it, is applicable here.</p>
            <p>And now before I proceed farther, I muſt juſt obſerve, that the <hi>Examiner</hi> has wrong'd me in the Application aforeſaid, by inſinuating that I ſpoke againſt <hi>ſuddain Converſions,</hi> or <hi>joyous Raptures</hi> altogether, whereas I only ſpoke againſt ſuch, as had not ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antecedents, Concommitants and Effects, as was before obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>He has likewiſe offended againſt the Generation of God's Children, by condemning all of them that have been converted ſuddainly. Let the <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> ſeriouſly conſider the following Place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Matt. 18.6. <hi>He that offends one of thoſe little ones who believe in me, it were better for him that a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone was hung about his Neck and he caſt into the midſt of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author in his next Paragraph mentions what I ſay p. 66. of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon.— <q>Thus do any eſteem this new upſtart <hi>Moravian</hi> Sect, becauſe they ſay they have Communion with God, and in Conſequence hereof Joy and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I anſwer when we conſider the <hi>Antinornian</hi> Principles they hold concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> as well as the proud Effects of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Good Frames,</hi> and that under a Mask of <hi>Humility,</hi> &amp;c. we have good Reaſon to ſuſpect their <hi>Communion</hi> to be but a Deluſion of the grand Enemy, and their <hi>Joys</hi> to be the <hi>Joys</hi> of Time Believers, and ſtony Ground Hearers. True <hi>Communion</hi> with God doth certainly <hi>humble</hi> the Soul, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5.6. It's no new Thing for <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> to talk of Joys and Comforts but they are a falſe cure to all Soul Troubles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Collumn he mentions the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words of his own, viz. <q>every reader of common Obſervation, will find the Tranſition very eaſy, from the <hi>Moravians</hi> to many of the Converts now a Days, who talk boldly of their high
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005297_0115_1016F66D30A579D8"/>
Joys and full Aſſurances, under a mask of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and at the ſame Time <hi>truſting in themſelves, that they are Righteous and deſpiſing others.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Let them not be high minded but fear,</hi> leaſt their Communion be but a Deluſion, and their Joys the Joys of ſtony Ground Hearers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By comparing thoſe Paragraphs, every Eye may ſee the <hi>Examiners</hi> Partiality, in applying what I have ſaid concerning the Joys of the <hi>Maravians,</hi> to many of the late Converts, for in his Compariſon, he omits one of the principle Reaſons of my ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the <hi>Moravian</hi> Joys, namely their <hi>Antinomian</hi> Principles, concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mentions proud Effects, namely <hi>truſting in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and deſpiſing others,</hi> and if the Caſe be truly and habitually ſo with any, it is an awful ſign of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
            <p>But perhaps our Author, has term'd a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rejoycing in the Aſſurance of God's Love, a modeſt and ſeaſonable diſcourſing thereof to others, together with a faithful Endeavour to detect and awaken ſecure Hypocrits, and dry Formaliſts, <hi>a talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boldly of their high Joys, and truſting in themſelves and deſpiſing of others,</hi> becauſe of his ſtrong Prejudice and repeated Partiality. In the mean Time I woudn't be underſtood to ſignify, as if I believ'd that all who recond themſelves Converted, or were eſteem'd ſo by others, during the late revival of Religion were really ſo: No not at all, neither is this any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Work of God. For thus it was in the Apoſtolick Times.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, what I wou'd offer upon this Head of <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> I muſt obſerve that the <hi>Examiner</hi> is moſt unjuſt in aſſerting in the <hi>Title</hi> thereof, that I and thoſe whom he calls my Party, propogate ſuch a manner of <hi>Converſion</hi> and after <hi>Experience,</hi> as he relates in the oppoſite Collumn to my Words. I challenge him to prove his <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> Charge, wherein have I or any that join with me propogated a <hi>Converſion</hi> conſiſting
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005297_0116_1016F66EB72BD720"/>
in <hi>Imagination</hi> or <hi>Satanical Deluſion,</hi> or ſuch an <hi>Eaſie</hi> State after Converſion, as is <hi>without fear, without Complaints,</hi> or a <hi>Muſhroom Faith, falſe Joy, ſpiritual Pride,</hi> and <hi>ſelf Confidence.</hi> Theſe very Sermons which the <hi>Examiner</hi> labours to caſt dirt upon, (conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially) evidence the Contrary, as well as all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons I have publiſh'd to the World, particularly that Book entitled <hi>the Preſumer detected,</hi> which was directly calculated to unhinge <hi>deluſive Hopes</hi> and <hi>Joys.</hi> Neither is there one of my Reverend Brethren that can be juſtly charg'd with thoſe Things, ſome of them have prov'd the Contrary by their printed Diſcourſes, and all that know the reſt, know the Charges againſt them to be falſe. What if ſome be deceived under our Preaching, ſeeing that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines we preach and our diſtinct manner of handling them, has no Tendency that Way, but the very contrary; our Author can no more juſtly charge us herewith then the Apoſtles, with all the <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Hopes</hi> of their Hearers. Why does our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor unjuſtly charge upon us, the Crimes of the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>ungodly,</hi> who are under his Influence, while we deteſt them in our Hearts, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to detect and oppoſe them by our Speech and Practice.</p>
            <p>And now we are prepar'd to conſider another part of the <hi>Examiners</hi> Performance, which he entitles thus, <hi>Mr.</hi> T's <hi>Reflections on the Spirit of the</hi> Moravians, <hi>compared with his own Spirit and of his Adherents.</hi>

            <p>The Paſſages of mine which he cites, are <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, Moravian</hi> Sermon, p. 104. the Words are theſe, <q>Are not the <hi>Moravians,</hi> many of them, <hi>uncharitable</hi> and <hi>diviſive</hi> in their Speech and Practice, and that under a pretext of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Catholiciſm.</hi> Witneſs Mr. SPANGENBERG'S comparing the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches</hi> to a <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

Witneſs his Sermon at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which is as full of <hi>uncharitable</hi> and <hi>diviſive</hi> Principles and Speeches, as a Crows Egg is full of Meat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Witneſs alſo Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and many of our late Zealots, Miniſters and others, who have been ready to cenſure and ſeparate from all that differ'd in Sentiment from them, but at the ſame Time receiving into their Fellowſhip, and with Charity eno', every one that pretended to be of their Way, pronouncing them true <hi>Converts</hi> upon little Examination, and proof of a Work of Grace in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here let the reader note, that what the <hi>Examiner</hi> objects, reſpecting (pretended) <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> and <hi>dividing Principles</hi> in the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon, has been before largely conſidered, and therefore I ſhall not now reſume what has been ſaid. But ſuppoſing I had been under ſome miſtakes in that Sermon, I ſee no Juſtice in his charging them upon my Brethren, except he proves their Conſent thereto which he has not ſo much as attempted.</p>
            <p>But in Anſwer to his next Charge againſt me, namely a <hi>readineſs to cenſure and ſeparate, from all that differed from me in Sentiment.</hi> I ſhall mention a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of our Apology offer'd to the Conſideration of the Synod, ſome Conſiderable Time before the Rupture happened, which runs thus. <q>To conclude we profeſs a hearty Charity for thoſe Gentlemen who are on the other Side of the Queſtion in this Debate, doubtleſs Things appear to them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light, we have only in the Courſe of our Reaſonings, labour'd to expoſe the Abſurdity of an Opinion which we think prejudicial to the Intereſts of the Saviours Kingdom, and if we are herein miſtaken, we are willing to be convinced by Scripture and Reaſon. But whether we get Conviction or not by our Brethrens Arguments
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005297_0118_1016F677343BE320"/>
we believe that <hi>the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace</hi> may be preſerved, notwithſtanding a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Sentiment in leſſer Things, if mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Councils be followed, and that mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance be allowed, which the Goſpel of CHRIST requires.</q> See remarks upon a <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, pag.</hi> 68. The aforeſaid Apology was ſign'd by divers Miniſters of our Number. The ſame Thing in Subſtance I have likewiſe expreſs'd in the 19 p. of the Remarks aforeſaid, thus: But <q>tho' we did Proteſt againſt what we apprehended (after deliberate enquirys) to be wrong in our Brethrens Conduct, a practice not unuſual in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorys of our Denomination, yet we were far from carrying Matters to the preſent Criſis, which our Bretheren have done by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, namely, to exclude our diſſenting Brethren, from Communion upon that Account.</q> And p. 9. are theſe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Truth is, tho' we differed in Sentiments from our Brethren, in reſpect of ſome Acts or Cannons they had made, yet we deſigned no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from them upon that Account, we tho't that mutual Forbearance would be the beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the Caſe aforeſaid. As we deſired liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of acting according to our Conſciences, in the controverted Affair, ſo we were far from a deſire of impoſing our Judgment upon our Brethren, or imagining that there was a neceſſity of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the Account of the aforeſaid diverſity of Sentiment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now what regard can it be reſonably ſuppos'd the <hi>Examiner</hi> has either to <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> when he aſſerts an abſolute <hi>Falſehood,</hi> while he had our ſolemn publick mutual Declaration in his Hands to convince him thereof.</p>
            <p>And here let me farther obſerve, that in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the aforeſaid Declaration, we kept Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Communion with them, until they after an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, unpreſidented and unjuſt Manner, violently
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:005297_0119_1016BA46B7966478"/>
and abruptly broke communion with us by a Proteſt without allowing us Liberty to ſpeak in our own Defence, before the Proteſt was ſigned, tho' it was again and again deſired. See now Mr. <hi>Examiner</hi> your partiality in favouring ſuch <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Innocent</hi> with their Crimes, and be at laſt aſhamed of your unaccountable Conduct.</p>
            <p>If ſome who have favour'd the late Reformation in <hi>New-England,</hi> have been ting'd with a ſeparating Spirit, or Diſpoſition to abandon abruptly the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of any that were ſound in Principle, blameleſs in Practice, and favourers of God's Work, as it has been reported, it deſerves Cenſure, and calls aloud for Lamentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But why do you Sir impute their Faults to me? when you know in your Conſcience, that I have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ſuch Separations there, as appears by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which you ſo much contemn, (as aforeſaid) and my Letter to the Rev. Mr. JONATHAN DICKINSON, and the other which was wrote to explain it more fully (which you Cenſure) Pray Sir conſider whether you are not very inconſiſtent with yourſelf in this Point, inaſmuch as while you Cenſure me, without Foundation, as being of a <hi>diviſive Spirit,</hi> you try by many Methods to caſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon my <hi>Eſſays</hi> againſt it, and favour thoſe that are guilty of it?</p>
            <p>As to what you ſay in the latter Part of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, of <hi>my receiving into Fellowſhip, with</hi> Charity <hi>enough, every one that pretend to be of our way, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them true</hi> Converts <hi>upon little Examination and Proof of a Work of Grace in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would obſerve that you Contradict yourſelf in two particulars, 1ſt In blaming me for exceſſive Charity; when in divers other Places in your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, you Blame me for the Contrary, <hi>See p.</hi> 13. And 2d. In Blaming me for Examining too little concerning <hi>a Work of Grace</hi> in Perſons; while you Blame me elſewhere, <hi>viz. pag</hi> 17. for attempting to do any ſuch Thing at all; your Words are, <hi>Who
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005297_0120_1016F67A46389720"/>
made thee a Judge of Mens inward Experience and ſecret State.</hi> After which you adopt the <hi>Queriſts</hi> Words, who compare it to the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition.</hi>—But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ſay in Anſwer to the firſt Particular, that it was only a <hi>Party Charity</hi> you faulted me for, and charg'd me with. To which I reply, that the Accuſation is falſe. My Soul abhors the ſordid Meaneſleſs and contracted Views of <hi>Biggotry</hi> and <hi>Party Zeal!</hi> I have a Witneſs in Heaven and many upon Earth, that my chief Deſire and Labours have been (ſince Almighty God has of his free Mercy given me the ſaving Knowledge of himſelf) to promote <hi>vital Religion,</hi> and not any Party whatſoever. And I have likewiſe great Reaſon to believe that this is the Temper and Diſpoſition of all the Miniſters that join with me in theſe Parts. There is one indeed, who is I hope a pious Man, Mr. ALEXANDER CRAIGHEAD, by Name, who was formerly in a State of Union with us, but having more Zeal and Poſitiveneſs than Knowledge and Judgment, has Schiſmatically broken Communion with us, and adopt'd the rigid <hi>Cameronian</hi> Scheme. He is indeed ringed with an <hi>uncharitable</hi> and <hi>party</hi> Spirit, to the prejudice of real Religion in ſome Places this Way May the Almighty forgive him and rectify his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His late and preſent cenſorious Temper and diviſive Conduct, we utterly deteſt and diſclaim.</p>
            <p>I think the Rev. Mr. <hi>WHITEFIELD</hi>'s Obſervation, in one of his Letters concerning the <hi>Covenanting Scheme,</hi> is very juſt and true, viz. <hi>That it is two narrow a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build any great Superſtructure upon.</hi> And on the contrary I cannot but highly approve of the catholick, generous and noble Sentiments of the very Rev. Dr. BATES and Mr. HOW, who obſerve a juſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between two dangerous Extremes of a <hi>rigorous Severity</hi> upon the one Hand, and a <hi>perilous Laxneſs</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>And I am likewiſe far from approving of divers Particulars which are Charged upon Mr. DAVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORT'S Conduct; one of which is, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005297_0121_1016F67D548E6F98"/>
goes, That after he has examined Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the State of their Souls, he has publickly in the open Congregation declared his Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bad State, and exhorted their Hearers to leave them. My Abhorrence of this Practice I have expreſs'd in a Letter to Mr. DICKINSON, which has been made Publick, to which I refer the Reader. And the late Story about Burning divers valuable Books at <hi>New London</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exceeding Scandalous and Ridiculous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be deteſted by all Mankind (but I am glad that I can now, upon a certain Foundation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Publick, that Mr <hi>Davenport</hi> appears to be deeply ſenſible of his criminal Conduct in that Affair.)</p>
            <p>It is likely that Mr. DAVENPORT and Mr. CRAIGHEAD, by their imprudent Conduct, have been acceſſory to the creating and fomenting of Diviſions in ſeveral Parts of this Country, which is much to be lamented: And while I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, by the Regard I have to the Honour of God and intereſt of his Kingdom, to bear a publick Teſtimony againſt the exceptionable Conduct of theſe Miniſters before mentioned, in the mean Time I declare, that I cannot but love their Perſons, and believe that in the ſimplicity of their Hearts they have gone aſtray. I likewiſe acknowledge, to the Glory of God's Sovereign Grace, that I have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that both of them have been Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of doing remarkable Service to many Souls.</p>
            <p>But why does our <hi>Examiner</hi> unjuſtly Charge the Miſconduct of either of thoſe Gentlemen upon us, who have never encouraged it? But on the Contrary our Author muſt need know in his Conſcience, that I have expreſly oppos'd the Miſconduct of one of them, in my printed Sermons and Letters.</p>
            <p>The next Particular the <hi>Examiner</hi> mentions, is borrow'd from p. 65 of my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, which is thus expreſs'd, <q>How very different are the Fruits of their coming into the Country from the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005297_0122_1016F68058625328"/>
Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD's? His plain and pungent Preaching the Truths of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, united generally the Hearts of good Men thro' the Land. But the <hi>Moravians</hi> wherever they have any Influence divide the People of God, and ſet them a jangling. <hi>See p.</hi> 23. 24</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Collumn to which, the <hi>Examiner</hi> mentions theſe Words of his own, namely, <q>Has not the coming of the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> and their Succeſſors, into theſe Provinces <hi>divided the People of God, and ſet them a Jangling,</hi> as much as the Preregrination of the <hi>Moravians</hi> in <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> has done there?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But it ſeems Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath felt the bad Effects of their <hi>uncharitable intruſive Spirit</hi> near home, which makes him complain and flinch as much as his Neighbours, who felt the Weight of his rough Hands and heavy Fiſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Application of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Inſtance to Mr. <hi>WHITEFIELD</hi> and me, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and untrue which many Thouſands in <hi>N. England</hi> can witneſs: When Mr. <hi>WHITEFIELD</hi> and I left <hi>N. England</hi> there was no ſuch <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>janglings</hi> as have ſince happened, but on the contrary <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ſeem'd generally to obtain among the People of God.</p>
            <p>Here obſerve the Sophiſtical low Art of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in joining Mr. <hi>WHITEFIELD</hi> and me, with thoſe whom he calls our Succeſſors in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that ſo he might charge upon us the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct of ſome of them; which we deteſt.</p>
            <p>As to what the <hi>Examiner</hi> adds, reſpecting <q>my feeling the bad Effects of the <hi>Moravian</hi> unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and intruſive Spirit near home, and that that made me complain and flinch.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer that tho' I have ſeen bad Effects thereof upon ſome; yet thro' Mercy I have no Reaſon to <hi>flinch</hi> and <hi>complain,</hi> becauſe of any bad Effects of it upon the Society which I am related to. For not
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005297_0123_1016F68435CD54A8"/>
one of them has been carry'd away with the Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entirely that I know of.</p>
            <p>I am thro' Grace concious to my ſelf, what ever our Author has uncharitably and ungenerouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated to the Contrary, that no private view has influenced my Zeal againſt the <hi>Moravians,</hi> but a ſincere regard to the Truths and Power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which they are oppoſing and undermining; neither have any of my Neighbours juſt cauſe of complaining of <hi>my rough Hands and heavy Fiſts,</hi> (as you are pleas'd with much Complaiſance to word the Matter) in reſpect of <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> and <hi>Intruſion,</hi> as is ſuggeſted. I have not preach'd in any of their Places without Invitation, or condemned any of them without Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiner</hi> next cites my Words from <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Sermon p. 67. which are theſe, <q>Do any eſteem the <hi>Moravians</hi> becauſe they <hi>travel</hi> and <hi>take great</hi> Pains. I anſwer did not the Phariſees of old compaſs Sea and Land to make proſelytes and do not <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and many other <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> travel ſtill. But what good do the <hi>Moravians</hi> do by their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling unleſs it be good to <hi>ſow Tares,</hi> to corrupt and divide religious People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Column, we have the following words of the Examiner. <q>Exactly true; and pray, what good do the <hi>Itinerants</hi> do by their <hi>Traveling,</hi> unleſs it be <hi>good to ſow Tares,</hi> to corrupt and divide religious People?</q> After the aforeſaid Words our Author refers by an <hi>Aſteriſm</hi> to a Charge of our Opponents this Way, in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,</hi> p. 81. reſpecting the pretended dividing Principles and Practices of <hi>Itinerants;</hi> but in aſmuch as nothing is offered to ſupport the Charge but their Affirmation, I ſee no need of any farther reply at preſent, then what has been before given to the like in theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>But I cannot paſs over in Silence, our Authors Judgment concerning the Succeſs of <hi>Itinerants,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that it is nothing but ſowing Tares, corrupting and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:005297_0124_1016F685C276BCC0"/>
dividing religious People;</hi> as is this as an uncharitable and falſe Charge, ſo it argues our <hi>Examiner</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with himſelf, for he has elſe where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Contrary, (See p. 9. 21. 30.) as has been obſerv'd before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiner</hi> in his 24. p. proceeds to cite from my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, p. 104. the following Words, <q>Do not thoſe Things together with their ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ignorant Miſſionaries, to gather ſeparate Societys in Places, where there is a ſound Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſignify that their Deſign is not Catholick, whatever their pretences be notwithſtanding?</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he borrows from <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon p. 54. theſe Words. <q>Whatever good Appearances thruſting out ignorant Perſons (how <hi>pious</hi> ſoever) into the Miniſtry may have, yet it is a dangerous Practice, tending directly to divide and corrupt the Church of God, and bring the Miniſtry thereof into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Collumn he ſays thus. <q>Who but the <hi>Brunſwick Party thruſt out Mr.</hi> ROWLAND into the Miniſtry, in Contempt of the <hi>Synod,</hi> after it was confeſs'd on all Sides he was very defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in many Parts of uſeful Learning, tho' educated at the <hi>Log-Houſe?</hi> Who but <hi>Party-Zealots</hi> have ordained Evangeliſts and ſent them forth to gather Societys in Places where there is a <hi>ſound Miniſtry,</hi> inſtead of ſending them into ungoſpelized Parts?</q> In this Paragraph our Author refers by an <hi>Aſteriſm;</hi> to a Charge of our Opponents in their Examination p. 69. which runs thus. <q>Upon the ſame Lay that they ordained this One, they might ordain one Hundred, if Opportunity offered: And was not this One very deficient in many Parts of uſeful Learning required by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory? And was not this One immediately thurſt into the Bounds of a neighbouring Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, without their Concurrence; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there, in Oppoſition to and contempt of their Determination, to the occaſioning of a
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:005297_0125_1016F687907DD510"/>
Breach and much Confuſion in a Congregation in their Bounds? And what hath his Practice to this Day been, but a continued Courſe of intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Diſorders? Beſides that his Character has been under a very dull Cloud, as to Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Who but <hi>Party Zealots</hi> have admitted into their Pulpits ſuch Novices as D—n <hi>E—s, S—i T—h—r,</hi> L—y—r <hi>P—ne,</hi> &amp;c. tending to bring the ſacred <hi>Miniſtry into Contempt,</hi> and <hi>divide and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Church of God?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer the <hi>Examiners</hi> Charge in the Negative. We have ſent no <hi>Ignorant Miſſinories</hi> to <hi>gather ſeparate Societies, where there was a ſound Miniſtry.</hi> The Caſe is truly thus, all that we have <hi>Licens'd</hi> or <hi>Ordain'd</hi> for the <hi>Holy Miniſtry,</hi> were furniſh'd with a competent Meaſure of <hi>human Learning,</hi> agreeable to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory. Indeed we have not ordain'd every one to a <hi>fix'd Charge</hi> for this Reaſon, becauſe the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that depend upon us for Supplies, are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and our Number of Candidates ſo ſmall, that we cannot ſupply them all at preſent with a ſettled Miniſtry, as we deſire and intend (God willing) The People, in the mean time, urge us with almoſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant</hi> Importunities for ſome Supplies, in reſpect of Preaching, and likewiſe want to have Baptiſm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to their Children; and it ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be obſerv'd, that thoſe Congregations are, many of them, far diſtant from each other. Now we knew of no better Method to remedy the preſent diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Exigence, than that of Ordaining ſome <hi>ad mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterium vagum,</hi>—or to preach about in divers Places for a while, and Baptize, until we cou'd get the Places ſupplyed with a ſettled Miniſtry, or until the Perſons ſo ordain'd wou'd themſelves incline to accept of a fix'd Charge, which Inclination we do not check or Diſcourage. And I think this Practice of ordaining, as aforeſaid, has not been without Preſidents in the reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:005297_0126_1016F68ED594DF30"/>But the Accuſation of <hi>ſending any into Places where there is a ſound Miniſtry, to gather ſeperate Societies,</hi> is a Calumny. Some of our Opponents have diſcover'd more <hi>unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in their Writings of late, then we tho't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had been tainted with. We had ſome Charges againſt ſome of their Number, which we wanted to have examined, and judicially try'd, while a Union ſubſiſted between us, (and without a View to the judicial deciſion of which, we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come into a State of Union with them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it) which we have not broken. But after they in an unjuſt Manner had broken it, (as before related) and by their Oppoſition to GOD's WORK and Servants, <hi>grieved</hi> the Hearts of his People and <hi>allienated</hi> their Affections from them, ſo that they cou'd not Profit under their Miniſtry, or with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conſcience attend upon it, leaſt they ſhould encourage them in their evil Courſe, and ſo be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in their Guilt, and be liable to the penal iſſues of it. I ſay, when thoſe poor oppreſſed People again and again Supplicated us for Relief, in the moſt moving and pathetick Strains! how cou'd we deny them, except we had Bowels of Braſs and Adamant?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Examiners</hi> Charge in relation to Mr. ROW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND is unjuſt. Mr. ROWLAND was neither Licens'd or Ordain'd by us, in <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Synod,</hi> but in <hi>compliance</hi> with the <hi>Dictates</hi> of our own <hi>Conſciences.</hi> And <hi>We,</hi> who have had him under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, did and do look upon him to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Qualified for the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Gracious Accompliſhments,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our <hi>Directory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what is added, of <hi>his beeng thruſt into the Bounds of a Neighbouring Presbytery, without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, and continu'd there in Oppoſition to, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Determination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a wrong Repreſentation of the Matter; he was <hi>Invited</hi> by a Body of Religious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who conſcientiouſly diſſented from thoſe Acts
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005297_0127_1016F6905C68FAD0"/>
or Laws, which were made by a Majority of the Synod, which occaſion'd the Debate between us and them, and he himſelf likewiſe ſcrupl'd the Laws aforeſaid. In conſequence of which the Majority of the Synod had publickly warn'd all the People of their Bounds againſt Hearing of Mr. ROWLAND, becauſe he had been licens'd by us, notwithſtanding of their Cannon.</p>
            <p>The People declin'd applying to that <hi>Presbytery</hi> in whoſe Bounds they were, becauſe of the Caſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and other Objections they had againſt their Conduct; and not being able to get a Miniſter elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, they importuned Mr. ROWLAND to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, with which he, at laſt, comply'd, not out of <hi>Contempt,</hi> but <hi>Conſcience</hi> towards God, in order to relieve a <hi>pious, oppos'd</hi> and <hi>oppreſs'd</hi> People! which, thro' the divine Bleſſing, was to all appearance a Mean of <hi>ſaving Good</hi> to many precious Souls there, in their <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> to God.</p>
            <p>As to what they ſay farther under this Head, viz. <hi>That his Practice hath been to this Day, a courſe of intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Diſorders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer to this Charge <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> we want Proof. To what has been ſaid, they add, <hi>that his Character has been under a very dull Gloud as to immorality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I muſt beg leave to obſerve, that it is an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſign in our Oppoſers to endeavour to caſt <hi>Contempt</hi> upon the Character of one, whoſe faithful Labours for God, has been Crown'd with remarkable and diſtinguiſh'd Succeſſes, and to join with the Prophane in Perſecuting of him. May God forgive their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. But let them know to their ſhame, that the <hi>dull Cloud which,</hi> they ſay, <hi>covered his Character,</hi> is now, by the kind Providence of God, cleared up, and that his <hi>Inocence ſhines as the Light,</hi> and <hi>his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Noon-Day!</hi> We wiſh with all our Hearts, that all their Candidates were Qualified like him, in reſpect of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>who are ſo wiſe in their own Eyes,</hi> underſtood Divinity as well as him, whom they deſpiſe, or that
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:005297_0128_1016F691E25BE218"/>
all of them together could ſhew ſo much Succeſs of their Labours.</p>
            <p>Who the <hi>Examiner</hi> means in his next Paragraph that <hi>have,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>admitted Novices into their Pulpits,</hi> I know not; neither do I know the Names be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by thoſe letters of them which he ſets down, and therefore I cannot anſwer particularly to that Charge; but this I can ſay in general, that we have been as careful as we could, to keep <hi>Novices out of our Pulpits,</hi> leaſt <hi>contempt ſhould thereby come on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> and other injuries to the <hi>Chruch of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we are arriv'd at another head of our Authors Performance, p. 26. entitled, <hi>Mr.</hi> T's <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the</hi> Practice <hi>of the</hi> Moravians <hi>compar'd with his own</hi> Practice <hi>and that of his</hi> Adherents.</p>
            <p>The firſt Paſſage he cites from my Writings, is <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 106. which is this, <q>Do not ſome <hi>Moravians</hi> ſlight human Reaſon and Learning? &amp;c. p. 97. Mr. SPANGENBERG declaim'd in my hearing, more than once, againſt human learning, &amp;c</q> In the oppoſite Collumn to which he ſays thus. <q>Hath not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> declaim'd more publickly, and fiercely aginſt Learning, then the <hi>Moravians,</hi> when he pronounc'd his <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt the <hi>publick Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demys,</hi> and pour'd contempt upon a <hi>learned Clergy,</hi> calling them <hi>Letter Learned.</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have neiter declaim'd publickly nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately againſt <hi>Learning,</hi> but in favour of it. Nor pronounc'd any <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt <hi>publick Univerſities.</hi> I only ſaid <hi>that they are generally corrupt;</hi> I meant in reſpect of religious Principles and Practice, and are they not? Can our Author ſay the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? I ſpake according to the beſt Information I had, but ſhould be glad to find it a miſtake.</p>
            <p>Beſides I ſpoke of <hi>private School</hi> to be erected, <hi>eſpecially</hi> where there were no Publick ones; which manifeſts that I had ſome regard to them.</p>
            <p>And the Method I propos'd to be obſerv'd in <hi>private Schools</hi> reſpecting the Examination of <hi>Intrants</hi> as to their Piety, is different from what is obſerv'd
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:005297_0129_1016F695E54F9AF0"/>
in publick ones; and in my Opinion is of noble Tendency to ſerve the Church of God. For then there wou'd be a greater Probability of the Youths being preſerv'd from the aforeſaid Corruptions, as well as of their greater advances in Religion by the help of mutual Converſation, about <hi>experimental Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How inconſiſtent is our Authors Charge that <hi>I ſhould declaim againſt Learning,</hi> while in the mean Time I propoſe amd incourage Schools for that very end; and <hi>more</hi> fiercely <hi>then the</hi> Moravians <hi>too.</hi> O Strange! Well I ſee tho' the <hi>Examiner</hi> has no <hi>Charity</hi> for me, or my expreſs Declarations; yet he has for the <hi>Moravians</hi> without any in their favour.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> adds, that <hi>I pour'd contempt upon a learned Clergy,</hi> calling them <hi>Letter Learned, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I didn't deſign in the Uſe of thoſe Words our Author mentions, any <hi>contempt</hi> upon the <hi>learning</hi> of Miniſters, but only to ſignify my diſlike at Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons coming into the Miniſtry, that have no other Qualifications but <hi>human Learning.</hi> As the Words of the Sermon to which he refers, conſidered in their Connection do manifeſt. <hi>See</hi> Notingham <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, p.</hi> 1. 2. The Sentence runs thus: <q>Why, had the People then no Teachers, O Yes, they had heaps of <hi>Phariſee</hi> Teachers, that came out, no doubt, after they had been the uſual Time at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and according to the Acts, Cannons and Traditions of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi>
               </q> And is our Author offended with me for that, wou'd he have me to encourage <hi>graceleſs</hi> Men tho' <hi>learned,</hi> to come into the Miniſtry? Let him ſpeak out, that we may hear his Mind upon this important Point. The <hi>Examiner's</hi> next Citation is from <hi>Moravian</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. p. 108. the Words are theſe. <q>I think it looks exceeding black in the <hi>Moravians,</hi> to ſlight ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Knowledge, ſo as they do, which they call Head-Knowledge. Is not ſpeculative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame for Subſtance with what is ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only deſtitute of its Influence upon Heart and Practice? <hi>Ibid.</hi> Don't the <hi>Moravians</hi> begin
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:005297_0130_1016F697B50A4328"/>
with the Affections firſt? And is this fair Dealing?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Column to which the <hi>Examiner</hi> ſpeaks thus, viz. <q>Why then do we hear ſo much of the ſpiritual and myſtical Senſe of Scripture? &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Pray, Has not this been the conſtant Practice of the <hi>Itinerants</hi> to addreſs and move the Paſſions firſt?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> the <hi>Primium Mobile,</hi> a principal Mover and Promoter of the Paſſionate-Religion, now prevailing among ſo many? Is it not as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair Dealing in the <hi>Itinerants</hi> as in the Moravians?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Has our Author heard much or little from, me, of the ſpiritual and myſtical Senſe of Scripture, if ſo let him declare it in his next. It ſeems by this Paſſage that the <hi>Examiner</hi> wou'd repreſent us, as a Tribe of <hi>Allegoriſts</hi> and <hi>enthuſiaſtick Myſticks;</hi> but we point blank deny the Charge, and demand his Proof. Our Author, as appears by the large Blanks in his Columns, ſeems to grow faint under the Weight of his <hi>task,</hi> and no wonder indeed. Its pity that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of his genius ſhould undertake ſuch a bad Cauſe, as puts him unavoidably to ſuch difficulties for the want of proper Materials. But I proceed to his Queſtion, in anſwer to which I can truly ſay, that ſo far as I know, ſuch as our Author terms <hi>Itinerants,</hi> their Method (in general) has been firſt to inform Mens Judgments, about the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Points of Religion, and to endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them in a cloſe diſtinguiſhing and pathetical Manner, to the Conſciences and Affections of their hearers, ſo as to have a Tendency to alarm their Fear and incite their Love.</p>
            <p>As to what is farther added againſt me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, viz. "That I am the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> a principal mover and promoter of the Paſſionate-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, now prevailing among ſo many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſerve Reader, the <hi>Examiner</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges than an affectionate Religion, now prevails
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005297_0131_1016F69CDC97D300"/>
among many; well here is another Teſtimony from his own Pen in favour of the late Reformation. In the mean Time I utterly diſclaim what he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to me in theſe Words, <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> or <hi>firſt mover.</hi> This is an honour which belongs to no meer Man. I am fully perſwaded upon the moſt certain Foundation, that it is the holy Spirit of God, who was the <hi>firſt Mover</hi> of what he calls the <hi>paſſionate Religion;</hi> and this the Effects thereof, in the Change that has been wrought upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tempers of the Minds and general Courſe of the Lives of Multitudes, do inconteſtibly prove, to all that are not blinded with unaccountable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. Can it with any ſhadow of Reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Satan wou'd ſo far fight againſt his own Intereſt, as to rouſe Multitudes of Sinners out of the Sleep of ſinful Security, and excite them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Enquiries, and inceſſant Importunities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Salvation by JESUS CHRIST? And that he would, if he could, change mens Minds and Practice as before obſerv'd. No ſurely! by the ſame Method of caviling, by which ſome Labour to condemn the late revival of Religion in this Land, they may condemn that Work of God which was in the Apoſtolick Age.—</p>
            <p>But if our Author means no more, than that I have been a <hi>principal Promoter</hi> under God, of the <hi>paſſionate Religion,</hi> he does me much honour, tho' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not with deſign. I have been indeed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to promote a Religion which includes both <hi>Judgment, Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> in it. And bleſſed be God he has given Succeſs to my attempts. <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> without <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> in Religion, is certainly but vain Fancy, and <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> without ſome degree of Paſſion, is but dead dry <hi>Formality.</hi> My own Conſcience and multitudes of Mankind can witneſs for me, that it has been always my endeavour in the Courſe of my Miniſtry firſt to inform Mens minds before I addreſs'd their <hi>Conſciences</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which I cannot but think
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005297_0132_1016F69F98EAE800"/>
is the only proper Method of dealing with intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Creatures. Certainly <hi>Paſſion</hi> is of no farther uſe in Religion, then it is under the Guidance of a well inform'd Judgment, but thus far it is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe. It is abſur'd to ſuppoſe that God has given us <hi>Paſſions</hi> to be only employ'd about terrene trifles.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to the 27 p. where our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor quotes the following Words from my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon. <q>Do they not endeavour to inſinuate themſelves into Peoples Affections firſt, by Smiles &amp;c. And in p. 65. Do any eſteem the <hi>Moravian</hi> Sect, becauſe they ſmile generally and appear loving; but Brethren is not this <hi>Judas</hi> like to betray us with a kiſs; for while they ſhew ſuch Love, they draw pious People into Errors, and ſo ſet them a quarelling with one another, ſhall we ſuffer them to ſmile us out of our Principles, then I'm ſure we are poorly grounded in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 
               <q>Do not they take ſpecial care to apply to young Perſons, Females and Ignorant People who are full of Affection?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Who do they imitate in attacking the weaker Part of Man, viz. the Paſſions, and the weaker Sex firſt, but the Devil, the Father of Lies and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? Did not he deal thus with our firſt Parents, and by the weaker Sex ſeduced <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </q>

            <p>Upon the oppoſite Column we have theſe Words of our <hi>Examiner,</hi> viz. <q>Who can help ſmiling at this, that conſiders what is paſt and now is.— Strange that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould complain of the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Smiles in religious Matter! When it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that he himſelf not only ſmil'd but laugh'd heartily over his Converts, even while they were under a preparatory Work of the Law, and his followers have practiſed upon him, and not been aſham'd to expreſs their Joy at,—by loud laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even in the Solemn Aſſemblies. Is not this <hi>ludere cum Sacris,?</hi> an unjuſtifiable Practice in one as well as another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:005297_0133_1016F6A293DE9BE0"/>
               <q>And is not this Practice exactly correſpondent with the Practice of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and other heady <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi> which <hi>creep into Houſes and have had moſt Succeſs among Females and young ignorant People.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The whole Paſſage is ſo very applicable to <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerants</hi> in general, That I ſhould have taken it for a Repreſentation, (not to ſay Refutation of their Conduct) if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> had not taught me to apply it to the <hi>Moravians.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here let the Reader obſerve, that the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer</hi> miſrepreſents my meaning, and has left out a pretty deal that ſerves to explain it; he ſays, <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the</hi> Moravian <hi>Smiles in religious Matters:</hi> But this is a falſe Charge, it is only their abuſe of them that I complain of, and not the meer Uſe of them in religious Matters; namely, their trying to inſinuate themſelves into Peoples Affection by them, thro' ſhews of Love, and ſo to draw them into Error, while in the mean Time they conceal their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, until the Affections are fixed.</p>
            <p>If the Heart is fill'd with Love and Joy, it will naturally make the face Serene. And have I ſmil'd and laugh'd heratily over my Converts, (or People wro't upon by my Miniſtry) while under a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Work of the Law: Well, and where is the Harm of it, it ſhew'd that I was glad that poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers were in a likely way to come to Chriſt: And wou'd our Author have me to be ſorry upon ſuch an Occaſion? God forbid! I wou'd rather immitate the Example of our Lord, who <hi>tho' a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief,</hi> yet <hi>rejoyc'd in Spirit</hi> at ſuch an event, viz. <hi>When Satan fell as Lightning from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here let it be noticed, by the by, that I am Honoured with another Teſtimony from our <hi>Examiner,</hi> to the Succeſs of my Miniſtry, for it ſeems, even according to his own acknowledgment, <hi>that ſome were brought under a Work of the Law by my Labours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>laughing loud in Religious Aſſemblies,</hi> if any have been guilty of it, I will not undertake to be their Patron, in that I think it is <hi>undecent</hi> and of <hi>bad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:005297_0134_1016F6A554022588"/>
But to ſhew the <hi>Examiner's</hi> unfair dealing un-this Head of Charge, I will cite the whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph he refers to, <hi>See Moravian Sermon page</hi> 106. the Words are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Don't the <hi>Moravians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Affections firſt? and is this fair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Do they not endeavour to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Peoples Affections firſt, by Smiles and ſoft Diſcourſes about the Love of CHRIST, and by a ſeemingly innocent, ſimple and loving Behaviour, while in the mean Time they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hide their Principles until the Affections are catch'd, and then let them out by Degrees? Should not they ſhow their Principles firſt, before the Affections are fix'd, that ſo People might judge of them with calmneſs and impartiality?</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the next particular of Charge, viz. <hi>Creeping into Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer that his Application is <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>untrue:</hi> Neither I nor any of my Brethren <hi>have crept into Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. Inſtead of <hi>ſculking</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand</hi> Methods, we have declar'd our religious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents freely on all proper Occaſions, and in the openeſt Manner poſſible, before the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>unlearned</hi> Men that ever <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> has ſeen of a Religious kind.</p>
            <p>Neither has our Succeſs, thro divine Grace, been confined to <hi>Females and young ignorant People,</hi> but has extended to Perſons of almoſt every age, order and condition of Life, learned and unlearned, rich and poor, old and young, honourable and ignoble, male and female, tho' in the mean time we look upon the Converſion of <hi>Females and ignorant Perſons,</hi> to be a Matter of infinite Importance, and do glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God upon the Account thereof.</p>
            <p>And here let the Reader obſerve another Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to our Succeſs from the Pen of an Oppoſer, and that even when he is trying to run us and it down, and that expreſly contrary to what he has ſaid page 24. in theſe Words, <hi>And pray what good do the</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:005297_0135_1016F6A818C52020"/>
Itinerants <hi>do by their</hi> Traveling, <hi>unleſs it be good to ſow</hi> Tares, <hi>to</hi> corrupt <hi>and divide religious People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we proceed to his 28 pag. where he quotes the following Words from my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, p. 107. <q>And don't they refuſe generally to reaſon upon Points in Religion, whereby one might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince another, and leave People to be proſelyted by ſight only! It is politick in them indeed to wave Reaſoning and to ſhun Diſcovery, for their Principles will bear neither.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Column the <hi>Examiner</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>This Rev. Gentleman had forgot ſurely the <hi>Motto</hi> of his own Party, viz. <hi>Anſwer him not a Word,</hi> when he whote this, it is thought by ſome that <hi>their Strength</hi> was herein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I can't be ſaid to forget that which I never knew. The controverſal Writings that ſome of us have make publick, do declare to the World, that what has been now ſaid is not our <hi>Motto,</hi> and I hope theſe Sheets will convince the <hi>Examiner</hi> that it is not mine.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems indeed that our Author was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Anſwer him not a Word,</hi> was our <hi>Motto,</hi> otherwiſe how could he run ſuch Lengths as he has done in his Performance.</p>
            <p>The next Paſſage that the <hi>Examiner</hi> quotes from my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon is p. 65. the Words are theſe, <q>My Soul is greived to ſee the childiſh Fickleneſs of the Sons and Daughters of this Generation, who are toſs'd about with every Wind of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; who are ſmil'd out of their Religion, without being able to offer one ſolid Reaſon for their Change.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the oppoſite Column to which, he ſays, <q>Even ſo many judicious and ſerious Chriſtians are grieved at the Heart to ſee the <hi>childiſh Fickel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of many Profeſſors at this Day, who are as Children <hi>toſſed to and fro, and carried about with diverſe and ſtrange Doctrines, ſeparating themſelves</hi> and <hi>having
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005297_0136_1016F6A99DA0BB68"/>
Men's Perſons in Admiration;</hi> without being able <hi>to offer one ſolid Reaſon for their Change.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> is the <hi>Examiners</hi> Application of the aforeſaid Paragraph to me, and ſuch as join with me, as it is evident he does, from the general Title of this Head of Charges before related. Wherein have I in particular <hi>been carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, or ſeparated myſelf, having Mens Perſons in Admiration?</hi> It is true indeed <hi>I can't give a ſolid Reaſon for my Change,</hi> becauſe I have ſuffer'd none. Will this Author tell us how I have been ſmil'd out of my Religion?</p>
            <p>Pray does the <hi>Examiner</hi> mean by <hi>Strange Doctrines</hi> the <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> namely of <hi>original Sin, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone,</hi> the <hi>New-Birth,</hi> the <hi>Perſeverance of the Saints,</hi> are theſe <hi>Strange</hi> to him? If ſo I'm ſorry for it: But I'm ſure they are not ſo to the <hi>reform'd Churches,</hi> as appears by the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Confeſſions of Faith. Now theſe are the Doctrines that ourſelves and hearers have been chiefly affected with, and influenced by. And is the <hi>Examiner</hi> ſorry for that, then he himſelf is an object of Pitty, and ſo are thoſe whom he calls <hi>judicious and ſerious Chriſtians,</hi> if they join with him therein.</p>
            <p>As to the Accuſation <hi>of having Mens Perſons in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi> I hope I may ſay in behalf of my ſelf and Brethren, that the chief Reaſons why we admire Perſons are their Goodneſs and Uſefulneſs to the Church of God, and that it is our deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the general, to proportion our eſteem to the Degrees thereof. As to the Charge of <hi>Separation</hi> it has been before anſwered.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Examiner</hi> in the mean Time ſeems to be realy guilty of what he without Foundation char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon us, in as much as by this Performance he ſeems to admire thoſe, who oppoſe the Power of Religion this Way, and who hold, ſome of them, theſe Strange Doctrines, viz. <hi>That Conviction is not neceſſary to Converſion.</hi> That <hi>there is no inward call to the Miniſtry,</hi> and the Notion of the <hi>rigid Independants</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:005297_0137_1016F6ADA810ED70"/>
and <hi>Browniſts,</hi> reſpecting the Peoples Relation to their Paſtor, <hi>viz. that it is equal to that of a Marriage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract:</hi> And who have ſeparated themſelves.—And thus our Author appears to be guilty <hi>of admiring of Perſons</hi> in the worſt Senſe.—The next Paſſage our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor quotes from <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon, is p. 58. <q>Children are fond of new Things, that look bright tho' of little Value: Thus Novices in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity who are juſt beginning the Chriſtian Courſe, ignorant in a great Meaſure, as to Chriſtian Principles, but full of Affection and ſelf Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, when a <hi>Moravian</hi> comes among them, ſitts down a while, and look very Harmleſs, Innocent and Sober, gives ſome ſmiles, and talks about the Blood of Chriſt, in their Myſtical Way, and of Love, Love. O brave, O what a fine Man is this!</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the oppoſite Column we have theſe Words of the <hi>Examiner,</hi> viz. <q>It is a moving Argument, and Proof that People are not ſo well taught in this Land as is pretended, but have now as much need as ever to have their Minds inſtructed as well as their Paſſions mov'd.—The Image is very Strong and lively.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Examiners</hi> applying to us, the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> Myſtical Way of talking about the Blood of Chriſt, is ſo falſe and trifling that it deſerves no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Our Author was exceedingly ſtraitned here, for the want of Matter, and well he might if he has any remains of Conſcience in him.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Examiner</hi> proceeds to quote a Paragraph from my <hi>Moravian</hi> Sermon p. 107. which runs thus. <q>Certainly we ſhould adhere inviolably to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples we have been inſtructed in, until we find better, which we ſhould be always ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive upon proper <hi>Conviction,</hi> which is not to be attain'd by a ſight of the Grimaces of Strangers or by immediate Revelations or Enthuſiaſms, but by Scripture, Reaſon and Argument.</q> And p. 52. I direct to hold faſt CHRIST'S precious Truth, thus. <q>It is needful to wave a poſitive Concluſion reſpecting the Good State of Strangers, when we
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005297_0138_1016F6B06B982030"/>
have not ſufficient Evidences for it in reſpect of their Principles, Experiences and Practice. <hi>Raſh judging</hi> either Way is certainly unreaſonable and prejudicial, when Perſons do ſpeedily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient Reaſon, conclude Strangers who come among them to be Pious and perhaps emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſo, becauſe of their fair Appearances in Behaviour, without examining their Principles; by this raſh Method of proceeding their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are apt to be unreaſonably engag'd in their Favour, and theſe being inflam'd do give a ſecret wrong By aſs to their Judgment, and thus they lay themſelves open to all Manner of Deluſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After which the <hi>Examiner</hi> obſerves as follows, viz. <q>I am confident the impartial Reader is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by this time, that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> has drawn his own Picture to the Life, by the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he has given of the Principles and Practices of the <hi>Moravians,</hi> and that I have only ſet the Mirror in ſuch a Poſition that He and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may ſee themſelves, and be aſhamed. But if they are blinded with Self-love, Admiration, Conceit, Party-Zeal, and the like, and will not, or cannot ſee their own Likeneſs; I believe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſo much of a Spirit of diſcerning, as to ſee that M. <hi>T—t</hi> and his Partizans as nearly reſemble the Character here given of the <hi>Moravians, as one Crow's Egg does another</hi> (to uſe his own homely Compariſon.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Reader had no other Repreſentation of the Caſe, then that <hi>Partial</hi> one which the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner</hi> has given in his Performance, he might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be enduced to think hard of me, and that I was inconſiſtent with my ſelf; for tho' there be little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Candor</hi> in our Authors Compoſure, yet ſeveral Stroaks in it are manag'd with much Art and apparent Plauſibility. I cannot but think that the <hi>Examiner</hi> is a Gentlemen of Wit and Addreſs, otherwiſe he cou'd not have manag'd ſo well ſo bad a Cauſe as he has done, but 'tis Pitty his Talents are
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005297_0139_1016F6B32AC31CF0"/>
not turned into another Channel, that might better ſerve the Intereſts of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as his own Reputation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mirror</hi> our Author has ſet before the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is but ſome broken Pieces ſet in a wrong Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſerve only to deceive the Mind with falſe Images of Perſons and Things.</p>
            <p>It is true <hi>I am aſham'd,</hi> when I read his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but not for my Self but him. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary I think I am honour'd, when traduced for the Sake of Truth and Piety.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion of the aforeſaid Paragraph is as <hi>falſe</hi> as ever any thing was <hi>true,</hi> namely, <hi>That I and my Partizans</hi> (as he is pleas'd to term my dear and reverend Brethren) <hi>as neerly reſemble the Character here given of the</hi> Moravians, <hi>as one Crow's Egg does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> If the whole Paragraph be conſidered, it will appear that in this Sentence the <hi>Examiner</hi> has a Ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to all that he had cited from my Sermons reſpecting the <hi>Moravians.</hi> Here obſerve this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is Poſitive that the Similitude is as exact as any Thing can be, but under the particular Heads of Charge in ſeveral of his Columns, the judicious Reader may perceive, that ſometimes he varies in the Application, leaves out ſome things altogether, and alters others to ſuit his Deſign; and in ſome Places he is Indiſtinct and General and ſpeaks but a very little, leaving large Blanks (and perhaps it would have been more to his Credit if it had been all a Blank.) How inconſiſtent are theſe Things?</p>
            <p>He ſays <hi>if we are ſo blinded, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>we will not or cannot ſee our own Likeneſs.</hi> He believes <hi>others have ſo much of a Spirit of diſcerning, as to ſee the Reſemblance is as exact as that of one Crow's Egg to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A true Spirit of diſcerning will perceive as much Difference between the two, (if I may be allowed to uſe another homely Simile) as between an <hi>Apple</hi> and an <hi>Oyſter,</hi> or rather as between <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white.</hi> To apprehend as he does, requires not right <hi>diſcerning</hi> or true <hi>diſtinguiſhing,</hi> but a Perverſion
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:005297_0140_1016F6B4B2E63E30"/>
of the Sight, either thro' a defect of the optick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, or by this falſe <hi>Mirror</hi> he preſents.</p>
            <p>However if the <hi>Examiner</hi> will not be offended, I will beg leave to uſe the homely Words, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, once more in the following Manner, viz. <hi>That I am apt to think that by this Time the impartial Reader may perceive as great a reſemblance between the</hi> Examiner <hi>and the</hi> Oppoſers of God's Work <hi>here, in divers Particulars,</hi> as between one Crow's Egg and another.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to conſider the next Paragraph in his 30th. p. which runs thus. <q>The Reader may take this Examination as an Help to diſcover <hi>what is Truth</hi> in the <hi>late Religious Commotion</hi> in this Country, and he will find it to be juſt that which the <hi>Oppoſers,</hi> ſo called, are zealous to maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Order of the Goſpel, and the ſacred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God. Strip <hi>this Work</hi> of its <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> and you will diſcern what is <hi>the Work of God,</hi> from that which is added to it <hi>by Art</hi> and <hi>Man's Device.</hi> Pray what is there Extraordinary on one ſide more than t'other, but what is juſtly to be exploded, <hi>viz.</hi> extraordinary Errors, Diſorders, Intruſions, raſh Cenſures, Clamorous Exclamations, vain-glorious Boaſtings, Fits, Pretence of Sights and Viſions, Roarings, Tremblings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Compare Mr. <hi>T</hi>— with himſelf, and ſhave off his Extraordinaries (turning the Edge of his own Weapon on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) and <hi>his Strength will go from him, and he will be like any other Man; a Man ſubject to like Paſſions as we are.</hi> I can't find but that the <hi>New-Brunſwick Party</hi> are fallible as other Men, and chargeable with as many Errors, Intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Contradictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as their Neighbours, whom they are ready to condemn as <hi>Enemies of God's Work</hi> and <hi>Enemies of Religion</hi> meerly for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Errors and real Indiſcretions: Whereas the true Intereſt of Religion is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſerv'd by ſuch Oppoſition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:005297_0141_1016F6B7DAF24508"/>
               <q>I know no <hi>ſhorter Method</hi> to open the Eyes of <hi>blind Party-Zealots,</hi> and convince them of the bad Tendency of extraordinary Self-Conceit, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, raſh Judging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to bring them home to their own Doors, and turn theſe Edge-Tools upon themſelves; prove them now herewith, and you will find theſe crucified Gentlemen have yet as much Senſation and are as ready to <hi>cry out of Danger</hi> as any of their abuſed Neighbours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Moravians</hi> it ſeems treated Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> in the ſame uncharitable, cenſorious, imperious, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſive Manner in which he himſelf has treated the <hi>Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</hi> and then the Spirit appears to him in a moſt frightful Shape, and muſt be avoided. <hi>Now it is come upon thee, thou fainteſt: And it toucheth thee, and thou art trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to what has been ſaid, let me brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve, that if any Body wants to entertain prejudice againſt the late glorious revival of Religion in this Land, or an unjuſt Notion of the greatneſs of it, the <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Performance may be ſome help that Way in reſpect of ſome Stroaks that are in it.</p>
            <p>However it ſhould be remark'd for the Honour of <hi>the late revival of Piety,</hi> that while our Author is induſtriouſly painting it in a Sable dreſs, he is conſtrain'd to confeſs in this Paragraph that there was ſome <hi>reality in it,</hi> which he terms the <hi>Order of the Goſpel and the ſacred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And while the <hi>Examiner</hi> propoſes this Queſtion viz, <hi>What is extraordinary upon one ſide more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> He hereby allows an equality of Succeſs in preaching as to Succeſs, between the <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers</hi> of the late Reformation of Religion, then by an unavoidable conſequence, our Author muſt either deny that they had any Succeſs at all, (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he wou'd be loth to do) or acknowledge ours, I ſee not how he can get clear of this Dilemma.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:005297_0142_1016F6BD8C1166B8"/>But in the mean Time while he owns ſome reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it he puts a bear Skin over it, and talks of ſomething added to it by <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Man's Deviſe,</hi> and then repeats his thread bare Catalogue of frightful Things, <hi>extraordinary Errors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> which has been before conſidered. It's true indeed the Bear Skin he mentions is added to the <hi>late Work,</hi> by <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Man's Deviſe.</hi> Let it be ſtrip'd of thoſe <hi>falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi> and then it will appear in its <hi>own native Beauty:</hi> And unleſs he deals with it as its ſtory'd of the Tyrant <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> who cut off Men's Legs to make them of an equal Length, he cannot bring the Succeſs of <hi>Itinerants</hi> down to a Level, with that of <hi>Oppoſers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Oppoſers</hi> had been Zealous to maintain the honours of <hi>the holy Spirit</hi> there wou'd be no Debate ſubſiſting among us reſpecting the <hi>late Reformation.</hi> But pray why does the <hi>Examiner</hi> put the <hi>Order of the Goſpel</hi> (ſo call'd) before <hi>the ſacred Honours due to the holy Spirit.</hi> By this unreaſonable Precedence it ſeems that our Author perferrs <hi>Externals</hi> before <hi>the Life of Piety,</hi> which is ſinful and Scandalous: But becauſe the <hi>Examiner</hi> and his Brethen talk <hi>of Order (uſque ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravim)</hi> ſo much, I will beg Leave to cite a Paſſage upon this Head, from the Works of excellent and judicious Mr. FLAVEL, in his <hi>Husbandry ſpirituliz'd</hi> Volum 2. p. 307. of the 4th Edition, <hi>upon an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent but irregular Tree.</hi> 
               <q>Seeing a Tree grow ſomewhat Irregular in a very neat Orchard, I told the Owner it was Pitty that Tree ſhould ſtand there, and that if it were mine I would root it up, and thereby reduce the Orchard to exact uniformity. It was reply'd to this purpoſe, That he rather regarded the Fruit then the Form; and that this ſlight inconveniency was abundantly preponderated by a more conſiderable Advantage. This Tree, ſaid he, which you wou'd root up hath yielded me more Fruit then many of thoſe Trees, which have nothing elſe to commend them but their regular Situation. I could not but
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005297_0143_1016F6BF1123CD58"/>
yield to the Reaſon of this Anſwer; and could wiſh it had been ſpoken ſo loud that all our <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity Men</hi> had heard it, who will not ſtick to root up many Hundred of the beſt bearers in the Lords Orchard, becauſe they ſtand not in an exact order with other more conformable, but leſs beneficial Trees, who do <hi>perdere Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam propter Accidentia,</hi> deſtroy the Fruit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Form.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Not much unlike ſuch fooliſh Men are thoſe,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>"That ſtrive for Shadows and their Subſtance looſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Examiners</hi> compliſance to me, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>uſe of the Raſor,</hi> I would beg Leave to aſſure him, that I neither have, or ever had, <hi>ſuch a monſtrous Beard of Extraordinaries,</hi> as he talks of.</p>
            <p>But I muſt make bold to tell the <hi>Examiner,</hi> that he has got a very long Beard, the Hairs of <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> ſtick out ſo long upon it, that it is <hi>undecent,</hi> I wou'd adviſe him therefore to be ſhaven as ſoon as may be for his own Credit and Comfort.</p>
            <p>As to that of <hi>turning the Edge of my Weapon upon my ſelf,</hi> the <hi>Examiner</hi> has try'd artfully and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Method he propoſes, but I am not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Effect he mentions has been the Iſſue of it, <hi>viz. That my Strength is gone from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>New-Brunſwick Party</hi> (as he calls them) have never pretended to infallibility,—and as to his Charge of <hi>Errors and intruſions, &amp;c.</hi> it has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidered. But while our Author aſſerts that the <hi>New-Brunſwick Party,</hi> are chargeable <hi>with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Errors, Intruſions, Contradictions, &amp;c. as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> Seeing that he believes the aforeſaid Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are realy applicable to us, doſn't he declare by the ſame Breath, that his Dear Brethren the <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> here, are equally guilty of them in his Opinion, and if ſo why does he ſo partially prefer them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us? as appears from divers Paſſages of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and particularly from the following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph in which the <hi>Examiner</hi> calls us <hi>blind Party Zealots.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are obliged to our Author for his kind Compliments, but are humbly of Opinion, that it is proper for him to enquire whether there be not Reaſon to apply them nearer home?</p>
            <p>But methinks our Authors advice in reſpect of <hi>proving us, &amp;c.</hi> as before expreſs'd—and ſaying <hi>you will find theſe crucified Gentlemen have as much Senſation and are as ready to cry out of Danger as any of their Neighbours,</hi> ſomewhat reſembles Satans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal concerning <hi>Job.</hi> Job 1.9.10.11. <hi>then Satan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Lord and ſaid, doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for nought, haſt thou not made a Hedge about him—but put forth thine Hand now and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy Face.</hi> But the <hi>Examiner</hi> knows that after a moſt formidable Tryal, when even Heaven it ſelf lowr'd, and Earth and Hell combin'd in a cruel Confederacy againſt him; when the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing &amp; gloomy Train of complicated Calamities of of various Forms, rold upon him in a thick and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant Succeſſion, his gallant noble Soul preſerv'd its integrity and ſtood firm as an impregnable Rock amidſt the boyſterous Billows, which with unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Violence in vain eſſay'd to diſturb its repoſe and Security. In a Word, the Iſſue prov'd, God himſelf being Judge, <hi>that the Accuſer of the Brethren was not able to maintain his envious Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can with integrity of Heart aſſure our Author that <hi>I do not cry out of Danger,</hi> on the Account of any Treatment I have received of the <hi>Moravians,</hi> but becauſe of the Hurt they are doing to the Church of God. I am thro' Mercy ſo <hi>far</hi> from <hi>fainting upon that Account</hi> that it doſn't create the leaſt uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in me.—</p>
            <p>O but the old Story comes over again, <hi>that I have treated the Body of the Clergy of this Generation in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Manner, &amp;c.</hi> Why didn't he ſay <hi>unconverted Miniſters,</hi> for ſure that is the Caſe, O No! that woudn't Anſwer his and his Friends Purpoſe, for then the nakedneſs and naughtineſs of their Cauſe in defending the ungodly Miniſtry, would
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:005297_0145_1016F6C3AB1C7BD8"/>
be open to every Eye, and therefore they give it an artful turn, in order to hide its filthy Face from the common People, and harp often upon this plauſibly String, that I treat <hi>uncharitably</hi> and <hi>cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>the Clergy, the Body</hi> of <hi>the Clergy of this Generation:</hi> Why what's the Matter, do I ſpeak a Word againſt <hi>converted Miniſters</hi> in the <hi>Noting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Sermon, no not a Word. What need they then take in ſuch great Dudgeon what I ſpeak againſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Miniſters</hi> in general. Except they be ſuch themſelves they ſhoudn't apply it, but if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters mention'd in the Sermon ſuit their Caſe and Courſe, in its main Stroaks pretty exactly, why then indeed they ought to apply it, but kindly, and humbly pray for converting Grace. To uſe our Authors Words, when the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon touches them <hi>why do they faint and cry out of Danger?</hi> Indeed if they find themſelves graceleſs and cry out of the Danger of their own preſent State, I ſhou'dn't find fault with them upon that Account; but for them to <hi>cry out of Danger</hi> in Relation to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> becauſe the unonverted Clergy are plainly ſpoke againſt, is very prepoſterous.</p>
            <p>What wou'd they have me do, ſhould I ſpeak well of graceleſs Miniſters, when ſome of them eſpecially, are the Bane of Religion, the Peſt of the Church, and Burden of the Creation? In this I muſt beg to be excuſed.</p>
            <p>Our Authors laſt Paragraphs are ſpent in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Mr. DAVENPORTS Clamorous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Boſton,</hi> againſt unconverted Miniſters, and in an earneſt Advice to me to retract the <hi>Noting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Sermon.</p>
            <p>As to the Manner of Mr. DAVENPORT'S preaching in <hi>Boſton</hi> againſt unconverted Miniſters, not having heard him there, not having a full and certain Information on both Sides, I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it.</p>
            <p>But in regard to our Authors Advice to retract the <hi>Notingham</hi> Sermon, I muſt beg to be excus'd
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:005297_0146_1016F6C7C3A620B8"/>
until I ſee ſome Reaſon for it. The <hi>Examiner</hi> calls that Sermon an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and adjudges it <hi>to the fire,</hi> hard Words, hard Sentence indeed, why is there no good in it at all, or wou'd he burn the Good with what he calls bad, and is this equitable? I humbly conceive our Author is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken when he ſays, that <hi>the</hi> Notingham <hi>Sermon cauſes Contentions:</hi> No, the true Cauſe is graceleſs Miniſters oppoſing of it. Me thinks it would be more to their Credit prudently to let it alone upon their own Account, for when they keep mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, growling and ſcolding at it, it does but give People Ground to ſuſpect they are of that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Tribe and Party themſelves, which is therein detected and cenſured.</p>
            <p>And to conclude Sir, I beg leave to return your Compliment, ſo far as to adviſe you to conſider, if your preſent Performance, which is fill'd with ſo many unjuſt Invectives againſt God's Work and Servants, doſn't deſerve a hard Fate, but I am not ſo earneſt for your burning it, as your repenting over your Impiety in the Compoſure of it,</p>
