            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Introductory remarks.</head>
            <p>THE year 1798 ſeemed to have been marked by Providence as pregnant with uncommon fatality to the people of the United States. Philadelphia, New-York, Boſton, Portſmouth, and ſeveral places of inferior note, were doomed to ſee their ſtreets depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and their inhabitants cut off by a mercileſs peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The dreadful <hi>Yellow Fever,</hi> which had lately made ſuch lamentable ravages in ſome of our capital towns, appeared this year with increaſed violence.— New-London, though heretofore remarkable for the ſalubrity of its air, had nevertheleſs its portion in the bitter cup.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the immediate cauſes of this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly viſitation, the opinions of the philoſopher, the phyſician, and the divine, are at variance. By ſome it was attributed to infection imported from abroad; by others to domeſtic origin from putrid animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; by others to the exceſſive and continued heat of the weather; and by ſome to the judgment of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in puniſhment of national iniquities. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the United States, it is true, had been for ſome time looking for a diminution of their numbers: but it was a diminution by other means which they expected. Preparations for hoſtilities were actively going forward, the din of arms reſounded in all our ports, and the noiſe of war was heard in every corner of the land. But, like David, we were deſtined to "fall into the hands of God rather than man." The buſtle of politics ſuddenly died away, the noiſe and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033890_0004_0ffa5520191f4258"/>pomp of military parade ceaſed; and in their ſtead a general ſtillneſs and diſmay prevailed, buſineſs and cares of every kind but that of ſelf-preſervation were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the public prints were either ſuſpended or filled with the records of diſeaſe and death.</p>
            <p>Thus in the ſpace of one month was the face of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican affairs entirely changed. How were the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fallen! how were the hopes of the great deſtroyed!</p>

            <head>A ſhort Account, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON the 26th of Auguſt the inhabitants of New-London were ſomewhat alarmed by the death of capt. Elijah Bingham, keeper of the Union Coffee-Houſe, after an illneſs of but two or three days. His funeral was immediately attended, it being Sunday, by the Union Lodge of Free Maſons, of which he was a member, and an unuſual number of people whom the ſolemnity of the ceremony and eſteem for the deceaſed drew together. It was, however, remarked at the time, that if the extreme hot weather continued it would be long before the burying-ground would be ſo thronged again: and the remark was too fully verified. Two days after three perſons in the neighborhood di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſame diſeaſe, which was ſoon aſcertained to be the dreadful <hi>Yellow Fever,</hi> The citizens now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their danger and removed from the infected part, the corporation and civil authority left their poſts, and a <hi>Health Committee,</hi> conſiſting of Meſſieurs John Woodward, John Ingraham, James Baxter, and Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer Holt, jun. were appointed to attend to the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the dead, the care of the ſick, and the relief of the indigent. The ſickneſs rapidly increaſing, the next week witneſſed no leſs than twenty-five deaths, among whom were ſome of the moſt reſpectable characters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the city or ſtate, and the wife, a ſon and a daughter of the late capt. Bingham, in the vicinity of whoſe houſe the contagion was yet principally confined. This very great mortality among ſo ſmall a number of people filled the citizens with conſternation; the dead were interred with all poſſible ſpeed, and without the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033890_0006_0ffa553849b2dd48"/>leaſt formality, the hearſe being commonly attended only by the ſexton and two or three black aſſiſtants, one of whom died of the prevailing diſeaſe. Laying out the corpſe, ornamenting the coffin and covering it with a pall, &amp;c. were generally diſpenſed with, every conſideration giving way to the important duty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the ſafety and convenience of the ſurvivors.— The country people naturally ſhunned the peſtilential air of the devoted city, and the adjoining towns took meaſures for preventing our flying inhabitants from ſpreading the infection.</p>
            <p>From this period the progreſs of the diſeaſe was varied according to the favourable or unfavourable changes in the air, the effects of which were viſibly perceived on the perſons of the ſick and the number of new caſes which occurred. That portion of the city where it firſt appeared being almoſt entirely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, it gradually extended into moſt of the compact parts within the diſtance of an hundred rods; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the violence of its ſymptoms and frequency of its attacks as the ſeaſon advanced, and by the 14th of October it had ſo far abated that the citizens began to return to their dwellings and reſume their uſual oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations.</p>
            <p>The mortality within the aforeſaid limits, (viz. an hundred rods north and ſouth from the market) was equal to that among the ſame number of inhabitants in any part of Philadelphia in the ſame length of time. In Bank-ſtreet, below the market, to the ſouth corner of Goldenhill-ſtreet, of thoſe who did not remove from the ſpot, but two perſons over 12 years of age eſcaped the infection. In this ſpace, excluding the buildings which were evacuated and the people who fled, are 15 houſes, ſhops and ſtores, in which lived or were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed 92 perſons, of whom 90 had the fever, 33 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and 2 eſcaped entirely. The deaths above the market were not in ſo great a proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033890_0007_0ffa554e386f1908"/>By October 28th the fever had nearly diſappeared, after having, in about eight weeks, cut off 81 perſons, a liſt of whoſe names are hereafter ſubjoined.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Phyſicians.</head>
               <p>AS during the ravages of this terrible diſorder me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical aſſiſtance was the greateſt concern of the people, it may not be improper to mention their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation in that reſpect. Early in the ſickneſs all the phyſicians, but one who was too much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to practiſe, and another, Dr. Rawſon, who was violently attacked by the fever, deſerted the city, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Dr. SAMUEL H. P. LEE, to whoſe lot it fell alone and unaſſiſted to combat the fury of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful peſtilence. And his conduct on the occaſion was ſuch as will call the warmeſt ſentiment of gratitude and eſteem from the citizens of New-London as long as the remembrance of the <hi>Yellow Fever</hi> ſhall exiſt in their minds. He cheerfully ſuſtained the arduous taſk of viſiting and ſupplying with medicine from 30 to 50 patients daily, notwithſtanding the great fatigue and danger of infection to which he peculiarly expoſed himſelf. How many owe their ſafety to his ſkill and aſſiduity it is impoſſible to know; but in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there are many now enjoying the invaluable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of life and health who but for his benevolent care would have been tenants of the houſe of reſt. In the diſcharge of the important duty to which he ſo nobly devoted himſelf he was ſeized with the prevailing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but after a ſtruggle of a few days was happily preſerved from falling a ſacrifice to his humanity. On his confinement Dr. James Lee, with a zeal and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy that does him the higheſt honour, left his reſidence and buſineſs in the remote parts of the town and repaired to the city, where he ably ſupplied the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033890_0008_0ffa5554c70d34d0"/>place of his kinſman till there was no more occaſion for his ſervices. The <hi>Committee,</hi> alſo, had written to ſome of the neighbouring phyſicians, requeſting their aſſiſtance; but none came to our relief, ſaving Dr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos Collins, from Weſterly, who could not remain an unmoved ſpectator of our diſtreſs. Mr. Gurdon J. Miller, likewiſe, a gentleman of much profeſſional abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, induced by the ſufferings of his fellow-citizens, commenced practice in a line he had never deſigned to have been found in, and alſo refuſed any compenſation for his unwearied and meritorious exertions. <hi>Such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct needs no praiſe or comment: its reward is found in the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were our pilots through the fearful ſtorm.</p>

               <head>Of the Poor.</head>
               <p>THE diſtreſſes of the labouring poor in this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected calamity were unavoidably great. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their ordinary means of ſupport, and unable to remove where employment and ſubſiſtence might be had, they were expoſed to the evils of poverty and danger of ſickneſs united. To alleviate theſe a great part of the attention of the Committee was directed. But their utmoſt vigilance would have been of little avail, without the charitable aſſiſtance of the adjoining towns and our own wealthy citizens. By their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they were enabled to afford to the neceſſitous a conſiderable degree of comfort and ſecurity. Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of money, produce, &amp;c. (a catalogue of which are annexed) were daily received and diſtributed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the urgency of circumſtances; the courthouſe, being in an elevated and healthy ſituation, was converted into an hoſpital; and medical aſſiſtance and nurſes were provided for thoſe who fell under the care of the Committee, while others in a ſuperior ſituation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033890_0009_0ffa556626d6cb78"/>might have periſhed for the want of them. In fact, ſuch was the difficulty of procuring nurſes and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that ſome of our moſt opulent citizens were ſeen going from houſe to houſe with money in their hands, offering any price for aſſiſtance even for a ſingle night in vain. This reluctance to attend the ſick was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſeveral having loſt their lives by infection taken while employed in that office. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this diſcouraging circumſtance, many were found whoſe humanity would not ſuffer them to withhold the leaſt kind office in their power in a time of ſuch unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled diſtreſs.</p>

               <p>THE Health Committee being appointed on the ſpur of this melancholy occaſion, and the civil authority devolving principally upon them, ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their proceedings will be given. They had power to do whatever in their judgment the exigencies of the caſe ſhould require. They accordingly, being ſenſible of the helpleſs ſituation to which the poor muſt be reduced by the ſuſpenſion of all buſineſs, and the diſtreſs they muſt ſuffer when attacked by ſickneſs, made them the chief object of their care. Vigilant and perſevering at all ſeaſons in the execution of their new functions, they ſought out proper ſubjects of their attention wherever they could be found, adminiſtering to them the neceſſaries and comforts of life, keeping a watchful eye over their health, and providing the moſt prompt and effectual aſſiſtance whenever they were ſeized by the diſeaſe.

Yet with an impartial hand and firm undeviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtep did they proceed till the expiration of their office.

               <p>WHATEVER might have been the different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions reſpecting the cauſe of this diſeaſe, the data from which a concluſion on the ſubject muſt be drawn are extremely few and obvious. The idea of imported infection, having neither fact or argument to ſupport it, muſt of courſe be abandoned. From do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic cauſes, then, are we to account for its origin. And here might be mentioned a number of different articles in the neighborhood where the diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, to which many attributed its origin. But as the opinions on this ſubject are extremely various and contradictory, and as it belongs properly to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the faculty, it is therefore left for their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. It ſhould, however, be remarked, that the weather for ſome weeks previous to the appearance of the fever was uncommonly dry and warm, as every one obſerved. Light breezes and calms had long prevailed, no rain had fallen for two months, vegetation was parched, wells were dried, and the crops within a few miles diſtance were about half cut off. The mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer frequently ſtood in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033890_0011_0ffa558591e36ff0"/>ſhade at 96 degrees, and ſeveral times at 98, a height never before witneſſed here; and ſea-captains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that they never felt ſo much inconvenience from the warmth in the Weſt-Indies. In this ſtate of the atmoſphere, when animal and vegetable ſubſtances are ſo liable to become putrid and engender a poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous air, ſomething might eaſily be found to kindle the fatal ſpark of contagion into a blaze. And it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought evident, even to a demonſtration, that we owe this viſit of this deſtructive peſtilence neither to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, extraordinary or hidden cauſes, but to domeſtic origin from the ſole action of <hi>heat,</hi> aſſiſted by the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and calmneſs of the atmoſphere.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Hiſtory of the diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>IT may not be improper to remark, that almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon who remained in the central parts of the city, particularly thoſe contiguous to Bank-ſtreet, or whoſe buſineſs called them there, although otherwiſe in perfect health, laboured under a high ſtate of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition,</hi> being conſtantly affected with a ſlight and tranſient head-ache, a white furred tongue, and ſmall ſhooting pains through the ſyſtem. And thoſe who came near this ſpot from other parts of the town very ſenſibly felt a difference in the ſtate of the air produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a greater or leſs degree ſome of theſe ſymptoms. This was undoubtedly owing to the atmoſphere being impregnated with noxious <hi>miaſmata</hi> or the <hi>ſeeds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,</hi> which only required an exciting cauſe, ſuch as violent exerciſe, exceſſive fear, expoſure to cold or damp air, &amp;c. to kindle the flame.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe generally announced its attack by a ſenſe of chillineſs or common ague-fit, attended with a pain in the head, and ſometimes in the back and limbs. In the more dangerous caſes the chillineſs was not always
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033890_0012_0ffa559f38f77f00"/>perceived. The attack was uſually preceded by lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and reſtleſſneſs, and a ſtrange and undeſcribable feeling through the whole ſyſtem. On its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the patient was frequently ſeized with nauſea and vomiting, obſtinate coſtiveneſs, and ſoreneſs of the whole body. The coſtiveneſs in ſome few caſes could not be removed by the moſt powerful purgatives; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel and jalap, ſalts, oil, and injections, were repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without effect; and the paſſage from the ſtomach to the bowels ſeemed entirely cloſed until death. From this cauſe might proceed the load and preſſure in the ſtomach, ſometimes higher and ſometimes lower, which, with very few exceptions, always attended the diſeaſe, and frequently continued ſome days after the patient was apparently recovered.</p>
               <p>During the firſt ſtage the progreſs of the diſeaſe was commonly marked with gentle fluſhings in the face, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternating with a pale, ſhrunk, deſponding and yellow countenance—the eyes were red, and their veſſels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſwoln with blood—ſome were almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally blind, and others could not bear the leaſt degree of light—but theſe ſymptoms, with the pain in the head, generally ſubſided after bleeding and other evacuations. The ſoreneſs of the muſcles, the diſtreſs at the ſtomach, and pain in the head and back, correſponding with the extreme pains mentioned by writers on the fever of the Weſt-Indies many years ago, called the "Break-bone Fever," continued—with the ſkin dry and parched, the tongue covered with a dark brown ſcurf, frequently ſcaling off and leaving the tongue red and ſometimes ſore—the fur was ſometimes very white, and ſometimes ſcarcely viſible. Delirium, ravings, and great involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtrength frequently appeared about this period, leſs violent in ſome than others, though equally dangerous. But ſome perfectly retained their ſenſes, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of little pain, remaining in a ſtupid calm and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference—upon being aſked how they were, they always
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033890_0013_0ffa55bad9350c78"/>anſwered "very well"—their eyes were ſomewhat ſunk, though red and inflamed, their cheeks purple and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, their extremities cold, their ſkin dry, and the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al nauſea and oppreſſion at the ſtomach. The pulſes of the ſick were variable; ſometimes high, quick and ſtrong, and at others low, quick, and very tenſe, like a ſtretched cord; and always roſe upon bleeding.</p>
               <p>This account principally deſcribes the ſymptoms on the firſt or ſecond day. If the diſeaſe was not by this time taken in hand by the phyſician, it was for the moſt part too late to be of any ultimate benefit. The patient now began to bring up matter from his ſtomach of the color and conſiſtence of coffee-grounds, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blood—blood iſſued from the mouth, noſe, and eyes—the fever raged without any intermiſſion—reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration became quick and laborious—the ſkin and whites of the eyes became more yellow—ſometimes he alſo ſunk into a comatoſe or ſleepy ſtate, from which he could hardly be rouſed by any means, and then but for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant—the eyes aſſumed a glaſſy appearance—the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance exhibited a cadaverous hue, and a certain ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of death which is better underſtood than deſcribed —with the black vomit, black and fetid ſtools came on —and the patient, often loſing his ſenſes, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them to the laſt, on the fourth or fifth day falls a prey to this moſt deſtructive malady.</p>
               <p>In a few inſtances glandular ſwellings, or buboes, that deadly ſymptom in the Mediterranean plague, made their appearance. In one they were driven back into the ſyſtem by ſtrong mercurial applications, and the diſeaſe terminated favorably; in a ſecond caſe the patient alſo recovered; but in a third the iſſue proved fatal.</p>
               <p>In the latter ſtages of the diſeaſe a ſuppreſſion of urine was commonly a ſymptom of great danger, but did not always indicate death, as ſeveral recovered after an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033890_0014_0ffa55d7d84ed6e0"/>ſtoppage of the urinary paſſages for one, two or three days.</p>
               <p>Some in their laſt moments inſenſibly ſprang from their beds, and required three or four to hold them; others would ſcream like a calf dragging to the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's block; while many at this period gave directions concerning their affairs, bid their attendants adieu, and ſurrendered to their fate with the utmoſt calmneſs and reſignation.</p>
               <p>If the patient ſurvived the fifth or ſixth day, he was generally out of danger; or if the phyſician, by large quantities of mercury applied internally and externally, could produce a <hi>ſalivation,</hi> it was a favorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and never failed to prove ſucceſsful. When the diſeaſe terminated fortunately they ſoon recovered, but were extremely liable to a relapſe, from too much exerciſe, taking cold, or uſing improper diet, in which caſe they ſcarcely ever conquered the ſecond aſſault; and by this means ſome of our moſt valuable citizens loſt their lives.</p>
               <p>In ſome the diſeaſe ſtruck inwardly, and without any violent external ſymptoms gradually undermined the conſtitution, and carried off the patient in eight or ten days.</p>
               <p>On perſons of an intemperate habit the ſeeds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion operated like ſparks of fire upon tinder, and in ſpite of every effort of medicine raged with irreſiſtible violence till the vitals were conſumed, generally termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating its progreſs upon the fifth day.</p>
               <p>In many, however, a ſweat and vomit, with bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and purging, removed the ſymptoms in a few hours; and in very few inſtances where medicine had a free action did the diſorder prove fatal.</p>
               <p>THE courſe of medicine which generally proved ſucceſsful was—judicious bleeding, ſweating, purging off the bilious redundancy of acrimonious matter in the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033890_0015_0ffa55ec739c91f8"/>ſtomach, bowels, &amp;c. and ſalivation by mercury as ſoon as could poſſibly be procured. Bliſtering, warm baths, and injections, were adminiſtered with much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>It is the opinion of Dr. S. H. P. Lee, whoſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, at leaſt, of becoming a judge in the caſe, will not be diſputed, that this diſeaſe is as eaſily managed, if taken at its commencement, as any diſorder to which the human ſyſtem is ſubject, and that the extraordinary mortality incident to ſuch peſtilential viſitations is owing in a great meaſure to an unhappy idea that the diſeaſe, from a ſpecific quality of the contagion, is in itſelf fatal to all without diſtinction whom it attacks.</p>
               <p>THE caſe of one perſon in this fever was perhaps worth mentioning. He lived a few miles from the city, but was in town upon a wharf a few rods from the place where the contagion firſt made its appearance, and was exerciſing himſelf ſomewhat violently, after ſunſet, and in a conſiderable perſpiration. In this ſituation he was ſuddenly ſtruck by a nauſeous and uncommon ſmell, occaſioning a ſickiſhneſs at the ſtomach. He mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this to his companion, and proceeded home, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to perceive the ſmell until he was ſome miles on his way. On going to ſupper he found his appetite much impaired, but did not think it deſerved remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and took no more notice of the matter. In about fifty-two hours, however, without having been in the city ſince, he was awakened from his ſleep by a fit of ſhivering and pain in the head, with a ſtrong recurrence of the nauſeous ſmell inhaled on the wharf. This ſcent was removed by a vomit; and the pain gradually left its firſt ſeat and concentred in the ſtomach, from which part it went off on the criſis of the fever, which took place on the fourth and fifth days. The preſſure in his breaſt continued ſome days after, and the legs, which ſuffered an excruciating pain and ſoreneſs, exactly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033890_0016_0ffa560f9ec2aa10"/>to the tooth-ache, remained ſo feeble that for ſix weeks after he was unable to mount his horſe without aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In another inſtance, the perſon attacked was at his uſual employment in the printing-office of the Bee, ſtanding near an open window, when an offenſive ſmell was perceived from a neighbouring houſe where they were removing a perſon who was dying with the fever. The windows were immediately ſhut, but he felt a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea and want of appetite, until about twelve o'clock at night, when he was violently attacked by the common ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. Although he was of a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary conſtitution and always perſpired freely on the ſlighteſt occaſion, the medicines given to excite a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration produced not the ſmalleſt effect, the body was inſtantly rendered coſtive, no kind of phyſic would ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and every ſymptom rapidly increaſed. At length, in thirty hours from the commencement of the attack, the fever gave way, the coſtiveneſs abating on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond bleeding, large drops of ſweat burſt out on every part of the body, the medicines remained on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the vomiting ceaſed, the pain diminiſhed, and the patient ſoon recovered.</p>
               <p>In another caſe, in a corpulent ſubject, the diſeaſe went off by a profuſe natural ſweat, without any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſiſtance whatever.</p>
               <p>In another, a ſevere attack was carried off by a very powerful doſe of Lee's New-London Bilious Pills; and in others it yielded to repeated purges alone.</p>

               <head>Miſcellaneous obſervations.</head>
               <p>ON caſting an eye over the liſt of perſons deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be readily obſerved, that the ravages of this diſeaſe were not confined to any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of people, but embraced indiſcriminately all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033890_0017_0ffa5622a2feb5b0"/>who came within its reach. It is true, thoſe of a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary conſtitution or vitiated habit ſuffered more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely than others, few of them recovering from an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack; but in general, as noted before reſpecting a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpace, not many of any habit or conſtitution eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infection. It was not here, as in ſome places, that the contagion ſhewed itſelf only in parts unuſually filthy or confined. The houſes where it appeared were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally large, not crowded with inhabitants, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to perſons of reſpectability. And the mortality ſwept off perhaps a greater proportion of the wealthy than of any other claſs of citizens. It will alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that more men than women have died of the diſorder, in the proportion of about four to three. But this will not appear ſtrange, when we conſider that men, by the nature of their employment, are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to attacks than women; their buſineſs calls them into the ſtreets, houſes, ſhops, &amp;c. where the diſeaſe rages, while their wives are employed at home in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic concerns; and thus they alone have been taken off by the peſtilence, while the reſt of their families, remaining out of the infected limits, have continued in perfect ſafety.</p>
               <p>IT was carefully remarked, during the progreſs of this diſeaſe, that the infection was confined to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part of the city, and was not ſpread or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by infected perſons, clothes, or other ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. People who had been in the infected part ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carried the diſeaſe out with them, and there died with it; but without any other perſon receiving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from them. Two or three ſolitary inſtances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, occurred, where the diſeaſe was taken from an infected perſon, without any previous communication with the contagious ſpot. General Marvin, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent phyſician of Norwich, was attacked while attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Stewart, at Mr. Haughton's, ſeven miles from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033890_0018_0ffa5641c5fe5ce0"/>the city, and went home and died. But no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is believed, was taken off by the diſorder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having been nurſing, or otherwiſe in the infected ſpot: and in general, thoſe who lived at only a few rods diſtance, and avoided any nearer approach, were as ſecure from the effects of the fever as though they had removed an hundred miles in the country.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH people generally made uſe of ſome kind of preventative againſt infection, ſuch as ſmoking tobacco, chewing garlic, and ſmelling of vinegar, cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, &amp;c. yet it was not obſerved in the end that they were thereby preſerved from the effects of the diſeaſe. Many died of it, who were the moſt careful to guard againſt it; while others who took no manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution whatever eſcaped. It ſhould nevertheleſs be remembered, that temperance was here the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative; and a habit kept open by gentle doſes of phyſic taken occaſionally was by far the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to encounter the diſorder.</p>
               <p>IN the commencement of this diſeaſe very few eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped who were ſeverely attacked. But as the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grew more temperate, and the phyſicians became better acquainted with the nature of the diſorder, they reſcued more from its devouring rage; and in the laſt ſtages of its duration it but ſeldom proved fatal. The whole number who were ſick is computed at 350, of whom leſs than one fourth died. At firſt ſcarcely a third ſurvived; but the mortality was leſs in proportion as the diſeaſe advanced, and towards its termination, of thoſe who were affected nearly nine out of ten reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

               <head>Moral reflections.</head>
               <p>IN times like theſe, how many circumſtances occur to wound the ſenſibility and pain the heart! Such an
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033890_0019_0ffa56595fe91528"/>uncommon and alarming calamity could not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt unexpected effects on the minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus it has been ſeen, when children have been attacked by this plague, that parents, forgetting the accuſtomed duties of humanity, and attentive only to their perſonal ſafety, have refuſed even to ſee their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and ſuffered them to periſh without their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Others have been deſerted by their brethren and ſiſters, and died without beholding their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Parents have been forſaken by their children, and had their eyes cloſed by ſtrangers. And even the cloſer ties of huſband and wife have been diſregarded by the dread inſpired by this terrible diſeaſe. Could it be believed that ſuch things would have exiſted in an enlightened chriſtian land? Yet ſuch things were ſeen in America, and ſomething nearly approaching to them in New-London; and ſuch will ever be the caſe in any country where an all-deſtroying peſtilence makes its dreadful appearance. Humanity, friendſhip, parental and filial affection, are all ſwallowed up in the terror that anxiety for our own preſervation excites; and we fly on the wings of fear to any place of ſecurity, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every other concern behind. Theſe remarks, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, muſt be underſtood as applying only to thoſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid perſons who are frightened at the leaſt ſymptom of danger, and want ſufficient ſtrength of mind to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to liſten to the voice of reaſon or obey its dictates. Others of a different temperament nothing can alarm or tempt from their duty; and on occaſions like this their ſervices are an invaluable acquiſition.</p>
               <p>WHAT ſtriking inſtances of the tranſitorineſs of life does ſuch a diſeaſe afford! We ſee men exulting in the bloom of youth and prime of health and ſtrength, in three or four ſhort days numbered with the dead. Our gayeſt companions, our lovelieſt friends, in leſs than a week are laid in the duſt. When we are daily
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033890_0020_0ffa1a995da06578"/>witneſſing theſe ſcenes around us, who can avoid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, often and feelingly, that <hi>his turn may be next</hi>! Yet the mind, when habituated to the moſt afflictive and extraordinary events, becomes hardened, and views them with unconcern and indifference. Diſeaſe and death, the moſt dreadful accidents that can afflict the human frame, when made familiar to the ſight, ceaſe to inſpire dread, and are ranked with the moſt common occurrences.</p>
