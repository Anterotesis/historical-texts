            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>OUR Saviour upbraided the</hi> Pharisees, <hi>Men that boasted high of their Knowledge and Practice in Religion, and who liv'd in a Time of great Expectations, with their Stupidity in not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the then-present Aspects of Divine Providence, and moral Prognosticks of the Day.</hi> Ye Hypocrites, ye can discern the Face of the Skie: but can ye not discern the Signs of the Times? <hi>From which it has been an Observation, "That it's an important Duty lying upon the People of GOD, to labour after a Skill in</hi> discerning the Signs of the Times, <hi>which we live in."—Now if I may be allow'd to have in any Measure</hi> Understanding of the Times, <hi>it seems that altho' a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous GOD has been testifying against his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The blessed GOD has by surprizing Ways began among us, in almost all Parts of this Land (as well as in other Places abroad) a most signal</hi> Reviving of his Work; <hi>and is</hi> renewing our Days as of old. <hi>Herein we see a marvellous fulfilling of that Scripture,</hi> When the Enemy cometh in like a Flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a Standard. <hi>Ah! what a melancholy Prospect

But how has the cloudy Face of Things, even on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, very much chang'd; and a more smiling Scene open'd before us!</hi> When the LORD turned again the Captivity of <hi>Zion,</hi> we were like them that dream: <hi>or like</hi> Peter, <hi>when miraculously deliver'd out of Prison,</hi> he wist not that it was true, <hi>which was done by the Angel; but thought he saw a Vision.</hi>—Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the Heavens and the Earth, and the Desire of all Nations shall come, and I will fill this House with Glory; <hi>seems to be the Language of the</hi> LORD of Hosts, <hi>in his present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, wherein he is</hi> marching through the Land, <hi>not in Indignation, nor for Correction, but in Mercy. May all the dear Children of GOD be</hi> stirring up themselves to take Hold of his Strength, <hi>and labour by Prayers of Faith to retain the Presence of his Grace; that</hi> He who has begun a good Work among us, <hi>may</hi> perform it to the Day of CHRIST, <hi>may</hi> perfect what concerns us, <hi>and</hi> not forsake the Work of his own Hands. <hi>So will</hi> Salvation be nigh to us, <hi>and</hi> Glory dwell in our Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know not what Constructions may be put upon it; but I can't forbear, on this Occasion, transcribing some remarkable Passages, of a prophetick Aspect, from a printed Sermon of that Man of GOD, the late Dr.</hi> COTTON MATHER. (<hi>On</hi> Rev. 21. 21.)</p>
            <p>
               <q>There are many Arguments (says he) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us, that our glorious LORD will have a <hi>holy City</hi> in AMERICA; a City, the <hi>Street</hi> whereof will be <hi>pure Gold.</hi>—Yea, the DAY IS AT HAND, when that Voice will be heard, <hi>Put on thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Garments,</hi> O America, <hi>the holy City!</hi>—We
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004710_0004_0000000000000000"/>
are sorry, we are troubled, that the <hi>good Seed of the Word,</hi> falling on the other <hi>three Soils</hi> has bro't forth so little <hi>good Fruit,</hi> and for so little a while. But our glorious LORD will order that <hi>good Seed</hi> ere long to be cast upon the fertile Regions of <hi>America,</hi> and it shall here find a <hi>good Ground,</hi> where it shall bring forth <hi>Fruit,</hi> unto Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unto Perpetuity! When our LORD uttered the <hi>Parable,</hi> to which I have now allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we read, <hi>He went into a</hi> SHIP, and from thence instructed the <hi>Multitude that stood on the</hi> SHORE. I <hi>will</hi> believe, that in this very <hi>Action,</hi> there was a <hi>Parable</hi> and a <hi>Prophesy.</hi> By NAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATION there will be brought the Word of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST, unto a Multitude afar off: and as the <hi>Ships cover the Sea,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> (and thou AMERICA too) <hi>shall be filled with the Knowledge of the glorious</hi> LORD.

                  <hi>Babylon</hi> will be accompany'd with the Loss of her <hi>American</hi> Interest; but when 'tis diverted from her, certainly it will then serve <hi>the City of GOD.</hi>—It will be impossible, that the Effect of the Essays, used by Men filled with the <hi>Spirit of</hi> CHRIST, and able to do more than all that was done in the primitive Times (For, <hi>when He giveth the Word, great will be the Army of them that publish it)</hi> should not be a Conquest of <hi>America,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Among all the</hi> Signs of the Times, <hi>I can think of none that looks more favourably, and promises better to us, than the restoring of a</hi> Zeal <hi>for Protestant</hi> Principles <hi>in Religion, for those Divine and ancient Truths which are the peculiar Glories of the Gospel, and</hi> Things which accompany Salvation.—<hi>This is the</hi> Faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints: <hi>This the</hi> Doctrine, which is according to Godliness.—<hi>Was it not by this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Doctrine, these Evangelical Principles, as the moral Means, under the Power of the Spirit of GOD, that the</hi> Apostles <hi>and their Fellow-Labourers in the Word, subdued the Kingdom of Darkness, set up the Kingdom of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and bro't forth Fruit in all the World?</hi> So mightily grew the Word of GOD, and prevailed.—<hi>Was it not by the same Doctrine, that the</hi> Reformers <hi>began and carry'd on those happy Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church, which gave such a Shock to the Papal Empire?—Was it not by the same Doctrine, that the</hi> Puritans <hi>were so useful in their Preaching, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the true Protestant Interest, and to promote the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:004710_0006_0000000000000000"/>
Conversion and Edification of Souls?—Was not this Doctrine laid in the Foundation of the first Churches of</hi> New-England? <hi>And have they not hitherto by the Favour of Heaven, stood on this</hi> Pillar and Ground of Truth, <hi>the</hi> Truth as it is in JESUS?—<hi>Has not this very obviously been the reigning Doctrine, wherever the</hi> Word preached <hi>has had any</hi> conspicuous <hi>Success among us, from Time to Time, in the</hi> general <hi>Awakning and Converting of Sinners?—In fine, Was it not by an uncommon</hi> Hand of GOD <hi>with such Preaching, that the illustrious</hi> Work <hi>of the present Day, thro' all these Provinces, was first set on Foot, &amp; happily advanced?—Thus, with uncontroulable Evidence, has the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Grace and Truth put a</hi> Distinction <hi>upon these sacred Principles,</hi> the Doctrines of Grace, <hi>by glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously owning &amp; crowning them with a Divine Blessing from Age to Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I wou'd not be understood to pretend, that</hi> these Doctrines <hi>are every where and at all Times attended with</hi> equal <hi>Power and the</hi> same <hi>Effects. No; for they had not always an</hi> invariable <hi>Success, even under the Dispensation of</hi> inspired <hi>Preachers.</hi> "Who is <hi>Paul,</hi> or who is <hi>Apollo,</hi> but Ministers, by whom ye believed, even as the LORD gave to every Man? So then, neither is he that planteth, any Thing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that watereth: but GOD, that giveth the Increase." <hi>And with adorable Liberty, a sovereign GOD either suspends or</hi> commands the Blessing, <hi>when and where He pleases; and</hi> sendeth by the Hand of whom He will.—<hi>Nor wou'd I be understood abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to confine</hi> real Christianity, <hi>or a</hi> valid Ministry, <hi>to Those fully in this Scheme of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the Nature of the Thing makes it necessary, that the Words should be thus understood in this Text. All Time and even Eternity it self being always present
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004710_0019_0000000000000000"/>
in the infinite Mind of GOD, whatever Counsels were at any Time entertain'd, must have been at all Times, and even before all Time, entertain'd by him. But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is set in View the Object of the Decree of Election. <hi>According as he hath chosen</hi> US.—<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving predestinated</hi> US <hi>to the Adoption of Children.</hi> By which cannot be understood these <hi>Ephesians</hi> only, to whom this Epistle was immediately directed: but all that then were, or ever shall be true Believers in CHRIST, and adopted into the Number of his Children; and none but such. Or in other Words, all and only those who ever have been, or ever shall be Heirs of eternal Salvation. The Text plainly shews us, that Election and Adoption are of equal Extent. For if these <hi>Ephesians</hi> were, all others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise were <hi>predestinated to the Adoption of Children,</hi> who are privileged with so near a Relation to GOD. And as all the Children of GOD, and none but they, shall inherit eternal Life, so all that shall inherit eternal Life, and none but they, were <hi>prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated to the Adoption of Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. These Words also set before us what are the predestinated and fore-determined Price and Terms of Salvation to all the Elect. They are <hi>chosen in him;</hi> and <hi>predestinated to the Adoption of Children by</hi> JESUS CHRIST. The Means and the End were united in the divine Decree. GOD never design'd Salvation to any Unbeliever: but eternally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to give his own Son a Ransom for the Elect; and to give an Interest in him by Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Title to eternal Life, unto all those that are chosen to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have here likewise the pre-determined Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of all the Elect, by which they shall be made
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004710_0020_0000000000000000"/>
meet to partake of the Salvation appointed for them. <hi>That we should be holy, and without Blame before him in Love.</hi> Those who are chosen to Salvation, are chosen also to Holiness of Life, as a necessary Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. It is by GOD's Decree as well as by his revealed Will an establish'd Truth, that <hi>without Holiness no Man shall see the LORD.</hi>—And it is further remarkable in the Words, that none are chosen to Salvation, because GOD foresaw they would be holy: but we are <hi>chosen that we should be holy.</hi>—The Holiness of the Elect is not the Cause, but the Consequence of the Decree. This brings me to the last Thing I would take Notice of in the Words, which is,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The only Motive (if I may so speak) by which GOD was acted in the Decree of Election. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good Pleasure of his Will.</hi> He was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self his own Motive and End. As there was nothing eternally existing but GOD, so there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of himself to influence his eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. But of this I shall afterwards have Occasion to speak more particularly.—Thus I have given a brief and general View of the Words before us; and shall now endeavour a more distinct Consideration of them under these Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That GOD has according to the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Will, from all Eternity, elected some to everlasting Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All that GOD has elected, are chosen to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by and through the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All who are thus chosen to Salvation, shall be sanctified and made meet to partake of it.</p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>GOD has according to the good Pleasure of his Will, from all Eternity, elected some of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to everlasting Life.</hi>—The main Business before
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004710_0021_0000000000000000"/>
me is to clear up this Proposition; I shall therefore be something particular, in considering what we are to <hi>understand</hi> by the Decree of <hi>Election;</hi> in <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> this Truth; and in answering some <hi>Objections</hi> that ly in our Way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I shall attempt a <hi>Description</hi> of this Decree. And by the <hi>Decree of Election</hi> I understand <hi>God's eternal Purpose, according to the good Pleasure of his Will, to give Grace and Glory to a certain Number of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men.</hi>—I shall here only consider the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, as my Text does, with Relation to Men, and not to Angels, as the Objects of it. For though the eternal Counsels of God must have consider'd and determin'd the State of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether of a superiour or inferiour Nature; yet it don't so much concern us, what were his Dispensations towards the Angels, as towards our selves; nor is this so particularly revealed to us in his Word.—That I may give a clearer View of what I intend by this Description, I shall consider the several Parts of it something distinctly, with some Evidences of the Justice and Propriety of each of them.—This is not the Place to prove the Truth of the Proposition; and to offer the Evidences of such a Decree of God: But upon the Supposal of such a Decree, to consider what it's necessary from the Nature and Word of God to understand by it.</p>
            <p>I describe God's Decree to be his eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. For though we have no adequate Idea of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor of him <hi>who inhabits Eternity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> yet we must suppose, either that all God's Determinations with Respect to us were eternal, or that they had a Beginning in Time. If the latter, there must have been a Time wherein God did not know, or did not conclude, what the future State of his Creatures
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004710_0022_0000000000000000"/>
should be; which I think none dare suppose. We may not imagine the Counsels of an infinite Mind like our own, gradual and successive, temporary and mutable. This were to attribute to the glorious God a State of Forgetfulness and Inactivity, or Doubtfulness and Uncertainty, before he came to a Result in his Mind how he would be glorified in his Works; which is infinitely unworthy of him.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we must consider of the Decrees of God as of God himself decreeing; and consequently if he himself be eternal, his Decrees must likewise be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. To conceive of God's Knowledge and Will to be something distinct from his Nature, is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him a Composition of Parts and Powers, which is altogether inconsistent with his being infinite; and if we consider these as the necessary Result of his Nature, they must be (as his Nature is) eternal.—The special Acts of God's Purpose or Counsel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed be considered as essential to God. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>husing <hi>Peter</hi> (for Instance) to Salvation, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so necessarily to flow from his Essence. He might have been the same God, if <hi>Peter</hi> had not been elected. But that Will of God, by which <hi>Peter</hi> was chosen to Salvation, does belong to his Being; and must necessarily act from Eternity, in that Way which is most agreeable to all the Perfections of his Nature.—Thus, in whatever View we consider this Case, the Decree of God must be his eternal Counsel: <hi>He hath from the Beginning</hi> (i. e. from Eternity) <hi>chosen us to Salvation,</hi> 2 Thes. ii. 13.</p>
            <p>I consider the Decree of Election as an Act of Sovereignty, <hi>according to the good Pleasure of his Will;</hi> and so it is consider'd in the Text, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd before. Every rational Agent must, in all he does, be always acted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>enced by the highest
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004710_0023_0000000000000000"/>
Motive and Inducement before him. But to suppose any higher Motive to the eternal GOD than himself is to suppose something higher than the highest, which is absurd. To imagine any Cause of GOD'S Will or Decree out of himself, is to suppose something in GOD which is an Effect; and so to assign a Cause of the first Cause, which is equally absurd.—We cannot indeed in Propriety of Speech attribute any Motive or End to GOD after the Manner that they are found in us; but only in a Way of analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. We must nevertheless speak of GOD after the Manner of Men, or we can't speak of him at all. But then, when we do speak after this Manner, we must remember, that Nothing below GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can be his End. He could not from Eternity have any Motive, but his meer good Pleasure, to give Existence to any future Beings; and therefore could have no other Inducement to determine their Kind of Existence, or what Circumstances he would state them in.—All Beings in the World, but GOD himself, were before the Creation Nothing, their future Existence and Manner of Existence were Nothing, but the good Pleasure of GOD concerning them; and therefore there could be Nothing but his good Pleasure as a Motive to the Decree.—I may add to this, that GOD must be consider'd as being from Eternity the absolute Proprietor, as well as the Rector and Governour of the future World with all its Inhabitants. As he has in Time made all Things for himself, so he must from Eternity have design'd to make all Things for himself; and therefore to be govern'd, guided, and order'd by himself, according to his own Pleasure.—Moreover the Judge of all the Earth must have determin'd to act right with Respect to his Creatures; but
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004710_0024_0000000000000000"/>
there could be no other Rule of Rectitude, but his own good Pleasure. If he had any other Motive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his own Will, it must have been a finite Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and therefore not only unworthy of an infinite Mind; but such as could not be infinitely good, and consequently might be in some Instance wrong and irregular. But we must by no Means attribute any possibility of Mistake either to the Purposes or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God. From all which it's apparent, that the eternal Counsels of God must be wholly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into this,—<hi>Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight.</hi> Mat. xi. 26.—<hi>Being predestinated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Purpose of him, who worketh all Things after the Counsel of his own Will.</hi> Eph. i. 11.</p>
            <p>It may possibly be objected to this, that the Decree of Election was the acting of Grace and Love to the Objects of it; and not meerly an Act of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. God is accordingly said to <hi>love</hi> his People <hi>with an everlasting Love,</hi> Jer. xxxi. 3. And they are <hi>called with an holy Calling, according to his own Purpose and Grace, which was given them in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>before the World began,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 9.—It's sufficient Answer to this Objection, to observe, that this eternal Grace and Love of God was arbitrary and sovereign; and could be excited by Nothing but his own Will. It's true, God had eternal Designs of Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to the Elect: But it's equally true, that his own Will and Pleasure were both the Fountain and End of these gracious Designs; there could be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else. And the Apostle accordingly resolves it into this, Rom. ix. 15. <hi>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy; and I will have Compassion on whom I will have Compassion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have described the Decree of Election, to be God's Purpose to give Grace and Glory to the Elect.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004710_0025_0000000000000000"/>
And it is for Want of a due Attention to this, that so many Objections have arisen in Men's Minds, against the Doctrine now before us.—Should we conceive of the Decree of God, as his unalterable Determination to give eternal Life to any particular Persons, without giving them previous Qualifications for it, this would plunge us into Difficulties that we could not get out of.—If he absolutely determin'd the eternal Salvation of any, whether they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for it or not, where were his Holiness? If he design'd to save some, and leave others that would be equally meet Subjects of his saving Mercy, where were the Rectitude of his moral Government? If he purposed Salvation to any, upon other Terms or Conditions than those proposed in the Gospel, where were the Truth of his Word? But if we consider him as having no Design to save any but gracious and sanctified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ersons; if we consider him as determining to give Grace to the Elect, and thereby to make them meet for Glory, all these Difficulties vanish at once. And thus the Scripture, thus the Nature of the Thing represents the Case to us. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son.</hi> Rom. viii. 29.—<hi>God hath from the Beginning chosen you to Salvation, through Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit &amp; Belief of the Truth,</hi> 2 Thes. ii. 13. We have repeated Assurance from the whole Tenour of the Gospel, that Repentance, Faith and new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, are necessary Qualifications for eternal Life; and if God has made these necessary to Salvation, he eternally decreed that they should be so. He has not decreed one Way of Salvation in Time, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from Eternity.—And how can any Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain these gracious Qualifications, unless God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give them? Or how can God be supposed to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004710_0026_0000000000000000"/>
give them, if he had not eternally design'd it; unless we suppose him to be acted by different, and even repagnant Views, which were Blasphemy to imagine? It is therefore most evident, that God did decree to sanctify the Elect, in Order to their Glorification; to give 'em new Hearts, that they might be fitted for future Happiness; and to give 'em Faith in CHRIST and thereby an Interest in his Righteousness, that they might be entitled to it.—There is not (it's true) in God any first and last, any Succession of Purposes or Contrivances: these are incompatible to an infinite Mind, to whom all Things are present at one View. But yet, though God did not first determine to give Grace to the Elect; and by a successive Act of his Will, decree to glorify them; He did by that one eternal Act of his Will decree to sanctify them, that they might thereby be made <hi>meet for an Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</hi> And we must conceive of the Decrees of God in this Order, if we would have any right Apprehensions of 'em.</p>
            <p>I have consider'd the Objects of the Decree to be a certain Number of the Children of Men. The whole World of Mankind could not equally be the Objects of electing Love; for then there could be no Choice. For all to be chosen, is a Contradiction in Terms; a Choice necessarily implying a Preference of one to another. The Number of the Elect could not be indefinite and undetermin'd, unless we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Doubtfulness and uncertainty to God, which were to suppose him <hi>altogether such an one as ourselves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> The Decree of Election must have respected every individual Person that shall ever be saved; or else there will some obtain Salvation, whom God did not eternally purpose to save; which must ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004710_0027_0000000000000000"/>
Foresight or Change of Purpose in God, both of which are unworthy of him.</p>
            <p>I know of but one considerable <hi>Objection</hi> against this Doctrine, which is, that the Decree might be <hi>conditional;</hi> They who are chosen to Salvation, might be chosen upon Condition of their Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And their Number could not therefore be certain, since it depended upon Conditions that were in themselves uncertain.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that if this Doctrine be true, there could be no Election of any at all to eternal Salvation. For God knows, and did eternally know, that none of us can ever obtain either Faith or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or other Condition of Salvation, unless he gives them. And a Decree founded upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as can never be fulfilled, leaves the Case hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and Remediless forever. To suppose any chosen to Salvation upon impossible Conditions, is to suppose those design'd for Salvation in God's eternal Counsel, whose Perdition is absolutely necessary from that very Decree; which is the Height of Absurdity.—If any should answer to this, that God might decree to give Men Ability to comply with these Conditions, this Supposal obviates the Objection at once; and shews that the Decree could not be conditional. For if God has absolutely decreed to sanctify the Elect, he has absolutely decreed to save them; Sanctification and eternal Salvation being necessarily connected in the Nature of Things. If he has not absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to sanctify them, he has not decreed to give them Ability to be saved; for he knows they have no Power to sanctify themselves; nor is there any Possibility of Salvation without Sanctification.—If it should be yet further urged in this Case, that God decreed to save those, that should duely improve t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ose
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004710_0028_0000000000000000"/>
Powers which they have in common with the Rest of the World, and none but those, this would not help the Case. For our grand Impotency lies in our Wills; and God knew from Eternity, that none of us should ever have a Will to comply with even these Terms of Salvation, unless he should <hi>work in us both to will and to do, of his own good Pleasure.</hi>—From these Premises it appears to me necessary, that the Objects of the Decree of Election must have been a certain Number; and that there could have been no uncertain precarious Conditions in God's eternal Counsel. But since conditional Decrees have been so warmly espous'd, even by some Men of Figure in the learned World, it may be proper to consider this Case yet more particularly.</p>
            <p>If the Decrees of God are conditional, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of those Conditions must be either in <hi>God,</hi> or in <hi>Man,</hi> or in <hi>both.</hi> But if it be made evident that it can be in neither God nor Man, I think the Consequence must necessarily follow, that there are no Conditions in the divine Decrees: But that the Objects of the Decrees are a definite certain Number.</p>
            <p>That the Foundation of these Conditions cannot be <hi>in</hi> GOD, appears to me most certain, from the following Considerations.—It is, I think, allow'd by all that have any just Idea of the divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Will of God is his Essence, or an essential Principle of Operation in him. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Composition of Parts, Powers, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; and therefore his Will cannot be any Thing distinct from his Essence, consistently with his infinite Nature, as I have observ'd before. From whence it follows, that to suppose any Conditions of the Will of God, or of the Decree of God,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004710_0029_0000000000000000"/>
(which is his Will with Respect to us) is to suppose Conditions of the divine Nature and Essence: That is, that God may be or may not be what he is, upon certain Conditions; which is too shocking to a serious Mind, to need any Animadversions.—Besides, if the eternal Counsel of God was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely right, just and good, it could admit of no Conditions: For infinite Rectitude must always be invariably the same, whatever Conditions can be supposed. There can be nothing better, and the Counsels of God cannot be worse, than infinite Rectitude. His Counsel must therefore, without any Conditions, be always the same; and the Elect must be a certain and definite Number.—I add to this, The absolute Will of God is both the first Cause, and the ultimate End of the Salvation of the Elect, as has been already consider'd. It must be the first Cause; because their very Being, their Qualifications for Salvation, and their Salvation it self wholly depend upon his Will; and had neither of them ever been, if he had not willed them. It must be his last End; because there was Nothing eternally existing but himself; and a Non-Entity could not be an higher End and Motive than his own Will. There could be no future End and Motive in his Creatures superiour to his Will, since they all depended upon his good Pleasure for their Existence and all their valuable Qualifications, as has been observ'd.—Now for the first Cause of our Salvation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be the absolute Will of God; and yet that first Cause to be conditional, is a Contradiction in Terms. To imagine any previous Conditions to the Will of God, is to suppose something prior to the first Cause, which is likewise a Contradiction. To suppose any subsequent Conditions to the Will of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004710_0030_0000000000000000"/>
God, is to suppose the first Cause to be precarious and uncertain, mutable and liable to the Controul of some other Cause; or in a Word, to be the first Cause, and yet no certain Cause at all, which is equally absurd.—And if we consider the Will of God as the last End of our Salvation, the same Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity will follow from the Supposal of any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality therein. For if God's Will be the last End, there can be no other End superiour to it, that can controul or change it; that is, it can have no Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If God's ultimate End be conditional, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there may be some other Motive greater than that, which may prompt him to change his Mind; which supposes that there may be in God an End or Motive higher than the highest, which is too gross an Absurdity to meet with any Entertainment.—Thus, I think, I have shewn that if we have any reverent Conceptions of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> we can find <hi>there</hi> no Foundation for a conditional Decree.</p>
            <p>I proceed to consider whether there be any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for such Conditionality in the Decrees of God from the <hi>Nature of Man.</hi>—If there be any Thing in Man, that could occasion any Conditions in God's electing Love, it must be some good Qualifications foreseen in him, upon the Condition whereof he is chosen to Salvation. This, I think, is what the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for conditional Decrees do always suppose. They imagine, that God chooses Men to Salvation upon Condition of their Faith, Repentance and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Life; that he foresees who will believe in CHRIST, repent of their Sins and live to God; and upon such Foresight, determines their eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.—But could GOD foresee any good in Man before he willed to them their first Good; or any Power to be or do good, before he willed to give
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004710_0031_0000000000000000"/>
them such Power? Could he foresee their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of such Powers as he determin'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he determin'd them that Assistance by which alone they should be able to improve them? It is impossible to imagine greater Absurdities than these are.—If there were any Conditions from the Nature of Man, in the Will and Counsel of God, these Conditions must exist, or at least the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of them must be supposed, before God's eternal Counsel; and so there must be something older than Eternity; and something existing before the Will and Counsel of God, which Supposals need no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.—If GOD foresaw these Conditions in us before he willed them, he foresaw them before they had any Foundation; and consequently before they were future. For I think that there is Nothing more certain, than that the only eternal Foundation and Cause of the Futurity of any good in us was the Will of God to give us that good; and to enable us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.—Besides, if God foresaw these Conditions in us before he willed them, his Fore-knowledge must be prior in Time to his Will, and consequently his Will must not be eternal; there must be successive Properties and Faculties in God; which are utterly inconsistent with his eternal uncompounded Nature.</p>
            <p>From what has been said, I think I may now safely come to a Conclusion, that the Decree of Election ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implies, that God has without any Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Will and Counsel, chosen a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to Grace here and Glory hereafter. Thus <hi>the Foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 19.</p>
            <p>After all it must be acknowledged, although there can be no Conditions in God's <hi>Decrees,</hi> yet he has
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004710_0032_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>decreed,</hi> that the <hi>Salvation</hi> even of the Elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shall be <hi>conditional;</hi> that they shall be saved upon the only Conditions of their Faith in Christ, and other corresponding Graces: Which Conditions he has decreed to give them, that they may be meet for the Salvation to which they are design'd.—There is Nothing more certain than that God has proposed these Conditions of Salvation in his <hi>Word</hi> to all that shall ever be saved; and it is from thence certain that he <hi>decreed</hi> so to do; for his Will is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the same. There are therefore Conditions of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Event,</hi> though there be no Conditions of the <hi>Decree:</hi> Nor is the Event the less certain because of the Conditions, since God has immutably decreed to give them also; to enable all the Elect to <hi>believe to the Salvation of their Souls.</hi>—It may be perhaps for Want of a due Attention to this, that many are prejudiced against the Doctrine of absolute Decrees.

There are even <hi>in the Counsel of God</hi> Conditions of our Salvation, though none of our <hi>Election.</hi> God has decreed to the Elect necessary Qualifications for Salvation, without which they shall never obtain it.

            </p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly shewn what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the Decree of Election, upon the Supposal of such a Decree? And I have endeavour'd to explain and confirm each Part of my Description.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am next <hi>to consider what</hi> EVIDENCE <hi>we have that this Doctrine is true,</hi> which I have hitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted.—I have indeed be'n already <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004710_0033_0000000000000000"/>
to take occasional Notice of some of those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are now to be offer'd in Confirmation of the Proposition. It is however necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to set those Arguments in a closer View and stronger Light, that we may more clearly see the Truth and Importance of the Doctrine I am pleading for. Repetitions are preferable to Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I had rather be censured for repeating the same Things, than for falling short in Point of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and for leaving the Cause doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's necessary from the very first Idea we have of an infinite God, that he is <hi>Omniscient.</hi>—The supposal of the least Degree of Ignorance in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mind, is an Affront to common Sense. An infinite Being, with but a finite Knowledge, is the greatest Contradiction. So that we must necessarily allow an omniscient God, or no God at all. This appears evident at the first View, and admits of no Debate.—It must therefore be allow'd, that all Things future were eternally open to the View of this omniscient Mind. He could not have been omniscient, if any Thing present or future was from Eternity unknown to him.—I shall not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern myself with the Debate among the Schoolmen, how or in what <hi>Manner</hi> all Futurities were eternally present with God. That is a Subject vastly above the Enquiry of such short-sighted Creatures as we are; for <hi>God is higher than Heaven, what can we know!</hi> We may safely, and must necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Knowledge of God is equal to his infinite Nature; and that he must consequently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know whatsoever shall come to pass, though <hi>we</hi> know not <hi>how.</hi> Thus far we go upon firm Ground;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004710_0034_0000000000000000"/>
a Step further plunges us into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unfathomable Depth.</p>
            <p>To apply this to the present Purpose: God's <hi>Fore-Knowledge</hi> of the Sanctification and eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all that shall ever be saved, renders those Events <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>necessary;</hi> that they will not, they cannot be otherwise than he foreknew they would be.—If God's Fore-Knowledge were not certain, it would not have be'n Knowledge, but Conjecture. If God's Fore-Knowledge was certain, the Event must be likewise certain and necessary; how could he otherwise certainly foreknow it? If God did not eternally foreknow these Events in all their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, just as they would come to pass, it would not have be'n Knowledge, but Mistake; and if he did foreknow these Events, just as they would come to pass, they must necessarily come to pass, just as he foreknew they would.—A Necessity of <hi>Infallibility</hi> must therefore be unavoidably connected to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God. And whether we can form any just Notion, how the several Perfections of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature did eternally co-operate with Respect to our future Salvation, or not, it must follow from these Considerations, that there was with God from all Eternity, an infallible Certainty and Necessity of the whole Progress of the Salvation, both in Grace and Glory, of every individual Person that will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be saved. It is absolutely impossible, that the Salvation of any one of them can fail (the Certainty of their Salvation being founded upon the Nature of God) unless we dare suppose even God himself to be fallible.</p>
            <p>I presume that even the Opposers of absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees will themselves generally allow the Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, with those undoubted Consequences
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004710_0035_0000000000000000"/>
of it. How unreasonable is it therefore, to quarrel with the Doctrine of absolute Decrees, when they must allow the absolute <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Event,</hi> or deny the <hi>Foreknowledge</hi> of God; and whatever Objection can be imagined against an absolute <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> the same can with the same Force and upon the same Grounds, be urged against a certain and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Foreknowledge?</hi> For it is the same Thing, and the same Consequences in all possible Instances will follow, if the Certainty and Infallibility of the Event do flow from the Knowledge, or the Will of God. Those Objections can therefore be no just Reason with such Men against God's Predetermination, that equally militate against his Prescience, which is what they dare not deny.</p>
            <p>It has indeed been objected against this Doctrine, That the Salvation of particular Persons is in it self a <hi>Contingency;</hi> what may be, or what may not be, according to their Compliance or non-Compliance with the Terms and Conditions of Salvation propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Gospel; and therefore that it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily have been <hi>foreknown</hi> of God to be a contingent and uncertain Event; for such it certainly is, and God foreknew it to be as it is.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that altho' the Event be contingent with Respect to <hi>us,</hi> while we do not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know whether we shall comply with these Terms of Salvation, or not; it could not be contingent with Respect to <hi>God,</hi> who from Eternity did certainly know whether we should comply with these Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or not; and therefore did certainly know what the Issue and Consequence of our Compliance or non-Compliance would be.—God could not have be'n omniscient, if he did not eternally foreknow all the minutest Circumstances of our whole Conduct
<pb facs="unknown:004710_0036_0000000000000000"/>
with their Consequences, all our Dispositions, Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Conversations here in this World, as well as our eternal State in the World to come. He must have fore-known these Events, as they would be in themselves, when they come to pass; and not as they would be to such short sighted Creatures as we are, before they come to pass.—These Events will be no longer contingent or uncertain to us, when they are fully accomplish'd; and therefore could never be contingent or uncertain to God, who did from Eternity as well foresee their full Accomplishment, as the Conditions on which they depended.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Head, If God did not eternally foreknow all Events, and the Accomplishment of all Circumstances and Conditions of Events, with Respect to all his Creatures, it must be either from Defect of Knowledge in God, or from some Obstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Obstacle in the Creature, that hid the Event from the View of an omniscient Eye. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; <hi>Let no such Arrogancy come out of your Mouth; for the Lord is a God of Knowledge, and by him Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are weighed.</hi> 1 Sam. ii. 3.—Not the latter; a finite Being cannot controul an infinite Nature; nor cast any Obscurity in the Way of infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is in vain <hi>to seek deep to hide our Counsel from the Lord. If we say, the Darkness shall cover us, even the Night shall be light about him; yea, the Darkness hideth not from him: but the Night shineth as the Day, the Darkness and the Light are both alike to him,</hi> Psal. cxxxix. 11, 12.—<hi>Neither is there any Creature that is not manifest in his Sight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>And now, I think, I am got safely thus far, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd there can no Objection ly in the Way of this Truth,
<pb facs="unknown:004710_0037_0000000000000000"/>
that God did eternally and certainly foresee the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all that will ever be saved; and that this Foresight of his renders their Salvation necessary and infallible.—I therefore proceed a Step further.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is also necessary that the eternal God be a <hi>perfect</hi> Being; and that all the <hi>Perfections</hi> of his Nature should <hi>always concur</hi> in all his <hi>Operations.</hi>—The Holiness (for Instance) &amp; the Goodness, the Truth, the Mercy, the Justice, so likewise the Knowledge and the Will of God, do most necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree together, in all his Dispensations.—Some of God's Attributes are indeed very different, and even contrary in their Exercise upon the Creatures. It is a vastly different Thing to us, to be the Objects of God's Favour, or of his Justice, Wrath, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure: That we must consider of some of the Operations of God toward us, as the Actings of one and not of another of his glorious Attributes. Thus his bestowing Salvation upon any, is an Act of his Grace, and not of his Justice; and punishing any with eternal Destruction, is an Act of his Justice, and not of his Grace: Yet all his Attributes must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unite and agree in his own infinite Mind. His Grace is not, in the Instance mention'd, inconsistent with his Justice, nor his Justice inconsistent with his Grace. There can be no Contrariety, no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or Repugnancy in the divine Nature. This must not be supposed of an infinitely perfect Being.—To suppose that God ever ceased in any one Act to be holy, to be just, to be good and merciful, or to have every one of his essential Properties in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, is to suppose that he ceased to be God. For he must be an Omniscient God, a holy God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, a just God &amp;c. at all Times,—and in all Instances, or be no God at all.—Whatever Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb facs="unknown:004710_0038_0000000000000000"/>
or Properties necessarily belong to the Divine Nature, are either essential to him, or else God may cease to be what he is, or be at one Time what he is not at another. But this is what no Man dare suppose. And if all the Attributes or Properties which necessarily belong to the divine Nature, are essential to him, no one of them can ever be removed, not so much as in one Instance, or one Moment, without the Destruction of his Being.—To apply this to the Case before us. The Decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be supposed an Act of God's Knowledge se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rate and distinct from his other essential Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but an eternal Act of his Mind, wherein they all unitedly concur. If God did eternally foreknow the Salvation of the Elect, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> foreknow it in a Manner agreable to all his essential Properties; &amp; consequently in a Manner agreable to his Will, which is one of them.—Whatever Difficulties there may be in our Minds with Respect to the eternal Concurrence of God's Will with his Knowledge, relating to some Things that either have or will come to pass, and were consequently the Objects of his Prescience; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in some Way or other, their Futurity was agreeable to his Will, or else his Knowledge and Will would have be'n at Disagreement, which may by no Means be imagined. What is God's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but God himself knowing? And what is God's Will but God himself willing? To suppose these at Disagreement, is therefore to suppose God at Disagreement with himself, which is the highest Blasphemy.</p>
            <p>It is also impossible from the very Nature of God, that he could eternally foreknow our future Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Way repugnant to his Will, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all his Perfections and consequently his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004710_0039_0000000000000000"/>
and Will must always agree; but also because it's impossible that our Salvation should have be'n fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, contrary to his Will. It was certainly in his Power to have hindred it, if he had not willed it; and then it never would have be'n, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could not have be'n fore-known. Nay, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Salvation of all that shall ever be saved, did eternally depend upon the Will of God, as the first Cause of it; as I have observ'd before. There could be nothing else from Eternity to make our Salvation possible; and therefore it could not have be'n the Object of God's Knowledge, if it had not be'n the Object of his Will.—This, I think, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, that the future Salvation of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Person that shall ever obtain it, did eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend either upon God, or the Creature, as the Cause of it; for an Effect, without a Cause, is a flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. It could not depend upon the Creature, who had no Existence; nor could have Power to give either Grace or Glory when existing. It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have necessarily depended upon God, as the only possible Cause. And if so, it must either have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon his Will, or upon some other of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections without his Will, and disagreable to it; upon something in himself, that should necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly constrain him to bestow Salvation upon the Elect, whether he would or not. But this none dare ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. It must therefore have depended upon the Will of God, or upon Nothing at all, for its Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Possibility. From which it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if the future Salvation of the Elect could not possibly have be'n, God could not have eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreknown that it would have be'n, except he had willed it.—This is also evident from the very Nature of the Decree of Election; if God has eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004710_0040_0000000000000000"/>
chosen any to Salvation (as is asserted in our Text) he has eternally willed their Salvation; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and choosing being the same Thing. To choose any Thing, and not to will the Object of such Choice, is a Contradiction in Terms.</p>
            <p>From all these Considerations it is (I think) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly true, that God hath eternally known and eternally willed the whole future Salvation of each individual Heir of everlasting Life and Glory; and that their Salvation, being founded upon the Foreknowledge and Will of God, is like his glorious Nature necessary and infallible; which is the Thing to be proved.—The Salvation of the Elect is <hi>the Mystery of his</hi> WILL, <hi>according to his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which he hath purposed in himself.</hi> Eph. i. 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is also necessary, that an infinite God must be an <hi>immutable</hi> Being; and that there cannot be in any of his Perfections the least Variation or Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Change. All the Counsels and Purposes of God must have been from Eternity infinitely wise, infinitely holy, &amp; infinitely good; there can therefore be no possible Reason why they should change, since there can be no Change for the better; and we cannot suppose that infinite Wisdom should change his Purposes without any Reason for it.—Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it possible that they should change or alter in the least Instance or Degree; such Change necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying that God would cease to be infinite. How can God be infinite, if he be in any Respect what he was not before? unless we allow a different Kind or different Degree of infinite Being, which is absurd. <hi>He is the Lord, he changes not.</hi> Mal. iii. 6. <hi>He is the same Yesterday, to Day and for ever.</hi> Heb. xiii. 8. <hi>With him is no Variableness, neither Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning.</hi> James i. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:004710_0041_0000000000000000"/>Where the Scriptures speak of God's <hi>changing</hi> his Purposes or Counsels, they speak after the Manner of Men; and represent to us that God acts in those Cases, as we do when we change our Purposes. As a Change of Purpose in us procures a Change of Conduct, so a Change of Conduct towards us is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as a Change of Purpose in God, by Way of Condescention to our weak Capacities. The Change in Reality is in us, and not in God; this occasions an Alteration in his Providence towards us, though there can be none in his Nature or Will. <hi>The Strength of Israel will not lie, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; for he is not a Man that he should repent.</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 29.—<hi>The Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance.</hi> Rom. xi. 29.</p>
            <p>And now what hinders our coming to a safe and certain Conclusion, that God has decreed in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Purpose, <hi>according to the good Pleasure of his Will,</hi> to give Grace and Glory to a certain Number of the Children of Men? I have prov'd from the very Nature of God, that he must eternally, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and infallibly foreknow the State of each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Heir of Salvation; and be fully acquainted from Eternity with the whole Progress of their Grace here, and their Glory hereafter.—I have prov'd that this Foreknowledge of God was according to his eternal Will and Pleasure. It could not be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to, but in the Order of our Conceptions must be founded upon his Will, since it would not have been, and consequently would not have been the Object of his Knowledge and Foresight, if he had not willed it.—I have prov'd that God's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and Will are, like all other Perfections of his Nature, immutable; and that they are the same now, and will be the same for ever, that they were
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004710_0042_0000000000000000"/>
from all Eternity. And when these Premises are put together, don't the Conclusion necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Admitting these Premises to be true (and I think I have prov'd that they are true) we must of Consequence admit the Truth of the Proposition which was to be prov'd.</p>
            <p>Having thus consider'd the Evidence of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as being founded upon the Nature of God, I proceed in the next Place,</p>
            <p>To consider whether it ben't also a Truth clearly manifest from <hi>plain Declarations of the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the Consideration of that Text in Rom. viii. 29, 30. <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son.—Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eds; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</hi> In which Words we find the Foreknowledge of God, his Predetermination, the Sanctification, Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eternal Salvation of the Elect, as so many Links in an inseparable Chain, necessarily connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together. And of necessary Consequence, we here find the Truth of the Proposition before us made most certain and evident.—If God did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know and predestinate the future State of every Heir of Salvation, if he does actually call, justify, and glorify every one that was foreknown and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated in his eternal Counsel, then God has from all Eternity elected a certain Number to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life, which is the Thing to be prov'd. But the former is asserted in the Text; and therefore the latter true.—I can here sec no Room for any plausible Evasion. The Words are plain, full, and pertinent to the Purpose. To question the Truth
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004710_0043_0000000000000000"/>
of the Doctrine I am pleading for, is to question the Truth of this sacred Text.</p>
            <p>The like Evidence of this Truth is also found in <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal Life, believed.</hi> Here the Decree, and the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, are both asserted; and shewn to be of equal Extent. For, if all that <hi>were ordained to eternal Life believed,</hi> all that were <hi>ordain'd to eternal Life,</hi> shall be certainly saved: Faith being Salvation begun; and Salvation being every where in the Gospel promis'd to true Believers.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be clearer to the same Purpose, than that in <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 23. <hi>That he might make known the Riches of his Glory, on the Vessels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory.</hi>—That this fore-Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto Glory, here spoken of, was in God's eternal Counsel, appears manifest from the Instance of God's Decree with Respect to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> from which the Apostle draws the Consequence here before us. It was <hi>before they had done either good or evil, that the Purpose of God according to Election might stand.</hi> Verse 11.—That this Preparation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glory was an Act of God's sovereign Counsel, is strongly asserted in Verse 15. <hi>He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy.</hi>—That it is an Act of his eternal and unchangeable Purpose, is asserted in the cited Text. He actually makes known the <hi>Riches of his Glory,</hi> on all these <hi>Vessels of Mercy which he had,</hi> in his eternal Purpose, <hi>afore prepared unto Glory.</hi>—Were it even granted to the Opposers of this Doctrine, that the Decree of God with Respect to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> from whence the Apostle argues throughout this Chapter, referred only to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Circumstances, it would Nothing affect the Cause. For if the Apostle thought it to be just ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004710_0044_0000000000000000"/>
from thence, to God's Decree of <hi>making known the Riches of his Glory on the Vessels of Mercy,</hi> we should think so too.</p>
            <p>This Truth is likewise confirm'd from <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 5,7. <hi>Even so then at this present Time also, there is a Remnant according to the Election of Grace.—The Election hath obtained; and the Rest were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> If it was true then, it is true now and at all Times, that the <hi>Remnant</hi> of God's Children are <hi>according to the Election of Grace;</hi> and consequently that he hath eternally chosen all that shall ever be his Children.—If it be true, that the <hi>Election ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the Rest are blinded,</hi> it thence follows, that all the Objects of his electing Love shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation, and none but they.</p>
            <p>But the Time would sail me, to consider particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly all the Texts of Scripture, where this Doctrine is clearly revealed. I shall therefore but just hint at some few of the many other scriptural Evidences of this Truth.—If it be true, that the Elect <hi>are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated according to the Purpose of him, who worketh all Things after the Counsel of his own Will;</hi> as is asserted in <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 11.—If it be true, that <hi>God hath appointed them to obtain Salvation, by our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> according to that in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 9.—If it be true, that <hi>God hath from the Beginning chosen them to Salvation,</hi> according to 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> ii. 13.—If <hi>God has saved them and called them with an holy Calling, not according to their Works; but according to his own Purpose and Grace, which was given them in Christ Jesus before the World began,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 9.—If they are <hi>elect according to the Foreknowledge of God the Father,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 2.—It must then necessarily be true, that God hath according to the good Pleasure of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, elected
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004710_0045_0000000000000000"/>
a certain Number to everlasting Life; which is the Thing to be prov'd.</p>
            <p>I have not hitherto been considering, nor attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to remove the Difficulties that ly in the Way of this Doctrine. But have only endeavour'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it; and to enquire into it's Truth and Certainty. It is soon enough to consider and solve the Scruples that arise in our Minds upon the Supposal of any Fact, when the Fact it self is established &amp; received. There is no Occasion to exercise our Minds with Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, about that which we have no Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.—It is not therefore the Question now before us, <hi>How can these Things be?</hi> But whether this Doctrine be the Truth of God, or not? If it be evidently true, we must receive it for Truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Objections arise in our Minds; and not reject it because we don't fully understand it.—If we suspend our Assent unto every Truth until all the Difficulties concerning them are removed, we must remain Sceptics as long as we live; and never fully consent to the Being of God; nor even to our own Being; for there will always remain insuperable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties with Respect to both.—Here then we should make a Pause; and review without Prejudice the Arguments which have been offer'd; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their Force; and let our <hi>Assent</hi> to this Doctrine be as strong as the <hi>Evidence</hi> of its Truth. If it be founded upon the Nature and Word of God, there is no Room to dispute it. If it be founded upon neither of these, there is no Reason to believe it.</p>
            <p>I don't speak this to discourage all proper and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Endeavours, to obviate the Difficulties, that may arise in our Minds from the Contemplation before us. For though we cannot expect to search out and comprehend the Perfections of God, so as to have a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004710_0046_0000000000000000"/>
full and clear View of the eternal Operations of his infinite Mind: Yet we may find sufficient Answers to all the Objections that can be thrown in the Way, to satisfy a sober and humble Enquirer after Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) I shall now accordingly endeavour <hi>to refute some of the chief of those</hi> OBJECTIONS, <hi>that ly in our Way;</hi> and I hope I shall at least be able to make it appear that <hi>there are no Absurdities in the Doctrine of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Decrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the chief Objections against this Doctrine is, that it <hi>takes away the Liberty of the Creature; is inconsistent with that Freedom that must necessarily be supposed of a rational and accountable Being.—If God has absolutely decreed the Event; and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elect is by Vertue of that Decree abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, that it cannot fail of Accomplishment, it is in it self unavoidable; and the Elect must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whether they will or not. And what Liberty or Freedom can there be then left them in the Affair of their Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a principal Objection, upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which the most of the Difficulties that are raised against this Doctrine do very much depend, I shall be something particular in answering it.</p>
            <p>And I would first ask of the Objector, whether <hi>he does not find himself at full Liberty in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> Let him look into the Operations of his own Mind; and inquire whether he has any Force or Constraint put upon his Affections Appetites or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, in any Case whatsoever; and whether he does not act voluntarily and spontaneously in all his moral Conduct? I think every one will in this Case answer in the Affirmative. And what Room can there then be for this Objection?—He can't
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004710_0047_0000000000000000"/>
perhaps see how this is consistent with an absolute Decree. What then! Must we dispute against it plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> manifest Fact, because we don't know how a can be? We can't see how it is consistant with an immaterial Spirit to have any Relation to Space; or to act upon Matter. Must we therefore dispute the Union of our Soul and Body, and the Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodily Members to the Dictates of our Minds, because we can't see the Consistency of it? Are there not a thousand undoubted Realities in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial World, wherein there are such apparent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistencies, as we can't see thro'? Must we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reject the greatest Certainties, because we are but short-sighted Creatures?—I think I have prov'd, from the infinite Nature and Perfections of God, that the Decrees are certainly absolute, &amp; without any pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Conditions; and that the Futurity of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed Event must be certain and infallible. And yet we find by Experience, that we are at full <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> that we act in all our moral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour according to our own Wills. And don't this Consideration make it necessary, that the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Creature is consistent with the Decree of God, whether we can see through it or not?</p>
            <p>It is a great deal too bold and assuming, for any Man to say, that it cannot be: for how does he know that it cannot be? Is it a necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that because God is infinite, because his Knowledge and his Will are infinite, and must always agree together; and because the Objects of both are consequently certain and infallible, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He cannot make a Creature in a State of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Liberty?</hi> If this be possible, if God can make a Creature at full Liberty, notwithstanding his predetermining what he would make him for,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004710_0048_0000000000000000"/>
how he would be glorified in him, and what his State should be, there is then no Inconsistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an absolute Decree and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Creature. And who dare venture to say, that God cannot make a Creature in a State of <hi>Freedom,</hi> and be not withstanding possessed of these infinite Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> no?</hi> I have shewn already, that God as well decreed to give <hi>Grace,</hi> as to give Glory to all the Elect; and that their Interest in Christ, with all the blessed Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, was decreed to be the Object of their own free Choice, and earnest Pursuit; what they should freely choose, and diligently labour after, in all the Methods of God's Appointment: and in that Way, and that only, obtain it. And this is so far from contradicting the <hi>Freedom</hi> of the Elect, that it fully establishes it. It is necessary even from
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004710_0049_0000000000000000"/>
the Decree of God, that they shall act <hi>freely</hi> and at full Liberty, in choosing their own Salvation, and <hi>working it out with Fear and Trembling.</hi>—Where then is the Contradiction? Is it a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for any <hi>Event</hi> to be infallibly <hi>necessary</hi> with Respect to a rational Being; and that Being to be notwithstanding in a State of <hi>Freedom?</hi> Is it not infallibly <hi>necessary</hi> for the Saints in Heaven to be everlastingly glorious and happy; and don't they nevertheless enjoy the Perfection of <hi>Freedom?</hi> Is it not infallibly <hi>necessary,</hi> that the glorious God shall be eternally infinite; and dare any Man imagine, that God himself is not at full <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> to act according to his own good Pleasure?</p>
            <p>If it be yet further urged, <hi>That according to this Doctrine of the Decrees, there is a Necessity that the Elect shall</hi> will <hi>the Means of their Salvation, since God has decreed to give them such a Will; and the same necessary Certainty, that those who are not elected shall</hi> not will <hi>the Means of Salvation. And is it not a Contradiction, that either the one or the other should be in a State of</hi> Freedom, <hi>since they can't</hi> will <hi>the Contrary to what they do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Answer to this I must observe, that a Power to <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>not</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> any particular Object of Choice, or a Power to choose <hi>indifferently</hi> either the one or the other of two contrary Objects, is so far from <hi>Freedom,</hi> that it is utterly <hi>inconsistent</hi> with it; and is what cannot be predicated of any Being that is perfectly <hi>free.</hi>—We could not be <hi>free</hi> Agents, if we had not a Power to <hi>will</hi> what appears to us from our present View of Things most fit to be chosen; or if we had a Power to <hi>will</hi> what appears to us from our present View of Things unfit to be chosen. For either of these supposes the <hi>Will</hi> it self to be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004710_0050_0000000000000000"/>
of some Constraint from something without us; and not to be the Result of our own Understandings, Affections, and Appetites, as it always is in every <hi>free</hi> Agent. This is equally true, whether our <hi>Wills</hi> are always excited and acted by some apparent Good, as has been generally supposed; or whether they are commonly acted by some present Uneasiness, as has also been supposed; or whether by both of these.—<hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> therefore cannot be opposed to <hi>Necessity.</hi> Every free Agent must necessarily <hi>will</hi> what his Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Appetites and Affections, represent to him the most fit Object of Choice; he can't do otherwise. To suppose a Power to do otherwise, is to suppose a Power that is extrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l to him, that must move his <hi>Will</hi> as a Clock or Watch is moved; and is therefore utterly inconsistent with <hi>Freedom.</hi>—If <hi>Freedom</hi> consists in a Power to <hi>will</hi> or not to <hi>will</hi> what appears to the Mind in its present View of Things the fittest Object of Choice, then the holy Angels and glorified Saints are not free: For they cannot help but will the Glory of God, and their own Holiness and Happiness. Nay, the blessed God himself, upon this Supposal, cannot be <hi>free:</hi> For he cannot do otherwise than eternally <hi>will</hi> the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfections of his own excellent Nature; he cannot <hi>will</hi> any Event, the Futuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of which is not some how agreable to them.—<hi>Freedom</hi> therefore is only opposed to <hi>Coaction</hi> or Constraint. He that can act according to his own <hi>Will,</hi> and do what he does—of Choice, without any Constraint, is therein <hi>free;</hi> though perhaps he may not be capable to do every Thing that he would do, if it were in his Power. Thus the Merchant acts <hi>freely,</hi> who by his Trade advances his Estate but a Hundred a Year, because he acts of Choice, and is under no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004710_0051_0000000000000000"/>
though he may probably desire to double the Increase. And thus the Believer acts <hi>freely,</hi> in his Acceptance of Christ, and living to him; for that is according to his own Will and Choice, without any Constraint; though he is not capable of all those gracious Attainments, which he desires. Thus likewise impenitent Sinners act <hi>freely,</hi> because they act voluntarily, in all their sinful Indulgences; tho' they may be uncapable to obtain some particular sinful Gratifications, which their Lusts prompt them to. In a Word, he that acts voluntarily and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Compulsion or Constraint, acts <hi>freely;</hi> and he that has a Power so to do, is in a State of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Liberty: for Freedom consists in Nothing else. The Freedom of a Creature does not consist in a Power to <hi>do</hi> every Thing which he <hi>might choose</hi> to do (that seems to be the peculiar Prerogative of God himself, and implies Omnipotence) but in a Power to act <hi>of Choice</hi> in all that he does do. From which it necessarily follows, that the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Decree of God can no Ways obstruct the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Creature; in that every rational Agent does nevertheless always act voluntarily in all his moral Conduct: and is therefore always in a State of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Liberty.</p>
            <p>I know that it has been the common Doctrine of Divines, that the <hi> Will</hi> of Man has full <hi>Freedom</hi> with Respect to Things <hi>natural;</hi> yet not in Things <hi>spiritual;</hi> but that in these Things it requires super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace to move and influence it.—However, I can't but think (with Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>) that it is a very inaccurate and obscure Way of speaking, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>Freedom,</hi> or <hi>Want</hi> of Freedom, to the <hi>Will.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Will</hi> being but a Property or Faculty of the Mind, can no more than any other of our intellectual
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004710_0052_0000000000000000"/>
Powers, be the Subject of other Properties or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—<hi>Free Agency</hi> implies <hi>Personality,</hi> which I think no Man applies to the <hi>Will.</hi> On the contrary, every one will allow, that there is a great Difference between an <hi>Act,</hi> and an intelligent <hi>Agent;</hi> and that it is the latter only, that can properly be the Subject of <hi>Freedom,</hi> or want of <hi>Freedom.</hi> And therefore to attribute either of these to the <hi>Will,</hi> is to make that the <hi>Agent,</hi> or Person, when it is indeed no more than a personal <hi>Act,</hi> or the Person acting in a Way of Choice:—the Confusion of which is obvious, and has been too manifest by the multiply'd imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Debates upon this Subject. I nevertheless fully agree with the <hi>Meaning</hi> of these Divines, if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. I agree, that no Man has a Power to <hi>will</hi> the Exercise of saving Grace, and a Life of Holiness and Piety, until the Spirit of God, by his supernatural Influences, represents these to him as most fit to be chosen, and makes such a powerful Impression upon his Mind, as conquers his natural Aversion, and excites him to <hi>will</hi> them.—It is evident, in every Man's Experience, that our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propensity is to <hi>Evil, only to Evil, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> But these Things that are evil, appear in a false Light to our carnal Minds, especially to our Appetites and Affections, as Things most fit to be chosen; and while they thus appear to us good and eligible, we could not be <hi>free,</hi> if we did not <hi>will</hi> them. While we act as rational and <hi>free Agents,</hi> we must <hi>will</hi> and choose what appears to us from our present View of Things most worthy our Choice. And it is therefore <hi>because</hi> we are in a State of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> with Respect to the Affairs of a spiritual and moral Nature, that we <hi>cannot</hi> habitually choose a gracious spiritual and heavenly Life, until by the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004710_0053_0000000000000000"/>
powerful Agency of divine Grace we have such an habitual Impression upon our Minds, that overcomes our contrary Inclinations, and represents such a Life most worthy of our Approbation and Pursuit. Tho' we may sometimes want Freedom and Liberty in Things <hi>natural</hi> (A Man in a Dungeon can't be said to be in a State of Freedom) yet a rational Creature, while such, can never want Freedom in Things <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>moral;</hi> since whatever he acts in those Concerns, he acts voluntarily, and therefore freely.—It is true indeed, that Sinners may in some Sense be said to be in <hi>Bondage</hi> to their Lusts: that is, they freely and willingly perform their base and sordid Drudgery, and can't will to do otherwise while in an unsanctified State. Nothing but <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus,</hi> can <hi>make us free from</hi> a chosen Subjection to <hi>the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>—The Man is notwithstanding in a State of <hi>Freedom,</hi> even in this Vassalage of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. For, though a Life of Sin and Sensuality is in it self of the Nature of Thraldom and Bondage, the <hi>Sinner</hi> does not <hi>esteem</hi> it so: But freely puts and keeps the Yoke on his own Neck. He does but what he <hi>wills</hi> to do, in his Subjection to his Lusts; and the Believer does what he wills to do, in his Subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ; both act <hi>freely,</hi> though both are voluntary <hi>Servants.</hi>—It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a rational Creature should act otherwise than <hi>freely,</hi> while he acts by Counsel; whatever the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God are concerning him.</p>
            <p>A right Apprehension of the Decrees of God will make them appear to be so far from taking away the <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Creature, that they must make it absolutely necessary, that every ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Agent shall act <hi>freely</hi> in his whole moral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004710_0054_0000000000000000"/>
—If God in his eternal Counsel did join the <hi>Means</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> together (as I have already prov'd that he did) then he did decree, that the <hi>Elect</hi> should be sav'd by Faith in Christ and other conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant Graces, which are in themselves free and voluntary Acts of the renewed Mind and that they should voluntarily and of Choice comply with the Terms of Salvation. He did also decree, that those who are NOT elected, shall be finally punished for Sin <hi>freely</hi> and voluntarily committed. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> both of one and the other, are infallibly necessary even from the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> of God. Which Consideration alone might have been sufficient Answer to this Objection.</p>
            <p>It may be further objected against this Doctrine, that <hi>if God has infallibly decreed to give Grace and Glory to a certain Number of Mankind, and to none but them, he is then a</hi> Respecter of Persons; <hi>which is directly contrary to his Word,</hi> Acts x. 34.</p>
            <p>To which I answer: To be a <hi>Respecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> implies an unequal Distribution of <hi>Justice,</hi> from Favour and Affection; and not an unequal Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of <hi>Benefits,</hi> by a Benefactor and absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor.—When a <hi>Judge</hi> is chargeable with Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality or Injustice, because biassed by something in the Person or Circumstances of the Party before him, such as Greatness, Riches, Relation, or Flattery &amp;c. he is a <hi>Respecter of Persons.</hi> But when an absolute <hi>Proprietor,</hi> and sovereign Disposer of his own Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, bestows an undeserv'd Kindness upon one, and not upon another, he is no <hi>Respecter of Persons.</hi>—Thus, if God should forgive and save one penitent <hi>Believer,</hi> and not another, out of a partial Respect to the one or the other, because they were or were not <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> of high or low Circumstances
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004710_0055_0000000000000000"/>
in the World, or the like (notwithstanding they both stand on a Level in the Gospel-Covenant, and have equal Rights belonging to them in the Court of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace) he might in this Case be denominated a <hi>Respecter of Persons.</hi> But inasmuch as he will equally and indifferently adopt, justify, and finally glorify <hi>all</hi> penitent Believers, whatever their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Circumstances may be, he cannot be charg'd with <hi>Respect of Persons,</hi> how differently soever he distributes, among a World of Rebels, such unmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Favours and Benefits, as no Man can have a Right to by any Law, Covenant, or Rule of <hi>Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in the quoted Text, He is said to be no <hi>Respecter of Persons,</hi> because <hi>in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him.</hi> As he is the <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> of the World, he is equal and impartial in bestowing his Rewards, according to his Law and Covenants of Promise, which he has made the Rule of his Dispensations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. As he is a sovereign <hi>Proprictor</hi> and <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> he bestows his Benefits how and where he pleases, without being a <hi>Respecter of Persons:</hi> for he is absolute Master of his own Favours.</p>
            <p>It is plainly visible, to every Man's Observation and Experience, that God does <hi>not</hi> bestow his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits equally upon all that are of equal Demerit.—He has not made every Man an Angel; nor every Angel an Arch-Angel. He has not made every Stone a Beast; nor every Beast a Man. He has not given to every Man equal Powers or Faculties of Mind; nor equal Advantage to get Riches, or Honour, Health or Comfort in the World. And dare any Man call him to an Account for these Acts of his Sovereignty, as a <hi>Respecter of Persons?</hi>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:004710_0056_0000000000000000"/>If we apply this to the Case before us, there will be found no Room at all for this Objection.—In the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Election</hi> God acted as a sovereign Benefactor; and had he not Right as such, to <hi>have Mercy upon whom he would have Mercy,</hi> when he was under no Obligation by any Law, Covenant, or Promise, or by any Thing else but his own sovereign Pleasure?—Could he not determine who should be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his special Grace and Favour, without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Persons?</hi> Though <hi>many are called, and but few chosen, is our Eye therefore evil because he is good? Is it not lawful for him to do what he will with his own?</hi> As our Lord argues in this very Case,<hi>Mat.</hi> xx. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>It has been objected also against this Doctrine, <hi>That it cuts the Sinews of all Endeavours to obtain Salvation; and brings</hi> Presumption <hi>into the World. For if we are elected, we shall be sure to obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do what we will; and if not, we shall be sure not to obtain it, do what we can. It is therefore to no Purpose to strive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Answer to which I would observe, that if this Objection be just from the Infallibility of God's eternal <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Purpose,</hi> it is equally just from the Infallibility of God's eternal <hi>Foreknowledge.</hi> For the Foreknowledge of God renders the Event as certain and necessary, as his eternal Counsel can do. What God did foreknow should come to pass, must certainly and infallibly come to pass; or else he could not have foreknown it, as has been consider'd before.—And now let the Objector consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he dare deny the Omniscience of God, upon such Kind of Reasoning as this in the Objection: Whether he dare venture to say, that God cannot be omniscient, that he could not foreknow all future Events; for if he did foreknow our Salvation, we
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004710_0057_0000000000000000"/>
shall be saved, do what we will; or if he foreknew that we shall not be saved, we shall not be saved, do what we can.—I presume, there are but few will venture so far as to deny the Knowledge of God, from such vain Imaginations of their own. How then dare they venture to deny the Decrees of God, from such Reasonings as prove a great deal too much, if they prove any Thing at all, and which must be wholly impertinent, if they don't prove that God cannot be infinite?—This therefore shews, that the Objection cannot be well grounded, how plausible soever it may appear, since it militates against the Perfections of God, and even against his very Being: for a God without Omniscience, is no God.</p>
            <p>I must further observe, that this whole Objection is founded upon a <hi>mistaken</hi> Apprehension of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> of God. God has not decreed to save any but persevering <hi>Saints;</hi> and he has decreed to save all such: Hence there can be no Room for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, that any shall be saved, do what they will; or that others shall perish, do what they can.—If God has chosen any Man to Salvation, he has chosen him also to Sanctification; he has decreed that by Faith in Christ, by a Life of Holiness, and by Perseverance in both, and in no other Way, he shall obtain eternal Life; as I have particularly shewn above.—And what Grounds can there then be for these Consequences? What Grounds for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, in this Doctrine of the Decrees? When it's certain, not only from the Word, but from the Decrees of God, that no finally impenitent Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall ever get to Heaven; and that no perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Saint shall ever fall short of it. The latter make their Election, &amp; the former their Reprobation, sure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to it in a Way of Faith and Holiness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who have these Qualifications, are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected, and shall be eternally saved. But they who want these Qualifications, who finally continue to reject an offer'd Saviour, and to live slothful and irreligious Lives, have no Decree in their Favour. They'll never obtain Salvation by Vertue of God's Decree, that don't obtain it upon the Terms propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Gospel: for God has never decreed Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to any Man upon other Terms.</p>
            <p>These Things being consider'd, it will appear, the absolute Decrees of God are so far from encouraging Presumption, that they are in themselves a powerful Argument to the utmost Diligence &amp; Activity in the Concerns of our Souls and their eternal Safety.—If God has never decreed Salvation to any Man in any other Way but this, may I hope to be saved in the Neglect of this only appointed Means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it? Don't it concern me to be in earnest in this Matter, since I am certain from the Nature and Counsels, as well as from the Word of God, that I must inevitably perish, unless I give up my self to Christ, and live to God in all holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and Godliness? In this Way, I may make sure to my self that I was eternally chosen to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But in the contrary Way, my eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will be most certain and unavoidable. Does not therefore my Eternity depend upon most active Diligence <hi>to make my Calling and Election Sure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we should consider this Objection with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the common Affairs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps set the Unreasonableness and Injustice of it in a fuller and clearer Light.—We read, Job xiv. 5. <hi>That our Days are determin'd, the Number of our Mouths is with God, he has appointed our Bounds
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004710_0059_0000000000000000"/>
that we cannot pass.</hi>—Now will any Man argue from hence, that there is no Occasion to eat or drink, or use any Means for the Support or Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Life: for if the Continuance of his Life be decreed, he shall live, do what he will; and if not, he shall die, do what he can? Don't every one see, that their Lives are preserv'd, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that God decreed they should be preserv'd, by Meat, Drink, Medicine, and other Methods of Support and Sustentation; and that there's no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree will preserve them in the Neglect of these? And don't they act accordingly?—Our secular Affairs were certainly the Objects of God's Decrees, as well as the more important Concerns of our Souls eternal Interest. Even <hi>the Hairs of our Head are all numbered,</hi> in the Counsel of God. And will any Man argue from hence, that there's no Need to plow, or sow; that if God has decreed him a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, he shall have it, do what he will; if not, he shall have none, do what he can? Don't every one see, that the Decree of God won't till the Ground, sow the Seed, nor bring them a Crop, while they loiter away their Time, and neglect their Business? Don't all Men see, that if God has decreed them a Harvest, he has decreed that they shall obtain it in the Use of the appointed Means, and no otherwise; that if they don't sow, they cannot hope to reap? And don't they behave accordingly? How unreasonable then is this Objection! How unreasonable a Presumption would it be, for any to venture their Eternity upon such an Issue, as they dare not venture their Lives or their Estates upon!</p>
            <p>Having thus obviated the common Objections, that have been thrown in our Way, I must proceed now to the Consideration of the other Propositions
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004710_0060_0000000000000000"/>
before mentioned. But inasmuch as these have been occasionally anticipated in the foregoing Discourse, I shall be very brief in their Discussion.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>All that God has elected to eternal Life, he has chosen to Salvation by and through the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do see, in Fact, that the whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are <hi>fallen</hi> Creatures; and that if any of 'em do obtain eternal Life, they must be saved from a <hi>lost perishing</hi> Condition. And it is consequently evident, that Man was consider'd as a <hi>sallen</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in God's eternal Counsel; and that the Elect were <hi>chosen</hi> to be <hi>saved</hi> from this lost undone State, which the Fall has brought us all into.—Now, if <hi>fallen</hi> Man was the Object of God's electing Love, he must be chosen to Salvation in a <hi>Way</hi> agreeable to all the Perfections of the divine Nature. Since therefore we find from the Word of God, that our Salvation by the Merits and Mediation of <hi>Christ</hi> is the Method, whereby God has provided to have <hi>Mercy and Truth meet together, and Righteousness and Peace kiss each other;</hi> we may safely conclude, that this is the Way in which God eternally determin'd the Salvation of the Elect. In this Way he has in Time provided, and therefore eternally determin'd, <hi>to declare his Righteousness, that he might be just, and the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus;</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 26.—We are accordingly told, that the Crucifixion of Christ was <hi>by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Counsel and Fore-knowledge of God</hi> (Acts ii. 23.) <hi>What his Hand and Counsel determin'd before to be done</hi> (Acts iv. 28.) That the Elect had <hi>their Names written in the Book of Life, of the Lamb slain, from the Foundation of the World</hi> (Rev. xiii. 8.)
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004710_0061_0000000000000000"/>
and that <hi>their Salvation is according to God's own Purpose and Grace, which was given them in Christ Jesus before the World began.</hi> 2 Tim. i. 9.</p>
            <p>This then is the Way of Salvation, which God has decreed: This the only Foundation of our Hope. Both the Decrees of God, and the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, secure Salvation to the Believer in this Way; and in no other.—Whoever are chosen to eternal Salvation, will be brought to see their undone State and Inability to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to despair of Salvation by any Thing they can do, to receive the Lord Jesus Christ by Faith; and to depend upon him as their <hi>Wisdom, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> Until they thus <hi>lead the Life that they live here in the Flesh, by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> they can have no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all of their Election.—But I pass to the other and last Head.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>All who are chosen to eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in and by the Lord Jesus Christ, shall be sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; and thereby made meet to partake of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marks and Evidences of their Election must, in ordinary, be found with all the Elect; even in this Life. <hi>They are chosen in Christ, that they should be holy, and without Blame before him in Love.</hi>—I am not now considering the Case of elect <hi>Infants,</hi> who die in Infancy. He who has told us, <hi>of such is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> knows how to give them a Title to it; and does doubtless qualify them for Salvation, by the sanctifying Influences of his Spirit. Nor shall I venture to <hi>limit the holy One of Israel,</hi> by determining (as some have done) that none can be converted in the <hi>last Hours</hi> of their Lives; and never have Opportunity to evidence
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004710_0062_0000000000000000"/>
their Election<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to themselves or others, by a Life of Holiness. But as may safely conclude, that this is not God's ordinary Method of dealing with us, and that such Conversions are always to us suspicious and doubtful; so we may certainly conclude, that in <hi>adult</hi> Persons a holy Life is the natural and (in ordinary Cases) the necessary Fruit and Consequence of God's electing Love.—He tht has not been brought to <hi>submit to God,</hi> and <hi>walk humbly</hi> with the Lord, and to mourn for his Sins, to hate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake 'em; He that does not <hi>cut off his right Hand</hi> or <hi>Foot,</hi> and <hi>pluck out his right Eye, if it offend him;</hi> He that does not habitually watch over his Heart and Life, and <hi>hate every false Way;</hi> that does not seriously and diligently attend all the Ordinances of religious Worship, and live in the Exercise of every Grace, and the Practice of every Duty, towards God and Man; tht does not after all lament the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which necessarily accompany his highest At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in this imperfect State, and <hi>look for the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal Life;</hi> such an one (I say) has not the Marks and Characters of God's electiing Love upon his Soul; nor sufficient Grounds to conclude upon his Interest in it.—He has no Grounds indeed to conclude the contrary, because he is yet in his State of Probation; and though he has not obtain'd, he may yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the sanctifying Influences of the Spirit of Grace, that will both incline and enable him to live a Life of Holiness, and thereby evidence his Election of God.—This however is to be received for an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth, that the Will of God is always inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable the same; and that what he has revealed to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Will in his Word, was his Will from all
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004710_0063_0000000000000000"/>
Eternity; and consequently, since God's Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Holiness, as the Way to Happiness, they who are <hi>a chosen Generation,</hi> are also <hi>an holy Nation, a peculiar People, that they should shew forth the Praises of him that has called them out of Darkness into his marvellous Light.</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 9.</p>
            <p>There is so little Reason to fear, the Decrees of God (when rightly consider'd) will prompt to a Life of Carelesness &amp; Security, Wickedness &amp; Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they evidently have every Way the strongest Tendency to the contrary. They who from Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication have no Evidences of their Election, had need use earnest Diligence to obtain them: For (as I have already shewn) they can be obtain'd no other Way; and they can have no grounded Comfort, or Reason to conclude either their Election or Salvation, while they live in a Habit of wilful Negligence or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.—They who have good Evidences of their Election, do not only live a Life of Holiness, in Course, without which they cannot possibly have any such Evidences: But they must necessarily from the Principles of their renewed Nature, take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Delight in a Conformity to the whole Will of God.—In a truly sanctified Soul, <hi>old Things are passed away; and all Things are become new.</hi> The Understanding, the Will, Affections and Dispositions of the renewed Mind are all spiritual; whence he cannot but approve, chuse, and delight in a new and spiritual Life and Conversation. <hi>He is God's Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works, which God hath before ordain'd that he should walk in them.</hi> Eph. ii. 10.—Satisfying Evidences of God's eternal Love will fill the Mind with admiring adoring Thoughts of such distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kindness; and be a continued Source of Love,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004710_0064_0000000000000000"/>
Thankfulness, and Obedience, in the Soul that lives under the Light of God's Countenance. They who <hi>know the Love of Christ, which passeth Knowledge, are</hi> thereby <hi>filled with all the Fulness of God.</hi> Eph. iii. 19.—<hi> The Love of Christ constraineth us.</hi> 1 Cor. v. 14.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to make some Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what has been said, by Way of IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p>USE. I. It is, I think, a natural Inference from what has been said and prov'd, <hi>That there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Mankind, who are</hi> not <hi>elected to eternal Life, and who will of Consequence certainly fall short of it.</hi>—I shall not here undertake the Dispute, whether all that perish, are by a positive and absolute Decree of God predetermin'd to a Life of Sin, and to eternal Destruction for their Sin. There has been such bold disputing, on both Sides of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and such bold Consequences drawn from the Idea's, which both Parties have entertain'd of the Nature of God, that I cannot read those Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies without Horrour.—And what Occasion is there for these over-curious Enquiries? Cannot such poor Dust, as we, be contented to acknowledge our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of these unsearchable Mysteries of the divine Nature? Methinks, the Apostle's solemn Reprimand might be sufficient to stop our Mouths, and silence our confident metaphysical Disputes about the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind of God, and the Manner how his infinite Perfections concur in the Decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Rom. ix. 20. <hi>Nay, but (O Man) who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the Thing formed say to him that formed it, Why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004710_0065_0000000000000000"/>
in the Scriptures, Nothing a more necessary Deduction from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Perfections of God (as I have shewn above) than God's absolute Choice of a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to Grace and Glory, it is from hence certain, that the Number of the Elect can neither be increased nor diminished. Their Number is no more capable of Change, than the eternal Counsel by which they are chosen. Thus the <hi>Foundation of God,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to each Individual of that chosen Number, <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth sure.</hi>—So likewise, on the contrary, God's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a certain Number does necessarily imply his not electing of the rest, whose Number must be equally certain to God; and therefore equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Increase or Diminution. As those will certainly be saved, so these will certainly fall short of Salvation.—The Certainty of the Salvation of the Elect depends upon God's Decree to give them eternal Life, and by Grace to qualify them for it. Is there not then an equal Certainty, that they will not obtain Salvation, to whom God has not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to give these gracious Qualifications? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obtains eternal Salvation, must be made meet for it by Faith in Christ, and Holiness of Heart and Life. But fallen Creatures can have neither of these, neither the Will nor the Deed, unless God change their Hearts; and renew them in the Spirit of their Minds. And can we suppose that God will do this for them, if he has not predetermin'd to do it? This were to suppose a Change of Purpose in God, which is inconsistent with all his Perfections.</p>
            <p>I am sensible, that very great Difficulties may arise in our Minds from the Contemplation of this awful Subject; which perhaps may never be fully and clearly remov'd, until we come where we shall <hi>know even as also we are known.</hi> A Reconciliation
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004710_0066_0000000000000000"/>
of all the Mysteries of God's eternal Counsel, with his revealed Will, seems to be reserv'd for one of the Employments and Enjoyments of the heavenly World.—In the mean Time, it becomes us with humble Adoration to fall down at the Footstool of God's Sovereignty, with such Language as that, (Rom. xi. 33, 34.) <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his Judgments; and his Ways past finding out! For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counsellor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think however, that God has not left us without sufficient Light to clear it up to every humble Mind, that God's Ways are equal; and our Ways are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected, <hi>That this seems inconsistent with the</hi> Goodness <hi>and</hi> Justice of God, <hi>to make our Sin and Guilt necessary; and punish us eternally for what we can't help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, if God's Decrees were the <hi>Cause</hi> of our Sin and Guilt, there might then perhaps be some Foundation for this Objection. But inasmuch as the Decrees of God have no Causality at all either of the Sin or Perdition of Wicked Men, the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is groundless.—Though we cannot fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Order and Manner of the Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, with Respect to the Perdition of those that are not chosen to Salvation by Christ, but this (like the Appearance in <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Vision) <hi>is high and dreadful:</hi> Yet we may certainly know, that God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the Destruction and Perdition of any Man, but for final Continuance in Sin. And we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise certain, that he cannot by his Decree, or any other Ways, be the Cause and Author of that Sin which he will finally punish. The former of these
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004710_0067_0000000000000000"/>
is certain from the Word of God, where we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that <hi>the Soul that sins shall die;</hi> that God <hi>hath no Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked;</hi> and that he will eternally punish none but those, who <hi>after their Hardness and impenitent Heart treasure up Wrath against the Day of Wrath;</hi> and consequently that he decreed to punish none but such. The latter of these is certain from the Nature of God, who is <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</hi> and consequently cannot be the Author of what his Soul hates.—The Sins of the Reprobate are from Satan and their own Hearts; their future Punishment will be for the Sins which they have voluntarily committed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently continued in. The Decrees of God have no Hand in procuring either the one or the other. How then can we say, that <hi>the Way of the Lord is not equal?</hi> Certainly it will appear in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that <hi>the Judge of all the Earth hath done right.</hi> He will <hi>be justified when he speaks, and clear when he judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Certainty and Infallibility of the Event does indeed follow from the Decrees of God; consider them in what Sense we will. If we allow no more than God's Foreknowledge of the Sin and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reprobate, <hi>that</hi> makes the Futurity of both most certain; as I have fully prov'd already. But by what Consequence will it follow, that God can't be good and just, because he is Omniscient? Is it not on the contrary most certain, that he must be good and just, because he is Omniscient? For if he be infinite in one, he must be infinite in every one of his Perfections.—This makes it evident, that there may be from the Decrees of God an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Certainty of the Sinner's Perdition, consistent with the Divine Justice and Goodness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And we
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004710_0068_0000000000000000"/>
must not venture to suppose such a Decree, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inconsistent with either.</p>
            <p>The common Occasion of the Confusion of Men's Minds upon this Subject is this. They don't distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between <hi>the Necessity or infallible Certainty of the Event from the Decree of God,</hi> and <hi>God's causing, compelling,</hi> or some Way or other <hi>bringing to pass that Event by his Decree.</hi> But in the present Case there is an infinite Difference between these two Idea's The former implies no more than the eternal Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>God's Mind within himself</hi> (if I may so speak) without any Influence upon the Creature, and utterly unknown to him. The latter supposes <hi>God's Agency upon the Mind of the Creature,</hi> inclining him to Sin; and thereby constraining him to perish. The former is a necessary Deduction from God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Nature, as I have shewn: the latter is horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Blasphemy, to be rejected with Abhorrence.—There is no Necessity to be supposed in this Case from the Decrees of God; but a Necessity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility: that is, that the Event will be certain and cannot fail. But how does that imply any Compulsion upon the Creature, whereby the Event is brought about; and he constrain'd to Sin and perish? There is no Connection between such Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and Constraint, as I have prov'd already. Men may act in this Sense necessarily; and yet act most freely and voluntarily, without any Compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—They cannot be compelled by the eternal Counsel of God, which could not act upon them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Ages before they had any Being. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compelled by God's influencing them to sin: for <hi>God cannot be tempted of Evil; neither tempteth be any Man.</hi> Jam. i. 13. And why is not this sufficient to satisfy our Minds? What Occasion
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004710_0069_0000000000000000"/>
can there be for our perplexing our selves with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Difficulties, about the hidden and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counsel of God?</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be further objected; <hi>That this does not appear consistent with the</hi> general Calls <hi>and</hi> Offers <hi>of Salvation in the Gospel. How can these be sincere, when God knows that a great Part of the World of Mankind can never accept them?<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And is it not a</hi> Mockery, <hi>to propose such Conditions to them, which they cannot comply with; and yet punish them for their Non-Compliance with these impossible Conditions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer: How comes it to pass, that they <hi>cannot</hi> comply with these Proposals of the Gospel? The Decree of God is no Cause of their Impotency, any more than it is the Cause of their Sin.—<hi>God made Man upright,</hi> capable of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his whole Will concerning him; and his not decreeing to give him Grace, is no Cause of his wanting this primitive Perfection. If God's not decreeing to give <hi>Adam</hi> persevering Grace, was the Cause of his Apostacy, then the Cause of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy was in God himself; and God was the Author of his Sin: Which is Blasphemy to suppose.—The Cause therefore of our first Apostacy, and of all the Impotency flowing from it, is from Man himself. And must God change his Law, or retract his Demands of Obedience from us, because by our own Fault we are become uncapable of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? If a Master in a Morning command his Servant his Work till Night, is the Servant guiltless and unworthy of Punishment, if he wilfully break his Ax or Spade, and thereby render himself unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004710_0070_0000000000000000"/>
of Obedience?—If God had left all the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> to perish in a graceless State, we should have had no Cause to find Fault: For he owed no Grace to any of us. If he gives Grace to some and not to others, he acts as a sovereign Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, that may do what he will with his own. If he require perfect Obedience from an impotent Creature, he requires no more than what is due to him by the Law of Nature; and the Impotence of the Creature being his Fault, deserves Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and not the Reward of sanctifying Grace from God.—The Sum of the Matter then is, that God makes Proposals of Salvation indifferently to all. They that comply with them shall reap the Benefit; and as for other, swhether they are consider'd as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that they cannot, or obstinate, that they will not comply, the Fault is their own; and <hi>God &amp; his Throne are guiltless.</hi>—I, have here, it is true, consider'd all Mankind under the Guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, which is a Fact so clearly revealed in Scripture, that it ought not to be called in Question. See <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 12. forward. <hi>Psalm</hi> li. 5. with many other Places. And though it would be an impertinent Digression, to endeavour an Illustration of that Point at present<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to attempt that also, if God shall give me Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Opportunity.</p>
            <p>I add to this: God has decreed to give even to the Reprobate <hi>more</hi> Power and Ability, than they will ever improve. God does in Fact give, and therefore has decreed to give, even to them, a <hi>natural Power</hi> to consider of their sinful and dangerous Estate and Condition, to endeavour to mourn for their Sins, to watch against them and reform them, to pray to him in some Manner with Diligence and Constancy for the sanctifying Influences of his blessed
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004710_0071_0000000000000000"/>
Spirit, to attend upon all the appointed Means of Grace in Order to obtain both Grace and Glory; and to endeavour to be sincere in all this. And none of 'em will be able to plead in the Day of Christ, that they went as far as they could by their natural Power in a Compliance with the Will of God, and in seeking his gracious Influences; and yet after all he deny'd them special Grace.—It is true, that God knew from Eternity that they would not improve these natural Powers: But he also knew that it would be their <hi>own Fault,</hi> that they do not improve them. Must not he offer them Terms of Salvation worthy of a rational Creature, endued with such Powers and Faculties, because he knew that they would not embrace them? Don't they deserve Perdition, that won't so much as endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what Obedience they are capable of? And is not this the Case of every impenitent Sinner?</p>
            <p>Let us further consider where is the <hi>Seat</hi> of this Impotency, in those that are not chosen to Salvation; that it is in their <hi>Wills.</hi> They <hi>will not come unto Christ, that they might have Life.</hi> John v. 40.—It cannot be said of any Man, that he is <hi>truly will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to comply with the Terms of Salvation, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Christ as offer'd in the Gospel, to depend upon him only as the Fountain of Grace and Life, and to live to him in the Exercise of Godliness and Honesty; and yet that he <hi>wanted Ability</hi> to live conformable to his Will. For what is <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ, but the proper Exercise of our <hi>Wills?</hi> He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>chuses</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ for his Saviour, his Portion and Confidence, has unfeigned Faith in him. It's true, an unregenerate Man cannot believe in Christ; that is, he cannot be willing to accept of him upon Gospel-Terms. Were he sincerely willing
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004710_0072_0000000000000000"/>
to comply with the Proposals of the Gospel, he would have actual Faith in Christ.—What is <hi>Repentance,</hi> but the Exercise of our <hi>Wills?</hi> He that rejecteth and renounceth all his Lusts and Idols, and <hi>chooseth</hi> a Life of Holiness, is a true Penitent. The Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a natural Man to repent of his Sins, consists especially in this, that he cannot be sincerely willing to forsake all his Sins, and to live a Life of holy Obedience to God. The like may be said of all the Graces of the Spirit.—Every rational Creature is (while such)a free Agent, in his whole moral Conduct; and every free Agent act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> according to his own Will. Let the Sinner's Impotency therefore be rightly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated; and it must be called <hi>Obstinacy.</hi> Let this Objection be fairly represented; and it must stand thus: <hi>How can God be sincere in the general Offers of Salvation in the Gospel, when he foresaw from Eternity an obstinate Part of Mankind, that would not by any Means be persuaded to comply with them?</hi> This is a just stating the Case; and a bare stating it in this Form is sufficient.</p>
            <p>Once more. There is no man living <hi>knows</hi> that he is <hi>not</hi> chosen to eternal Life; nor can know it, but by an obstinate final Perseverance in Sin and Impenitence.—As the Offers of Salvation in the Gospel are made indifferently to all, so all have a like natural Capacity to be mov'd and influenced by them. And no Man whatsoever has any more Grounds of Discouragement before him upon the Account of God's Decrees, than every Man in the World has.—Our Business therefore is not to stand disputing about the unsearchable Mysteries of God's eternal Counsel: but to be most active and earnest and constant in seeking an Interest in Christ and his Salvation. In this Way we may hope for the saving
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004710_0073_0000000000000000"/>
Efficacy of his Grace, and in no other. If we are found in this Way, there is no Decree that will compel us to sin and perish. If we are never found in this Way, there can be no Decree to save us.</p>
            <p>USE II. <hi>This Doctrine administers Matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable</hi> Comfort <hi>to true Believers, to all that have Experience of a Work of Grace in their Souls; in that their Security of</hi> persevering <hi>in Grace unto eternal Salvation, is thereby proportionable to the Evidences of their Sanctification.</hi>—It is certain, that if God has begun a Work of Grace in their Souls, he has done this agreable to his eternal Counsel. He has had no new Purpose or Design, no new Motive to act with Respect to them. And if he eternally purposed to sanctify them, he also eternally purposed to glorify them. He never design'd their Sanctification to any lower End. They may therefore be ascertain'd, that as he has begun, he will also carry on this Work of Grace in their Souls, unto the Day of Christ.—<hi>Who shall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect?</hi> since <hi>it's God that justifieth them. Who is he that condemneth</hi> those who have thus evidenced their Election of God? <hi>It is Christ who died <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Shall Tribulation, or Distress, or Persecution, or Famine, or Nakedness, or Peril, or Sword? </hi> No surely! <hi>They may be persuaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things present, nor Things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, shall be able to separate them from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi> Rom. viii. 33,—39.</p>

               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:004710_0074_0000000000000000"/>What a <hi>distressing</hi> Consideration must it be to such who have once experienced the Joy &amp; Peace of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they had greater Reason to fear a total <hi>Apostacy</hi> from this happy State, than to hope for Perseverance in it? And such must be their Case, if their Hope were not built upon this <hi>sure Foundation.</hi> For if their Stability depended upon any Thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, upon their good Purposes, Promises, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of a religious Life, how many thousand Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers would there be in the Way? What a dreadful Hazard would there be, that by the Strength of their own Corruptions, the subtle and powerful Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, the Vanities of the World, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of wicked Men, or a gradual Decay of their Graces, they should <hi>draw back unto Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, what inexpressible <hi>Comfort</hi> must it be to them, to consider, that the present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit of Grace which they experience in their own Souls, are the Pledge and Earnest of their <hi>Perseverance</hi> in Grace, and of their eternal <hi>Reward!</hi> And this is the necessary Consequence of the Doctrine I have been insisting upon. For he that, has manifested his Love to any of us by giving us sanctifying Grace, has loved us with an <hi>everlasting Love;</hi> and will certainly love us to the End.—Could such therefore but keep a just View of this comfortable Doctrine before them, how would it fill their Souls with even Raptures of <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> of the eternal distinguishing Love of God! How would it quicken and invigorate them in their spiritual Race, when they have such a clear Prospect of the glorious <hi>Prize</hi> before them? How would it strengthen them in all the rough Encounters they may meet with, when they consider what a glorious

               <hi>Captain</hi> they fight under, and what Assurance they have of <hi>Victory</hi> in the Conclusion? How would it endear the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to 'em, <hi>in whom</hi> they are <hi>chosen</hi> to eternal Life! How would it fill them with Love to <hi>God</hi> and his Service, when they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as a kind indulgent <hi>Father;</hi> and themselves (though most unworthy) as adopted <hi>Heirs</hi> of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inheritance! How would it fill them with a perpetual Abhorrence of every Sin, as vile Ingratitude to such a bountiful Benefactor! How would it sweeten even Death itself, when they consider it as an Entrance into the <hi>Joy of their Lord!</hi> And how would it prove a constant Source of Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in all their Trials; be their <hi>Song in the House of their Pilgrimage;</hi> and make the Ways of <hi>Wisdom</hi> appear indeed <hi>Ways of Pleasantness; and all her Paths Peace!</hi>

            <p>USE III. This Doctrine may be improv'd by Way of most earnest <hi>Exhortation</hi> to every one, to <hi>give all Diligence to make his Calling and Election sure;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 10.—It is certainly attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Life, to make sure to ourselves, that we <hi>were chosen in Christ before the Foundations of the World:</hi> Otherwise it would not be urged upon us by the Apostle, as our Duty and Interest. And if attainable, how justly does it challenge our utmost Care, Concern, and Application!—We are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to secure a good Title to our Houses and Lands; and are uneasy while we think our Title precarious. But it is of infinitely greater Importance to see to it, that our Foundation for Eternity is well laid. And I venture to say, I'm persuaded that there is no indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Person among <hi>Us</hi> but may (if he ben't really wanting to himself) make it certain to him, that <hi>his Name</hi> was from Eternity <hi>enrolled in the Book of

Life.</hi> Though it be true, that this is not in Fact the Case of every one, as I have prov'd before: Yet it is also true, that it in Reality is the Case of all such who with the <hi>utmost Care, Watchfulness</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> and with a <hi>humbling</hi> Sense of their own Unworthiness, are <hi>constantly</hi> sound at the Footstool of Divine Grace, seeking for an Interest in <hi>Christ</hi> and the gracious Influences of the blessed Spirit; and that <hi>earnestly</hi> and <hi>constantly,</hi> with a humble <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> on the Grace of God, endeavour after all <hi>holy Conversation</hi> and <hi>Godliness.</hi> They who neglect this, have dark Symptoms upon 'em; and have no Grounds to conclude their <hi>Election of God.</hi>—Tho' we can't <hi>claim</hi> either Grace or Glory on Account of what we do or can do: Yet if we <hi>persevere</hi> in the Way described, God has <hi>encouraged</hi> us to expect that he will, and therefore we <hi>may</hi> hope that he certainly will <hi>for his own Sake</hi> (not for ours) glorify his free Grace in our Sanctification and Salvation. <hi>He has not said to the House of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Seek ye me in vain.</hi> If we are <hi>stedfast, immoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, our Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>—They who are not elected will not indeed ever come to do this, and so will certainly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. But then the immediate Cause and moral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this is wholly <hi>in themselves:</hi> They <hi>neglect the great Salvation;</hi> they <hi>resist</hi> and <hi>quench the Holy Spirit; they will not frame their Doings to turn to the Lord:</hi> Thus they are wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and they'll perish through their own Fault.</p>
            <p>There is something therefore before us of much greater Importance than <hi>over-curious</hi> Enquiries, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi> Speculations and <hi>distracting</hi> Debate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>electing Love.</hi> O why are we not then in earnest in an Affair of such everlasting Consequence? Why don't this exercise our Thoughts and Care more than every Thing else? Why don't it ly down and rise with us, and accompany us in the whole Conduct of our Lives? Can we rest contented in a dreadful Uncertainty, whether we are like to be saved or damned to all Eternity? Can we be contented while we have no Grounds to conclude, that we must not spend a doleful Eternity in Weeping and Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth, under the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Agonies of infinite Vengeance?—Let us then <hi>up and be doing,</hi> &amp; we may hope <hi>the Lord will be with us.</hi> There is no need to search into the Archives of Eternity to know our State. There is no need to say in our Hearts, <hi>Who shall ascend into Heaven</hi> to bring us an Account from thence, or <hi>Who shall descend into the Deep</hi> to bring up one from thence? The Evidence <hi>is nigh us, even in our own Hearts</hi> and Lives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to the Word of Christ. And if we do but follow these two DIRECTIONS, we cannot fail of obtaining it.</p>

If we make this sure, the other will be equally certain.</p>
            <p>Let us then strive to make sure to ourselves the Sincerity of <hi>our Repentance</hi> towards God. That we have seen the Evil of Sin, have seen our Sinfulness by Nature and Practice, and abhorred ourselves in our own Eyes; have heartily mourned for, hated and forsaken our Sins without Reserve; and turn'd from

rightly conceived. Many strong Prejudices have therefore arisen in Men's Minds against it. Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Pride and Haughtiness is hardly brought to stoop to such a humbling and abasing Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And there are some apparent Difficulties in the Doctrine, which make some Men imagine it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the divine Perfections; and therefore unworthy to be received or taught.—But whatever Opposition this may meet with, from these or other like Reasons, it is clearly and fully revealed in the Scriptures; and it is therefore certain, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against it cannot be just, how plausible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may appear. As the whole Tenour of the Bible every where considers, directs, and treats us as apostate sinful Creatures, so the Nature, Manner, and Consequences of our Apostacy, are particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in sundry Passages both of the Old and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament: But perhaps in none more fully, than in the Words before us, with the following Context. In these Words we may note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apostle's <hi>Design</hi> in introducing them in this Place, represented by the illative Word, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>—That we may have a clearer View of this, we must recur to the foregoing Verses of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where our being <hi>justified by Christ's Blood,</hi> our being <hi>reconciled to God by the Death of his Son,</hi> and our <hi>receiving the Attonement</hi> by him, are particularly celebrated.—That this Doctrine of our Justification by the Merits of Christ's Death might not be Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Prejudice, 'tis here illustrated and explain'd by another Doctrine more wonderful, which was notwithstanding always received for an undoubted Truth.—Wherefore as it is on all Hands allowed,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004710_0082_0000000000000000"/>
that by the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin we are all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sinful and guilty before God, it cannot be tho't strange, that by the Imputation of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, we should be justified in his Sight. If it be allow'd to be just in God, to impute the Guilt of our first Parents Sin to us, it may much more easily be supposed, that God may from the Riches of his Grace impute the Merits of Christ's Death to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, without any Appearance of Injustice. <hi>For if through the Offence of one, many be dead; much more the Grace of God and the Gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto Many.</hi>—This is plainly the Scope of the Apostle's Argument in this Context. From whence it appears, that the Words of our Text are not only to be allow'd for a Truth not controverted; but for a Truth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiv'd in the Apostolick Times, in that they were here improved by the Apostle, as a Medium to illustrate and evince another Doctrine by.—As it cannot be just arguing, to bring any Thing for a Medium to prove another by, unless it be more clear in itself, or at least more known and generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; it is therefore necessary, that the Doctrine of the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin to his Posterity was known and generally receiv'd by those to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> whom the Apostle wrote; for it is not more clear in it self than the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: But more difficult to conceive of. That being a Display of Justice, this of Goodness and Mercy; that an Imputation of Sin and Guilt, this of Merits and Benefits. In that God acts as a Judge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> whose Conduct must be equal and right according to the Rules of Justice; in this as a gracious Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who may be as good as he pleases.—It being
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004710_0083_0000000000000000"/>
therefore necessary, that this was a known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Truth, it also appears, that we are not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in supposing this Doctrine taught in the Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament; for from thence they must have learn'd it, unless they were particularly instructed in it by the inspired Teachers of those Times: And if this was the Case, it must have been an ancient Doctrine, tho' now more clearly revealed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may note in the Words, <hi>a plain and full Declaration of the Sin and Guilt brought upon the</hi> World of Mankind. <hi>Sin entred into the World—All have sinned.</hi> No Words can possibly be used, more fully to express the Universality of the Contagion and Pollution of Original Sin. Sin has not only <hi>entred into the World:</hi> But ALL, universally without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, <hi>have sinned;</hi> and are consequently under the Guilt of that Sin, which they are ALL charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with.—If it be objected, that the Particle ALL is not here to be accepted in its largest Extent, as implying every individual Person, inasmuch as the same Particle is used by the Apostle in this Discourse, where it cannot be so understood. Thus in Verse 18<hi>th</hi> he tells us, that <hi>by the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon</hi> ALL <hi>Men to Justification of Life.</hi>—I answer, that if the Scope and Design of the Apostle's Reasoning be consider'd, it will be found that this Particle must be understood as carrying in it the Idea of Universality in both these Verses. The Apostle is there comparing <hi>Adam</hi> with <hi>Christ;</hi> and running the Parallel between them, as they were both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Persons, and Representatives of their Posterity. He shews us, that as <hi>all Adam's</hi> natural Progeny whom he represented, were without Exception char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004710_0084_0000000000000000"/>
with his Sin and Guilt; so <hi>all</hi> Christ's spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Posterity whom he represented, are also without Exception, Partakers of <hi>Righteousness unto Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Life.</hi>—The Term ALL must therefore be understood in our Text to be of universal Extent, as including every individual Person, that proceeds from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary Generation. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ indeed, though truly and really Man, is not included in this Number; Because he was not a Descendant from <hi>Adam,</hi> in a Way of Nature: tho' none of <hi>Adam's</hi> natural Descendants are exempted.—It is further Observable, that Sin and Death are here represented, as being by the same Means of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Extent, by the same universal Particle. <hi>Death pass'd upon</hi> ALL <hi>Men, for that</hi> ALL <hi>have sinned.</hi> As natural Death therefore is, without Distinction, the common Lot of <hi>all</hi> Mankind, it being appointed for all Men once to die, so the Sin and Guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> natural Posterity are as universal as their Mortality.—I might add, that it would be no Ways favourable to the Cause of our Adversaries. if this Particle ALL were taken in a more limited and restrained Sense. For if it be just and equal in God, to impute <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin with its Consequences to <hi>any</hi> of his Posterity, it is for the same Reason just and equal to impute his Sin to ALL, without Distinction. He was as much the general Head and Representative of one, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—And what serves further to illustrate this Matter is, that the Words of the Text now under Consideration should not be rendred as in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, <hi>for that all have sinned:</hi> but <hi>in him</hi>

If this be the Meaning of our Text, it should be thus understood. <hi>By one Man</hi> Mortality <hi>entred into the World, and Death by</hi> Mortality; <hi>and so Death passed upon all Men; for in him all are become mortal</hi>

And consequently he must in them also, be chargeable with the greatest Impropriety. Upon that Supposal, we should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the following Context in this Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Until the Law,</hi> Mortality <hi>was in the World: but</hi> Mortality <hi>was not imputed, when there were no Law.</hi>

Verse 13. <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not been</hi> mortal, <hi>after the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Adam's</hi> Mortality. Verse 14. <hi>But not as the</hi> Mortality, <hi>so is the free Gift; for if through the</hi> Mortality <hi>of one, many be dead</hi> &amp;c. Verse 15.—The like Impertinency would be found throughout the Chapter: the meer Representation whereof, is a sufficient Refutation of this trifling Construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Words are in themselves most plain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; and fully represent us ALL as being under the Imputation of Original Sin. There is no other Difficulty to understand 'em, but Men's Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to believe 'em.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Words represents to us the <hi>deadly Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of our Apostate sinful State. <hi>And Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men.—Death,</hi> we see, has the same universal Extent with Original Sin, and has passed upon all the natural Offspring of <hi>Adam.</hi> And if we understand these Words to refer only to natural <hi>Death,</hi> the Experience of all the World has put the Truth of 'em out of Doubt.—But it appears manifest, that the Apostle used the Word <hi>Death</hi> in its largest Extent, to imply spiritual, as well as natural <hi>Death.</hi> For it is considered as the Fruit, Consequence and Wages of Sin. It's that <hi>Death</hi> which came by Sin.

               <hi>Death</hi> is here considered as being all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fruit of Sin from which Christ came to redeem us; and must therefore imply a greater Evil than Mortality. Our Lord Jesus Christ is represented throughout this Chapter, as delivering us from the sad Effects of our first Parents Apostacy. And if we would know what they are, we may recur to the first Covenant between God and <hi>Adam,</hi> where we find nothing worse threatned upon the Violation of that Covenant, and consequently nothing worse has been inflicted, than <hi>Death.</hi> That <hi>Death</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with which <hi>Adam</hi> was threatned in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was all the Misery consequent upon his Fall; and all the Occasion of Christ's undertaking our Redemption; and must consequently imply more in it than natural <hi>Death.</hi> And whatever was included in the Threatning, from which <hi>Adam</hi> was redeem'd by the promised Seed of the Woman, is included in the Word <hi>Death</hi> in the Text; for it is of <hi>that</hi> the Apostle speaks. It is that <hi>Death</hi> which <hi>has passed upon all Men: For in him all have sinned.</hi> The Apostle accordingly represents <hi>the Grace of God, and the Gift by Grace, by one Man Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>the Grace which reigns through Righteousness unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, by Jesus Christ our Lord,</hi> as our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Recovery from this <hi>Death,</hi> which is <hi>through the Offence of one</hi> and is the Consequence of his <hi>Sin reigning</hi> in the World. (In the 15, 17, and 21 Verses in this Chapter.)—This <hi>Death</hi> must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imply, that our sinful Nature and sinful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which flow from it, our State of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Exposedness to eternal Misery, are the Fruits of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, as well as natural <hi>Death;</hi> for from all these Christ came to redeem us.—I might
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004710_0088_0000000000000000"/>
also add, that this <hi>Death</hi> implies in it our Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the Apostle himself assures us, in the 16th and 18th Verses of this Chapter; and consequently must signify spiritual, as well as natural Death. I think it's a clear Case, that if by <hi>the Offence of one, Judgment is come upon all Men unto Condemnation,</hi> as the Apostle asserts, there have worse Effects of that Offence come upon all Men, than meerly a State of Mortality. We cannot be in a State of Condemnation, unless we are spiritually dead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Text sets before us the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the Universal Sin, Guilt, and Misery, of the World of Mankind. <hi>By one Man, Sin entred into the World.</hi> It is allowed by every Body, that <hi>Adam</hi> is the one Man here intended; and that it was by him, that <hi>Sin entred into the World; and Death by Sin.</hi> If it be enquired, how <hi>Eve</hi> comes to be excepted from having a Hand in propagating this Contagion to her miserable Posterity, when she was <hi>first in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression:</hi> I answer, that it's probable that she may not be excepted, but <hi>included,</hi> in these Words of the Apostle. She may be consider'd as belonging to <hi>Adam;</hi> and being as it were a Part of him. The Term <hi>Man</hi> may be a collective Term, including both Male and Female, according to that, Gen. i. 26. <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and let</hi> them <hi>have Dominion,</hi> &amp;c. The like Phraseology is frequently found in Scripture.—But if otherwise, we must suppose, that as the Covenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi> personally, though <hi>Eve</hi> was included in the Prohibition; yet, she was not, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, considered in that Covenant, to be the Head and Representative of a future Posterity.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:004710_0089_0000000000000000"/>The greatest Difficulty in these Words before us, is to understand in what Sense <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> entred into the World, by this <hi>one Man.</hi> In answer to which, it has been the Common received Doctrine of the Church of Christ, that as <hi>Adam</hi> was the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he was likewise constituted the moral Head and Representative of all Mankind; and that the first Covenant with it's Sanctions, was made with him in that Capacity and Relation. He was therefore to stand or fall, not only for himself, but for all his Posterity. Had he obey'd that single and easy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But his Disobedience to such an easy and reasonable Command incurr'd the Penalty threatned, both to himself and to all whom he represented.—That <hi>Adam</hi> is thus consider'd by the Apostle in such a public Capacity, as representing and acting for all his Posterity, appears manifest from the whole Scope of this Context, in which he is every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to Christ; and the Parallel run between them; And in which Sin and Death are represented, as brought upon the World by <hi>Adam,</hi> in the same Manner as the free Gift of Justification and Life, are procured for us by the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ. For as by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners, so by the Obedience of One shall many be made righteous,</hi> Verse 19. To the like Purpose also are the 15th, 18th, and 21st Verses. Now as it is confessed on all Hands, that the Lord Jesus Christ represented us and acted for us in his Work of Redemption, so it seems necessary to allow, in Order to make the Apostle's Discourse pertinent and intelligible, that <hi>Adam</hi> is here considered, as representing us and acting for us in his

first, Transgression. In what else can the Parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Offence and Christ's Righteousness consist; but in their being both publick Persons and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives of others? Agreeable to this, the Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 47. speaks of <hi>Adam</hi> as the <hi>first</hi> Man, and <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>second;</hi> as if there never had been more than those two Men in the World. But in what Respect can we possibly imagine these two to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and comprehend the rest of Mankind, unless they be consider'd as publick Heads and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of them?</p>
            <p>It is certainly most clearly evident from this Text, that we are some Way or other become Sinners by <hi>Adam's</hi> Disobedience. And can this possibly be, but either merely by our Desc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt from him in a Way of Generation; or by our being in him as our public Head and Representative. It cannot be true, that in the former Sense we any more sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> than in our immediate Parents and in each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Person of our Progenitors; and therefore in that Sense it cannot be true, that <hi>by one Man Sin entred into the World; and Death by Sin.</hi> For if Sin and Death are derived to us merely in a Way of natural Generation, they entred into the World not by one Man only, but by more than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men. It must therefore necessarily follow, that Sin entred into the World by this one Man, as the legal Head and Representative of his whole Race; and that what he did in that Character was done for them all, as well as for himself.</p>

            <p>No Man that will view the Circumstances of an apostate World, and consider the State of his own Soul, can find Room to doubt the universal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this Contagion.—If we look into our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, what Darkness covers them! What Ignorance of God and the Things of God is seen, not only in the Heathen World, where Stocks and Stones and inanimate Things are worshipped as the Author of their Being and Happiness: but even in the most enlightned Part of the World, where the <hi>natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God! but they are Foolishness unto him;</hi> What Error and Mistake are we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

many perish by believing strong Delusions, many grope in the Dark, not knowing in what Way to walk; and all are liable to Error, while cloathed with Mortality! What Folly and Madness are in the Hearts of Men, that they will by no Means be persuaded to consider the Things of their Peace, and to consult and pursue their best Interest: until their Understandings are enlightned by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influences of divine Grace!—If we look into our Wills, what Opposition do we find there, to the Love, Fear and Service of God! How do all Men naturally chuse the Service of Sin and Satan, and the Vanities of Time and Sense, before the Favour of God, and eternal Happiness! How obstinate, how refractory are they in their sinful Gratifications; notwithstanding all the Terrors and Dangers of which they have such a dreadful Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect!—If we consider our Affections and Appetites, how irregular, how vile do they appear to be! How little is God in the Thoughts of carnal Men! How far is he from being the Object of their Desire or Delight! How disagreeable are all the Perfections of his Nature to their Minds! How are the Ways of Godliness their Aversation, that they cannot by any Motives be prevailed with, to walk in them! How are their Hearts glew'd to these perishing Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows! What base and sordid Lusts do they grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy at all Adventures! How impetuously do their Appetites hurry them on in those Pursuits, which they cannot but know to be repugnant to all their most valuable Interests, both in this World and that to come!—If we consider our Passions, how violent, inordinate, and ungovernable will they appear; how hard to be tamed, regulated, and kept under proper
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004710_0096_0000000000000000"/>
Restraint! How do they often drive us like a Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, against all the Dictates of Reason; and indeed against ail our Powers of Opposition!—Again, if we consider our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> how vain are their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects! How restless are they in their Operations! How frisking, roving, &amp; wandring from one Vanity to another! How impertinently and unseasonably do they interrupt and hinder us, from any serious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our more important Concerns! How ready are they to run astray, after forbidden Objects! How ready to receive sinful Impressions; and even to set the whole Soul on Fire with their wicked Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions!—In a Word, whatever Faculty of the Soul comes into View, it appears to be altogether Pollution and Defilement. <hi>The carnal Mind is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God; nor indeed can be. They that are in the Flesh, cannot please God.</hi> Rom. viii. 7. 8.—<hi>The Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately Wicked; who can know it?</hi> Jer. xvii. 9.</p>
            <p>And this Pollution does not only extend to our Minds: But the <hi>Members of our Bodies</hi> too are all become <hi>Instruments of Unrighteousness unto Sin.</hi> The Body is not only many Ways a Clogg and Hindrance to the Soul, from making any Progress in its spiritual Concerns: But the bodily Senses are the Inlets to Multitudes of those sinful Disorders, with which the Soul is defiled. So that the whole Man is corrupted, and we want to be <hi>sanctified wholly, in our whole Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Soul, and Body. For we are all as an unclean Thing; and our Iniquities, as the Wind, have taken us away,</hi> Isai. lxiv. 6.</p>
            <p>Now, that this State of Pollution is a State of <hi>Guilt,</hi> is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004710_0097_0000000000000000"/>
of the Law of Nature. <hi>God made Man upright;</hi> and had therefore a just Claim upon him, of a sincere intire and universal Obedience. God had a just Demand of his Heart and Affections, of his Fear, Love, Complacency, and Delight; as well as of an external Conformity to the Duties of natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If therefore instead of loving God, our Hearts are full of Enmity against him; and Opposition to his Holiness and other Perfections of his Nature: If instead of choosing God for our Portion, we prefer the World and our Lusts before him: If instead of spiritual and heavenly Affections, our Hearts are full of Vanity and Sensuality: If instead of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exercises which Nature itself teaches, these Things are such a Burthen, as to be either wholly neglected, or hypocritically perform'd: If instead of that Obedience, which is due from a Creature to his Creator, we are serving divers Lusts and Pleasures: It is from hence most evident, that we are all become <hi>Guilty before God.</hi> And that in all these Instances I have been drawing the Character of every unsanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Person, appears evident from what has been said above.—It is an impertinent Plea, to say, That this Depravity of our Nature is what we <hi>cannot help;</hi> and therefore what cannot be our <hi>Fault.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is a Fault somewhere, that we are thus estranged from God and Godliness, and thus in love with Sin and Vanity. None dare be so hardy as to impute this Fault to a just and holy God; it must therefore lie at their own Door; and we must be guilty, whatever are Men's Imaginations about it.</p>
            <p>But this I shall have Occasion to consider more particularly, under another Head,</p>
            <p n="2">

            <p>And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I think this is most evident from the <hi>Experience</hi> of all the World.—We see in Fact, that this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is our Case; and to debate it, is even to dispute against our Senses, and against the clearest Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we are capable of in any Case whatsoever.—Don't every Body see, that in our first Actions there is no Appearance at all of Love to God or Holiness; no spiritual Affection, no Promptitude or Towardliness to any Thing that is morally good; nor any Thing of this Nature to be introduced, but by great Care, Pains, and Culture, all which meets with strongest Opposition from a contrary Byass. What then is become of the Image of God, in which we were at first created? Is it not most evident, that this is not only defaced; but utterly lost in our Souls?—If we still extend our Views further, that Pollution of all our Powers and Faculties, which I have described, is a Fact every where experienced and observ'd. What is the first Propensity of our Children, if they are suffer'd to follow their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations without Restraint? What Courses do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplin'd Youth chuse and pursue? How does their Enmity to God, and their Delight in Sin and Sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in our Souls, is obvious, from the Impossibility of eradicating them, without the omnipotent Agency of divine Grace. We every Day see Men go on in sinful Courses, against all their valuable Interests tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal, against the Light of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; and even against frequent Apprehensions of external Damnation. We frequently see them wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off all Convictions, breaking through all Purposes and Promises of Reformation, and venturing upon the <hi>thick Bosses of God's Buckler;</hi> though they can't but know when they at all consider, that it is for their Lives. And how strong and impetuous must those Lusts be, that the Fear of eternal Damnation won't mortify and restrain!—If it be objected, that I am here only describing the Case of the most profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and abandon'd Part of Mankind: I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How came they to be thus profligate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd, how came they by these corrupt and sinful Inclinations, if their Natures are not polluted and defiled? But I may even appeal to the Experience of the most vertuous and religious of the Children of Men, whether they don't find a continued Struggle with the same sinful Affections and Appetites, that are so visible in the Lives of the more careless and secure: Whether they are not forc'd to maintain a continual Warfare with their Lusts, if they would live a religious Life. And whence is it that <hi>the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit; and the Spirit against the Flesh;</hi> but from the Remainders of those Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that reign in the unsanctified? From thence it was, that the Apostle himself found Cause to groan under this Burthen; and to exclaim, as in Rom. vii. 24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:004710_0100_0000000000000000"/>I might further argue from our constant Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the dreadful Effects of Original Sin, upon the whole World of Mankind. What a vast Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Miseries and Calamities do we see every where obtain in the World! And <hi>what meaneth the Heat of this Anger;</hi> and what is the Source of this Affliction and Wo? Whence is it, that we are thus <hi>born to Trouble, as the Sparks fly upward?</hi> Surely God would not delight to punish an innocent Creature; and to make him thus miserable.—If it be pretended, that this is the Fruit of our <hi>actual</hi> Sin: I enquire, how <hi>Infants</hi> that have never been guilty of actual Sin, came by their Share in the common Calamity? We see that Sickness and Death, invades them as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And if <hi>Death</hi> be <hi>the Wages of Sin,</hi> as the Scriptures assure us it is, they would not be liable to Punishment, if free from Sin and Guilt. Hence, if we had no other Evidence than our own Experience, we might plainly discover, that we are naturally <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> according to <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 1.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This also appears evident from the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Christ. What can make the Misery of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State more evident, than the infinite Price expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our Recovery out of it? Did the glorious God contrive this wonderful Method of Salvation for us, when there was no Necessity for it? Did the Lord Jesus Christ shed his own Blood for a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of innocent Creatures? Or was it not because that <hi>we were without Strength, that Christ died for the Ungodly?</hi> May we not <hi>thus judge, that if Christ died for all then are all dead?</hi> As in 2 Cor. v. 14. Was not Christ's precious Blood shed as a Ransom for Sin; and were not, they therefore Sinners, for
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004710_0101_0000000000000000"/>
whom the Ransom was paid? Was not the Lord Jesus Christ <hi>made a Curse for us;</hi> and don't that Evidence, that we are all under the Curse of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Law? Was not the End of his Death as a Propitiation and Atonement, to free us from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and don't it therefore follow, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has told us, that <hi>we are condemn'd already, while we do not believe on the only Begotten Son of God;</hi> and that <hi>we are by Nature the Children of Wrath?</hi> In a Word, Christ gave himself <hi>a Ransom for all,</hi> either as innocent or guilty Creatures. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can hardly be supposed: there was no Need to purchase Pardon at so dear a Rate, for those that did not want it. Whence it follows, that we are fallen guilty Creatures, in that we are redeem'd by the Blood of God.</p>
            <p>If it be pretended (as some have pretended) <hi>That Christ came not into the World to redeem us from a fallen State: But to give us a new Edition of the</hi> Law of Nature, <hi>very much effaced and worn out of the Minds of Men; to propose</hi> easier <hi>Terms of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Mankind, than perfect Obedience; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Truth of his Doctrine, by sealing it with his Blood:</hi>—</p>
            <p>I answer, This Pretence is as directly contrary to the Scripture-Account of this Matter, as can possibly be conceived. We are there taught, that <hi>he was set forth to be a Propitiation for Sin,</hi> that <hi>he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our Offences,</hi> that <hi>he dyed for the Ungodly,</hi> that <hi>he gave himself for our Sins,</hi> that <hi>he was made Sin for us, who kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w no Sin,</hi> that <hi>he appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himself,</hi> that <hi>he also once suffer'd for Sins, the Just for the Unjust;</hi> and the like. Now can any Man read such Texts as these,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:004710_0102_0000000000000000"/>
and deny that we are in a State of Sin and Guilt; and that Christ came to redeem us from that State with his own Blood? If this may be justly deny'd, it is impossible to understand any thing by the strongest and plainest Expressions that can be used.—But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Imagination were not contradicted by the Scriptures, might we not enquire of such Objectors, what Need there can be of a new Edition of the Law of Nature, if we are not fallen Creatures? If we had retain'd our original Integrity, we should certainly have Light enough to know our Duty. It can't be supposed, that God made us at first ignorant of, and uncapable to answer the End of our Being. And if we had this Capacity at our first Creation, we still retain it, unless we are fallen from our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rectitude, and have lost those Powers with which we were created. Neither Time nor Custom could obliterate such Powers of Nature; and make the World ignorant, without special Revelation, of the very first principles of Faith and Practice.—But it is pretended, that we wanted easier Terms of Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God; and that the great Redeemer came into the World and shed his precious Blood to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them. I would here again reply, What need can there be of easier Terms of Acceptance? God was not a hard Master, to require impossible or unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Terms of his Favour. He certainly at first gave us Powers, equal to the Obedience he required of us. And we must still retain the same Capacity, unless we have lost it by our Apostacy from God. If Obedience to the Law of Nature was our reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Service at first, it is so still. If it was at first easy to be perform'd, it yet remains so, if we have the same natural Powers with which we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:004710_0103_0000000000000000"/>
And why is it not as equal in God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us the Improvement of these natural Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties now, as at the first?—Nothing therefore can be more repugnant to the whole Tenour of the Gospel, Nothing more unreasonable, than this Supposal. We must acknowledge ourselves to be apostate guilty Creatures, or we can give no good Reason for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Price of our Redemption, the Blood of Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we are all by Nature in a State of Sin and Guilt, is <hi>most frequently, clearly and expresly</hi> revealed <hi>to us in Scripture.</hi>—It cannot indeed be declared in more strong plain and intelligible Expressions, than what are found in our Text and Context. We have there an express Dissertation upon the Subject. The Doctrine is there strongly asserted, and clearly illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated.—But this is not the only Evidence to be found in Scripture, of the sad Truth under Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The whole Word of God considers us as fallen Creatures, as being in a State of Sin, Pollution, and Condemnation. And there is no Way to avoid the Force of the many full and plain Texts to this Purpose; but by strain'd and unnatural Glosses and Interpretations, upon Words in themselves most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and easy to be understood. What can be plainer, than such Texts as these? <hi>I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Psal. li. 5. <hi>The Wicked are estranged from the Womb, they go astray as soon as they are born.</hi> Psal. lviii. 3. <hi>There is not a just Man upon Earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.</hi> Eccles. vii. 20.—<hi> The Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately Wicked.</hi> Jer. xvii. 9.—<hi>We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin.

               </gap>—<hi>We know that the whole World lieth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 1 John v. 19.—Many more Testimonies from the Spirit of God might be produced, to evince the Truth of this Proposition. But these are sufficient to satisfy every one, that is not prejudiced against the Doctrine and resolv'd not to believe it: And it is in vain to endeavour the Conviction of such as these. I shall therefore proceed to the next general Head.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>This State of Sin and Guilt, which we are all naturally in, is the Fruit of</hi> Adam's <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think I have prov'd, that we are by Nature in a State of Sin and Guilt; and there must be some Cause of these corrupt Affections, Appetites and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, of this universal Depravity of our Natures; and Corruption of all our Powers and Faculties. We must either have come thus imperfect and impure out of the Hands of God at our first Creation; or we must some Way or other have lost our original
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004710_0105_0000000000000000"/>
Righteousness. If the latter, no other Supposal can carry equal Probability in it, with this in our Text, That <hi>by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make Way for a more distinct View of this Case, it may be proper to consider, whether we could be <hi>at first created</hi> in the same State, in which we now find ourselves. And I think, this upon Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be found most inconsistent with all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divine Nature.—How could it be consistent with the Holiness of God, to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with prevalent Enmity to himself, and Love to Sin and Sensuality? Could a pure and holy God take Delight in such Ignorance and Darkness, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally clouds our Understandings; and alienates us from the Life of God? Could he take Pleasure in having all the Powers of our Souls most contrary to his own excellent Nature; and in having us under the Government and Guidance of sinful Dispositions, irregular Affections, and turbulent Passions? The great God must certainly be <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; or to look upon Sin with Approbation.</hi> And consequently could not create us with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Souls, under the Influence of such vile Lusts and sinful Appetites, as naturally reign in our Hearts and lead us away from God.—How could it consist with the Goodness of God, to make a Creature in a State of Misery and Calamity? Can it be supposed agreeable to infinite Goodness, Kindness, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, to see us agonizing from our Births to our Graves, under the Disorders of a vitiated Soul and the Infirmities of a distemper'd Body, to see us prompted by Pride and Ambition, Lust and Avarice, to destroy and devour one another; and to keep the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004710_0106_0000000000000000"/>
World in Convulsions and Confusions, as it has always been? Could it be agreeable to him, to see so noble a Being as Man, the necessary Subject of continual Affliction in this World, that he might be thereby prepar'd for eternal Torments in the World to come? This certainly cannot be supposed; and therefore it must not be imagined, that a good and gracious God did at first create us in this State of Sin and Misery.—Could it be agreeable to the Justice of God, to make us under a natural Necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against him; and yet punish us for those sinful Affections which he himself had given us; or for such sinful Practices as are the necessary Result of them? No surely, <hi>the Judge of all the Earth will do right.</hi> He could not make us on Purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himself in our Misery.—From these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it must necessarily follow, that <hi>God made Man upright;</hi> that our Defection proceeds from some other Cause; and what that is, I shall apply my self more distinctly to consider, by endeavouring to shew,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. How or in what Way we became sinful and guilty, by the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By clearing up the <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of God, in <hi>imputing</hi> the Sin and Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi> to his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I am first then to shew <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>in what Way we become sinful and guilty, by the Sin of</hi> Adam.—In Order to which I shall Observe,</p>
            <p>That God enter'd into a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> as the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Representative</hi> of all Mankind, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow Life upon him and all his Posterity, if he did
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004710_0107_0000000000000000"/>
not eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, or to inflict Death both upon him and them, if he did eat of that forbidden Fruit. The Sum of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is set before us in Gen. ii. 7. <hi>But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the Day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</hi>—This Covenant-Transaction is indeed here (as all God's Dispensations in the Mosaic History are) but very briefly and generally represented. Here is no express Mention, that <hi>Adam</hi> should be confirm'd in a State of Life and Peace, upon his Obedience to this particular Precept; nor is there express Mention, that <hi>Adam</hi> was in this Transaction consider'd as the Head and Representative of his Posterity. It may (I think) nevertheless be made most evident, that both of these are imply'd in this short Account of that Matter.</p>
            <p>That a <hi>Promise</hi> of Life is imply'd in this Covenant upon Condition of <hi>Adam's</hi> Obedience, appears from the Threatni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of Death in Case of Disobedience. The Threatning must necessarily imply some Evil consequent upon his Violation of that Precept, that would not have otherwise happened. God's threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Death upon this single Condition, does plainly suppose, that it was the only Condition upon which it was to be feared and expected. For how could it be consistent with the Justice, Goodness, or even Sincerity of God, to threaten <hi>Adam</hi> with Death in Case of Disobedience, which would have been his Lot, had he been ever so perfect in his Obedience?—This Threatning was certainly design'd as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Obedience: which it could not be, if <hi>Adam</hi> had no Good in Expectation by continuing in his Duty. And it was certainly unworthy of God, to
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004710_0108_0000000000000000"/>
raise his Expectation of a Benefit, which he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partake of, had he comply'd with the Terms on which he expected it.—This therefore appears plainly to be the Case. <hi>Adam</hi> was by the Law of his Nature under a perpetual Obligation to a Conformity unto the known Will of God, upon the Penalty of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him the just Demerit of his Disobedience against him. The Demerit of such Disobedience in any Instance would have been <hi>Death;</hi> for that, the Apostle assures us, is the <hi>Wages of Sin,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. But God was graciously pleased to put <hi>Adam</hi> upon a more limited and easy Trial, in Order to his Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment in a State of Life and Happiness. Had he continued obedient, and withstood this Temptation, had he retain'd his Integrity and overcome the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of the Seducer in this Instance, he would have been no more in Danger of Apostacy from God; nor any more exposed to Death or Misery. In the Day that he eat of the forbidden Fruit, he was to die; and does not this necessarily imply a Promise of Life, if he had not eat of it at all?</p>
            <p>If it be here enquired, Whether <hi>our first Parents would not have died, if they had been guilty of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act of Disobedience, while under this Trial, tho' they had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Though they were undoubtedly under the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> during the Time of their Trial for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, as much as they were before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore equally liable to its Penalties in Case of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Yet, I don't know how the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was in any Respect a <hi>Covenant of Life,</hi> between
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004710_0109_0000000000000000"/>
God and them.—I don't know how their Obedience to it would have entitled them and their Posterity to the continued Favour of God, at this Time of their Tryal, any more than at any other Time, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after it; or how their Disobedience to it at this Time would have involv'd their Posterity in their Guilt, without some special Transaction between God and them to that Purpose. They were, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, under <hi>penal Obligations</hi> to their Creator and Benefactor: But I can't see how they were, as such, the legal <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Representative</hi> of their Offspring; nor how they had had, as such, a Claim to perpetual Life &amp; Happiness from their Creator, had their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence been ever so perfect.—I cannot therefore but suppose a real Difference, between the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Covenant made with our f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. By all the Account we have of this Matter in Scripture, the <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> of our first Parents and their Offspring, was wholly put upon <hi>their eating,</hi> or <hi>forbearing to eat of the forbidden Fruit.</hi>—The Law of Nature is not, that I know of, any where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd as a Part of this Covenant-Transaction.

And what Consequence must therefore follow? Here are two Trees placed in the Garden: Of the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to eat, upon Pain of Death; of the other he might freely eat, and live for ever. By eating of the one he exposed both himself and Posterity to Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by eating of the other he might have confirmed both himself and them in a State of Life and Peace. Did not therefore his Happiness depend upon his Conduct with Relation to the Fruit of these Trees?</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is certain in Fact, that <hi>God did not,</hi> and thence we know his foregoing Determination that he <hi>would not, leave our first Parents,</hi> during the Time of their Trial, <hi>to any other prevalent Temptation,</hi> but what related to the <hi>forbidden Fruit.</hi>—I think it just arguing, from what God has done, to what he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to do. It is certain from the infinite Perfections of his Nature, that his Conduct is always agreeable to his Counsel; and consequently, that God did determine to put them upon no other Trial for their Establishment, but in this single Instance.

Appetites to the forbidden Fruit: But these all had an <hi>immediate</hi> Reference to this <hi>Inhibition,</hi> and were <hi>directly introductory</hi> to it's Violation.

                  </gap>
               </hi> And its remarkable, that God does not challenge them for these Things, as Violations of the Law of Nature; but as Infractions of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Covenant,</hi> by which they were to stand or fall.—In a Word, God expresly made this the Instance of their Trial; the Scripture mentions nothing more, and I know of no Authority we have, to be <hi>wise</hi> in this Case <hi>beyond what is written.</hi> The Integrity of their Nature would keep them from falling, where there was no strong Temptation to overcome it. God did not permit, and therefore we are sure that he determin'd not to permit, any <hi>other</hi> prevalent Temptation to assault them. They were not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exposed to fall, in any other Instance. He threatned Death upon Condition of this Disobedience: there was no other Condition express'd in the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They were challenged for this Disobedience and no other, after their Fall. Life was consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promised upon Condition of Obedience in this Instance; for this was the only Condition of their Establishment, that I find any where mention'd in the Bible.—<hi>Adam</hi> was put upon no other Trial, that I know of, but this only; and this might have been as short as he pleased. For it's remarkable, that he had full Liberty to eat of the <hi>Tree of Life;</hi> and it seems plainly hinted in <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 22. that if he had done so any Time before his Fall, immortal Life would have been secured to him; that it seems left to his own Choice, how long his Probation should
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004710_0112_0000000000000000"/>
continue. It is therefore evident, that there was a Promise of Life in this Covenant, inasmuch as there was a Pledge and Seal of his Confirmation appointed, ready for him at any Time before his Apostacy: Though guarded and kept by <hi>Cherubim</hi> and a <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ming Sword</hi> afterward. It is evident, that as according to this Dispensation of astonishing Grace and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, he was to expect Death upon no other Condition but the Violation of this Precept, so he was on the contrary to expect <hi>Life</hi> upon the actual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of it. This, though not directly, is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever implicitly promised in this Covenant recorded by <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after all any will suppose, as some have supposed (though, I confess, I don't know upon what Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that the Observance of the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> was implicitly enjoyn'd by this Prohibition, both upon <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity, as the <hi>Condition</hi> of their escaping the Death threatned; and that this Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi> was but an additional Injunction for the <hi>Trial</hi> of their Obedience: It must nevertheless be allow'd, that God intended, and <hi>Adam</hi> understood, a conditional Promise of Life, in the Threatning of Death. If Death was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only upon his Disobedience, it certainly implies that it would not have been inflicted, if he had not disobey'd. By this Threatning, Death was made the Wages of his Sin; and neither the Justice nor Goodness of God can allow the Righteous to receive the Wages of the Wicked.</p>
            <p>But it's Time that I should return to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, how <hi>Adam</hi> was in this Transaction consider'd as the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Representative</hi> of his natural Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:004710_0113_0000000000000000"/>It must be confessed, that the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Account of this Covenant between God and our first Father, does not so evidently represent his Posterity to be immediately concern'd in it. But this also may be fully evinced from the following Considerations.</p>
            <p>It is manifestly true in Fact, that <hi>Adam's</hi> Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do partake of the bitter <hi>Fruits</hi> of his Apostacy. The Experience of all the World carries this beyond Debate. We all see that Sin and Death, with all their Terrors, have invaded all the natural Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Adam;</hi> that all the Calamities of Life and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Death</hi> it self <hi>reign over those, that have not sinned after the Similitude of</hi> Adam's <hi>Transgression.</hi> And how comes the Curse annexed to the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> to fall upon the Heads of his Posterity, if they were not included in that Covenant? This Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be the Effect of Sin. <hi>Far be it from God, that the Righteous should be as the Wicked. The Soul that sinneth, shall die.</hi> And yet it is inflicted upon such as are not capable of actual and personal Sin; who consequently must have sinned in <hi>Adam;</hi> or we cannot conceive how <hi>the Judge of all the Earth does right,</hi> in bringing the Penalty threatned to him, upon his otherwise innocent Posterity.—The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced upon <hi>Adam</hi> after his Fall, is in every Article of it executed upon his Posterity, in the same Extent as upon himself: From whence it's evident that they as well as he were Partakers of the Guilt of that Apostacy, in the same Degree that they bear the Punishment of it. And consequently, he must be consider'd as their Head and Representative in that first Covenant.</p>
            <p>The same Thing is abundantly confirm'd to us, by various plain and clear Passages in <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Our
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004710_0114_0000000000000000"/>
Textassures us, that <hi>by this one Man Sin entred into the World;</hi> and that <hi>in him all have sinned.</hi> We are told (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 22.) that <hi>in Adam all die.</hi> Now, as I before observ'd, Sin and Death must descend from <hi>Adam</hi> merely in a Way of natural Generation; or else we must have fallen in him as our legal Head and Representative. The former can't be the Case; these did not descend to us in a Way of natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from <hi>one</hi> Man only; for if that be the Means of their Derivation, they descended to us from all our Progenitors; and we no more died in <hi>Adam</hi> than in our immediate Parents. He must therefore have sustain'd a publick Character; and was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as our Representative in that Covenant-Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction.—But of this I found Occasion to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particularly before; and need not therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon it in this Place.</p>
            <p n="II">II. <hi>I'm to endeavour to clear up the</hi> Justice <hi>and</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>in imputing</hi> Adam's <hi>Sin and Guilt to his Posterity.</hi>—The Adversaries of this Doctrine under Consideration, do principally found their Opposition upon its Inconsistency with the Perfections of God. They pretend, that God would not be <hi>just</hi> in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>Adam</hi> our Surety and Representative, when he knew he would fall, and involve his Posterity with him in his Guilt and Misery.—That it were rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gnant to the divine <hi>Goodness,</hi> to contrive such a Covenant, as would bring unavoidable Misery upon Millions of Souls, who would be personally innocent of that Transgression.—And consequently that there could be no such Constitution made by him, who is infinite Justice and Goodness. I shall therefore be something particular in my Endeavours to obviate
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004710_0115_0000000000000000"/>
this Difficulty; and to shew how this Doctrine is consistent with the Perfections of God.—This will appear by considering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That such a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Adam</hi> would have been in it self <hi>more likely to subserve the Interests of Mankind,</hi> than for him and his Posterity to have been left under the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what <hi>all Mankind</hi> would have <hi>chosen</hi> for themselves, had they been then existing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we were all <hi>seminally</hi> in <hi>Adam;</hi> and in that Respect Parties in this Covenant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Good</hi> promised by this Covenant, was more than proportionable to the <hi>Evil</hi> threatned by it. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God has in infinite Mercy made a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Provision for our <hi>Recovery</hi> from the sad Effects of <hi>Adam's</hi> Apostacy.</p>
            <p>We are then to consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>such a Covenant with</hi> Adam <hi>would have been in it self more likely to subserve the</hi> Interest <hi>and</hi> Advantage <hi>of Mankind, than for him and his Posterity to have been left under the</hi> Law of Nature; <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently what all Mankind would have</hi> chosen <hi>for themselves, had they been then existing.</hi>—The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adam's</hi> Establishment in a State of Life and Happiness, was certainly much easier to be comply'd with, than the Demands of the Law of Nature. It was much easier for him to refrain from eating a particular Fruit in a Garden, where there was so great
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004710_0116_0000000000000000"/>
a Plenty and such a grateful Variety of whatever could contribute to his Support or Delight, than for him to stand engag'd in perpetual Obligations, under a Penalty, to perform an exact and perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of Nature. So that with Respect to <hi>Adam</hi> himself, the Goodness of God was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously display'd, in bringing the Terms of his Life and Stability so low.—And if we consider the Case with Respect to his <hi>Descendants,</hi> it will appear every Way their Interest also, to have their Safety put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Issue.—There would have be'n the same Manifestation of Goodness to us, as to our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, if each Individual of the human Race could have had perpetual Life and perfect Happiness per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally proposed to them, 'upon the same Terms as they were to <hi>Adam;</hi> and consequently the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God must be equally acknowledged, in join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Interest with his in that Covenant-Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction.</p>
            <p>This will appear, if we consider, that every one of <hi>Adam's</hi> Posterity would have been perpetually under the strictest Obligations of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> if they had not been included in this <hi>Covenant.</hi> They must therefore every one of them be much more likely to fall, than <hi>Adam</hi> himself was; in that their Safety would have depended upon a much more <hi>extensive</hi> Obedience.—Their Obligations to the Law, and their Danger of violating it in some Instance or other, would have been perpetual; and their Stability would therefore have been for ever precarious and uncertain. Now, was it not better for them, that their Confirmation in a State of continual Life and Peace, should depend only upon <hi>one</hi> such easy Instance of Obedience; than that each Individual
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004710_0117_0000000000000000"/>
of them, left to act for himself, should be always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Loss of God's Favour, upon their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating any Part of the Law of God, and always uncertain of their future Happiness?</p>
            <p>It will add further Weight to this Reflection, if we consider, that <hi>Adam</hi> (in Case he stood in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Capacity) was much <hi>more</hi> concern'd to obey this Precept, and to obtain the blessed Consequences of his Obedience, than any one of his <hi>Posterity</hi> could have been, had they <hi>personally</hi> been put upon the same Trial.—His <hi>own</hi> eternal Interest was at Stake: he had therefore all the Inducements from Hope or Fear, from a Desire of Happiness, or a Prospect of Misery, that any of his Progeny could have had, were they in his Place. But what an <hi>additional</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern would it naturally excite in him, to consider, that the Welfare of all his <hi>Posterity</hi> was embark'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Bottom; and that they as well as he must be everlastingly and incomparably happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, according to his Conduct in this most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affair?—Let it then be consider'd, whether we have any Reason to find Fault, when the Terms of our Safety was made so very easy; when our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests were put into the Hands of our natural Parent, who was not only as much concern'd to secure his own Happiness as Ours, but also under the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influence of parental Love and Affection to the numerous Offspring of his own Bowels; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all these Respects much more likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Establishment in a continued happy Life, than we could have been ourselves, if we had not been interested in this Covenant, but left to stand or fall by the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:004710_0118_0000000000000000"/>It may be also further consider'd, that <hi>Adam</hi> being God's <hi>immediate</hi> Workmanship, &amp; having <hi>immediately</hi> received the Law from the Mouth of God himself, must have had more <hi>lively</hi> Impressions of his <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi>' than any of his natural Posterity: And was in that Respect also more likely, than they could be, to have kept this Covenant; and thereby to have secured the Benefits of it to himself and them.</p>
            <p>I may also add to this, that it seems absolutely <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to the <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of Mankind, that there should have been some <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Establishment</hi> proposed to them. How much would it have lessen'd and abridg'd the Comforts and Delights even of <hi>Paradise</hi> it self, to have consider'd that happy State as being always <hi>mutable,</hi> and liable to be forfeited and lost? How could <hi>Adam,</hi> or his Posterity, have been any of 'em truly and compleatly happy, even in a State of Integrity, under the sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reflection, that they should be forever exposed through the Prevalence of Temptation, to fall from their Innocence and from the Favour of God?—All the Innocence, Purity, and Perfection of our Nature in its Original Rectitude, could have been no Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against this melancholly Apprehension. For some of the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves are become <hi>Devils:</hi> And dreadful Experience has taught us, how not only <hi>Adam</hi> himself, but all his Posterity, would have been always liable to the dreadful Consequences of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God. What therefore, but some <hi>Terms of Confirmation</hi> in their State of Life and Integrity, could have banish'd this uneasy Apprehension from their Breasts; and have put them into a Capacity for compleat Satisfaction and Happiness? And what
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:004710_0119_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>easier</hi> Terms could have been thought of, than what were propos'd? Had it been left to <hi>Adam</hi> himself, to state his own Terms, he could have devised No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more easy and practicable.</p>
            <p>From what has been said, it appears to have been in the Nature of the Thing much safer for us, and more to our Advantage, to be <hi>represented</hi> in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by our first Parent, than for each one of us to have been left to act <hi>separately</hi> for ourselves. In short, <hi>some Terms</hi> of Confirmation were wanted.—Those proposed were as <hi>easy</hi> as could be desired.—<hi>Adam</hi> was in all Respects <hi>more likely</hi> to have come up to these Terms, than <hi>we</hi> could have been; and had <hi>he</hi> continued in his Obedience (as there was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test reasonable Prospect that he would have done) <hi>we</hi> should have perpetually acknowledged and adored the <hi>Wisdom, Equity</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, in this Contrivance to secure the Holiness and Happiness of Mankind for ever.—Since therefore this Transaction was in it self good, just, and reasonable, most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and most likely to subserve our best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, the <hi>Event</hi> that has happen'd gives no Cause of <hi>Complaint.</hi> God is just; and we are justly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>To urge God's <hi>Foresight</hi> of the Event, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the Justice and Equity of this Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, is impertinent and unreasonable. The great God makes the Perfections of his own Nature, and not the Conduct of his Creatures, the Rule and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Dispensations.—Since this Method was from the Nature of Things needful for us, and most likely to secure our Happiness, God was good and just in proposing it; whatever the Event would be.—Besides, we have Reason to suppose, God knew
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:004710_0120_0000000000000000"/>
that the Event would have been very much <hi>worse</hi> for us, than it now is, if we had each of us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>t to stand or fall by the Law of Nature. God certainly knew how it would have been: And we have Reason to conclude from all Appearances, that it would have turned out to our still greater Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.—We should have had no Terms of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore at the best should none of us have ever been remov'd beyond Fear and Danger.—The Conditions of our enjoying God's Favour would have been much more difficult; but the Inducements to take heed to ourselves, nothing equal to what <hi>Adam</hi> was under.—Our Exposedness to Temptations would not have been, as his was, short and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But of a perpetual Continuance.—It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the strongest Probability, that God knew how in that Case we should every one fall; and how much worse our State would then have been, than it now is, since in that Way there could have been no Room for the glorious Remedy now provided.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It should also be considered, <hi>that we were all</hi> seminally <hi>in</hi> Adam; <hi>and in that Respect were all Parties to this Covenant.</hi>—I shall not here insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the philosophical Speculations of some very great and learned Men, who suppose that every Individual of the human Race were actually included in the Loins of our Parent, and were actually existing in Miniature, as a Part of him; and as such, Partakers with him in his first Transgression. Though these think, that they have carried their Hypothesis higher than meer Conjecture, and made it at least appear probable to be true; and if true, to be a Solution of the greatest Difficulties relating to the Propagation of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004710_0121_0000000000000000"/>
original Sin: Yet, I think, we ought to have a more sure Foundation, to build our Faith of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Article upon. It may therefore be consider'd, whether the Words of our <hi>Text</hi> don't directly lead us to a View of the Propagation, as well as Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin to his Posterity. We are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that <hi>in him</hi> (so in the Greek) <hi>all have sinned.</hi> And the same Thing seems to be likewise illustrated from 1 Cor. xv. 22. <hi>In</hi> Adam <hi>all died.</hi> We were in him, it is true, as he was our moral or legal Head and Representative: And if we were only thus in him, we must with him be jointly concern'd, and accountable for his Conduct. But it's certain we were, if not personally, yet virtually in him, as our natural (as well as our legal) Head; and this may probably be referred to in the Texts now cited. We were in him, as the Fruit is in the Seed; as the Sprouts are in the Root; as <hi>Eve</hi> was in him, when one of his Ribs; and were really derived from his Essence.—<hi>Adam</hi> was guilty, totally and universally so: No Part of him was innocent; but every Part chargeable with the same Guilt. And if <hi>we</hi> were then a <hi>Part</hi> of him, as it's certain we were, we must have been so far guilty of his Apostacy.—Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be supposed, that when the Covenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi> (whereby he was to stand or fall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his eating or forbearing to eat of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit) <hi>we</hi> were all of us at that Time a Part of him; will it not hence follow, that the <hi>Covenant</hi> was made with <hi>us,</hi> as well as with him; that it was made with every Part of him; and that every Part of him must partake of the Consequences of his Conduct <hi>while in that State of Trial?</hi> This being supposed,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004710_0122_0000000000000000"/>
it will not follow that his Sin and Guilt descends to us <hi>merely</hi> by natural Generation, or that the Sin of our <hi>immediate</hi> Parents, as well as of our first Parents, is imputable to us, as being a Part of them. For, as <hi>Adam</hi> was but once, and none of his Descendants were at all, in a State of Trial for Confirmation and Establishment in original Righteousness and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so that Covenant could be but once broken, either by himself or his Posterity. We could not be guilty of original Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> but only when <hi>he</hi> himself was guilty of it by eating the forbidden Fruit. We are guilty, not merely as <hi>Descendants</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> but as being naturally, as well as legally, <hi>in him</hi> when he violated the first <hi>Covenant.</hi>—We were (it's true) in the Loins of our immediate Parents, during all their Transgressions of God's Law, as well as in the Loins of <hi>Adam</hi> when he broke this Covenant: But we could not be in <hi>them,</hi> as we were in <hi>him,</hi> guilty of violating any Terms of <hi>Establishment</hi> in Life and Peace; for there were no such Terms made with them. And therefore we could not in them forfeit a Confirmation in a State of Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which was never proposed to them, either for themselves or us; nor could we in them bring upon ourselves the dreadful Consequences of such Forfeiture, in our Death and Ruin. The Terms of Life propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> are in and by a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator;</hi> and our Interest in the Benefits of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is only in the Way of our <hi>personal</hi> Faith in him and Acceptance of him and his offer'd Salvation; and therefore by the Tenour of the new Covenant, neither the Holiness nor Impiety of our Progenitors can descend to us, or so far affect us, as that we should stand or fall by it. But in the present Case,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004710_0123_0000000000000000"/>
all <hi>Adam's</hi> Interests were concern'd in that Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Transaction, and His whole <hi>Self</hi> was to stand or fall on the Terms propos'd.</p>
            <p>If it be <hi>objected,</hi> that our <hi>Souls</hi> were not so much as seminally in <hi>Adam</hi> at all; and consequently not in this Respect chargeable with his Sin and Guilt:—I <hi>answer,</hi> it would be proper for us to know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more about the Time and Manner of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our Souls and Bodies, before we decree too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively in this Matter.—Whether our Souls were all created in the Beginning; whether the organised Bodies of the whole human Species were included in Miniature in <hi>Adam's</hi> Loins, and all their Souls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then united to 'em; whether the Soul of each Foetus is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately created and infused at the Time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; or else united to the Embrio in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb; or whether in some other unknown Time and Manner; These are Things, which for my Part I profess to know nothing about. And it's possible, that they who talk most boldly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently upon this Subject, are really as ignorant of it as I am. And why should we grope in the Dark, to remove Difficulties out of our Way, that we are not certain were ever in it?.... Thus much appears evident to me, That we were in the same Sense in <hi>Adam's</hi> Loins, and a Part of him, when he violated the first Covenant, as we now are his natural Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And as truly as we are his Seed, descended from him, so truly did we in the same Respect sin in him, when he fell. The Apostle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 10. <hi>That</hi> Levi <hi>was in the Loins of his Father</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>when</hi> Melchizedeck <hi>met him.</hi> And it is as true, that we were all in the Loins of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> when he broke the first Covenant..... But in how
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004710_0124_0000000000000000"/>
lax a Sense soever this be allow'd to be true, it serves to clear up the Justice and Equity of God in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us <hi>Parties</hi> in that <hi>Covenant,</hi> when we were <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in him,</hi> with whom the Covenant was personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made. If it was equitable, for God to covenant with him on <hi>his own</hi> Behalf, it was equitable to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him on <hi>ours</hi> also, who were a Part of him, and so nearly concern'd with him in that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction..... Doubtless we should have thought it <hi>equal</hi> in God, to make <hi>us</hi> joint Partakers with <hi>Adam</hi> in the glorious Consequences of his <hi>Obedience,</hi> if he had stood. We should perhaps have thought it hard, if we who were so nearly united to him, both by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Interest, should have been secluded the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Privilege; and put upon harder Terms of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, than he was..... And the <hi>Equity</hi> of God's Dispensation is the <hi>same,</hi> however the <hi>Event</hi> turn'd out..... In a Word, It was from the Nature of the Thing most agreeable, that we should be in <hi>Adam</hi> as our <hi>Covenant-Head,</hi> since we were in him as our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Head; that the Streams should partake of the Quality of the Fountain, and the Branches be of the same Kind with the Stock, from whence they sprung.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be further consider'd, <hi>that the</hi> Good <hi>promised by this Covenant, was more than proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the</hi> Evil <hi>threatned by it...</hi>.. By what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said upon this Subject, the <hi>Justice</hi> of God is (I think) cleared from all Imputation, in including <hi>Adam's</hi> Posterity with himself in the first Covenant made with him. And what is now propos'd, may serve to display the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, in the gracious Terms and Tenour of that Covenant..... Had the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:004710_0125_0000000000000000"/>
Threatning and Promise annexed to that Covenant, been but proportionable to one another, the Terms must have been allow'd to be <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>right.</hi> Hence therefore so much of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in that Dispensation, as the promised Good was in Proportion <hi>greater</hi> than the threatned Evil.</p>
            <p>Let the Case then be consider'd, and it will appear, that the <hi>Obedience</hi> which God claim'd of <hi>Adam</hi> in this Instance of his <hi>Trial,</hi> was vastly <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss,</hi> than what was due by the Law of <hi>Nature;</hi> and that the <hi>Penalty</hi> annexed to his Disobedience, was <hi>no more</hi> than would have been, by the strictest Rules of Justice, the Demerit of his violating the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> in any Instance whatsoever; and would therefore have been eminently due to his sinning against so much Goodness, as appeared in bringing the Terms of his Establishment to low as they were brought. But then on the other Hand, he could have had no Claim to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> but from the mere <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of God, if he had not only obey'd <hi>this</hi> Precept, but been perfect in his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>whole</hi> Law. For, though a happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence may be reasonably expected by an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creature, so long as God sees Cause to prolong his Being: Yet as God cannot be in Debt to any of his Creatures, he cannot owe them so much as the Benefit of any Existence at all; and therefore cannot owe them an eternal Continuance of Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. As God could not owe us our Being, before we had it; neither can he be brought in Debt to us by any Thing we can do, to continue our Being when we have it. Our Obedience cannot lay him under any Obligation to us. <hi>If we be righteous, what give we him? or what receiveth be at our Hands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:004710_0126_0000000000000000"/>This then is the true State of the Case; A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perpetual <hi>Obedience</hi> to the whole Law of Nature was <hi>due</hi> to God by our first Parents, as he was their <hi>Creator,</hi> and the Author of their Being and Powers.—<hi>Death</hi> was the just and natural <hi>Penalty</hi> of their Disobedience in <hi>any</hi> Instance..... So far therefore as God lessen'd the <hi>Obligation,</hi> he relaxed the <hi>Penalty</hi> of their Disobedience.... While on the other Hand, <hi>eternal Life</hi> was infinitely <hi>more</hi> than could be claim'd as a <hi>Debt</hi> for the most perfect <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> and therefore there was certainly astonishing <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in making it the <hi>Reward</hi> of their refraining from the <hi>forbidden Fruit.</hi> Thus we see how vast the Disproportion appears, between the Threatning and the Promise annexed to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant..... The former was a Debt by the Laws of strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Justice; the latter an Act of mere Grace and Goodness.... The former would have been the just Wages of Sin, if there had been no Threatning annexed to the Command of God; the latter is what <hi>Adam</hi> could never have deserv'd for himself; and much less for his Posterity.... In the former, God did as it were depart from his own Right, and give up Part of his just Claim; he might have deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perfect, universal and eternal Obedience, as the only Condition of his Favour: and yet he promis'd perpetual Life and Happiness upon a single, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and easy Observance of his Will. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God secur'd to <hi>Adam</hi> more than his Right, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more than he could have claim'd by the Laws of natural Justice.—How then can we complain of the Inequality of this Dispensation, in which there is such a Manifestation of condescending Grace and
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004710_0127_0000000000000000"/>
Goodness, as deserves our perpetual Acknowledgment and Admiration!</p>
            <p>To all this may be added,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That God has in infinite Mercy made a glorious Provision for our</hi> Recovery, <hi>from the sad Effects of</hi> Adam's <hi>Apostacy.</hi>—Our Adversaries imagine it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Goodness of God, that we should all perish on Account of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin. But how could it be inconsistent with his Goodness, to reward us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Desert? I think, I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Terms of that Covenant with Respect both to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity, were equal and right; that there was no Appearance of Severity: but special Manifestations of gracious Condescension in that admirable Dispensation. And what have we now to say for ourselves, why Sentence should not be executed upon us, according to the Tenour of the broken Law? Can't God be <hi>good</hi> in the Display of his <hi>Justice?</hi> Was it inconsistent with God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to take the Forfeiture at the Hands of the fallen <hi>Angels?</hi> Or would it have been any more contrary to his Goodness, to have reserv'd us, as he did them <hi>in Chains of Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day?</hi>—But besure all Murmuring and Complaint should be silenced for ever, when we consider what a <hi>Reprieve</hi> was granted to such poor Criminals at the Bar of Justice; and when we consider, at what an infinite <hi>Price</hi> our Redemption from Death and Ruin was provided and purchased. Shall <hi>we</hi> complain, who are thus <hi>distinguished</hi> from the Angels that fell, by the glad Tidings of a <hi>Saviour;</hi> while the Fruit of their first Disobedience was hopeless and remediless Perdition? Shall we complain, when God has had
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004710_0128_0000000000000000"/>
such Compassion on our perishing Circumstances, as to purchase our Deliverance with the <hi>Blood of his own Son?</hi> Shall we complain, who have Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be restored with so much <hi>greater Advantage;</hi> and to be Partakers of so much <hi>greater Blessedness,</hi> than could have been hoped for from the <hi>Law of Nature?</hi> Here is <hi>Grace,</hi> worthy of our highest Gratitude; <hi>Grace,</hi> that shall be admited, adored, and praised both by Angels and Men to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then it appears; That some Terms of Confirmation in our original State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness were necessary for us; That the Terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd were most equal, easy, and good; That it was from the Nature of the Thing best for us, and what we should have chosen for our selves if we had been then existing, that <hi>Adam</hi> should represent us; and stand or fall for us, as well as for himself; That we were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and a Part of him, when he represented us in that Covenant-Relation: And it was therefore to be expected from the Reason of the Thing as well as from the Tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that the Branches should partake of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Stock, from whence they sprung; and that the good contain'd in the Promise of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was vastly more than proportional to the Evil threatned.—Is not all this sufficient to quiet our Minds; and make us silently and humbly acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sce in this Dispensation as most just and equal? It will certainly appear to be so, when we further consider the infinite Compassion that has <hi>look'd upon us in our Blood; said unto us, live;</hi> and redeem'd us from the Demerit of our Apostacy by the Blood of <hi>God manifest in the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:004710_0129_0000000000000000"/>God omniscient knew indeed, that we should fall and violate this Covenant; and that all the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> would become guilty and miserable by his eating the forbidden Fruit. This may perhaps at first View appear a hard Dispensation, that God should without our Consent, join our Lot with our first Parents, when he knew that they would fall; and we in them. But then if we not only consider what has already been said in Answer to this; but remember, that he who knew we should fall, did also design us a glorious <hi>Recovery</hi> from our fallen State, that he design'd to display his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in the Redemption of fallen perishing Creatures with such an infinite Price; and to bring them into so much <hi>better</hi> Circumstances, than they were in by the Law of Nature; surely every hard Thought of God must vanish before this Reflection; and we must rather adore and praise, than complain of this glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. Did God foreknow, that <hi>Adam</hi> would break through the most just Terms of Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that were proposed to him in this first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and involve himself and his Posterity in Guilt and Ruin? But did not God also foreknow, that he would contrive a Method of Redemption, that should distinguish <hi>Adam</hi> and his Descendants as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Subjects of his Grace and Favour, above the rest of the rational World, purchase their Happiness with an infinite Price, make the Terms of their Salvation most easy and honourable, bring them near to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and put them under the best Advantages to be happy here, and happy for ever? <hi>Where is</hi> Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>then? It is excluded. By what Law?—Of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi>—If all this won't satisfy us, in the Equity of this Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:004710_0130_0000000000000000"/>
of God toward us, it must be because we are unwilling to see the lost and undone State that we are naturally in; or else because we are willing to shift off the Blame of it somewhere else.—But it's Time I should proceed to the Consideration of the other Part of my Subject.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>We are all, by Virtue of our Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin and Guilt, justly liable to Death, temporal, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already in a great Measure anticipated what would naturally occur under this Preposition; and shall therefore be very brief upon the Illustration of it, in two or three Particulars; and then proceed to obviate some Objections that lie in our Way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, as I have already shewn, it's a plain Fact which cannot be reasonably disputed, that the <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Penalty annexed to the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are inflicted upon all <hi>Adam's</hi> natural Posterity,—It's open to every one's Observation, that <hi>the Ground is cursed for Man's Sake, that in Sorrow we eat of it all the Days of our Lives, that in the Sweat of our Face we eat our Bread, until we return unto the Ground.</hi> And it's indisputably evident too, that we are naturally <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins;</hi> and that we have hard Hearts, corrupt Affections, irregular Appetites and Passions, and a dreadful Promptitude to the Ways of Sin and Death. We can be no more certain of our Being, than of this Corruption of our Natures, and this Depravity of all the Powers and Faculties of our Souls and Bodies. That all this is the Fruit and Consequence of our original Apostacy,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:004710_0131_0000000000000000"/>
I have largely shewn already.—If any should object, and say, <hi>How can these Things be?</hi> I answer, they are so by the divine Designation and Appointment; and they are therefore certainly most equal and just. If all that has been said already, won't quiet the Minds of Objectors, this one Consideration is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to do it; That <hi>God, whose Ways are all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who is a God of Truth and without Iniquity, just and right,</hi> has annexed these Penalties to our first Transgression; and he has inflicted them upon us; and therefore we are sure, that it's equal and right that he should do so..... Let it be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>while we continue in this State,</hi> which we are naturally in, we are utterly <hi>unqualified</hi> for <hi>eternal Life.</hi>—It cannot be supposed that a God of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Purity and Holiness will admit polluted and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creatures into his immediate Presence; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their sinful Natures and Practices, with the Glories of the heavenly World. No! <hi>He is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil; and cannot look upon Iniquity.</hi> Hab. i. 13. <hi>If the Heavens are not clean in his Sight: But he chargeth the Angels with Folly, how much more abominable and filthy is Man, who drinketh in Iniquity like Water!</hi> Job xv. 15, 16.—But were it even supposed, that we could be admitted to this heavenly State with our natural Corruptions and sinful Affections, with that Enmity to God and Godliness, which we all experience in our unrenewed Natures? What Comfort could we find there? What Comfort could the Sensualist find, where there would be no Objects to gratify the perpetual Cravings of his sensual Appetite? What Comfort
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:004710_0132_0000000000000000"/>
could be found in the Enjoyments and Imployments of Heaven, by those, to whom these spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises would be Matter of eternal Aversation? What Comfort would be found in being eternally confin'd to such Company, as is our Burthen here; and would be for ever opposite and disagreable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Dispositions and Inclinations? To such as these, Heaven itself would be a Sort of Hell; and even the glorious Presence of God, an everlasting Torment.... Whence it's apparent, that unless we are renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, and have our corrupt Nature sanctified, we cannot be <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light;</hi> for <hi>no unclean Thing shall enter there...</hi>.. We are naturally impure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and none but <hi>the pure in Heart shall see God.</hi> Matth. v. 8. This brings me to observe,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>all who live and die in that State of moral Defilement,</hi> which we are brought into by our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Apostacy, must <hi>necessarily perish eternally...</hi>.. I have already observ'd, that such as these are not meet for the Kingdom of Glory. No! when they leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this World, <hi>he that is unjust, must be unjust still.</hi> None but they that <hi>do God's Commandments,</hi> will <hi>have Right to enter through the Gates into the City of Heaven.</hi> Where then must they go? There is no middle State to be expected in the future World. Either Heaven or Hell, eternal Happiness or eternal Misery, must be the Portion of all the Children of Men, when they have done with Time. Whence it's evident, that our original Sin exposes us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death. We are accordingly represented in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as being <hi>by Nature the Children of Wrath.</hi> (Eph. ii.3.) as being <hi>condemned already,</hi> and having
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004710_0133_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>the Wrath of God abiding on us,</hi> whilst without an Interest in Christ by Faith, <hi>John</hi> iii. 18, 36..... We are plainly and positively inform'd by our blessed Lord himself, that <hi>except we are born again, except we be converted</hi> and brought out of that State of Sin and Death, which we are naturally in, we <hi>shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> (John iii. 3. Matth. xviii. 3.) There is no Salvation to be hoped for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>our old Things pass away, and all Things become new in our Souls, unless we are created anew in Christ Jesus unto good Works, which God hath fore-ordained that we should walk in them...</hi>.. This then is the Sum of the Matter. The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> has <hi>reigned unto Death;</hi> for <hi>the Judgment was by this one Man unto Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> and <hi>by the Offence of one, Judgment is come upon all Men to Condemnation!</hi> as in the 16<hi>th,</hi> 18<hi>th, and</hi> 21<hi>st</hi> Verses of our <hi>Context.</hi> It is therefore a sad and dreadful Truth; and will certainly be found so in the Conclusion, whatever Imaginations Men may entertain to the contrary, that our original Sin is in it self sufficient to render us eternally miserable, if it be not washed away in the Blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>It may be here objected, <hi>That God himself has cleared up the Equality of his Dispensations toward the Children of Men by assuring us that</hi> the Soul which sins shall die, <hi>and that he will not charge Sin upon any but them who commit it. How then can it be</hi> equal <hi>with God to charge the Sin of</hi> Adam, <hi>any more than the Sin of others, upon those that never committed it, nor consented to it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer: <hi>Who art thou, O Man, that repliest against God!</hi>—I think, I have already made it evident, that this is an undoubted Fact, and plainly true, that <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin is imputed to us, And shall
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:004710_0134_0000000000000000"/>
we dare to arraign God's Justice and Equity, because we can't fully see through the Methods or his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations? <hi>Let the Potsherds strive with the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherds of the Earth:</hi> But let not proud Worms <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with their Maker...</hi>.. We see, that we are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and defiled: We feel, that we are sinful; and therefore guilty and obnoxious to God's Wrath: and we know, from the infinite Perfections of the divine Nature, that the <hi>righteous God has done righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,</hi> whether we see through it, or not.</p>
            <p>I further add, to what has been said to clear up the Equity of God's Dispensation toward us, That we do all of us naturally <hi>consent</hi> to <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin; and in that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Way also make it <hi>our own.</hi> There is none of <hi>Adam's</hi> Progeny but what are by Nature promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and thereby manifest their Approbation of the <hi>like Sins</hi> with those that our first Parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Did they call in Question the Truth of God's Word? And don't every unsanctified Person daily do the same Thing? Did they yield to the Temptation of Satan? And don't every Man in a natural State likewise do so continually?—Were they acted by Pride and Ambition to seek a more exalted Station than God had placed them in? And are not the same aspiring Views in the Hearts of all Men by Nature? Are not we (as they were) influenced by irregular sensual Appetites? And do not we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually violate God's Commands and Prohibitions?.... Thus we manifest our Approbation of our first Parents Sin; and as it were act it over again. We are by Nature of the same Temper and Disposition that they shewed in the Commission of this Sin. By a just Construction, we may be said to be inwardly pleased with their Disobedience: And are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  </gap>s</hi> and other Leaders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>upon them should come all the righteous Blood shed upon the Earth, from the Blood of righteous</hi> Abel, <hi>unto the Blood of</hi> Zecharias <hi>Son of</hi> Barachias. (Matth. xxiv. 35.) Because they were influenced by the same cruel and bloody Dispositions, and went on in the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of persecuting the Saints of God with their Wicked and malignant Ancestors; and by approving and imitating their Sin, brought their Guilt on their own Heads. In the same Manner are we all guilty of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin; and liable to the Penalty of it. We are upon the same Account as much chargeable with his Apostacy, as these Jews were with all the Blood shed from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zecharias...</hi>.. If we did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally commit that Sin, we are naturally disposed to the same Kind of Disobedience; and are daily imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and thereby approving and making ourselves guilty of that first Transgression.</p>
            <p>I might yet further observe, that this Objection proves <hi>too much,</hi> if any Thing at all. I think that not only the <hi>Arminians,</hi> but all that acknowledge the divine Authority of the Scriptures, must own, that <hi>temporal</hi> Calamities are some Way or other the Consequences of <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall. And it's equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just to inflict a greater, as a lesser Penalty, without Demerit..... We are certain, that God doth actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by Consequence, that he doth justly inflict tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Punishments upon us for <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin: And it therefore cannot be unequal with God, to punish us for a Sin that we have not personally committed..... Besides, if we are on Account of <hi>Adam's</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy justly liable to <hi>temporal</hi> Calamities, we are justly
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:004710_0136_0000000000000000"/>
liable to <hi>eternal</hi> Misery also. We have not merited the former, unless we are thereby become Sinners; and if we are Sinners we as well deserve the latter. For <hi>eternal Death</hi> is the just Wages of Sin. This Objection is therefore ungrounded and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>It may be further objected, <hi>That God hath expresly declared in</hi> Ezek. xviii. 20. <hi>That</hi> the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of the Father; nor the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son. The Righteousness of the Righteous shall be upon him; and the Wickedness of the Wicked shall be upon him. <hi>How then can it be true and consistent with this Declaration from God's own Mouth, that our first Parents Sin should be imputed to us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, that this Passage refers only to those Children that do not imitate or walk in the sinful Practices of their Parents; but hate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them: And thus God himself expounds his Meaning in the Context. <hi>If the Son seeth all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Sins, and considereth and doth not such like, he shall not die for the Iniquity of his Father; he shall surely live.</hi> But then on the contrary, God has threatned those Children which imitate their Parents Sins, that He <hi>will visit the Iniquity of the Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate him.</hi> (Exod. xx. v.)—And the Reason of the Thing is obvious. The Sin of their Parents should have been a Warning and Admonition to them, to have watched against and avoided their sinful Courses. These should have been as a Beacon to caution them against the Rocks upon which their Fathers have struck and perished. They should have deter'd them from going on in the same Way of
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:004710_0137_0000000000000000"/>
Destruction..... Had any of our Parents fallen a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to human Justice for Treason and Rebellion against their Prince, or had they brought any remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Calamity upon themselves by their Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Misdemeanours; should we not improve it as a Warning against imitating their Example, lest we bring the same Misery and Ruin upon ourselves, as we have seen to fall upon our Parents Heads? And is there not much greater Reason to avoid the Paths of Sin, in which any of us have seen our Parents walk, to their eternal Ruin in another World?..... But if instead of taking Warning by their Wicked Life, we imitate and approve it; if we go on in the same Courses of Impiety which they lived in, and thereby justify their sinful Conduct; we make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Partakers of their Crimes; and upon that Account deserve also to be Partakers of their Punishment..... It is accordingly offered as a Reason of <hi>Belshazzar's</hi> Ruin, that he saw his Father's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, Pride, and Fall, and <hi>yet he his Son had not humbled his Heart, though he know all this.</hi> (Dan. v. 22,).... And if we apply this to the present Case, I have shewn already, that we all naturally imitate and approve the Sin of our first Parents; and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all justly liable to the Penalty. We are Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their Guilt, and therefore deserve to share in the Punishment of it.</p>
            <p>I may also observe, that if this and other such Texts of Scripture were taken in the most unlimited Sense possible; if it were since the Fall, in all Cases and all Instances true, that <hi>the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his Father,</hi> it would nothing affect the Case before us. For no Parents are consider'd now as the legal Representers of their Children, as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacting
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:004710_0138_0000000000000000"/>
in a moral Capacity for them, and standing or falling in their Place and Stead; in the same Sense as I have proved to be the Case with Respect to our first Parents..... As <hi>Adam</hi> was set in a publick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, he sinned as the Covenant-Head and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of all his Posterity; and for that Reason his first Transgression is imputed to us. But the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sins of his Life were not imputed to us: The Reason of this, is (as I shewed above) because the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Dispensation or probationary State <hi>Adam</hi> was put under, came to a Period on his first Sin and Fall, so that he no longer acted in the Capacity of a public Person, our federal Head and Surety: Therefore none of his consequent Sins were imputed to his Posterity, any more than the Sins of our immediate Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.—It will not therefore follow, that God doth not impute the Guilt of our <hi>first Parents</hi> Apostacy to their Posterity, because he doth not punish us for the Sins of our <hi>immediate</hi> Parents; since the former acted in a publick Relation, but the latter act only in a private and personal Capacity.</p>
            <p>It may be further urged against this Proposition, <hi>That it dooms Multitudes of poor</hi> Infants <hi>to Hell, who never committed any actual Sin; and is therefore a Doctrine so cruel and unmerciful, as to be unworthy of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, that greatest Modesty becomes us in drawing any Conclusions, on this Subject. We have indeed the highest Encouragement to dedicate our Children to Christ, since he has told us, <hi>Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and the strongest Reason for Hope as to the Happiness of those deceased In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who have been thus dedicated to him. But God has not been pleased to reveal to us, how far
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004710_0139_0000000000000000"/>
he will extend his <hi>uncovenanted</hi> Mercy, to others that die in Infancy..... As, on the one Hand, I don't know that the Scripture any where assures us, that they shall <hi>all</hi> be <hi>saved:</hi> So, on the other Hand, we have not (that I know of) any Evidence, from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the Nature of Things, that <hi>any</hi> of these will eternally <hi>perish.</hi>—All those that die in <hi>Infancy,</hi> may (for ought we know) belong to the <hi>Election of Grace;</hi> and be <hi>predestinated to the Adoption of Children.</hi> They may, in Methods to us unknown, have the Benefits of Christ's Redemption applied to them; and thereby be made Heirs of eternal Glory. They are (it's true) naturally under the Guilt and Pollution of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin: But they may notwithstanding this, for any Thing that appears to the contrary, be renewed by the gracious Influences of the Spirit of God; and thereby be made meet for eternal Life. It therefore concerns us, without any bold and presumptuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, to leave them in the Hands of that God, whose <hi>tender Mercies are over all his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly stated and explain'd the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of original Sin, and endeavoured to obviate the Difficulties that lie in the Way: I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make some practical Reflections upon what has been said, by Way of IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p>USE I. <hi>This shews us the miserable perishing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of all</hi> unconverted Sinners; <hi>of all that continue in the State of Pollution and Guilt, that they are naturally in.</hi>—It is a dreadful Thing to be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the living God, <hi>A fearful Thing to fall into his Hands.</hi> If <hi>the Wrath of a King be as the Roaring of a Lyon,</hi> how terrible is the Wrath of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

God! How terrible will his eternal Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, to all those who are the miserable Subjects of it! This is a Thought that might justly surprize the securest Sinner living. For <hi>who can stand before his Indignation, when his Fury is poured out like Fire; and the Rocks are thrown down by him! What Heart can endure, or Hands be strong, when the Lord shall deal with them!</hi>—How shocking a Thought must it therefore be, to consider the far greatest Part of the World of Mankind as obnoxious eventually to suffer the eternal Displeasure of a just and almighty God!—All that live and die in a State of <hi>Nature,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably miserable forever. Their <hi>original Sin</hi> (as I have shewn) is sufficient to condemn them. They can never be admitted to Heaven with that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Defilement, with that Hardness of Heart, and Enmity to God, which they have derived from our first Parents. And while they remain unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they are continually adding to this original Weight dreadful Loads of Guilt, by their innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>actual</hi> Sins; and thereby increasing their Misery, and exposing themselves to more amazing Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—And is this a State to be continued in? Can Men sleep secure, while the Flames of infinite Wrath surround them? Can they be content to <hi>dwell with devouring Fire;</hi> and <hi>to inhabit everlasting Burnings?</hi> Does it not infinitely concern every one, to meditate a Deliverance from that undone Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they are naturally in; and to <hi>

How dangerous to remain quiet and secure in a State of Death; and not to be undeceived, until it is too late!—The Doctrine I have been treating of, is not to be consider'd as a Matter of mere Speculation, that may without Prejudice to our Souls be indffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently either believed or rejected.

For how can he mourn after a Pardon of the Sin, that he neither sees nor feels? How can he in earnest seek

a Recovery from such a Condition, as appears good enough already? To what Purpose would it be, to endeavour to purify the Streams, when the Fountain is corrupt and polluted; to seek a Reformation from particular Sins, when the whole Nature is Sin and Defilement, <hi>the whole Head sick, and the whole Heart faint? Verily the whole need not the Physician; but they that are sick.</hi> Matth. ix. 12.—It is therefore of the last Necessity, for Sinners to see the Sinfulness and Misery of their State by Nature, to see that they are undone and perishing in their present Condition, to have a lively Impression of their dreadful Danger, while Enemies to God, and Heirs of Perdition; that this awakening Prospect may make them in earnest repair to the Fountain of Grace and Life.—If ever Sinners are brought to a sincere Repentance, they will be deeply humbled under a Sense of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin and the Corruption of their Natures, as well as Transgressions of their Life. They will groan out <hi>David's</hi> Complaint, <hi>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity; and in Sin did my Mother conceive me:</hi> and will, with the Apostle, mourn after <hi>Deliverance from the Body of this Death.</hi>—As for others that are sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing secure in this perishing Condition, they must quickly awake out of Sleep; or be terribly convinced, that God is most just in imputing and punishing the Sin of our first Parents, when <hi>every Mouth will be stopt, and the whole World be judged in Righteousness.</hi>

How dreadful will your final Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, when not only your original, but all your numerous actual Sins, attended with such mighty Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, are hereafter punish'd according to their Demerit.—Let the Appeal be therefore made to your own Consciences, whether it be not of greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to get into a better and safer State, than this is; to get your Nature sanctified and renewed; to secure the Favour of God; and to be fitted to appear before your Judge with Comfort, when <hi>he shall appear, and his Reward shall be with him!</hi>—Have you any Desire of the Comforts of a religious Life?

View your Circumstances as they appear by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> which thunders forth <hi>Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguish against you.</hi> View them as they will appear when you come to <hi>die;</hi> and have nothing in Prospect, but the dreadful Effects of your Sin and Guilt; when <hi>nothing remains but a fearful looking for of fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ready to consume you,</hi> except you repent and be converted. View them as they will appear, if you are found in your present State, <hi>at the last Day,</hi> before the Tribunal of your Judge, when with Horror and Amazement you must hear the terrible Sentence, <hi>Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> View them as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And let the dreadful View excite in you all possible Endeavours to <hi>flee from the Wrath to come,</hi> and secure the Salvation of your Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Labour after a humbling Sense of your utter</hi> Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <hi>to relieve and save your selves.</hi>—Don't attempt this Change of your Heart and State in your own Strength. Alas, you are <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:004710_0145_0000000000000000"/>
(as you have heard before) and a naturally dead Man is as capable to revive himself and to reassume vital Power and Action, as you are to <hi>create your selves a new unto good Works.</hi>—As you are not indeed <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> dead, you are therefore capable to attend upon the Means of Grace and Life, in Order to have the <hi>good Pleasure of God's Goodness wrought in you, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi> But then as you are spiritually dead, you cannot by any Skill or Strength of your own change your Hearts; nor do any Thing that will give you a Claim to have it done for you.</p>
            <p>You must become <hi>new Creatures:</hi> You must <hi>be born again:</hi> You must be <hi>turned from Darkness to Light; and from the Power of Satan unto God: The Heart of Stone must be taken out of your Flesh; and a Heart of Flesh given you;</hi> and in a Word (as I observ'd before) <hi>Old Things must pass away; and all Things must become new in you.</hi> And can it be in your own Power to produce this wonderful Change?—You must live in the Exercise of <hi>Faith in the Son of God, without which it is impossible to please him:</hi> You must live in the <hi>Love of God:</hi> Your <hi>Affections must be placed upon the Things that are above:</hi> You must be <hi>spiritually minded;</hi> and have <hi>your Conversations in Heaven.</hi> But is it possible to exercise these Graces before you have them? Is it possible for you to beget them in your own Souls, when all your Powers, Faculties and Affections are directly opposite to 'em? Or is it possible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Blessing of this renewed Nature from God; when your whole Conduct is one Course of Enmity against him and Indignity to him? <hi>No!</hi> Consider your Case <hi>as it is.</hi> You are dead, and can't help your selves: You are guilty, and can't deserve that

God should help you. If you perish for ever, God is just; and you have no Cause of Complaint. And if God have Mercy upon your Soul, he will bring you to his Footstool, with a most humble abasing Sense of this your impotent and miserable, guilty and exposed State. He will bring you to be thus <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> if ever he gives you a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Resolve to cast your perishing Souls upon the Riches of the sovereign free</hi> Grace <hi>of God in Christ.</hi> You deserve to perish, and can't help your selves. Destruction and Death are before you; and there is no Remedy in your own Power. What will you do? What Course can you take? If you rest in your present Condition, you are undone for ever. If you betake your selves to any Sufficiency of your own, it won't help the Case.—But here is your Relief and Encouragement: <hi>With God there is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, that he may be feared; and with Him is plenteous Redemption. It is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Acceptation, that Christ Jesus came to save, even the chief of Sinners.</hi> If you are sensible of your lost Estate, If you are burthen'd with the Weight of your Sin and Guilt, If you are solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously enquiring after a Deliverance from the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you feel and fear, the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is inviting you <hi>to come unto him; and</hi> so doing <hi>he will give you Rest.</hi>—Resolve therefore to commit your Souls to the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of Christ for Justification, to the Influences of the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> for Conversion and Sanctification; and rely only upon the Riches of the free <hi>Mercy</hi> of God in Christ, that the Work of Grace may be carried on in your Souls with Power,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:004710_0147_0000000000000000"/>
that you may be translated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son, and obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal Glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Persevere in a constant and diligent Attendance upon all the</hi> Means of Grace, <hi>in Order to have this Change wrought in you.</hi>—Though your Deliverance from your miserable Condition intirely depends upon the sovereign Grace of God in Christ, which you can neither merit, nor have any Claim to, by any Thing you do, or can do: Yet you must <hi>seek</hi> it, if you would <hi>find</hi> it. You must <hi>knock</hi> at the Door of Mercy, if you would have it <hi>open'd</hi> unto you.—It is God that must <hi>sprinkle you with clean Water, and make you clean; from all your Filthiness and from all your Idols he must cleanse you: He must take away the Heart of Stone; and give you a Heart of Flesh: He must cause you to remember your own evil Ways, and your Doings that are not good; and to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HAVING in the foregoing Discourse, something distinctly consider'd the sad Effects of our original Apostacy, I am now led by the Words before us, to take Notice of the Methods of our Recovery from the Misery, Death and Ruin, which the Fall has brought upon us.—In the Text we have,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:004710_0150_0000000000000000"/>1. A Representation of our <hi>State by Nature,</hi> in those Words, <hi>When we were dead in Sins.</hi> We are by our Apostacy from God, <hi>dead</hi> as to all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Faculties of our Souls in their moral Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: They are wholly Pollution and Sin; and naturally uncapable of any Thing that is spiritually good.—We are dead by a just Sentence of the <hi>Law</hi> of God. We are <hi>condemned already; and the Wrath of God abideth on us.</hi> And we are not only spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; but <hi>eternally</hi> dead, by the Execution of that terrible Sentence upon our Souls, if infinite Mercy doth not step in to our Rescue and Deliverance; as I have observ'd in a former Discourse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is set before us the great Change, which by <hi>Conversion</hi> is wrought on the Soul? In that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Hath quickned us;</hi> or (as it is elsewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed) hath <hi>made us alive from the Dead.</hi> The blessed Spirit of God, when he pleaseth, renews our Nature, sanctifies our Affections, and <hi>fulfils in us the whole good Pleasure of his Goodness.</hi> By his gracious Operations upon our Souls, he mortifies our Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, brings our sinful Appetites and Passions-into Subjection; and <hi>creates us anew in Christ Jesus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> good Works, that we may walk in them.</hi> This makes a great Change in the Soul, such as may very aptly be compared to a <hi>Quickning,</hi> or Resurrection from the Dead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is intimated the powerful <hi>Efficiency,</hi> by which this Change is wrought; in those Words, <hi>Together with Christ.</hi> As the almighty Power of God was gloriously exerted and display'd, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> from the Dead,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004710_0151_0000000000000000"/>
so is the same almighty Power manifested and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in the Resurrection of <hi>Sinners</hi> from their <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Death. Thus they are <hi>quickned together with Christ;</hi> as truly quickned as he was, and by the same Divine Efficiency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have the <hi>Motive</hi> unto, or the <hi>impulsive Cause</hi> of this Change, suggested in those Words, <hi>God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love, wherewith he loved us: By Grace ye are saved.</hi>—There could be no Motive <hi>out</hi> of himself, Nothing but his own infinite <hi>Mercy Love, &amp; Grace,</hi> to excite his kind Regards to such poor guilty Hell-deserving Rebels as we are. Should he leave us all under the Guilt of our Sins and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power of our Lusts, unto inevitable and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diless Perdition, he would be most just; and we most justly miserable. We should have no Cause of Complaint, if he should bestow no Mercy upon any of us; for he owes us none, we have nothing to claim but his just Displeasure. What then but sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign distinguishing Grace, looks upon any of the fallen Race of Mankind while in their Blood, and says unto them, <hi>Live?</hi> Why is one, more than another, Partaker of these quickning Influences; but from the meer <hi>good Pleasure of God's Goodness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may more distinctly explain the Words before us, I shall endeavour to consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In what <hi>Manner</hi> the Spirit of God power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>quickens</hi> dead Sinners, and brings them into a State of spiritual Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In what Respect we are thus saved by the rich <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:004710_0152_0000000000000000"/>I'm then to consider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>In what</hi> Manner <hi>the Spirit of God quickens dead Sinners, and brings them into a State of spiritual Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I shall in general observe, that the <hi>principal Method,</hi> by which this great Change is wrought in the Heart of a Sinner by the Spirit of God, is <hi>his giving him a realizing View of the great Truths reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word of God, and enabling him to see Things as they are.</hi>—It may be some Prejudice against the Doctrine of our Sanctification by the special Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit of God upon our Hearts, that Men may imagine, there is hereby intended the Infusion of some new <hi>Faculty</hi> into the Soul, which it had not before; and that the new Creation implies our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a new Sort of Being, with Respect to the <hi>natural</hi> Powers and Properties of the Soul, which we were not before. But let it be consider'd, that the Spirit of God does no more in the Conversion of a Sinner, than bring him to the <hi>right Exercise</hi> of those rational Powers, with which he was born; give him a <hi>just View</hi> of his greatest Concerns; and <hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> him to act worthy of a <hi>reasonable</hi> Being. Observe this, and all the Prejudices against the Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us are obviated, and vanish away. Now that this is the Case, I shall endeavour to shew, by taking some particular Notice of the usual <hi>progressive Steps</hi> by which a Sinner is brought out of a State of carnal Security, to the Possession and Exercise of the divine Life; <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Though I have on another Occasion formerly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to represent the</hi> Methods of the blessed Spirit's Operations in the Conversion and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of a Sinner <hi>(in a Discourse publish'd on that Subject) the Reader will see the Necessity of considering these Things over again</hi> in another View, <hi>in Order to clear up the Case before me.</hi>
               </note> And I think it will appear that the whole
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:004710_0153_0000000000000000"/>
Change is wrought in him by spiritual <hi>Illumination,</hi> by impressing a <hi>right View</hi> of Things upon his Mind, or by enabling him to act <hi>reasonably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, if we consider the <hi>first Change</hi> wrought in a Sinner by the Spirit of God, it will appear to be no more than his bringing him to <hi>realize his own miserable Condition, and see it as it is.</hi>—It is awfully certain from the Word of God, that every impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner is an Enemy to God, under a Sentence of Condemnation, and an Heir of Hell and eternal Misery. And it is equally certain, that the most of the World are easy and quiet, careless and secure in this dreadful State. No Means that can possibly be used, will put the most of Mankind upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sollicitude about their eternal Welfare. The most awakening Addresses, that can be made them in the Name of the Lord, the most surprizing Alarms of God's Providence, the most pathetick and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate Intreaties of their godly Friends, have no Effect upon them, to stop their Carreer for Hell and Damnation. They will yet sleep upon the Brink of the Pit. They will yet <hi>run upon the thick Boss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of God's Bucklers.</hi> They will yet indulge their Lusts, though they perish forever.—And what is the Source of this Indolence, Thoughtlesness, and Security; but their want of a <hi>just View</hi> of their State and Danger?
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:004710_0154_0000000000000000"/>
Could they but realize these Things, and see them <hi>as they are,</hi> they would sooner rush upon a drawn Sword, or leap into a burning Furnace, than farther incense the eternal Majesty against their Souls, and venture upon everlasting Damnation. But their Misery is, that they have no feeling Apprehension of these Things. They consider them but as the Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of remote Thunder; and as Affairs of no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Consequence to them: and thus they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them, unless the Spirit of God sets home the important Concern upon their Mind; and gives them a lively Sense of what they are doing, and whither they are going.—But if once the blessed Spirit under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the Work, he will make the long neglected and slighted Means of Grace effectual to open their Eyes, that they may see their State as it is. Tho' they could before sit under the most powerful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry from Year to Year, without Care, Fear, or sensible Apprehension of their Danger: Yet now an ordinary Sermon, or a particular Passage in a Sermon, which perhaps they had heard hundreds of Times before without Concern, shall awaken their sleepy Consciences, and make them with <hi>Trembling</hi> and <hi>Astonishment</hi> cry out, <hi>What shall I do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>—Why, what's the Matter now? Whence is this wonderful Change? Why can't the poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do now as he was wont to do? Why can't he go on in his Mirth and Jollity, in his worldly Pursuits and sensual Gratifications? What means this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Distress, this melancholly Countenance and solemn Concern? Is this the Man, that lately laugh'd at Preciseness; that banter'd serious Godliness, and ridicul'd vital Piety, as <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or a heated Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination? Whence is he now as much an Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:004710_0155_0000000000000000"/>
as any of those whom he lately derided and scoff'd at? Whence is <hi>be</hi> now so afraid of Hell and Damnation, that could lately <hi>mock at Fear; and laugh at the shaking of God's Spear?</hi>—This wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Alteration is wholly wrought by the almighty Spirit's impressing a <hi>lively View</hi> of what the secure Sinner could have no feeling Sense of before. Now he sees his <hi>Sins,</hi> in their Number, Nature and Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. Now he sees his <hi>Danger;</hi> and thence feels that <hi>it's a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</hi> He sees it in such a View, that he can be no longer quiet and easy, in such a State of Guilt and Misery. But this (tho' open to every one's Observation, and plainly visible from the Word of God, and the Nature of Things) is what he never would have seen to Purpose, unless the Consorter had be'n sent to <hi>convince him of Sin.</hi> And the Reason is assigned, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not.</hi> And <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Israel doth not know; my People doth not consider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If we consider the Case with Respect to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's <hi>Humiliation,</hi> the Spirit of God works this also in the Soul, by <hi>shewing him his State as it is;</hi> and by giving him a realizing Sight of his <hi>Unworthiness</hi> of Divine Mercy, of his spiritual <hi>Impotency,</hi> and utter Inability to help himself.—These are indeed Truths plainly revealed in Scripture, as well as necessary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from the Light of Nature. By both these it is clearly manifest, that we are guilty Creatures, and thereby obnoxious to the Wrath God; that we are imperfect Creatures, and therefore cannot fulfil the Demands of the Law of Nature; much less can we make Satisfaction for our past Offences. But,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:004710_0156_0000000000000000"/>
though these Things are in themselves evident as the Light, they have no Impression upon the Minds of the Generality of Mankind.—Though deserving Nothing but Destruction and Death, they are as easy and secure, as though they had a Title to God's Favour, and a Claim to eternal Happiness. Though utterly uncapable to change their own Hearts, or to deserve that God should do it for them, they are yet attempting their Salvation <hi>in their own Strength,</hi> if they attempt it at all; and <hi>being ignorant of God's Righteousness, they go about to establish their own Righteousness, not submitting themselves to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God.</hi> Even those who are convinced of their Guilt and Danger, are usually struggling after Deliverance in their own Strength; and betaking themselves to some Self-righteous Refuge or other. And thus in their highest Attainments, will they continue to <hi>compass themselves about with Sparks of their own Kindling,</hi> till the Spirit of Grace by his powerful Influences humble them at God's Foot; and shew'em that they are <hi>poor, and miserable, and wretched, and blind, and naked.</hi> And how is this done, but by giving them a <hi>Sight of their Case as it is?</hi>—They had a <hi>doctrinal</hi> Knowledge before, that they were sinful, guilty, helpless, and hopeless in themselves: But this had no special Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Affections, or their Conduct. But when they have a <hi>feeling</hi> Sense of this, it must bring them low. They now see their Sin and Guilt, that there is no resting in their present Condition. They see the Defects of their Duties, that these cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend 'em to God's Favour. They see their own Impotency, that they cannot take away the Heart of Stone out of their Flesh; and give themselves a
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:004710_0157_0000000000000000"/>
Heart of Flesh. They see the strict Demands of God's Law, that it's impossible to come up to 'em. They see the Purity and Holiness of God's Nature, that He cannot look upon Sin and Sinners with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. They see that they have no Capacity to help themselves, though they are utterly undone in their present Condition. And what is the necessary Result of a realizing Sight of such a lost, helpless, perishing Condition, but that (<hi>Psalm</hi> cxxx. 3.) <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldst mark Iniquity, O Lord, who should stand?</hi> Or that (<hi>Neb.</hi> ix. 15.) <hi>Behold, we are before thee in our Trespasses; for we cannot stand before thee, because of this!</hi> What should be the Result of this Prospect, but that they lie at God's Footstool, as condemned Malefactors, having nothing to plead, save unmerited and forfeited Mercy, why Sentence should not be executed upon them, to their eternal Confusion!</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the same Manner, is a convinced Sinner brought to a <hi>sollicitous Inquiry after an Interest in Christ.</hi> This also is wrought in him, by a lively <hi>View</hi> of his Case <hi>as it is.</hi>—We are all indeed from our earliest Age, indoctrinated in this essential Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Christian Faith, That <hi>there is not Salvation in any other</hi> but Christ, and that <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven and among Men, whereby we must be saved.</hi> And yet the most of the World are <hi>whole, and need not the Physician.</hi> They are more concern'd about any Thing else, than about an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ. It is beyond human Art and Means, to make them at all sollicitous about this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though they know that their eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare depends upon it.—And what can be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:004710_0158_0000000000000000"/>
that this <hi>Madness is in the Hearts of Men?</hi> Can condemned perishing Sinners be unconcern'd, about the only Method of Escape from eternal Damnation? Can they set more Value by their Lusts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by the World and it's Vanities, and even by the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>est Trifles imaginable, than by Christ and his saving Benefits? Can they rather choose to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish eternally, and to lose all the Glories of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly World, than to <hi>come to Christ, that they might have Life?</hi> How astonishing soever this Conduct appears, it is visibly the Case of the World of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general. And what Reason can possibly be imagin'd of such unparallel'd Stupidity, but this, that they have not (they cannot have, while under the Power of a blind and carnal Mind) any realizing View of this great Concern? Could they but see their Case <hi>as it is,</hi> a condemned Malefactor could as easily set Light by a Pardon, or a drowning Man by Deliverance, as these perishing Sinners by an offered Saviour.—We accordingly find, that when the Spirit of God comes upon them with his Illuminations, and opens their Eyes to see their Misery and Impotency, they can be no longer careless about an Interest in Christ. They can no longer make Excuses: and <hi>go their Way, one to his Farm; and another to his Merchandize.</hi> They can no longer amuse themselves with divers Lusts and Pleasures; and forget their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Christ and his Salvation. No! they have now Nothing so much at Heart, as the securing an Interest in this blessed Saviour. Now this Thought lies down and rises with them, <hi>What must I do to be saved?</hi> How shall I obtain an Interest in Christ? Now their distressed Souls are groaning out these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick Desires, <hi>O for an Interest in Christ! Let
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004710_0159_0000000000000000"/>
me have Christ, whatever I want!</hi> The World now with all it's Blandishments, all its Riches and Glory, dwindles to Nothing in the Eyes of such a humbled Sinner, when compared with this excellent and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour. I may appeal to every one that have been truly converted to God, at an Age of Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether they han't experienced these Things in their own Hearts. And indeed these Operations of the Mind are so rational, that it would be in the Nature of Things impossible we should neglect a most active Concern about an Interest in Christ, if the Eyes of our Understanding were enlighten'd. But alas! <hi>The Light shines in Darkness; and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness comprehendeth it not.</hi> We see by Experience, that Men never do (never will) shew themselves tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly in earnest about this everlasting Concern, till the Spirit of God <hi>open their Eyes, and turn them from Darkness to Light;</hi> and that when they are thus il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, they can't do otherwise. This wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Change in Men's Desires and Pursuits, is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Consequence of Divine Illumination, and of a just and reasonable View of Things. Without this, they cannot attain it: With this, they cannot fail of it. To this therefore the Apostle ascribes it. 2<hi>Cor.</hi> iv.6. <hi>For God who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. In the same Manner also is the <hi>actual Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of a Sinner accomplish'd. In Order to this, the Spirit of God gives him a realizing Sight of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Sufficiency that there is in Christ; and of his Willingness and Readiness to save him. The
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:004710_0160_0000000000000000"/>
Attainments before described, do not necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a saving Conversion to God. Tho' these are the Influences of the blessed Spirit, they are not his special and saving Operations. The Sinner is not brought into a State of Favour with God, till he accepts a tendred Saviour upon his own Terms. Tis by <hi>receiving him, that we have Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> The first Act of saving <hi>Faith</hi> is that Conversion, by which the Sinner affectually turns from Sin <hi>to God,</hi> passes <hi>from Death to Life,</hi> and becomes interested in Christ and all his saving Benefits.—Now, which Way is the Sinner bro't to this, but by an impressed lively <hi>Discovery</hi> of Things <hi>as they are?</hi>—By a lively Sight of his <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Danger,</hi> powerfully applied to his Mind and Conscience, and appearing <hi>as it is,</hi> he is awaken'd to an earnest Inquiry after the Way of Salvation. By a clear Discovery of his <hi>Unworthiness</hi> and <hi>Impotence,</hi> he is bro't to the Footstool of God's Sovereignty, and to an earnest Desire of an Interest in Christ; as I observ'd before. But here the Soul is often plunged into greatest Darkness and Distress: His <hi>Guilt</hi> stares him in the Face; He sees he has no Claim to Mercy, Nothing that can intitle him to it; He has been struggling in vain, to mortify his Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to enliven his Affections, and to do something to recommend himself to God's Favour; and is now perhaps ready to give up the Case, as helpless and hopeless; He can't see how God can have Mercy upon such a guilty, polluted, hard-hearted, hellish Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he is.—Propose to him the only <hi>Remedy</hi> for such lost Sinners; and how many <hi>Objections</hi> will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in the Way! How many Arguments will he bring against believing in Christ; from his own Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and want of Qualifications to come to him;
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:004710_0161_0000000000000000"/>
from the Decrees of God; from his having sinned away the Day of Grace, and the like; even till he runs into Despair, unless the Spirit of God disperse the dark Cloud, and give him a <hi>right view of</hi> redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy!—But when once such a distressed Soul fees this as it is, when once he has an impressed Sense of Gospel-Grace, and is brought to see indeed, that he is invited to come to Christ, notwithstanding all his Guilt and Unworthiness; and that this precious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is able and willing to bestow all that Salvation upon him, which he stands in Need of, then his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are silenced; and he cannot refrain from heartily complying with the Offer.—Then he can commit his Soul to him; for he sees that there is utmost Safety in doing it. Then he can depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as the <hi>Author of his eternal Salvation;</hi> for he sees that he has no <hi>whither else to go,</hi> and that Christ <hi>has the Words of eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that the Scriptures every where annex Salvation to <hi>Faith,</hi> and to the <hi>Belief of the Truth;</hi> and we are told, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God.</hi> But what are we to understand by this Belief? Will a cold and unactive Assent to this Truth interest us in Christ and his Salvation? No! <hi>Faith is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not seen.</hi> Heb. xi. 1. In which is more than a bare Assent imply'd. It implies such a realizing View as makes all the Offers of Salvation by Christ certain, and his purchased Benefits present to the Believer. And when a weary and heavy-laden Soul hath such a Sight of the Fulness and Sufficiency, of the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Compassion of Christ; and of his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to save him upon his coming to him, as makes
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:004710_0162_0000000000000000"/>
this comfortable Truth as it were personally present to his Mind; when he has such a View that this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is offered freely to him, <hi>without Money and without Price;</hi> it is impossible for him to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than consent to such reasonable Terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How can he refuse his Consent to these Terms, when his Distress of Soul had before prepar'd him for a Compliance with any Terms of obtaining God's Favour? It's impossible for him to do otherwise than set the highest Value by such a Saviour, when he has this Sight, that Grace here, and Glory hereafter is imply'd in his Interest in Christ. It's impossible for him to do otherwise than have his Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ only, when he has this Sight, that <hi>in him all Fulness dwells,</hi> and that there is no Safety any where else.—But I hope (if God will) more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to describe a true saving Faith. I'm now only endeavouring to shew, that the Spirit of God works this Grace in us by illuminating our Minds; and giving us a right Exercise of our Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God does likewise carry on the Work of Grace in a Believer's <hi>Sanctification,</hi> by continued <hi>Views</hi> of spiritual Things <hi>as they are.</hi>—By Faith, the Soul is united to the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and becomes <hi>one Spirit</hi> with him. By Faith, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have an Interest in all the Benefits of Christ's Redemption. They have thereby a Claim to all the Promises of the Covenant of Grace, and may safely and confidently depend upon the Faithfulness of God, that <hi>he will give them Grace and Glory;</hi> that <hi>they shall be kept by his Power, through Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

How comes the Believer to <hi>hate every false Way;</hi> but by a lively View of the Vileness and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of sinning against God? What excites him to live in the Love of God; but a realizing Impression of the Excellency of his Nature, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Value of his Favour, and the endearing Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of his Goodness, Kindness and Compassion? What makes him in Love with Holiness; but a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Discovery of it's internal Beauty and agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a reasonable Being? How comes he wean'd from the World; but by a true Sight of it's Vanity, and utter Insufficiency to satisfy the Desires of an immortal Nature? How come his Affections placed upon the Things above; but from a like Discovery of the Value and Importance of Things unseen and eternal? What is Communion with God; but a just Impression of what pertains to God and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And what the Evidences of God's Favour; but a realizing Sight of the Actings of Grace in our Souls, and of the Truth of the Invitations and Promises of the Gospel? The extraordinary Influences of the Spirit in his immediate Communications of Light and Joy to the Believer, are but still a brighter Discovery of Things <hi>as they are.</hi>—In a Word, in whatever As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this Case is consider'd, what I am pleading for
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:004710_0164_0000000000000000"/>
will (I think) appear to be Truth. The whole Work of Sanctification is carried on by Illumination, and by the Soul's being brought, through the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's Spirit, to the Exercise of Knowledge and Understanding; and to this the Apostle ascribes it. Eph. i. 17, 18. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Mercy, may give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, in the Knowlege of him: The Eyes of your Understanding being enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you may know what is the Hope of his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I can't see that the Spirit of God does in any other manner work this wonderful Change in the Hearts of Sinners, than by giving them a just <hi>View</hi> of Things <hi>as they are,</hi> by bringing them to act <hi>reasonably,</hi> worthy the Dignity of their rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the intellectual Powers they are endued with. By this he conquers the Enmity to God there is in their Hearts; and brings them from the Power of their Lusts, of Satan, and the World, into the Fear and Favour of God. By <hi>opening their Eyes, he turns them from Darkness to Light, and from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Satan unto God, that they may have an Inheritance among those that are sanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be <hi>objected,</hi> That the <hi>Will</hi> must be changed and renewed, as well as the Understanding enlightned, in the Conversion of a Sinner; That the Spirit of God <hi>works in us both to will and to do of his good Pleasure;</hi> and Christ's <hi>People must be made willing in the Day of his Power:</hi> This is readily granted.—But the Question is, In what <hi>Manner</hi> is the Will changed; and how doth the Lord Jesus Christ bring the stubborn obdurate Will of the Sinner into Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:004710_0165_0000000000000000"/>
to himself? To this I answer as before; By giving them a <hi>realizing affecting Sight</hi> of Things as they are.—It's impossible for a reasonable Being to do otherwise than <hi>will</hi> what appears to be, in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, <hi>best</hi> for him and most agreable and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him. Did therefore carnally secure Sinners see Things <hi>as they are;</hi> did they realize to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Folly and Danger of their Lusts, the Misery of an unconverted State, their Need of a Saviour, the Excellency of Christ, the Advantage of an Interest in him, the Benefits of a Life of Religion with Respect both to this World and that to come; I say, did they <hi>see</hi> these Things in a just and powerful Light, their <hi>Wills</hi> would necessarily be changed. They would no longer choose the Way of Destruction and Death, before the Path of Life and Peace. They would no longer venture eternal Damnation, rather than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Happiness here and for ever.—We are not therefore to suppose, that the Spirit of God properly puts any <hi>Force</hi> upon Men's Inclinations, when he changes their Wills. The Will admits no Violence. He does but give them a true Discovery, a realizing View and powerful Impression of what is best for them; and that necessarily determines their Choice.—Let Sinners, if they can, be willing to rush upon the Pikes of God's Displeasure, when the Spirit by strong Convictions and Illuminations gives them a full and clear Sight of their Sins, and of the flaming Vengeance, that hangs over their guilty Heads. Let them, if they can, refuse a tendred Saviour, when they are brought to see their extreme Necessity of him, with his Fulness, Sufficiency, and Readiness to save them. Or let them, if they can, choose the Service of Sin and Satan before the Service of God, when
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:004710_0166_0000000000000000"/>
they have a feeling Sense of the Danger and Misery of the one; and the Excellency, Desireableness, and Safety of the other.—In a Word, Tho' Men may have the greatest Degree of <hi>doctrinal</hi> Knowledge, in the Things now treated of, understand them well, discourse of 'em rationally and distinctly; and receive 'em for Truth, without any Change of their Wills and Affections: yet if through the Spirit they had any <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>affecting Apprehensions</hi> of these unseen and eternal Concerns, they must of Necessity have an Influence upon their Hearts and Lives, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi> of the <hi>Light</hi> impressed on their Minds. Tho' a notional Knowledge of these Things will serve no other Purpose, but to leave the Sinner the more <hi>inexcusable:</hi> yet when the Spirit of God sets them home with Power upon the Soul, in their own proper Light and Evidence, this Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect cannot fail of a blessed Effect.—But it's Time I should proceed to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>In what</hi> Respect <hi>this quickning and sanctifying Change is to be attributed to the</hi> rich Mercy <hi>and</hi> Grace <hi>of God.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And here let it be observ'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is to be ascribed to the Riches of divine Grace, with Respect to the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, in distinguishing some from the rest of the World of Mankind, in the Application of the Benefits of Christ's Redemption to their Souls.—There is Nothing more visible to every Observer, than the dreadful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Stupidity, Neglect of Christ and Salvation, chargeable upon the far greatest Part of those, who enjoy the best Advantages for their eternal Welfare. How sad and melancholly is the Reflection, that
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:004710_0167_0000000000000000"/>
such Multitudes of those who are <hi>lifted up to Heaven</hi> by their Privileges, must yet be <hi>cast down to Hell;</hi> and Nothing that is or can be done for 'em in the Use of the best Means whatsoever, will prevent their final and eternal Ruin! And whence is it, that all the World, without Difference, are not boldly going on in the same Paths of Destruction and Death? Whence is it, that there are any of the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> brought to see their Danger, to enquire the Way of Salvation; and to betake themselves to Christ for Refuge?—Is it from any superiour <hi>natural Powers,</hi> that they thus become wise to Salvation? Constant Experience shews us that <hi>God hath chosen the foolish Things of the World, to confound the wise; and the weak Things of the World, to confound the Things that are mighty.</hi>—Is it from the Enjoyment of better <hi>Means</hi> and external Advantages for their Souls eternal Interest? Don't we daily see, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very same Ordinances and Providences of God <hi>one is taken and another left?</hi>—Is it from their more innocent and regular <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Conversations?</hi> How often do we see scandalous and flagitious Sinners savingly converted to God, when others that are free from such gross Pollutions, remain in Unbelief, and live on in the Neglect of Christ and his offered Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots</hi> enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, when <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> are shut out.—Is it from better <hi>Education?</hi> Whence then is <hi>this</hi> Difference in the Children of the <hi>same</hi> Family?—Is it from a better <hi>natural Disposition?</hi> Alas, every unsanctified carnal <hi>Mind is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, it is not subject to the Law of God; neither indeed can be.</hi>—What Cause then can this possibly be ascribed to, but that which is assign'd by our blessed
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:004710_0168_0000000000000000"/>
Lord? <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 25, 26? <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these Things from the wise and prudent; and revealed them unto Babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight.</hi>—God is absolutely Sovereign in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of his own Benefits. He bestows them when, where, and how he pleaseth. <hi>He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy.—He makes known the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of his Will, according to his good Pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself.</hi> Eph. i. 9.—What Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore have those that are effectually called, to admire and adore the infinite Riches of the sovereign free Grace of God to them, in Distinction from so many others, that continue in their Sin and Guilt, in a State of Death and Perdition! <hi>Who has made them to differ? What have they, that they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?</hi> What was there in them more than in others, that could excite the divine Compassion? Had they not the same corrupt Nature, the same Enmity to God, the same Hardness of Heart, the same (if not greater) Degrees of Sin and Guilt, that are found in the unsanctified World? And has God <hi>passed by them when in their Blood, and said unto them, Live;</hi> while such Multitudes of others, as good by Nature as they, are like to perish eternally? O the Riches of the free distinguishing Grace of God<hi>! What manner of Love hath the Father bestowed upon them, that they should be called the Children of God!</hi> What Cause have they now to begin the eternal Anthem, <hi>To him that hath loved us and washed us from our Sins in his own Blood, and made us Kings and Priests unto God and his Father, to him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever, Amen!</hi>

               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:004710_0169_0000000000000000"/>2. The Conversion of a Sinner is a Display of the rich Mercy and free Grace of God, on Account of the <hi>strong Opposition</hi> there is in the Hearts of Sinners to this Change.—This Opposition to vital Piety is every where visible, in the Unsuccessfulness of the Means of Grace, and in all the fruitless Endeavours, that are used to persuade Men to turn and live. All that can be done by the faithful Ministers of Christ, won't prevail with a great Part of Mankind, so much as seriously to consider those Concerns that are of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Importance to their Souls. And what but the Enmity of their Natures to God and Godliness, can be the Cause of this Stupidity and Insensibility? They have the same natural Powers to consider their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest, which the Believer exercises to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Advantage; and yet <hi>they cannot receive the Things of the Spirit of God; but they are Foolishness to 'em.</hi> And whence is this Impotency but from a Fountain of Enmity and Opposition in their Hearts?—They are strongly attached to their Lusts and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Gratifications; and therefore will not realize to themselves, that these will in the Conclusion <hi>sting like a Serpent; and bite like an Adder.</hi> Their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are glowed to the World and its Vanities; they therefore will not allow themselves any suitable and solemn Reflections upon the Shortness, the Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vexation of these ensnaring Amusements. They have a natural Aversation to a spiritual and heavenly Life; and therefore cannot dwell in the Views of those Things that are unseen and eternal; nor at the utmost proceed further, than to a <hi>Form of Godliness,</hi> without the Power. The Way of Salvation by Christ is so contrary to the proud and self-righteous Disposition of their Souls, that they
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:004710_0170_0000000000000000"/>
cannot see <hi>any Comeliness in him, that they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him.</hi> They are so immersed in the Affairs of Time and Sense, that they will not allow themselves Leisure for any deliberate Thought and Concern about an eternal World.—Tho' they may be reasoned into an Acknowledgement, that <hi>this their Way is their Folly,</hi> how quickly does the Consideration vanish; and the sensual Appetite reccover its Dominion? Tho' they may be awaken'd to some temporary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about their State, by the Ordinances or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God; such are the rooted Prejudices in their Hearts against a religious Life, that <hi>the Dog soon returns to his Vomit; and the Sow that is washed, to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the Mire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, they are under the Dominion of Sin, and the Empire of Satan; and as long as the Strength of their own Corruptions, in concert with all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell, can keep the Palace, they will enjoy their Lusts in Peace. There must be one <hi>stronger than the strong Man armed, to take from him the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein he tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it therefore be, to bear down this Opposition, to bring these mad Men to their Reason; and how their Souls into Subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ! How wonderful is this Grace of God, to exercise such Compassion to their Souls, while they are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both to him and themselves! The Mercy of God does herein shine with peculiar Glory, that it not only enlightens the Eyes of the <hi>Blind;</hi> but of those that are <hi>voluntarily</hi> and <hi>obstinately</hi> so, that do and will refuse a Recovery, until he <hi>anoints them with his Eye-Salve, that they may see!</hi> This will be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

of the eternal Admiration of the Redeemed, that <hi>when they were Enemies, they were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> Rom. v. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Riches of God's free Grace appear in a Sinner's Conversion, in that none can have any <hi>Claim</hi> to the sanctifying Influences of the blessed Spirit, by any Thing they can do.—If we consider the <hi>whole Race</hi> of Mankind, in our apostate Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, what was there in <hi>us</hi> more than in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> that fell, to excite the divine Compassion?

Were they not all the Offspring of the same ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rebel, all under the Power of the same original Corruption, and all in the same Manner guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God? What therefore, but infinite free Grace, has distinguished us from the darkest Corners of the Earth?—If we consider this with Respect to the <hi>Elect</hi> of God, what out of God himself could be eternal Motive to choose them from the rest of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Faith it's impossible to please God.</hi> Can Unbelievers intitle themselves to God's Favour, while it's impossible they should please him?</p>
            <p>If any should pretend, that God has <hi>promised</hi> to bestow <hi>sanctifying Grace</hi> upon those that diligently <hi>seek</hi> it; that he has promised to <hi>those which seek,</hi> that <hi>they shall find;</hi> and to those, <hi>which knock,</hi> that <hi>the Door of Mercy shall be open'd unto them:</hi>—I shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether these should be consider'd as <hi>Promises</hi> made to unsanctified Persons; or <hi>Directions</hi> to be found in the Way of Life, and gracious <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to Diligence in Duty. For at present I can't but think, that in which soever of these Views such Texts of Scripture are consider'd, the Consequence will be the same; and that if these are consider'd as Promises, no unconverted Sinner can so far comply with the Condition, as to have a Title to the Benefit of such Promises.—None can (I think) pretend, that these Promises are made to an <hi>idle,</hi> slothful, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent Performance of Duty. And will the meer Powers of Nature ever carry any Man so far, as to be constant, fervent, and persevering in all the Ways of known Duty?—None can pretend, that these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made to an <hi>hypocritical</hi> Performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to those that <hi>flatter God with their Lips, and lie to him with their Tongues, while their Hearts are far from him.</hi> And can any unsanctify'd Person be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and sincere, in all his religious Performances?—None can pretend, that these Promises are made to such who bring their <hi>Lusts</hi> with them to God, in all their Approaches before him. No surely! <hi>If they regard Iniquity in their Hearts, the Lord will not hear them.</hi> And is any unsanctified Person capable to keep his Lusts always in Subjection; and to approach
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:004710_0173_0000000000000000"/>
the Presence of God with a <hi>hatred to every false Way,</hi> when it's always true, of them all, that <hi>their Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately Wicked?</hi>—If it be here urged, that God has given a Promise of Grace to those who seek it <hi>as well as they can;</hi> and that they therefore have a Claim to it, upon the Terms of using their <hi>best Endeavours</hi> to obtain it: I must yet observe, that no unsanctified Person ever came up, even to these low Terms. Can any of them pretend, that they have always gone <hi>as far as they could,</hi> in watching over their Hearts, in keeping out of the Way of Temptation, in bridling their Lusts, in attending upon all known Duties, and in being serious and affectionate in their Performance of them? If not, how have they a Title to Mercy, for doing as well as they can?—If it be further urged, that God has promis'd to <hi>overlook our Imperfections;</hi> and to bestow Grace upon us in the Way of seeking it, <hi>notwithstanding</hi> the great Defects of our Duties: I enquire, Where is the Promise to be found, that God will overlook the Imperfections of <hi>christless</hi> Sinners? They are under the <hi>Law,</hi> which <hi>curseth every one, that continues not in all Things to do them.</hi> Gal. iii. 10. Christ has indeed purchased for <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> that their imperfect Performances shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, through the Merit of his Atonement and Intercession. But how does that affect the Case of <hi>unconverted</hi> Sinners, who have no Interest in Christ, nor in the Benefits of his Redemption; and can therefore have no Claim to Mercy upon his Account?—Upon the whole then, it's most evident, that the Conversion of a Sinner is of <hi>sovereign free Grace;</hi> what God without Injustice can deny to any Man in the World; and what none have any Right to
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:004710_0174_0000000000000000"/>
by any possible Qualification of their own. And every Partaker of this unspeakable Gift has Cause with highest Admiration to say as the Apostle, <hi>The Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with Faith and Love which is in Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be objected, that if this Doctrine be true, <hi>it is in</hi> vain <hi>for unconverted Sinners to seek for Grace, since they have no Claim to it when they have done all they can; and it is</hi> impertinent, <hi>to press the Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon them, when their utmost Endeavours will give them no Title to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, the Apostle improves this Argument the quite contrary Way. <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling: FOR it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</hi> If God only can bestow Grace upon us, we should be the more in earnest to obtain it from him. If we have no Claim to Mercy, we should the more humbly prostrate our Souls at God's Footstool, pleading for Acceptance through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the great Redeemer.—Would it be just Reasoning in a condemned <hi>Malefactor,</hi> because none but his offended Sovereign can pardon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, reprieve him from Execution, and restore him to his forfeited Favour, that therefore he will not <hi>petition</hi> him for it? Would it be just Reasoning in a miserable <hi>Beggar,</hi> because he must die and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with Hunger, if the rich Man at whose Door he lies, won't extend his undeserv'd Charity to him, that therefore he will not <hi>ask</hi> an Alms of him to save his Life?—We are condemned Malefactors, what Need have we therefore to seek a Reprieve at the Footstool of divine Grace, where it can only be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for! We are <hi>

have we therefore to <hi>repair to our Father's House, where there is Bread enough and to spare!</hi> Were there but a meer <hi>Possibility</hi> of Mercy, it were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Incentive to the most active Endeavours, since there is no Hope of it in any other Way.—God <hi>can</hi> bestow Grace upon us, if he pleaseth. A Word from him is sufficient to change our Hearts, sanctify our Affections, and qualify us for eternal Salvation: and this is what all the Angels in Heaven, and Men upon Earth cannot do for us. <hi>To whom then shall we go, but to</hi> him <hi>who has the Words of eternal Life?</hi> Sinners don't know indeed that he <hi>will</hi> do this for them: but they do know that must perish, if he does not bestow his Salvation upon them; and they know nothing to the contrary, but that they <hi>may</hi> obtain, if they seek it. They have now all the <hi>Encouragement</hi> to seek, that any others have ever had, who have sought and obtain'd. And will they sit still and perish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is a <hi>sovereign</hi> Benefactor, that may do what he will with his own Benefits?</p>
            <p>I add to this, that God has given gracious <hi>Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> unto Sinners, to seek the renewing and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influences of his Blessed Spirit. <hi>He hath not said to the Seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi> How many Offers of Mercy are made in the Gospel, to every one without Difference, that are found <hi>watching at Christ's Gates, and waiting at the Posts of his Doors?</hi> If their own Attainments won't give them a <hi>Claim</hi> and Title to sanctifying Grace, they will yet put them in that <hi>Way</hi> in which alone it is to be had, and in which they are encouraged to hope, that <hi>their Labour will not be in vain.</hi>—They can't indeed <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> it, do what they can: but is it not as well to receive it of sovereign Mercy, as of Merit? They
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:004710_0176_0000000000000000"/>
can't claim it on Account of their own Performances: but is it not as well to receive it on Account of the Merits of the great Redeemer? They may be (and it is best they should be) afraid, <hi>left they fail of the Grace of God:</hi> But if they have a Heart to seek it in Earnest, to seek it upon the Terms proposed in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Gospel, and to persevere in thus seeking it, they may hope that God will for <hi>his own Name's</hi> Sake, though not for their Sake or for their Duties and Deservings, make good to them all the gracious Words of Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement given them in the Gospel. What then stands in the Way of their most active Industry; but the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Naughtiness of their Hearts?</hi>—Should condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Rebels stand upon Terms with their Prince, in Order to their Acceptance of his Pardon? Is it not enough that Pardon is to be hoped for upon their Petition, though they neither do nor can deserve it? If they'll refuse to seek it upon the gracious Offer, because they can't claim it as due to 'em, let Justice be done: They must receive the deserved Reward of their Rebellion and foolish Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. So if Sinners will rather make their Damnation sure, than seek and hope for Mercy at the Hand of God, upon such blessed Encouragement as is given them in the Gospel, they must e'en be left to their unhappy Choice; they must be left to repent their Madness when it is too late.</p>
            <p>It may be further objected against this Doctrine, <hi>That it takes from Man all</hi> Freedom <hi>of Will, and renders him a meer Machine, uncapable of all moral Good, even as if he were a Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e or a Beast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have said something to this Objection in a former Discourse; and endeavour'd to shew the Improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the Debates, with which the Church has
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:004710_0177_0000000000000000"/>
been harassed, about the Freedom or want of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the <hi>Will</hi> of Man. The Question ought not to be, Whether the Will be free? But whether the <hi>Man</hi> be free; and whether the present Doctrine does necessarily deny, even to <hi>unregenerate</hi> Men, full <hi>Freedom,</hi> in all their moral Conduct?—Having spoken so particularly to this Case before, I need not enlarge upon it now. I shall therefore only propose a few Queries to the Objector, which will (I think) be sufficient to illustrate the Case. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I inquire, whether an <hi>irreligious</hi> Life don't ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most <hi>desirable</hi> to an unsanctified Person; and whether he can refrain <hi>choosing</hi> such a Life, while it does appear so?—If it does not appear most desirable, why does he choose it? If it does appear most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable, how can he decline choosing it, until he has another and better View of Things? To choose what does not appear most desirable, or not to choose what does appear most desirable, is a Contradiction in Terms; and implies to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> at the same Time, and in the same Respect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I inquire, whether <hi>Freedom</hi> consists in acting <hi>contrary</hi> to our Inclinations; or in acting <hi>agreeable</hi> to 'em?—If Freedom consists in acting <hi>contrary</hi> to our Inclinations, then Freedom and Constraint are the same Thing: For no Man acts contrary to his Inclinations but by Constraint. If Freedom consists in acting <hi>agreeable</hi> to our Inclinations, then uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinners are in a State of Freedom; for they always act in their moral Conduct as they incline to act. If they have some transient Inclinations to a
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:004710_0178_0000000000000000"/>
better Conduct: yet the most powerful and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inclinations of their Minds are to do as they do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I inquire, whether it is possible that an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinner, while such, can <hi>comply</hi> with the <hi>Terms</hi> of Salvation, and yet remain in a State of <hi>Freedom?</hi>—Every unconverted Sinner is an <hi>Unbeliever;</hi> or in other Words, he is <hi>unwilling</hi> to accept of the Lord Jesus Christ upon Gospel-Terms. To be willing to accept of the Lord Jesus Christ upon his own Terms, is a true saving Faith: and can be affirmed of none but those who are savingly converted to God. If therefore an unsanctified Person does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Terms of Salvation, he does it against his Will: and where then is his Freedom? To act freely and unwillingly, at the same Time and in the same Respect, is the most glaring Contradiction; as was hinted before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I inquire, whether it is not consistent with the most absolute <hi>Freedom,</hi> to have such <hi>new Views</hi> of of Things, as <hi>change</hi> our Wills and Affections?—It's most evident, that a rational and free Agent must act according to his <hi>present View</hi> of Things. He must choose what appears most desirable to him; and his Freedom consists in Nothing else, but in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voluntarily, or according to his Inclinations. Whence it follows, that impenitent Sinners, while such, must necessarily pursue the Gratification of their Lusts: For these appear most desirable; and are therefore the Objects of their Choice.—But then on the contrary, when the Spirit of God gives them a new Prospect and a just Apprehension of Things, the same sinful and sensual Pursuits, that before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:004710_0179_0000000000000000"/>
most pleasant and delightful, do now appear most hateful and burthensome; the same Ways of Piety and Holiness, that were before their Aversation, are now become infinitely more desirable in their Eyes, than all the Pleasures of Sense. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must necessarily become the Objects of their Choice. And is there not in both Cases the greatest Freedom?—The <hi>Sinner</hi> acts most <hi>freely,</hi> in choosing what his darkned Understanding and vitiated Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites represent to him most worthy of his Choice. The <hi>Convert</hi> acts most <hi>freely,</hi> when his enlightned Understanding gives him a contrary View of Things; and represents the Objects of his former Detestation and Abhorrence, to be most worthy of his Desire and Delight. While on the other Hand, neither the one nor the other would exercise any <hi>Freedom</hi> at all, if they did not <hi>choose,</hi> as they do, what upon their present View of Things appears most desirable.—How vain therefore and frivolous is that Pretence, that the Sovereignty of God's efficacious Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes the Liberty of the Creature! How is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with human Liberty, for a Man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of a former Mistake, and induced by such a Conviction to a different Temper and Conduct! To have his Understanding enlightned to see Things, which he did not see before; to have new Views and Impressions of Objects; and to be assisted and enabled to act conformably thereto; that is, to act <hi>reasonably,</hi> and to shew himself <hi>a Man!</hi> It might be as justly pretended, that a liberal Education is inconsistent with Freedom, in that it gives new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to the enlightned Understanding; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently new Desires, Inclinations, and Delights.</p>

               <pb n="165" facs="unknown:004710_0180_0000000000000000"/>But I hasten to make some IMPROVEMENT of what has been said.—And here,</p>
            <p>USE 1. This teaches us the dreadful <hi>Danger</hi> of placing any <hi>Confidence</hi> or <hi>Dependance</hi> upon any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of <hi>our own,</hi> for Salvation.—<hi>By Grace are ye saved, thro' Faith; and that not of your selves, it is the Gift of God.</hi> What then will become of all those in the Day of Christ, who sew together the Fig-leaves of <hi>their own Righteousness,</hi> to cover their Nakedness; who instead of repairing to, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Riches of God's free Grace in Christ, are placing their Confidence upon something of their own, for Justification and Salvation? These will all be found with the <hi>Hypocrites Hope,</hi> when it comes to the decisive Trial.—If they can <hi>now</hi> quiet their Consciences, or raise their Hopes of Happiness, from any Qualifications in themselves; if they can <hi>now</hi> put such Glosses upon the plain Doctrines of Grace in the Gospel, as will gratify their proud self-righteous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: yet the Time approaches, when they will find (if they han't founded their Hope upon God's free sovereign Mercy and Love in the great Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) that they have <hi>built upon the Sand;</hi> and therefore that their Hopes must <hi>fall</hi> in the stormy Hour; and <hi>great will be the Fall thereof.</hi>—Certain it is, that there is not, there cannot be, any Danger at all in placing all our Hope and Confidence in the free unmerited Mercy of God in Christ. But on the contrary, the Appeal may be made to the most reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Opposers of this Doctrine, whether they ben't capable of a Mistake, in their Opinions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions on this most impotant Concern. Can they pretend to Infallibility? Are they certain that they
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:004710_0181_0000000000000000"/>
cannot be deceived, when so many, as great and as good Men as themselves, do (at least) imagine the greatest Certainty, that they both see and feel their fatal Delusion? And what will be the Consequence, if they are too late <hi>ashamed of their Hope?</hi> Is it not much safer to venture our Eternity upon a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that cannot disappoint us, than to run the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hazard of having <hi>a deceived Heart turn us aside,</hi> and of <hi>perishing with a Lie in our right Hand?</hi>—If I have any Knowledge of the Gospel of Christ, or any Acquaintance with the Method of divine Grace in the Conversion and Sanctification of Sinners, they who raise their Expectations of Happiness from any other Grounds than the Sovereignty of God's free Grace, as it has been described above, will find in the Conclusion, that they have <hi>compassed themselves about with Sparks of their own Kindling; and what they must receive at the Hands of God, will be, to lie down in Sorrow.</hi>—But with what inexpressible. Horrour and Confusion will these Hypocrites be filled, when they too late discover the Disappointment! How dreadful will the Mistake appear, when they find it remediless, when there will be no rectifying the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Error, no recovering the lost Soul, no more Seasons or Means of Grace left them, for the reforming their deluded Conduct! How terrible will their Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prove, when they find that their false Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are rejected, and have undone them to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!—To have our Hopes vanish and our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations cut off, in Things <hi>temporal</hi> (tho' many Times accompanied with Circumstances dismal enough) is but light and trivial, compared to an <hi>eternal</hi> Disappointment. Who can imagine the Dreadfulness of being miserable for EVER and
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:004710_0182_0000000000000000"/>

And yet this, I fear, is the Case of too many, who live under Gospel-Light.—They either flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their <hi>negative</hi> Holiness, that they are not Drunkards, not Swearers, Couzeners, openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, or the like; and thence boast with the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,</hi> Luk xviii. 11.) <hi>God, I thank thee that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers; or even as this Publican.</hi>—Or else, they raise their Expectations of Happiness upon their outward <hi>positive</hi> Conformity to the moral Law; vaunting with the <hi>young Man</hi> in the Gospel (Mat. xix. 20.) <hi>All these Things have I kept from my Youth up: </hi> Or satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with <hi>Saul</hi> (before his Conversion) that they are <hi>touching the Righteousness which is in the Law, blameless.</hi> Phil. 3. 6.—But is this all our Plea for eternal Safety? How then is our Case better than that of the moral <hi>Heathen?

Christ is become of none Effect unto us, whosoever of us are justify'd by the Law.</hi> We <hi>frustrate the Grace of God, by going about to establish our own Righteousness.</hi> What Occasion was there for the dear Purchase of our Redemption by the Blood of Christ, what Occasion for the Gospel of Salvation, if our Morality will intitle us to the heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance? Will our imperfect Obedience to the Law attone for our original Guilt, and our multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actual Sins? Will it pacify God's Displeasure;s

free us from the Curse of the broken Law; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase eternal Salvation for us? No surely. <hi>By the Deeds of the Law shall no Flesh be justified in his Sight,</hi> Rom. iii. 23. <hi>But as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse.</hi> Gal. iii. 10. Tho' good Works are what God requires; and are on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count pleasing in his Sight: yet they are not the Price of our Salvation, "The Opinion of Merit changes their Nature; and turns Gold into Dross." Our Dependence is upon Divine Grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not at all upon our moral Attainments. <hi>For if it be by Grace, it is no more of Works; otherwise Grace is no more Grace.</hi> Rom. xi. 6. Tho' it be true, that no Man can be saved <hi>without</hi> Morality; that being a necessary Qualification of a real Christian, and a necessary Fruit of justifying Faith; it is also true, that no Man can be saved <hi>by</hi> his Morality: for our imperfect Obedience must not be placed in Christ's Stead; nor rob him of the Honour of his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy. We must not expect to purchase the eternal Inheritance, with a Price that is less than Nothing; nor hope for Heaven on Account of our Obedience, when it has Sin enough cleaving to it, to condemn both that and us. Whoever are so mad as to venture their Souls upon this treacherous Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, will certainly sink into the Ocean of eternal Misery.</p>
            <p>How dangerous also is the Case of those, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their external Performances in <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> as what will give them a Claim to eternal Life? I have spoken something particularly to this before; and shall only add, That altho' Duty is indeed the prescribed Way of entring into Life; and if ever we obtain Salvation, we must
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:004710_0184_0000000000000000"/>
seek it diligently in this Way: yet our best Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances won't bring God in Debt to us; nor lay him under any Obligation to shew us Favour.—They who attend Duty, do well: but they who <hi>depend</hi> upon what they do, are among <hi>the Proud in in heart, whom God abhors,</hi> and dooms <hi>to Destruction.</hi> If we don't bring our Persons and Services to the Footstool of divine Grace for Acceptance, thro' the Merits of the Mediator's Atonement, they will both be found as an <hi>unclean Thing,</hi> in the Day of Christ's Appearance.—Then we may plead, that <hi>we have eat and drank in Christ's Presence; and that he has taught in our Streets;</hi> that we have pray'd in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Closets, read and meditated in his Word, attended publick Ordinances, and the like; and yet be the Subjects of that terrible Sentence, <hi>I tell you, I know you not whence you are, depart from me, all ye Workers of Iniquity.</hi> Luke xiii. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>In a Word, How dangerous is the Case of those who depend for Salvation upon transient <hi>Affections, Convictions,</hi> or other <hi>inward</hi> Experiences, consistent with reigning Hypocrisy and Unbelief.—Alas! we may have a Sense of the infinite Defect of all our moral Attainments, and of all our religious Duties; and yet <hi>sacrifice to our own Net, and burn incense to our own Drag:</hi> So consequently have all our Hopes end in Disappointment and Confusion.—Such will be our Case, if we depend upon our <hi>Convictions</hi> and Apprehensions of our Guilt and Danger.

The greatest Degrees of Grief under a Sense of our Sin and Guilt, will prove but the Earnests and Foretastes of eternal Horror; unless it brings the Soul to the Blood of Christ for Pardon, and ends in a Renovation of our Nature, a Change both of Heart and Life.</p>

            <p>THE glorious Transaction of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jesus Christ, is the just Surprize and Wonder of the reasonable Creation. <hi>The Angels desire to look into these Things;</hi> and Man who is immediately interested herein, has especial Reason to adore the amazing Love, that shines with such Lustre in his Deliverance from Death and Hell.—And what brightens the Glory of this stupendous Work, and gives us Occasion of the highest Exercise of Gratitude, is the infinite Price, by which our Salvation is purchased. For thus faith
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:004710_0193_0000000000000000"/>
the Scripture, <hi>We are redeemed, not by corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without Blemish and without Spot. And God hath purchased his Church with his own Blood.</hi> Thus the Price of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance bears Proportion to the Degree of our Misery and Guilt. When these were so aggravated, that all the Angels in Heaven were insufficient for our Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue; when no created Wisdom could invent an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Expedient, when no created Power was equal to the vast Design; God our Saviour <hi>looked, and there was none to help; and wondred, that there was none to uphold;</hi> He therefore himself interposed, and <hi>his own Arm brought Salvation.</hi> According to the Appointment of God the Father, our Lord-Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has undertaken to be a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us, that thro' <hi>Faith</hi> in the Merits of his Blood, we may be interested in his Righteousness, and obtain the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our Sins;</hi> as we are instructed in the Words of our Text.</p>
            <p>In which we may note the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Observe the <hi>Person</hi> here spoken of, represented by the Relative, <hi>Whom;</hi> which leads us to the last Words of the foregoing Verse; <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> WHOM <hi>God hath set forth to be a Propitiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We may observe the <hi>Character</hi> here attributed to this Person, that is, a <hi>Propitiation</hi> or Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>greek</hi> Word here rendred <hi>Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is very emphatical; and signifies one Person's being substituted in the Room and Place of another, to bear his Guilt, or to discharge his Debt; and thereby to make <hi>Atonement</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction</hi> on his Account. By which is exhibited to us, how the
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:004710_0194_0000000000000000"/>
Lord Jesus Christ undertook to <hi>become a Curse for us,</hi> to <hi>bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</hi> that he might thereby expiate our Guilt, pacify offended Justice, and reconcile us to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are here shewn the <hi>Divine Appointment</hi> of this glorious Person to be a Propitiation for us. <hi>Whom</hi> GOD <hi>hath set forth,</hi> proposed or ordain'd. This merciful Provision of God for our Recovery from Ruin by the Atonement of Christ, is the Fruit and Consequence of the eternal Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, or <hi>Counsel of Peace between them both.</hi>—God the Father, as the first in Order in the blessed Trinity, is represented as <hi>proposing</hi> or <hi>appointing;</hi> and God the Son as <hi>undertaking</hi> this glorious Work. Whereby is not only shewn, how the Operations of this blessed <hi>Three in One,</hi> do follow the Order of their Personality, but also how God the Father, as sustaining the Character of <hi>Supreme</hi> in the OEcono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Redemption, demands Satisfaction to offended Justice, and has allotted this Way of obtaining it, by Christ's being a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us, that in this Way <hi>he might be just, and yet the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is pointed out to us the <hi>Means</hi> or <hi>Method</hi> of our getting actually <hi>interested</hi> in this Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Through Faith in his Blood.</hi> It is through a believing Acceptance of, and Dependance upon the Death and Sacrifice of the Redeemer, that we are to partake of the Benefits of his Atonement.—His Satisfaction is <hi>sufficient</hi> for all; but actually <hi>applied</hi> and effectual to none but the <hi>Believer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We may note the blessed <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Consequence</hi> of an Interest in this Propitiation of Christ: <hi>The Remission of Sins, that are past, thro' the Forbearance
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:004710_0195_0000000000000000"/>
of God.</hi> All the Sins committed before Justification, while God so patiently exercised his forbearing Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the guilty Sinner, are fully remitted and for ever done away, through the Merits of this Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the first Exercise of a true Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, insomuch that the Sinner is at once reconciled to God, and instated in his Favour.</p>
            <p>But there are three Things here, that more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally demand our Attention, and which I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour more distinctly to consider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What's imply'd in our Lord Jesus Christ's being a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What we are to understand by that <hi>Faith</hi> in him, by Means of which we are interested in this <hi>Propitiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, How</hi> Faith in Christ <hi>operates</hi> or <hi>influences</hi> to bring about our <hi>Remission</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> in the Sight of God.—As to the <hi>Nature of Justification,</hi> I shall have Occasion to consider that in my next Discourse; and therefore pass it at present.</p>
            <p>Here,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Then I'm to shew what's imply'd in Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a</hi> Propitiation <hi>for us.</hi>—And that I may illustrate this in the most familiar and perspicuous Manner I am capable of, I shall endeavour to be something particular and progressive in my Attempts to explain it.</p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This implies or rather presupposes the</hi> guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>State of apostate Man; and our utter Inability to
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:004710_0196_0000000000000000"/>
recover ourselves.</hi>—The Apostacy of <hi>Adam,</hi> I mean the Guilt thereby contracted, was by a just Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion transmitted to all his natural Posterity; So that <hi>we are all become guilty before God.</hi> And the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Pollution, contracted by the Apostacy, being also propagated to the miserable Progeny of a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Rebel, hence all our Affections and Passions are corrupted and defiled; and our Conversations being Streams from this polluted Fountain, are become ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and sinful; whereby we have lost the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and are the Objects of his righteous Displeasure.—This is plainly the Case of the whole World of Mankind, while in a State of Nature.—This fatal Fruit of the Fall does indeed seem one of the darkest Dispensations of Providence; and is what carnal Reason is exceeding apt to cavil at. But, I think, I have given such Answers to the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made against it, in my Discourse on this Subject, as may justly quiet our Minds, and silence all our Opposition.</p>
            <p>This then being our distressed Case, whither could we flee for Help? It's evident to every one's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that we cannot come up to that unspotted Obedience, which God has the justest Claim to from a rational Creature; that our best Duties and most careful Observances of the Law of Nature, are sadly defiled with Sin; that we have vitious Habits and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, which we cannot conquer; and that <hi>our carnal Minds are Enmity against God, are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God; nor indeed can be.</hi> Whence it's certain, we are so far from being capable of atoning for our Apostacy, that we are utterly unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to live up to the Law of Nature, had that Breach been made up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="unknown:004710_0197_0000000000000000"/>If any will suppose, that our <hi>Repentance</hi> would have been sufficient to have appeased the divine Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, without any other Satisfaction: I would ask them, how they can be certain of this? I would desire them to shew, what necessary <hi>Connection</hi> there is between the Sorrow of guilty Rebels for their Sins, and the Favour of an offended God, without a Satisfaction or Atonement?—And I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether they have this good News for the fallen <hi>Angels?</hi> It would be such glad Tidings, that I dare say, they have never heard since their first Apostacy.—But were even this supposed, still I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, How that would afford any Relief in our Case? For We are naturally uncapable of a true Repentance, by any Power of our own, as much as of making a strict and adequate Atonement. We are too much in love with Sin, to loath and abhor it, as of our selves. The Habits of Sin too intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to our Souls, to be wholly subdued and forsaken, by any Attempts or Resolutions of ours. And can we please God with a partial and unsincere Repentance, which is all we can pretend to? Can God he <hi>deceived;</hi> or will he be <hi>mocked?</hi> No surely! We can neither discharge the Debt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy contracted; nor avoid running further into Debt every Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This also implies or presupposes, that divine Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice demanded</hi> Satisfaction <hi>for our Offences, in Order to our Reconciliation unto God.</hi>—I shall not undertake to determine, whether the Punishment of Sin be indispensably necessary from the Nature of God; and naturally results from his essential Righteousness and Purity, absolutely consider'd. It is indeed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:004710_0198_0000000000000000"/>
that Holiness and Justice are essential Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in God; <hi>that he is of purer Eyes, than to behold Iniquity;</hi> and that "his Justice being infinite, it must be inflexible." But, Mankind not. having ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Ideas of these Divine Perfections, we may err in our Reasonings and Deductions from them.—However, I think we may safely affirm, that God's requiring Satisfaction for Sin, is <hi>agreeable</hi> to his rectoral Holiness and governing Justice; and that as he is the supream Judge and Governor of the World, he justly requires Sin should be punished; That by this he may illustrate and vindicate his own Holiness, and convince the World, that the <hi>righteous Lord loveth Righteousness;</hi> and that <hi>the Wicked his Soul hateth.</hi> (Psal. xi. 5, 7.) That by this he may testify his Adherence to his own Laws; and let the World see, <hi>that Heaven and Earth shall sooner pass away, than one Jot or Tittle shall pass from them.</hi> (Mat. v. 18.) That by this he may discover the Value he puts upon the Obedience of his Creatures; and shew that their <hi>Observance of his Law is not a vain Thing for them, because it is their Life.</hi> (Deut. xxxii. 47.) And that by this he may assert his own Sovereignty; and the World may see, that <hi>verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth.</hi> (Psal. lviii. 11.) I might add, by this he also brandishes a flaming Sword against the Impiety of future Transgressors; and discovers, that to <hi>him belongeth Vengeance and Recompence.</hi> (Deut. xxxii. 35.)—The <hi>Truth</hi> of God does certainly make Satisfaction for Sin neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. He threatned Death as the Consequence of the Fall. (<hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17.) And his Word is immutable like his infinite Nature. Hath he said it, and will he not do it? What he has spoken, he is able also
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:004710_0199_0000000000000000"/>
to perform; and being the God of Truth, will he not bring it to pass?—In a Word, God's actually requiring Satisfaction for Sin, is a Fact abundantly confirm'd in the Scriptures; and therefore cannot but be own'd a Reality. Among the Multitudes of Scriptures, that might be cited in this Case, you may consider these that follow. Exod. xxxiv. 7. <hi>That will by no Means clear the guilty.</hi> Josh. xxvi. 19. <hi>He is an holy God, he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your Transgressions nor your Sins.</hi> Rom. iii. 5, 6. <hi>Is God unrighteous, who taketh Vengeance?

Rom. iii. 26. <hi>To declare at this Time his Righteousness, that he might be just, and the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</hi> Which shews, that the Satisfaction of Christ was requisite, in Order to God's being just, in the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Sinners; and that it would not have been agreeable to his Justice, to have saved them without Satisfaction. Rom. vi. 23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> This is so, both from the Justice and Law of God.</p>

to the Mediator; &amp; accordingly as <hi>sending</hi> him to undertake our Salvation. Thus, <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 16, 17. <q>For God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish; but have everlasting Life. For God sent not his Son into the World, to condemn the World: but that the World thro' him might be saved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. For what the Law could not do in that it was weak thro' the Flesh, God (sending his own Son in the Likeness of sinful Flesh and for SIN.) condemned Sin in the Flesh; that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 21. For he hath made him to be SIN for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 9, 10. In this was manifested the Love of God towards us; because that God sent his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Son into the World, that we might live thro' him. Herein is Love, not that we loved God: but that he loved us; and sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</q>—The Scriptures also represent the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily <hi>consenting</hi> to undertake this great Work; unto which he could be liable to no Constraint. <hi>Mark</hi> x. 45. <q>For even the Son of Man came not to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred unto: but to minister; and to give his Life a Ransom for many. <hi>Joh.</hi> x. 17, 18. I lay down my Life, that I might take it again. No Man taketh it from me; but I lay it down of my self: I have Power to lay it down; and I have Power to take it again. <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 14. Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for us, that he might redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 7. Then said I, Lo I come (in the Volume of the Book it is written of me) to do thy
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:004710_0201_0000000000000000"/>
Will, O God.</q>—The Scriptures do moreover set forth the Redeemer, in the Quality of our <hi>Surety</hi> and <hi>Representative,</hi> in this wonderful Transaction. <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 22. <q>By so much, was Jesus made a Surety of a better Testament. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 24. Who his own self bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, that we being dead to Sin, might live unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; by whose Stripes ye were healed. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 18. For Christ also hath once suffered for Sins, the Just for the Unjust (that he might bring us to God) being put to Death in the Flesh; but quickned in the Spirit.</q> In which Texts, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Lord Jesus Christ in our Room and Stead, is clearly and strongly expressed, in his <hi>bearing our Sins;</hi> and <hi>suffering for us;</hi> and the like Expressions are very numerous throughout the New-Testament.—I will only add, that the Scriptures represent the Sufferings of Christ, and his Obedience unto the Death, as a proper <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Atonement</hi> for us, and as the Purchase of our Redemption. <hi>Isai.</hi> liii. 10. <q>When thou shalt make his Soul an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin, he shall see his Seed. <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 2. And walk in Love, as Christ also hath loved us; and given himself for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling Savour. <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 17. That he might be a merciful and faithful High-Priest, in Things pertaining to God, to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the Sins of the People.</q> See also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 14. with many other Passages to the same Purpose, which frequently occur in the sacred Pages.—Let Men therefore strain their Wits as much as they can, to put false Glosses upon these and such like Texts of Scripture, there is nothing more certain, than that the proper <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:004710_0202_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Atonement</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ for the Sins of the World, is in the strongest, most plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Terms, repeatedly asserted in the Word of God. If we have any Regard at all to the Way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proposed in the Gospel, we must expect Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' the alone Merits of his Life and Death; and depend upon him as our <hi>Ransom,</hi> as the <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our Sins,</hi> and the <hi>Lord our Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'm aware, that there are some <hi>Difficulties</hi> in the Way of this Doctrine, which the carnal Mind is ready to stumble at.—It is an Objection against this; <hi>That it is not</hi> just, <hi>to accept of and punish the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent instead of the Guilty.</hi>—To which I answer,</p>
            <p>It must be granted, that in <hi>human</hi> Judicatures this would be most unjust, thus to transfer <hi>capital</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment; because no Man has Power to dispose of his own Life at pleasure, nor Power to give his Life for another, be sure, not the Just for the Unjust: Neither hath the civil Magistrate Power thus to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a good Man for a bad, tho' even with his own Consent; because it would be highly injurious to the Community, to cut off the innocent and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Member, and to spare the guilty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>minal, as a Pest and Nusance to Society.—But these Reasons don't affect the Case now before us. Our Redeemer had <hi>Power to lay down his Life; and Power to take it up again.</hi>—As he was the Lord from Heaven, he had the absolute Property and Disposal of his own Life. And he has <hi>declared himself the Son of God with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by his Resurrection from the Dead.</hi> And instead of this being injurious to the Community, it has bro't most glorious Advantages to us, both with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:004710_0203_0000000000000000"/>
to the present and the future World.—I may add to this, that our blessed Saviour did not <hi>finally</hi> perish; as a Substitute must do, in capital Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among Men. No; he underwent but a short temporary Death, and received his Life again, with greatest Advantage. From whence it appears, that those Objections, which would be just in other Cases, can have no Place here. The Character and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Substitute, and the absolute Sovereignty of the sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>am Judge, render the Case exempt from all the Rules of human Judicatures,—It is true indeed, that the Justice of God could not have demanded Satisfaction from the Redeemer, if he had not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily made himself responsible for us: but Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more absolute and sovereign Disposal of his own Life, than any Man can have of his Estate, he might as freely offer it, and God the Father as justly accept it, in Satisfaction for our Sins, as any Man can be accepted as Surety for another Man's Debt.</p>
            <p>It may also be objected; <hi>That this seems deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the</hi> Goodness <hi>of God, to have penal Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction lead the Way to the Exercise of Mercy; and that this represents the divine Being too like to the most merciless of human Creatures, who have such an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to Revenge, as cannot be satisfied without Blood: Whereas it would seem more agreeable to infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to pardon freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, The Mistake lies in the Objector; and he only (I think) has Unworthy Notions of God. To imagine the Death of Christ flow'd from an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Appetite to Vengeance, is indeed to measure the divine Perfections by our depraved Lusts and
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:004710_0204_0000000000000000"/>
Passions. But to suppose, that God's Demand of Satisfaction arises from (or at least is consonant to) the infinite Purity of his Nature, whereby he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look upon Sin with Approbation; but testifies his Abhorrence of it to all the rational World: To suppose, that the righteous Governour of the World should inflict Punishments, as well as bestow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, according to the Rectitude and Equity of his own glorious Nature: To suppose, that this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lawgiver should insist upon maintaining the Honour of his own Laws, whereby he has determin'd to govern the World; This is not to entertain Tho'ts in any Respect unworthy of infinite Grace and Goodness. The Goodness of God does hereby shine in its brightest Lustre, that he is willing to save poor guilty Rebels at such an infinite Expence; and that in such an admirable Method, <hi>Mercy and Truth meet together, Righteousness and Peace kiss each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Christ's being a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us does also imply, that <hi>God did</hi> accept <hi>of the passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ (together with his active) as sufficient Satisfaction to the Demands of Justice.</hi> Jesus Christ hath <q>made Reconciliation for the Sins of the People. <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 17. <hi>And</hi> he has reconciled the World to God, that their Trespasses are not imputed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 18, 19. <hi>Thus</hi> Peace is made with God, <hi>and we</hi> reconciled to him by his Cross, the Enmity being slain. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 15, 16.</q> So that the Imputation of the Obedience of Christ, does fully and perfectly acquit the Believer from the Guilt of Sin, the Empire of Satan, the Curses of the Law, and the Damnation of Hell. God has received Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:004710_0205_0000000000000000"/>
from the Surety; and therefore will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand no more from the principal Debtor.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly consider'd what is imply'd in Christ's being a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to confirm each particular, by full and clear Testimonies from the Word of God. From this View of the Case, it appears to me as reasonable, to call the whole of divine Revelation into Question, as to doubt of this great Article, Christ's having made a proper <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Atonement</hi> by his Blood, for the Sins of his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now of the Things which I have spoken, this is the Sum.</hi> That by our first Apostacy we have violated the fundamental Laws of Nature, have been Traitors and Rebels to the Sovereign of the World, have plunged ourselves into Guilt, debased and polluted all the noble Faculties of our Souls; and separated between our God and us; whereby we are not only become guilty, but impotent and helpless.—That the supreme Governour of the World, willing to assert the infinite Purity and Holiness of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his eternal and immutable Antipathy to Sin and Sinners, has testified the Value he puts upon his righteous Laws, and upon the Observance of them; has vindicated his sovereign Dominion, and the Truth of his Threatnings; and has set before the rational World the dreadful Consequences of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against him; by insisting upon a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to his offended Justice.—That when we were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncapable to make <hi>Atonement,</hi> by any Thing less than eternal Sufferings, the great God, as supreme Judge and Arbiter of his own Laws and Affairs of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:004710_0206_0000000000000000"/>
Government, was pleased of his infinite Goodness and Compassion, so far to relax the Threatning, as in our Stead to accept of a Surety, in the Person of his dear Son; who was with his own voluntary Consent appointed by the Father to work out our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by taking upon him our Sin and Guilt, bearing our Punishment, and fulfilling the Law for us, and thereby purchasing our Acquittance from Death and Hell, and Recovery to Life and Happiness. The blessed Fruit of his Mediation is, That <hi>there is no Condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus;</hi> but <hi>whose hath the Son, hath Life, Life everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I'm prepar'd to take Notice, in what Way we may hope for the Benefits of this Redemption; which brings me to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>What we are to understand by that</hi> Faith <hi>in Christ, through which we have an Interest in this Propitiation.</hi> And it may be proper to take Notice, that a saving <hi>Faith</hi> is variously described in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is sometimes described, as an <hi>Assent</hi> of the Mind to the <hi>Gospel-Rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lation</hi> of Christ. Thus, <hi>Mark</hi> i. 15. <q>Repent ye; and believe the Gospel: <hi>So,</hi> 1 John v. 1. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. <hi>And, Rom.</hi> x. 9. If thou shalt confess with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus; and shalt believe in thine Heart that God hath raised him from the Dead, thou shalt be saved.</q> In these and many other like Passages of Scripture, a saving <hi>Faith</hi> is proposed as an Act of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as an Assent unto, or Belief of the Truth of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="192" facs="unknown:004710_0207_0000000000000000"/>2. <hi>Faith</hi> is sometimes described in Scripture, as a <hi>Consent</hi> of the Will to the <hi>Gospel-Offer</hi> of Salvation by Christ. Thus, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 12. <q>To as many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God; even to them that believe on his Name. <hi>And, Joh.</hi> vi. 35. He that cometh unto me, shall never hunger; and he that believeth in me, shall never thirst. <hi>So, Col.</hi> ii. 6. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.—</q> In which Texts we find, that receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ, and believing on his Name, and coming to him, and believing in him, are Terms of the same Significancy: and all of these Expressions imply a Willingness to obtain the Salvation by Christ, upon his own Terms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faith is also described in Scripture, as a <hi>considing</hi> in, and <hi>depending</hi> upon the Lord Jesus Christ for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Thus, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 12. <q>That we should be to the Praise of his Glory, who first trusted in Christ. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 9. And be found in him, not having mine own Righteousness which is of the Law: but that which is thro' the Faith of Christ, the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is of God by Faith. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 12. For I know whom I have believed; and am persuaded, that he is able to keep that which I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, against that Day.</q> In which Texts, <hi>Faith</hi> is consider'd as our trusting in Christ, hoping to be found in him, relying upon his Righteousness, and committing our Souls to him.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that <hi>Faith</hi> is sometimes described by one of its essential Properties, and sometimes by another: but we must always remember, that when it is described by one of these Properties, the other two are not excluded, but included; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:004710_0208_0000000000000000"/>
each of these Descriptions, if duly consider'd, will amount to the same Thing.</p>
            <p>If we (for Example) consider Faith as an <hi>Assent</hi> to the Gospel-Revelation concerning Christ (which by the Way, is the primary Signification of the Word <hi>Faith</hi>) it will necessarily include in it a <hi>Consent</hi> to what we believe; and an <hi>Affiance</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n him, on whom we believe. For this Assent, or <hi>Belief of the Truth,</hi> must be supposed such a strong and thorow Persuasion as will have a proper and effectual Influence upon our Minds. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> doctrinal Belief, or speculative Opinion can't be recommended in Scripture as a saving <hi>Faith.</hi> And this being supposed, that we have a firm realizing Belief, and a lively Impression, that Christ is the Saviour of the World, that his Righteousness imputed to us is the only Ground of our Justification, that without this we must inevitably perish, and that he is both able and willing to save us; it will necessarily excite in us earnest Desires after an Interest in him, after Union and Communion with Him, and bring us to place our Hope and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Him only for Salvation.—We may have (as most of the professing World have) a disciplinary or notional Belief of the Truth of the Gospel, that will produce no proper Effect upon our Souls; but will leave us, against the Conviction of Conscience, to neglect an offered Saviour, indulge our Lusts, and perish in them. But tho' such a <hi>dead Faith</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us Nothing, yet we cannot but esteem the Lord Jesus Christ to be precious, we cannot but choose him for our Portion, and depend upon him to do all in us and for us, if we have <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>clear Impressions</hi> of the Truth of what the Gospel reports
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:004710_0209_0000000000000000"/>
concerning him. Tho' a careless indifferent or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steady Assent unto the Gospel-Revelation, will not bring us off from our Lusts and sinful Pleasures, from our own Righteousness and Self-Sufficiency, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ and depend upon him: Yet a full realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearty Assent to this, will bring us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Offers of the Gospel, and to place our Confidence in the only Object of our Hope. Thus we see, that this first Description of Faith includes the other two; and if we distinctly consider them also, we shall find the same Conclusion.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Consent</hi> (for Instance) to the Offers of Christ and his Salvation in the Gospel, necessarily implies an <hi>Assent</hi> to the Truth of the Gospel. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that we shou'd with our Wills concur to any Proposal, that our Understandings are not convinc'd of the Truth of. It implies also a <hi>Dependance</hi> upon Christ for Salvation. For it is impossible to consent to receive Christ for our Saviour; and not depend upon him as such.</p>
            <p>The same Thing may be also observ'd, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Trusting</hi> in Christ, the last Description of Faith. For we can't depend upon Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in him, unless we assent to the Gospel-Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consent to accept him as our Saviour.—Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, these several Descriptions of Faith do mutually imply and involve each other; and all of them do always belong to the Essence of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith. Which makes Way for this general Description:—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith in Christ is such an Assent to the christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, as brings us heartily and fully to receive him as
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:004710_0210_0000000000000000"/>
he is therein exhibited to us, and to depend on him only for Salvation upon Gospel-Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here let it be distinctly observ'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> in Jesus Christ necessarily implies an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to the <hi>Gospel-Revelation.</hi>—I'm not now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how far God may discover his Salvation to the <hi>heathen</hi> World, who are Strangers to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. As on the one Hand, I would not limit the holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi> who may (for ought I know) <hi>reveal his Son,</hi> in an extraordinary Manner, to some that never heard of the Gospel; so on the other Hand, I would leave <hi>secret Things</hi> to God, unto whom they belong. The Business now before me is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a saving Faith, as it relates to us, who dwell under Gospel-Light, and are arrived to an Age of Consideration and Observation. And in that View of the Case, a hearty Assent to the Truths reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gospel, is certainly essential to a true <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ.</p>
            <p>Unto this Assent it is necessary, that we have a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Doctrines of the Gospel; and of the Way of Salvation therein proposed. <hi>How shall they call upon him, in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Rom. x. 14. <hi>Faith</hi> always follows the Understanding; and cannot go before it. It's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to believe, strictly and properly, what we don't in some Respect understand. We may indeed, in the general, believe That to be Truth, the special Nature of which we neither understand, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. We may (for Instance) believe the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to be an undoubted Truth; though
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:004710_0211_0000000000000000"/>
we can neither understand, nor believe the particular <hi>Modus,</hi> or Manner how the divine Being is one in three, and three in one. In such Cases, we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no more than what our Understanding repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to us, from the Word of God, as reasonable and credible.—This being apply'd to the present Case, makes it evident, that they who remain grosly ignorant of the Doctrine of Christ, and the Method of Salvation proposed in the Gospel, cannot concur in it, nor comply with it. Ignorance here slays Men in the dark; and makes them uncapable of any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by an offered Saviour. We must therefore first know all that's really necessary to be believed. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Account Knowledge is sometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture put for Faith. Thus, <hi>Joh.</hi> xvii. 3. <hi>This is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> And 1 Cor. ii. 2. <hi>For I determined not to know any Thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified.</hi> Tho' Men may be capable of <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Brightness of Parts, or eminent Degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, either in polemical or systematical Divinity, as it is called: Yet it's needful, that they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the principal Doctrines of Christianity, (such as relate to the one only Mediator, Jesus Christ, his Person, Offices, and Benefits, his Incarnation, Life, Sufferings and Death, his Resurrection, Ascension, and Intercession; and such as relate to their own lost Estate, and necessary Dependance upon his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Grace for Justification and Life) in Order to their believing in Christ.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is also needful, that we heartily <hi>receive</hi> this Revelation for <hi>divine Truth,</hi> when we do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:004710_0212_0000000000000000"/>
it. It is necessary, that <hi>we receive it not as the Word of Man; but (as it is in Truth) the Word of God,</hi> in Order that it should <hi>effectually work</hi> in us, as <hi>in them that believe.</hi> 1 Thess. ii. 13.—It is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to believe this from the Bias of <hi>Education,</hi> or because we have been early and all along taught these Doctrines. Alas, We should have been likely to have had the same <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if we had been as early and constantly instructed in the <hi>Alcoran</hi>—It is not sufficient to have an <hi>implicit</hi> Belief of these Truths, to take them upon Trust from any Man or Society of Men whatsoever; this is to depend upon other Men's <hi>Faith,</hi> and have none of our own.—It is not sufficient <hi>inconsiderately</hi> to take these Things for granted, without making particular and due Inquiry; this may possibly amount to <hi>Opinion,</hi> but not to <hi>Faith.</hi>—Nor is it sufficient to give a <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Assent to the Gospel, though founded upon the best Evidence, and most rational Argumentation: For this won't effectually convince us of our abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Necessity of Christ, nor of his Sufficiency to supply all our Wants.—But we must <hi>receive the Testimony of God concerning his Son;</hi> and assent to the Gospel-Report as the Truth of God, as that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our eternal Welfare depends, and as that which we are above all Things in the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about.—If it be <hi>objected,</hi> That this will yet fall short of true <hi>Faith;</hi> that the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves give as firm an Assent to the Truth of the Gospel as we can do, <hi>They believe and tremble:</hi> I grant, that a bare Assent to the Gospel, separately consider'd, if never so steady and strong and rational, is not a sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Faith;</hi> but yet it is always an essential <hi>Part</hi> of

it: though <hi>Faith</hi> (as I before observ'd) has more imply'd in it. Which brings me to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a saving <hi>Faith</hi> does also imply <hi>a Receiving</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ, as <hi>offered in the Gospel.</hi> This (as I shewed before) is given as a Description of Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 12. By which we are to understand, a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Desire of an Interest in Christ; and a sincere Willingness to comply with the Offers, he makes of himself and his saving Benefits, upon Gospel-Terms.</p>
            <p>This necessarily supposes, that we have an <hi>impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sense of our Necessity of an Interest in Christ.</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are but hardly brought to embrace an offered Saviour. The most of the World are quiet and secure in a State of Guilt, without any just Apprehension of their Danger; and without any serious Concern about the Welfare of their immortal Souls. These go their Way <hi>to their Farms and Merchandise;</hi> and excuse themselves from coming to Christ: They have something else to do.—And as to others, that are under same Conviction of their Sin and Danger, they are ready to fly to any other Refuge, than the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, and to quiet their Consciences with their good Purposes or Performances: Until they are brought to see, that <hi>in vain is Salvation hoped for, from the Hills and from the Multitude of Mountains;</hi> that they have no where to go for Salvation, but to Christ alone, <hi>for he</hi> and he only <hi>hath the Words of eternal Life.</hi> These two Things are essentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a true Faith in Christ; a lively Sense of our own Emptiness, and Inability to help our selves, and a like Sense of the Sufficiency of Christ to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us. By the former, we discover the last Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:004710_0214_0000000000000000"/>
of some Remedy, beyond what we can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly provide for our distressed Souls: By the latter, the only Door of Hope is set open to us: and by both, we are made willing to comply with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Proposals of Life and Peace in the Gospel, and submit to the Terms whereon they are offered.—While Sinners can think themselves <hi>rich and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Goods, and that they have Need of Nothing,</hi> they will set no special Value by an offered Saviour. They must see themselves <hi>wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</hi> before they will repair to him, for <hi>Gold tried in the Fire, that they may be rich; for white Raiment, that they may be cloathed; and for Eye-Salve, that they may see.</hi> And this is the great Reason of the Unsuccesfulness of Gospel-Ordinances, and of the Unpersuadableness of the greatest Part of the World to come unto Christ, that they might have Life. They are insensible of their undone mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable State while at a Distance from him: <hi>The Whole need not the Physician, but they that are sick.</hi> They can rest quiet in their present Attainments; and will therefore look no further. They'll never come to <hi>Christ,</hi> till they are first brought to utterly despair of all Help in <hi>themselves.</hi>—And when they are even brought to this, it will have no better Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than to fill them with Horror and Amazement, unless they have also a Discovery that there is Help to be had: that there is Hope for their Souls, from the Sufficiency of redeeming Love.—But when they have both these Discoveries, they can't but see their Necessity of Christ; and whatever else they want, they cannot but be willing to receive him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Terms.</p>

But this is only a <hi>legal</hi> Work: If they rest here, they'll never be interested in Christ and his saving Benefits. A true evangelical <hi>Faith</hi> excites an earnest Desire of Salvation from the Power and Pollution of Sin, as well as from Guilt and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The Believer desires Christ to <hi>save him from his Sins,</hi> and not <hi>in</hi> them; he desires that Christ may reign in his Heart, and that his whole Man, in all its Powers, may be subjected to him.—There is no Man willing to perish; <hi>Destruction from God</hi> would be a <hi>Terror</hi> to the worst of Men, it realized: and since they know that there is no Way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but by Christ, they desire by him a Salvation from <hi>Hell;</hi> yet however, it is with a Reservation of their Lasts and sinful Pleasures, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not part with.—But this is very far short of a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine saving <hi>Faith,</hi> which receives a <hi>whole Christ,</hi> with our <hi>whole Heart;</hi> Christ in all his Offices, as well as with all his Benefits; the Grace of Christ for our Sanctification, as well as his Righteousness for our Justification. As a true Penitent looks upon his Sins as his greatest Burthen, and groans after Deliverance from the Pollution and Dominion of them: So the true Believer values an Interest in Christ upon this Account, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

with him. In this Way we must seek an Interest in Christ. In this Way we must seek Grace to receive the Lord Jesus Christ; and in this Way we must exercise that Grace, when we have obtain'd it. If we be Partakers of Christ at all, it must be by an active Reception; by a <hi>Faith</hi> accompanied with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest diligent seeking him in the Ways of God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: for the Neglect of Duty is not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, but a Rejecting of Christ; and a practical Declaration, that we <hi>will none of him,</hi> that we <hi>will not have this Man to rule over us.</hi>—The Act of <hi>Faith</hi> by which we receive the Lord Jesus Christ, is indeed distinct from the Duties of religious Worship; but as <hi>Faith</hi> must be obtain'd in a Way of Duty, so it is necessarily productive of a Life of Duty, in all that have it.

As <hi>Faith</hi> empties us of our selves, and shews us that we are lost and undone, notwithstanding any Thing we do or can do; so it discovers an abundant Fulness and Sufficiency in Christ, upon which we may safely trust, and venture our eternal Interests. It shews us, that altho' we can do nothing ourselves, which will procure the Favour of God or intitle us

to it, yet Christ has done enough for us, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God, and to answer all the Demands of Justice. Thus by Faith <hi>we rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no Confidence in the Flesh; We go forth unto Him without the Camp, bearing his Reproach;</hi> and <hi>go up from the Wilderness, leaning upon our Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any should now inquire, What Place is there for <hi>good Works,</hi> if we are to have all our Dependance upon what <hi>Christ</hi> has done and suffered for us? I answer, we must depend upon Him in the Way of a <hi>Carefulness to maintain good Works.</hi> (Tit. 3. 8.) And we can safely depend upon him in no other Way. All other Dependance, exclusive of this Care of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary living, is not <hi>Faith,</hi> but Presumption. For <hi>Faith without Works is dead.</hi> Though <hi>we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law,</hi> (Rom. 3. 28.) yet the <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are justified, is never (in Case of Opportunity) <hi>without</hi> the Deeds of the Law, though in Truth animated by Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Motives, and springing from evangelical Principles. They that have <hi>Faith unfeign'd</hi> dwelling in them, <hi>will live godly in Christ Jesus.</hi>—Faith alone justifies, by receiving and depending upon the Righteousness of Christ for Justification: But the Faith which justifies, is never alone. For being thereby united to Christ, as <hi>a Branch to the Vine,</hi> we shall <hi>bring forth Fruit, much Fruit, whereby our heavenly Father it glorified.</hi> It is a sanctifying Faith, as well as justifying</p>

Christ, in an hearty Consent to the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Offer of Christ, his Offices and Benefits; and in an hearty Dependance upon what Christ has done and suffered for us, as the Ground of our Pardon and Justification, and the Price of eternal Salvation.—I have shewn, that our Assent to the Gospel-Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation supposes a sufficient Knowledge of the Way of Salvation therein revealed; for <hi>Faith</hi> must follow the Understanding, and cannot go before it; and that it supposes a Reception of this Revelation for divine Truth, when we do understand it; for our <hi>Faith should not stand in the Wisdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</hi>—I have shewn, that our <hi>Consent</hi> to the Gospel-Offer, or our receiving of Christ upon Gospel-Terms, supposes such a Sense of our Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Interest in Christ, as makes us earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and cheerfully comply with any Terms of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; for we shall never accept an offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour upon his own Terms, as long as we can do without him; that it supposes we accept him as our King, as well as our Saviour; for he must save us <hi>from</hi> our Sins, and not <hi>in</hi> them; and it supposes that we receive him in the Use of Means, and not in the Neglect of them; for the Neglect of Duty is a practical Rejection of Christ.—I have shewn, that our <hi>Dependance</hi> upon Christ supposes, that we renounce all Confidence in our selves, in any Thing we do or can do; for he will be a compleat Saviour, and the alone Saviour, or none at all; and that it supposes, we place all our Confidence in his active and passive Obedience; for he <hi>is the Lord our Righteousness;</hi> and <hi>in him shall all the Seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> That <hi>Faith</hi> does not reconcile us to God, consider'd <hi>subjectively,</hi> or as it is our own Act. The Act of believing is no more a Condition of our Justification, than the Act of repenting, or the Exercise of any other Grace or Duty.—There are no <hi>Works of Righteousness, which we have done,</hi> or can do, that will save us, whether they be consider'd as our legal, or evangelical Righteousness.—Our <hi>legal</hi> Righteousness, or Deeds of the Law, can't save us; because they can't atone for our past Offences; nor can they in any Instance come up to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law; but in every Thing fall short of the Perfection thereby required.—Nor may we imagine, that our <hi>evangelical</hi> Righteousness, or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Gospel, can save us; because that would be to place Merit in our repenting and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to set our <hi>Faith</hi> in the Room of Christ's Obedience, which is the only Price of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Though we are said to be justified <hi>by</hi> Faith, we are no where said to be justified <hi>for</hi> it. This Act of our's (as well as all others) is very imperfect; and accompany'd with much sinful Unbelief at the best; therefore stands in Need of Pardon itself, and so cannot possibly merit our Salvation.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> justifies us, as it is the instituted <hi>Means</hi> of our obtaining an <hi>Interest</hi> in what Christ has <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> for us, For <hi>with the Heart Man belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

unto Righteousness, and with the Mouth Confession is made unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. We are espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Christ by Faith, and in this Way his Benefits are dispensed to us.—The Lord Jesus Christ has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd a perfect Obedience for us (as I have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly shewn above) and has purchased Salvation for all that are interested in that Obedience. He has done and suffered all that the Law required of us.—He has fully answered its <hi>penal</hi> Demands. He has been <hi>made Sin for us, who knew no Sin.</hi> He <hi>has born our Sins in his own Body upon the Cross.</hi> He has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the Wrath of God (as well as of Men and Devils) for our sakes, that he might propitiate an offended God; and pay the Debt, which our Sins had contracted.—He has obey'd the whole <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Part of the Law; been perfect in his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with all its Commands, and <hi>fulfilled all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;</hi> that he might intitle us to the eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and purchase Salvation for us.—And all this he has done in the Capacity of our <hi>Surety.</hi> It is in our Name, Place and Stead that he has wrought out this perfect Righteousness. An Interest in him does therefore invest us with this Righteousness, and make it as much Ours, and pleadable by us, as if it had been in Fact personally performed by our selves.</p>
            <p>Now it is by <hi>Faith</hi> that we obtain an actual Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in him, and so are cloathed upon with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; and in that Respect we are justified by <hi>Faith.</hi>—The Gospel proclaims the happy Tidings of Christ, and Redemption; <hi>Faith</hi> assents to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains this blessed Proclamation. The Gospel makes a free Tender of purchased Salvation, to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:004710_0224_0000000000000000"/>
sensible of their Need of it, and willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; <hi>Faith</hi> complies with the Offer, and readily embraces a tender'd Saviour.—The Gospel proposes Christ's Righteousness, and that only, for our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; <hi>Faith</hi> makes us <hi>esteem all Things but Loss and Dung, that we may win Christ, and be found in him.</hi>—The Gospel requires a Life of holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God, as a proper Fruit and Evidence of Faith, as a Testimony of our Acceptance of this offer'd Saviour, and our Gratitude to him. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned <hi>Faith</hi> produces the happy Effect, wherever it is. <hi>Faith</hi> purifies the Heart, and works by Love. So that <hi>Faith</hi> is in every Thing a Compliance with what the Gospel requires to the constituting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining us justify'd Persons.—<hi>Christ is the End of the Law, for Righteousness, to every one that believeth.</hi> He that is once brought to <hi>live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> is no longer <hi>under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> no longer consider'd as in <hi>Adam,</hi> by whose <hi>Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> he was made a <hi>Sinner;</hi> but as in <hi>Christ,</hi> by whose <hi>Obedience</hi> he is made <hi>righteous.</hi> And thus <hi>Faith</hi> brings us Pardon and Salvation, as it unites us to Christ, interests us in his perfect Obedience, and makes his Righteousness ours. Whence <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God</hi> is said to be <hi>revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. i. 17. And we are told, that <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi> Rom. iii. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith</hi> has the Promise of Christ's continual <hi>Intercession</hi> for us.—Our highest Attainments in Faith and Holiness, are accompanied with many Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. <hi>In many Things we all offend.</hi> And as we are daily chargeable with new Sins, we stand in daily
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:004710_0225_0000000000000000"/>
Need of renewed Pardon and Justification; upon which Account <hi>Jesus Christ, the Righteous,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as <hi>our Advocate with the Father,</hi> to procure this for us; and to bestow it upon us. 1 Joh. ii. 1. The Apostle puts an Emphasis on Christ's Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rom. viii. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the right Hand of God, who also maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for us.</hi> Now being interested in Christ by <hi>Faith,</hi> we have an Interest in his Intercession: and by the Efficacy of his Intercession, the Believer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a renewed Pardon of his daily Transgressions, and a confirmed Pardon of all his Trespasses. We have, through <hi>Faith</hi> renewedly exercised, a Claim to have all our new Sins pardon'd, and blotted out, by a fresh Application of Christ's Blood, and Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Righteousness. The Believer is made <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the Beloved:</hi> and by Virtue of his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> receives an Answer of Peace.—<hi>Wherefore he is able to save them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make Intercession for them.</hi> Heb. vii. 25.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to make some practical IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROVEMENT of what hath been said.</p>
            <p>USE I. This administers Matter of <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Awakening,</hi> to all that rest in an Estate of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>—If we are interested in the <hi>Propitiation</hi> of Christ by <hi>Faith</hi> in his Blood, what must be the Case of those who are destitute of a saving <hi>Faith?</hi> We are told (Joh. iii. 18, 36.) that <hi>they are condemned already,</hi> that <hi>they shall not see Life: but the Wrath of God abideth on them.</hi> Which awful Consideration
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:004710_0226_0000000000000000"/>
might justly startle and surprize the securest Sinners; and put them upon the most solicitous Inquiry after Christ and an Interest in him by Faith.—Can you esteem it a trifling Concern, whether you are saved or damned; whether you are by <hi>Faith</hi> Partakers of the Salvation Christ has purchased, or whether you are by your <hi>Unbelief</hi> shut out of the Glories of the heavenly World, and left to lament your Misery and Loss with most amazing Horror, to all Eternity? Remember, that if you continue and die in Unbelief, your Misery must bear Proportion to the Mercy you have abused and forfeited; and it would have been better for you never to have heard of a Saviour, than to perish in your Sins, from under Gospel-Light and Grace. This will be your <hi>Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and you have chosen Darkness rather than Light; because your Deeds are Evil.</hi> (Joh. iii. 19.) You have the Revelation of this Salvation; and the continued Offers of it, upon most easy and honourable Terms. You have it pressed upon you, by repeated Inculcation, in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Gospel: and how aggravated will your Guilt be, if you set light by this precious Saviour, and reject his Salvation! O that neglectful Sinners might therefore be awaken'd out of their Security, to see their Misery and Danger, before it be too late; before <hi>the Things of their Peace are hidden from their Eyes;</hi> and before the Offers of Salvation thro' <hi>Faith</hi> in Jesus Christ, be for ever over! <hi>O foolish</hi> Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the Truth, before whose Eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you!</hi> O the astonishing Folly of Christ-Despisers and Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Neglecters, who notwithstanding you are brought in
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:004710_0227_0000000000000000"/>
View of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> will after all perish in the <hi>Wilderness;</hi> and have your final Lot assign'd you among <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Unbelievers!</hi> O how can you rest thus contented in an Estate of Unbelief, until you provoke God to <hi>swear in his Wrath, that you shall never enter into his Rest!</hi> Had you not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accept the Saviour now, than to have him your angry Judge at last, and reject you with a <hi>Verily I know you not!</hi> Had you not better hearken to the Offers of Mercy now, than to have the Gospel it self, and all the Ordinances of Salvation you have ever enjoy'd, rise up in Judgment against you, to aggravate your Condemnation! But alas! till your Eyes are opened, to see your Sin and Danger, <hi>you will not come unto Christ, that you might have Life:</hi> You will rather run the Venture of eternal Perdition, than accept of this precious Saviour and his great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, tho' so freely offered.—This seems to be the Case of the greatest Part of the gospelized World. And they must be left to the Consequences of their unhappy Choice. They must find, by sad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the dreadful Effects of <hi>neglecting so great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> before they will receive Conviction.</p>
            <p>USE II. Let all be exhorted to make it their Concern to <hi>obtain a true Faith in Jesus Christ,</hi> by which alone they can be justified in the Sight of God.—What has been said already, gives full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this is an Affair of everlasting Importance, a Concern that your Eternity depends upon; and that you may expect to <hi>rejoice with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory,</hi> or <hi>mourn bitterly,</hi> with the sharpest Accents of Horror and Agony, according to your Compliance with, or Rejection of this Gospel-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.

It is founded on Scripture-Calls and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, inforced with the most solemn and affecting Sanctions, both of Promises and Threatnings.—You have many Examples, both to encourage, and to warn you.—You are invited to be <hi>Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience do inherit the Promises.</hi> And to a Care of <hi>obtaining like precious Faith with them,</hi> you are strongly excited, by the endearing Attractives of Christ's infinite Love, in his giving himself for and to his People. <hi>I therefore beseech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God our Saviour;</hi> that you <hi>come unto Christ as to a living Stone, disallowed indeed of Men, but chosen of God, and precious.</hi>—To this you are also most awfully warn'd by the awakening Alarms of your Guilt and Danger. <hi>Take heed therefore, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, lest there be in any of you an evil Heart of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in departing from the living God.</hi> It is high Time to fly from the impending Storm, to this Hope set before you. Be prevailed with to take Hold of this Instruction, and not let it go, but to keep it; <hi>for it is your Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labour after an effectual Sense of the infinite <hi>Importance</hi> of a saving <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ. Get it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon your Mind, that you must believe in Christ, or perish without Remedy. Don't put off this eternal Concern; but think of it now, and think of it solemnly, as you must think of it, when you come to your final Trial. Let this Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lie down and rise with you: <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall he damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labour after a lively Impression of your <hi>Incapacity</hi> to produce this important Grace in yourselves. Keep
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:004710_0229_0000000000000000"/>
up a constant Remembrance, that <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot reveal this to you: but our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Let the humbling Thought bring you to God's Foot; and make you deeply sensible, that you lie at his Mercy, unable to help your selves, and unworthy of Divine Relief.</p>
            <p>Let a Discovery of this your distressed Case quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you to greater Diligence in <hi>seeking</hi> the Influence of the blessed Spirit, to work this <hi>Faith</hi> in you. Be importunate in Prayer, and in all Ways of Duty, to have <hi>the good Pleasure of God's Goodness, and the Work of Faith with Power wrought</hi> in your Souls.</p>
            <p>And labour to <hi>exercise</hi> Faith in Christ. Though you cannot work this Grace in your selves, yet if ever you obtain it, you yourselves must use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise it. The Principle is from God: but the Act must be your own. If God bring you to exercise this Grace, you must be <hi>made willing in the Day of his Power,</hi> and act with your free Consent. <hi>This is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the great Command of the Gospel, <hi>That you should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> It is therefore your Duty to believe, and by Consequence to labour to believe in Christ: And if God gives you the Grace to do so, it will be by quickning and strengthening you in the Way of your Prayers and your Endeavours. Labour therefore to comply with the gracious Offer and Call of the Gospel, to see your perishing Condition without Christ, and to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize his Ability and Readiness to help and save you. Contemplate his infinite Excellencies and complete Sufficiency for you; and endeavour (looking to God for his gracious Assistance) to choose Christ for
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:004710_0230_0000000000000000"/>
your Saviour and Portion, to prefer an Interest in him above all the World, to rely upon him as the Author of your eternal Salvation, and to plead his Righteousness before God as your only Claim to Mercy. In a Word, endeavour to accept him upon his own Terms: And be earnest with God in your continual Supplications, for <hi>Grace to help you,</hi> that you may indeed <hi>receive Christ Jesus the Lord, and walk in him.</hi> Though you are <hi>without Strength,</hi> yet <hi>through Christ strengthning you,</hi> you <hi>can do all Things:</hi> And you should attempt, in his Strength, to do what otherwise you are utterly insufficient for.</p>
            <p>USE, III. Let all be exhorted to utmost Care and Caution, that they be not <hi>deceived</hi> in this momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Affair; and that they don't take up with a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>counterfeit Faith,</hi> which will Issue in a fatal and eternal Disappointment of all their Expectations.—Multitudes <hi>have</hi> been, and we <hi>may</hi> be deceived; and it's impossible to imagine the Confusion that will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, if we are too late convinced of our Mistake, and ashamed of our Hope.</p>
            <p>See that you evidence to your selves the Sincerity of your <hi>Faith,</hi> by an earnest Desire after Christ for your Portion, and by the highest Esteem for him. If you have a true <hi>Faith,</hi> you will have the Lord Jesus Christ represented to you as the <hi>chief of ten Thousand, altogether lovely;</hi> and will certainly value him accordingly. Hence it is said, <hi>Unto You that believe, Christ is precious.</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 7.</p>
            <p>Evidence the Sincerity of your <hi>Faith,</hi> by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Sin;</hi> and by an earnest, constant Endeavour after the <hi>Victory</hi> over all your <hi>Lusts,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:004710_0231_0000000000000000"/>
any Reserve. We are told, that <hi>Faith purifies the Heart.</hi> (Acts xv. 9.) And that <hi>whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin; because he is born of God.</hi> (1 Joh. iii. 9.)</p>
            <p>Evidence the Truth of your <hi>Faith,</hi> by a Life of <hi>universal Holiness;</hi> by a careful constant Endeavour after Conformity to the whole revealed Will of God; by Purity of Heart and Hands. Walk in all the Ways of God and Godliness, in all the Duties of Religion, and in all the Duties of each Relation which God has placed you in; and endeavour to approve your selves to a pure and holy God, in the Discharge of them all. You may depend upon it, that no other Evidence of Sincerity without this, can stand you in stead. Resolve then as he (Jam. ii. 18.) <hi>I will shew my Faith by my Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Evidence the Truth of your <hi>Faith,</hi> by having your Affections weaned from the <hi>World;</hi> and by <hi>seeking the Things which are above, where Christ Jesus sits at the right Hand of God.</hi> If you are true Believers, you <hi>look not at the Things that are seen and temporal: but at those which are unseen and eternal.</hi> You are looking upon all the Affairs of Time, but as trifling and vain, compared to the Concerns of a future and everlasting World. For <hi>this is the Victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the World, even our Faith.</hi> 1 Joh. v. 4.—<hi>Faith</hi> worketh by <hi>Love;</hi> not to the World, or the Things of it; but to God, and the Things of God. Love not the World therefore, or the Things of the World: For if ye love the World, the Love of the Father is not in you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:004710_0232_0000000000000000"/>Finally, Evidence the Sincerity of your <hi>Faith,</hi> by an habitual <hi>Subjection</hi> of Soul to the Lord Jesus Christ, and fervent <hi>Applications</hi> unto Him, to work in and for you the good Pleasure of his Will. Commit the whole Concern of your Salvation to him. Look to him in a Way of constant earnest Prayer and active Diligence, for all Supplies of Grace. Whatever Darkness, whatever Deadness, whatever Afflictions, or Temptations you may meet with, still repair to him, that you may <hi>obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in a Time of Need,</hi> that <hi>of his Fulness you may receive even Grace for Grace.</hi> You can't trust too little your selves; nor too much to him, in the Way of Duty. Resolve therefore constantly to come, empty and self-insufficient, to him; and <hi>open your Mouth wide, that he may fill it.</hi> If you thus <hi>believe in him, you shall never be confounded.</hi> I conclude with those Words of the Apostle. 1 Joh. iii. 21,—24. <q>Beloved, if our Heart condemn us not, then have we Confidence towards God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And this is his Commandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And he that keepeth his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</q>

            <p>THIS brief Clause is the last Link of that golden Chain, which extends from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting to Everlasting, and connects a past and future Eternity. It takes its Rise in God's <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> and eter <hi>Purpose</hi> of Grace to the Elect; and reaches thro' their <hi>Vocation</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> on Earth, unto their eternal <hi>Glorification</hi> in Heaven. It shews us the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Connection between the Decree of God, and the progressive Execution of it, in our present Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for, and final Admittance to everlasting Glory. And as we are here assur'd, that <hi>the Counsel of the Lord shall stand,</hi> firm as his own Being, and
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:004710_0234_0000000000000000"/>
without any Variation or Shadow of turning; so we are equally assur'd, that where God's eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel is manifested in our effectual Calling and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by Consequence our eternal Salvation is also manifest and certain. The <hi>Perseverance</hi> of the Saints through Faith unto Salvation, is here founded upon the same immutable Certainty with the Purpose and Decree of God. As all <hi>whom he did predestinate,</hi> shall be certainly called; not only by the outward Invitations of the Gospel, but by the inward power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influences of the blessed Spirit, whereby they shall he brought to a hearty Compliance with Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Offers: so they whom he thus calleth, he as certainly <hi>justifieth,</hi> through Christ's Righteousness imputed to them, and received by Faith: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus <hi>justified,</hi> they shall with the same Certainty be also <hi>glorified.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Make some practical <hi>Improvement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I shall premise some Hints on the Article of <hi>Justification.</hi>—And I would here observe, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already in a former Discourse particularly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd both the <hi>Price</hi> and the <hi>Means</hi> of our Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to God and Acceptance with him, I am now
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:004710_0235_0000000000000000"/>
only to set in View the <hi>Nature</hi> of this precious Benefit, as personally receiv'd: And it may be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily represented in the following Description.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Justification is the gracious Sentence of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Sinner is on Account of Christ's Satisfaction, at or upon his believing, actually acquitted from Guilt and Condemnation, accepted as righteous in the Sight of God, and thereby intitled to eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I consider <hi>Justification</hi> as a gracious <hi>Sentence of God:</hi> And so the Apostle considers it in the 33d Verse of our Context, <hi>Who shall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifieth.—Justification</hi> is a forensic Term; and signifies the Sentence of a Judge, whereby an accused or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Person is discharg'd from the Imputation of Guilt or the Infliction of Punishment, and whereby he is pronounced just, and accepted as such.—Thus in the present Case, the Person justify'd has a gracious Sentence passed upon him in a judiciary Way. The great Law-giver and Judge of the World pronounces his Absolution, and acknowledges him to be in his Favour and Friendship, accepted as righteous in the Court of Heaven.—<hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> are carefully to be distinguished. That is a <hi>qualitative,</hi> This a <hi>relative</hi> Change: That is a Change of our <hi>moral</hi> State, Nature and Disposition, but this a Change of our <hi>Covenant</hi>-State, <hi>Law</hi>-Condition and Character, in Reference to God: That is an <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete</hi> Change, defective as to the Degree at present, but this a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> one: That is a Change by the Operation of the Holy Spirit, <hi>within us;</hi> This by the Declaration of the sovereigh Judge, <hi>without</hi> us.—<hi>Justification</hi> is also to be distinguish'd from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:004710_0236_0000000000000000"/>
proving Sentence of our own <hi>Conscience.</hi> For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science misguided, may <hi>acquit,</hi> when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns: The Man may vote himself <hi>rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased with Goods, and in Need of nothing,</hi> whom yet this supream Judge pronounces <hi>wretched and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and poor and blind and naked.</hi> So on the other Hand, Conscience may <hi>condemn,</hi> when God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits. The Man may <hi>walk in Darkness and see no Light,</hi> whom yet this supreme Judge invites to <hi>trust in the Name of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God.</hi> The justifying Sentence then is that of God, and not of Conscience. <hi>It is God, that justifieth:</hi> Herein following his own revealed Will, the external Rule of Justification, and not always accompanying it with the internal Testimony of his Spirit in our Conscience. The divine Sentence may be actually pronounced, and yet not sensibly perceived by the Soul, on which it's passed.</p>
            <p>I give the Subject of this gracious Benefit the Denomination of a <hi>Sinner;</hi> because I wou'd keep it in Mind, that Justification is an Act of God's free sovereign <hi>Grace</hi> towards lapsed guilty unworthy Creatures; that <hi>not according to Works of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saveth us;</hi> that although we are justify'd in the Way of believing, yet even our Faith is not so much as in Part our Justifying Righteousness; that altho' the Sentence of Justification does in Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture follow our Union to Christ by Faith, yet it is an instantaneous Benefit, and no Internal of Time passes between the one and the other.—When the Spirit of Grace comes to work in us Faith, the Means of our receiving Christ's Righteousness to
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:004710_0237_0000000000000000"/>
justify us, he finds us <hi>in our Sins,</hi> dead in Trespasses, as well as dead in Law. Hence tho' in one Place God is described as <hi>the Justifier of him which believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Jesus</hi> (Rom. 3. 26.) Yet in another he is spoken of in that Language, <hi>Him that justifieth the Ungodly.</hi> (Rom. iv. 5.) Not that he leaves us <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> altho' he find us so. For God <hi>purifies our Hearts by Faith,</hi> at the same Time that he <hi>justifies us thro' Faith.</hi> And indeed Faith is in its Nature a sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Principle: it is it self a Branch of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and is influential into progressive Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. However, in the first Act of Faith we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider our selves as condemned <hi>Sinners,</hi> and <hi>flee for Refuge, to lay hold upon the Hope set before us; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Jesus,</hi> we <hi>receive the Atonement,</hi> for our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Justification: Whence it's call'd <hi>Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom. iii. 25. And then Faith operates as a Principle of Sanctification, <hi>works by Love,</hi> and excites a Care to <hi>purify our Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spirit.</hi>—But further, in a large Sense, even the renewed Believer may be call'd a <hi>Sinner;</hi> he is so in the Eye of the Law, as coming infinitely short of its just Demands, in his personal Qualifications and Performances: but altho' in himself a Sinner, yet at the Instant of Conversion being vitally <hi>united to Christ,</hi> and absolv'd from the Curse and Penalty of the Law, <hi>there is</hi> thenceforward <hi>no Condemnation unto him.</hi>—And then I characterize him a <hi>Sinner,</hi> because the very Idea of Pardon, and of the Justification we are upon, speaks the Propriety of so describing him. For altho' a Believer may in some Sense be said to be <hi>justify'd by Works,</hi> as they are Evidences for him, and plead in his Vindication, against the Charge of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy, upon his Trial as a Gospel-Professor: yet in
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:004710_0238_0000000000000000"/>
the Case before us, as standing at the Bar of the Law, he is <hi>not justify'd by Works,</hi> but by <hi>Grace:</hi> although a Criminal in the View of Justice, he has by an Act of sovereign Grace his <hi>Sins covered,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness without Works imputed to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By our being justify'd on Account of Christ's <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> at or upon our <hi>believing,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that we are pardon'd and accepted with God <hi>thro' the Righteousness of Christ</hi> imputed to us, and reckoned ours in the Construction of Redeeming Mercy, upon our <hi>receiving Christ by Faith;</hi> and not before. Hence it's said in our Context, <hi>Whom he called, them he also justified.</hi> And hence <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God is said to be revealed from Faith to Faith.</hi> (Rom. 1. 17.) Our first actual Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Righteousness of Christ, is upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's first working <hi>Faith</hi> in us, and thereby uniting us to Christ in our effectual Calling: The continued Application of it, and renewed Benefit by it, is upon the continued Existence and renewed Exercise of the same <hi>Faith.</hi> And thus <hi>the Just shall live by Faith:</hi> that is, They are in a State of Life and Peace with God, from their Union to Christ by <hi>Faith. He that hath the Son, hath Life.</hi> The <hi>Justification of Life</hi> commences with their being <hi>made Partakers of Christ:</hi> and <hi>Christ dwells in their Heart by Faith.</hi> It is through <hi>Faith,</hi> that they are interested in the Benefits of his Redemption: and they are kept by the Power of God through <hi>Faith</hi> unto Salvation.—All Pretences therefore to <hi>eternal</hi> Justification are superseded, as unscriptural and unreasonable.—The Believers <hi>Justification,</hi> it is true, was determin'd in God's eternal Counsel, and in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:004710_0239_0000000000000000"/>
and so likewise was his Sanctification and his future Glory. But will any pretend, that we were sanctified or glorified from all Eternity? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they with any better Shew of Reason, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an eternal <hi>Justification.</hi> These all stand on the same Foot, as to the Decree of God, and the Promise in Christ; and may be said in their <hi>Causes</hi> to be eternal, tho' neither of them so in themselves: but are Events that fall within the Compass of <hi>Time,</hi> as to their actual Accomplishment. That Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imports a real Event in Time, coming to pass at or upon believing, and not before, is evident from those Scriptures, which speak of it as a future Consequence: <hi>By his Knowledge</hi> SHALL <hi>my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Servant justify many.—By the Obedience of one</hi> SHALL <hi>many be made righteous.—That Righteousness</hi> MIGHT BE <hi>imputed unto them also.</hi>—All that hold Mankind to be <hi>Children of Wrath by Nature,</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess such an Imputation of Sin in <hi>Time,</hi> as is utterly inconsistent with Justification from <hi>Eternity.</hi> If the <hi>Curse</hi> of the Law be a <hi>real</hi> Thing, and not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then the Justification that reverses and removes it, must be what takes Place in <hi>Time,</hi> and must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd a Transaction in Time as real as the Condemnation, it stands in Opposition to. In short, the Elect, as well as others, before their vital Union to Christ by Faith, are in a State of actual Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and therefore, while so, most certainly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in a State of actual Justification. It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Distinction of Persons always true, that <q>He who believeth not, is condemned already; because he hath not believed in the Name of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God.</q> 
               <hi>John</hi> iii. 18.—But in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Soul <hi>passes from Death to Life,</hi> by Virtue
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:004710_0240_0000000000000000"/>
of a perfect <hi>Righteousness</hi> revealed and applied to him, which he actually had not before his believing. <hi>Man believeth unto Righteousness</hi> (Rom. x. 10.) unto the <hi>obtaining</hi> and possessing of it. Faith is the Means of receiving <hi>the Gift of Righteousness.</hi> No Unbeliever is in the Possession and Enjoyment of it. A Man is personally justify'd no otherwise than by Christ and his Righteousness <hi>apply'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Justification</hi> is consider'd as an <hi>Acquittance</hi> from <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Condemnation.</hi>—Not that the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Person is free from remaining Sin and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For, <hi>in many Things we all offend.</hi> And <hi>if we say that we have no Sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> But tho' the Believer has contracted Guilt enough, to separate him from the Favour of God for ever, yet the Atonement that Christ has made for him, is a sufficient Satisfaction to the Demands of Justice. Tho' 
in his highest At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, he is chargeable with renewed and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Offences against God, he will yet <hi>be saved to the uttermost, seeing Christ ever lives to make Intercession for him.</hi> This therefore is his comfortable and happy State, <hi>Being justified by Faith, he hath Peace with God.</hi> (Rom. v. 1.) Christ's Righteousness being imputed to the Believer, hence his Sins how great and aggravated soever, will no more be imputed to him unto Condemnation. Justice is satisfied, and the Law fulfilled by the Redeemer. The Believer's Guilt is therefore finally taken away; &amp; he freed from all Obligation to Punishment for ever. Nor is it a mere conditional Absolution, but an actual Discharge; putting him not meerly into a State of <hi>Salvability,</hi> but of present and everlasting <hi>Safety.</hi> This is the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:004710_0241_0000000000000000"/>
Case of them, <hi>whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose Sins are covered: unto whom the Lord</hi> WILL NOT <hi>impute Sin.</hi> Rom. iv. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Justification</hi> does likewise imply an <hi>Acceptance</hi> of our Persons, as perfectly <hi>righteous</hi> in the Sight of God. Tho' God knows, that numberless Spots and Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes cleave to the brightest Performances, that the best of the Children of Men are capable of in this Life; and that their very Tears want washing in the Blood of Christ: yet the Believer's Faith interests him in all that Christ has done and suffered for him; and cloaths him in that <hi>white Raiment,</hi> which covers all his Sins, <hi>that the Shame of his Nakedness doth not appear.</hi>—His inherent personal Righteousness is full of Flaws and Imperfections; but his Surety's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which he hath received by Faith, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely perfect and compleat. This being imputed to him, he is accepted by God on this Account; and in this his justifying Righteousness, the pure Eyes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice can see no Defect. For <hi>Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that believeth.</hi> Rom. x. 4.—Hence such are said be <hi>made accepted in the Beloved.</hi> Eph. i. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Justification</hi> must be also consider'd as including a <hi>Title</hi> to everlasting Life, a full <hi>Right</hi> to the whole of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, with eternal Glory.—<hi>Being now justified by his Blood, much more shall we be saved from Wrath thro' him.</hi> Rom. v. 9.—and Ver. 21. <hi>That as Sin hath reigned unto Death, even so might Grace reign through Righteousness unto eternal Life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> This is most undoubted, that these must either be Heirs of eternal Life, or Heirs of eternal
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:004710_0242_0000000000000000"/>
Destruction. But how can the latter be supposed of those, who are interested in Christ, reconciled to God, and Favourites of Heaven? Can it be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that those whom Christ has purchased with his Blood, those to whom he has apply'd the Merits of his Cross and Benefits of his Redemption, shall fall short of the purchased Possession? Are they drawn to Christ by the powerful Influences of the divine Grace? Are they united to him by a lively Faith? Are they accepted of God, as his Children and Friends? Are they dear to him; and does he tender them <hi>as the Apple of his Eye?</hi> Are they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Spirit of their Minds;</hi> and <hi>made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light?</hi> And shall any such, after all, spend a dreadful Eternity in amazing Anguish and Horror, among Devils and damned Spirits? How monstrously inconsistent is the Supposition, and how contradictory to the whole Tenor of the Gospel! <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 24. <q>Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into Condemnation; but is passed from Death unto Life.</q>—Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a final and perfect Absolution from Sin and the Curse; and invests us with an actual and compleat Right to positive Happiness for ever. Hence the pardon'd Man is pronounc'd the <hi>blessed</hi> Man. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 6. <q>Even as David also describeth the Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness without Works.</q>—Whoso is wise, will observe and understand these Things.</p>
            <p>Now if any should surmise and object, That true Believers may <hi>fall away from Grace,</hi> dissolve their
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:004710_0243_0000000000000000"/>
Union to Christ, lose their near Relation to God, and provoke him to cast them off for their Apostasy; Our <hi>Text</hi> assures us of the contrary. For <hi>whom he justified, them he also glorified.</hi>—This brings me to the other Thing propos'd to Consideration.</p>
            <p n="II">II. <hi>How it appears, that all who are</hi> justified, <hi>shall be also</hi> glorified.</p>
            <p>And here let it be remark'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This appears from the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God's eternal <hi>Counsel.</hi>—We read, <hi>The Foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> (2 Tim. 2. 19.) If God has chosen them to eternal Life, <hi>his Counsel shall stand; and he will do all his Pleasure.</hi> If he has not chosen them to eternal Life, how came they by the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it? Are not these the Fruits and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of electing Love? <q>Whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified.—He hath chosen us in Christ, that we should be holy.—He hath chosen us to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth.</q> Now if he has predetermin'd these Qualifications as the Means of Salvation, if he has connected the Means and the End together in his eternal Purpose, as the Scripture assures us that he has, it then follows, that all those <hi>whom he has justified, them he will also glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify:</hi> there must otherwise be a Change of Purpose in God, which were Blasphemy to suppose.</p>
            <p>If any Man <hi>apostatise</hi> and fall out of a justified State, it must be either because some do in Time
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:004710_0244_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>come to Christ,</hi> whom the Father had not given him in his eternal Counsel; or because he had eternally <hi>given some</hi> to Christ and determin'd that they should come to him, who shall nevertheless be <hi>left</hi> to <hi>fall away</hi> and finally miscarry.</p>
            <p>Not the former. For <hi>all that the Father hath given unto Christ, shall come to him,</hi> and none but they. (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37.) <hi>The Election obtain</hi> this Grace, <hi>and the Rest are blinded.</hi> (Rom. 11. 7.) How can any Man come unto the Son, unless it be given him of the Father? And how can this be given him in Time, if God did not eternally determine to give it him, without a Change of Purpose and Counsel in God?</p>
            <p>Not the latter. For <hi>him that cometh unto Christ, he will in no wise cast out.</hi> (Joh. 6. 37.) <hi>He that believeth in him, shall not perish; but have everlasting Life.</hi> (Joh. 3. 16.) <hi>This is the Father's Will, that of all which he hath given to Christ, he should lose Nothing; but should raise it up again at the last Day.</hi> Joh. 6. 39.</p>
            <p>Let us consider this Argument in one View; and see whether it can admit of any Answer, without a flat Contradiction both to the Scriptures, and to the Nature of Things. If no Man can come to Christ, unless he were given to him in God's eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; if all that were given to Christ in God's eternal Counsel, shall come to him; if none that do come, shall be cast out or lost, but all be raised up to Salvation at the last Day; then surely <hi>all that are justified, shall be glorified,</hi> which was the Thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="unknown:004710_0245_0000000000000000"/>I might add to this, that we are exhorted (2 Pet. 1. 10.) <hi>to make our Election sure.</hi> Which must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that we make it sure to our selves, or make our selves sure of it: for as to the Decree of God, or the final Event, these are in themselves as sure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as they can be made. We can contribute Nothing to the Immutability of the divine Counsel, or Certainty of the future Issue.—This Exhortation does therefore suppose, that an inward Consciousness and Assurance of our Election is attainable in this Life: it would otherwise be unreasonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to press it upon us. And if there be a Certainty of our <hi>Election</hi> attainable, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, that all true Believers shall certainly <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe</hi> to the End. For how can I be sure of my <hi>Election</hi> by any possible Qualification, if my <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be not with the same Certainty connected to such Qualification, as it is to the eternal Decree of God?—I may be sure, that I am now interested in Christ by a lively Faith; but I can't be sure, that I am <hi>chosen</hi> to eternal Salvation, or shall ever obtain it, but from a Certainty of my <hi>Perseverance</hi> in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State of Safety.—This Argument may be thus summ'd up. All that are <hi>elected,</hi> shall certainly be <hi>saved;</hi> and all that have a true <hi>Faith</hi> in Jesus Christ, are certainly <hi>elected:</hi> for by this only we can <hi>make our Election sure.</hi> From hence the Conclusion is necessary, that all who have a true <hi>Faith</hi> in Jesus Christ, shall be <hi>kept by the Power of God, to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Or in other Words, that the Saints shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in Grace; and <hi>all whom God hath justified, he will also</hi> finally <hi>glorify.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="231" facs="unknown:004710_0246_0000000000000000"/>2. This appears also from the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of Christ's <hi>Redemption,</hi> for the Recovery and Happiness of all to whom it is apply'd.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Redeemer has not only procured for Believer's the Pardon of their Sins, and a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God: but he has also purchased for 'em a Title to God's Favour here, and to eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hereafter. Whence Heaven is called the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and his <hi>purchased Possession.</hi> Eph. i. 14.—Now if Christ has purchased this Inheritance for the Believer, and made over the Title to him in his <hi>Justification,</hi> who shall deprive him of his own Estate, procured for him at such an infinite Price?</p>
            <p>Can it consist with the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, to accept of a vicarious Satisfaction for all our Sins, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of that to give us a Discharge from Sin and Guilt in our <hi>Justification;</hi> and yet to require <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Satisfaction from us, in our everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Will he accept of the full Price of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inheritance from our Surety, and yet refuse us the Possession? Will he give us a Right to eternal Life upon Christ's Account; and yet finally exclude us from it? Our Lord assures us, it cannot be. <q>My Sheep hear my Voice: and I give unto them eternal Life; and they shall never perish: neither shall any pluck them out of my Hand.</q> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> x. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Can it consist with the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, to bestow an Interest in Christ upon the Believer; and yet to withhold from him the glorious Benefits of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? The Apostle assures us, it cannot be
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:004710_0247_0000000000000000"/>
               <q>He that spared not his own Son; but freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all Things?</q> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 32.</p>
            <p>It should be here remembred, that our Lord Jesus Christ has purchased the <hi>Means,</hi> as well as the <hi>End,</hi> for all that believe in him: not only <hi>eternal Life,</hi> but also continued Supplies of renewing <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby they shall be made <hi>meet</hi> for it. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly purchased for <hi>some</hi> Believers. Whence do they else obtain persevering Grace, if not from this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? And if for some Believers, why not for <hi>all?</hi> Unless the Faith of some gives 'em but a partial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ's Redemption.—It can't be doubted, but that some Believers do in Fact <hi>persevere,</hi> through Grace and Strength received from the Lord Jesus Christ. Nor can it be doubted, but that Christ has <hi>purchased</hi> that Grace and Strength for 'em, which he bestows upon them. Now every justified Person is either interested in <hi>all</hi> the Redemption purchased by Christ; or only in <hi>Part</hi> of it.—If any are interested but in <hi>Part</hi> of it, they are but partly justified, which is too great an Absurdity to be supposed.—If they are interested in <hi>all</hi> the Redemption of Christ, upon their believing in him, they partake of all the spiritual Blessings, that any others are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to; and consequently <hi>persevere</hi> to eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>And thus the Case is accordingly represented in the Scriptures. <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 25, 26, 27. <q>Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it to himself a glorious Church, not having

Spot or Wrinkle or any such Thing; but that it should be holy and without Blemish.—<hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 14. Who gave himself for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all Iniquity; and purify to himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.—<hi>Heb.</hi> x. 14. For by one Offering he hath perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever, them that are sanctified.</q> By which Texts and many others that might be cited, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Christ has purchased sanctifying and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing Grace for Believers. From whence they may confidently draw this comfortable Conclusion, that they are <q>begotten again to a lively Hope, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Dead, to an Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for them: Who are kept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. This is likewise evident from the Tenor of the <hi>Gospel-Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Lord Jesus Christ has purchased persevering Grace for Believers; so God hath, in a Way of Covenant, obliged himself to bestow it upon all such. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiii. 5. <q>Although my House be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all Things and sure.—<hi>Isai.</hi> lv. 3. I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure Mercies of David.—<hi>Isai.</hi> lxi. 8. I will direct their Work in Truth; and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them.—<hi>Jer.</hi> xxxii. 40. And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good: but I will put my

Fear into their Hearts, that they shall not depart from me.—<hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvii. 26, 27. Moreover, I will make a Covenant of Peace with them, it shall be an everlasting Covenant—Yea, I will be their God; and they shall be my People.—<hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 10. For this is the Covenant that I will make with the House of Israel, after those Days, saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts; and I will be unto them a God, and they shall be to me a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q>—By these cited Scriptures, we see the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace. It is <hi>a Covenant everlasting and sure;</hi> a Covenant, that <hi>he will not turn away from them to do them Good,</hi> that <hi>he will put his Fear in their Hearts,</hi> that <hi>he will put his Laws in their Minds, and write them in their Hearts; and</hi> (what is full to the Purpose) a Covenant, that <hi>they shall not depart from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And agreeable to the Tenour of this Covenant, we have repeated Assurances in Scripture, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers actually shall be preserved through all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Dangers, and Temptations, to the heavenly Kingdom. Thus, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxvii. 28. <q>For the Lord loveth Judgment; and forsaketh not his Saints; they are preserved for ever.—<hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 14.

shall Tribulation, or Distress, or Persecution, or Famine, or Nakedness, or Peril, or Sword?—I am persuaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things present, nor Things to come, nor Height nor Depth, nor any other Creature, shall be able to separate us from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.—<hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 29.

For the Truth's Sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</q>—From these, and Multitudes of such like Scriptures, it is most apparent, that God has by Covenant, by his immutable Promise, and the gracious Encouragements of his Word, secured the Confirmation, Establishment, and final <hi>Perseverance</hi> of true Believers.</p>
            <p>And is he not <q>faithful that has promised? Will he not guide them by his Counsel; and afterward bring them to Glory? Will he not strengthen them? Will he not help them? Yea, he will uphold them by the right Hand of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>—Believers may certainly and safely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Faithfulness of God: for his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are all yea, and all Amen in Christ.</hi> They may depend upon it, that their <q>whose Spirit, and Soul, and Body shall be preserved blameless, unto

the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: for faithful is he that calleth them, who also will do it.</q> (1 <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 23, 24.) Verily if his Covenant be not with Day and Night, if he hath not appointed the Ordinances of Heaven, then will he alter the Word that is gone out of his Mouth, and suffer his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to fail, in regard to the Covenant of Grace and Promise of eternal Salvation to Believers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Perseverance of the Saints is likewise evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and certain from the <hi>Intercession of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are told, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 25. that <q>Christ is able to save to the uttermost, all them that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for them.</q> And, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 1. <q>If any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</q> And may we not from this comforting Consideration, make the same Challenge as the Apostle does? <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 34. <q>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at the right Hand of God, who also maketh Intercession for us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ for Believers (I think) is unitedly and universally understood, his pleading the Merits of his Blood, &amp; applying the Benefits of his Redemption, for the increasing or renewing their Graces, for the renewing their Pardon and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for their final Confirmation and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is his <hi>appearing in the Presence of God for them,</hi> his pleading the Causes of their Souls in the Court of Heaven, representing their Persons before
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:004710_0252_0000000000000000"/>
the supream Judge and Governour of the World, making Reconciliation for their Sins by a new Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Sacrifice, and perfuming their Persons and Services by the Incense of his Merits. It is his <hi>praying the Father,</hi> and thereby procuring for them, that they receive of his Fulness, even Grace for Grace, and be carried from Strength to Strength, through all the Opposition they meet with from their own Hearts, from Satan, or from the World, until they are <hi>presented without Spot, faultless and unrebukable,</hi> before the Throne of their Judge, with exceeding Joy.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ, is either promised to <hi>every</hi> justified Person, as such; or but to <hi>some</hi> true Believers, in Distinction from others.—If the <hi>latter,</hi> then some justified Persons must have Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of <hi>their own</hi> to recommend them to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of Christ, which others want. There must be something that distinguishes their Case; and makes this infinite Difference between them and others. An Interest in the Benefits of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, it cannot be: for these every justified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son equally partake of. It must therefore be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own; and consequently they must be Partners with Christ in the Merit of their Salvation; and they must have something to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ast</hi> of, which others have not. But this is opposite to the whole Scheme of our Salvation by Christ; and therefore absurd.—If on the contrary, the Intercession of Christ is promised to every justified Person, then every one that <hi>is justified, shall be also glorified:</hi> for Christ's Intercession is always effectual.—If we are interested in Christ by Faith, we are interested in a whole
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:004710_0253_0000000000000000"/>
Christ, and all his Benefits. If we are interested in all the Benefits of Christ's Redemption, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in his Intercession, which is one of them; and if so, we may safely conclude, that he will "save to the uttermost, seeing he ever lives to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us."</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is also evident from the <hi>State of Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> which the Scriptures every where declare Believers to be in.</p>
            <p>Thus we read, <q>Therefore being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God thro' our Lord Jesus Christ. By whom also we have Access into this Grace, wherein we stand; and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God. For if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life. And not only so; but we joy in God thro' our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have received the Atonement. <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1, 2, 10, 11.—Now the God of Peace fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing. <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 13.—Our Consolation also aboundeth by Jesus Christ. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 5.—And the Peace of God which passeth all Understanding, shall keep your Hearts and Minds, through Christ Jesus. <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 7.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let it be consider'd: What Joy and Peace can the Believer possibly obtain, or entertain, from the clearest Evidences of his <hi>Justification,</hi> if he has no <hi>Promise</hi> to rest upon, that he shall <hi>continue</hi> in his present happy State; and has consequently before him
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:004710_0254_0000000000000000"/>
a dark and distressing Prospect of final Apostasy, and eternal Perdition, as possible to happen to him, and as certain in Case a merciful God do not <hi>uphold him by his free Spirit!</hi>—If it be answered, that he may find Peace and Comfort from the supporting <hi>Hope,</hi> that in a Way of diligent Duty he shall from Time to Time obtain <hi>new Supplies</hi> of Grace; and be finally establish'd in the Possession of his Inheritance: I would inquire, what <hi>Foundation</hi> he has for such a supporting Hope, as will afford him Joy and Peace in believing?</p>
            <p>Can he found it upon <hi>his own good Frames,</hi> and present Purposes, or Resolutions? This were to set his Foot upon a Quicksand. <hi>He that trusteth in his own Heart, is a Fool.</hi> Alas, he knows by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that his <hi>Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately wicked.</hi> He knows, that he has an allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World, a tempting Devil, and the contagious Examples and Enticements of wicked Men to deal with: and if that be all his Encouragement, the Probability is every Way against him; there is a much greater Prospect of his final Apostasy, than of his Perseverance. This therefore can afford him no Peace. He can't rejoice in this gloomy and dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing View of his Case.—Where then can he found his Hope?</p>
            <p>Can he found it upon the <hi>Grace of God,</hi>as being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him? This would indeed afford him Peace and Comfort, if he had any Promise to build upon. But alas, according to the Opinion I am opposing, his present Faith gives him no Security of future Grace. God has not promised (and therefore the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:004710_0255_0000000000000000"/>
Believer can't conclude) that he shall not yet be left to a hard Heart and a reprobate Mind, to final Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Impenitence. All his Expectations of future Supplies of Grace may (for ought he knows) be vain Presumption. And what Joy or Consolation can flow from thence? What <hi>Peace</hi> can he find in <hi>believing,</hi> when he has no Encouragement, but what belongs to the <hi>Unbeliever,</hi> as much as to him?</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be pretended, That this Hope, from which he should derive his Comfort, may be founded upon his <hi>sincere</hi> Endeavours to live to God, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the Graces, and to discharge the Duties of the christian Life.—But I must yet inquire, what he has to depend upon for <hi>maintaining</hi> the Exercise of this pretended Sincerity? He may imagine himself <hi>sincere</hi> to Day; and yet under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Corruptions, prove a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> to Morrow; and in that Case what would become of his Hope and Peace? Or what would become of 'em for ever, if he should <hi>die</hi> in such a State?</p>
            <p>Should it be even supposed, that the <hi>common Grace,</hi> which is generally communicated to such as live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gospel-Light and Advantages, were <hi>sufficient</hi> to support this Hope; yet this Concession would Nothing affect the present Argument. For how does that Hope flow from Faith in Christ, which is common to the Unbeliever? How is that Peace the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our <hi>Justification,</hi> which is common to the <hi>Christless</hi> Sinner, as well as to them that are <hi>in Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, how can the Believer have <hi>the Peace of God which passeth all Understanding, to keep his Mind and
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:004710_0256_0000000000000000"/>
Heart,</hi> without a well-grounded Hope of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? How can he have such a Hope, without any Security of his Continuance in a State of Safety, either from his own Qualifications, or from a divine Promise? Indeed how can he possibly have any such Security, while actually always liable to a final Apostacy?—It therefore appears to me, that by this Opinion, the Believer must be <hi>left comfortless;</hi> and the Scriptures I have cited, with a great many others of the like kind, must be wholly unintelligible.—But blessed be God, there be many, who from happy Experience can <hi>set to their Seal, that God is true,</hi> from a <hi>lively Hope, a Hope that maketh not ashamed; because the Love of God is shed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be <hi>objected</hi> against the Doctrine of <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> That it is <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi>—<hi>Noah, David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did fall from Grace. And that we find by our own <hi>Observation,</hi> some of the most flourishing Professors, who for a Time appeared very eminent Christians, have finally apostatised.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Answer</hi> to this, it must be remembred, That it is not the present Inquiry, what <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Declension</hi> from a Life of vital Piety, is consistent with a justified State: But whether any justified Person will <hi>finally</hi> apostatise. Let it therefore be considered, whether any of the Instances mention'd in the Objection, or any other that can be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, will necessarily produce this Conclusion, That a Man may fall finally away from a true lively Faith in Jesus Christ, and from a State of Favour with God,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:004710_0257_0000000000000000"/>
and so perish eternally. This must be proved; or the Objection is nothing to the Purpose.—But I think there is no Instance in the Bible, will support that Conclusion. The Instances commonly brought by our Adversaries, are the Falls of such Believers, who are <hi>now glorified Saints</hi> in Heaven: and they are therefore exceedingly impertinent to the present Purpose. How does it appear, that true Believers may <hi>finally</hi> apostatise, because some true Believers have fallen into Sin, who did <hi>not</hi> finally apostatize?—That <hi>the righteous may fall seven Times, and rise again,</hi> is what I make no Doubt of. But that the true Believer may <hi>finally</hi> miscarry, is what: I could never see proved from any Instance on Scripture-Record.</p>
            <p>And as for the Plea from <hi>our own Observation,</hi> it proves nothing but the Shortness of our Sight, and our Incapacity to search Men's <hi>Hearts.</hi> Among the Apostles there was a <hi>Judas;</hi> who (though <hi>a Devil</hi>) was not discern'd by his Fellow-Disciples, till his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Treason proclaim'd his Hypocrisy. And there will always be <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> (among the Wise) who will never be distinguish'd by their Companions, 'till that Mid-night Cry is heard, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be likewise <hi>objected</hi> against this Doctrine of <hi>Perseverance,</hi> That it is contrary to <hi>Scripture:</hi> That there are many Texts of Scripture, which speak of the <hi>Righteous turning away from their Righteousness?</hi> and their finally falling from eminent Attainments in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="unknown:004710_0258_0000000000000000"/>In <hi>answer</hi> to this, my designed Brevity will not allow a distinct Consideration of the several Texts quoted by our Adversaries to this Purpose. I shall only in general observe, that I know of no Text in the Bible, which supposes a <hi>total and final Apostasy</hi> from a saving Faith in Christ, or from a justified State.</p>
            <p>That Men may fall from great. Attainments in <hi>moral</hi> Righteousness, is frequently supposed; and that such might have apostatised from the <hi>Profession</hi> of Christianity, who had obtain'd the <hi>miraculous</hi> Gifts of the Holy Ghost, seems to be insinuated, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4, 6. But as in this Text there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of <hi>Repentance</hi> towards God, or of a saving <hi>Faith</hi> in the Lord Jesus Christ; so, I think, upon Trial it will be found, there is no Text in the Bible, that gives the least Hint of any Man's totally and finally falling away from <hi>such</hi> Attainments.</p>
            <p>I have already shewn, that the contrary is asserted in the plainest and strongest Terms; not meetly in some few and doubtful, but in Multitudes of clear, plain and express Texts of Scripture. And as for any other Passages of a more dubious Aspect, they ought to be so interpreted, as that one Place of Scripture should not be made to militate against another. And in this Case, the Appeal may be made even to our <hi>Adversaries</hi> themselves, whether the Advantage is not every Way on our Side of the Question.</p>
            <p>Could they prove, that Christians may finally apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statise from every Attainment <hi>short</hi> of justifying <hi>Faith</hi> it doth nothing affect the Case before us. Could they
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:004710_0259_0000000000000000"/>
prove, That Persons of distinguishing Eminence in Morality, <hi>as touching the Righteousness which is in the Law, blameless;</hi> That such who boldly profess the Truths of the Gospel, and conscientiously attend all the external Ordinances of the Christian Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; That such who have found great Comfort and Joy in their Christian Profession, and have been zealous in the Cause of Religion; That such who could <hi>give all their Goods to feed the Poor,</hi> and could even have <hi>given their Bodies to be burn'd,</hi> from their firm Belief of the Favour of God to them: And that such who with <hi>Balaam, Judas,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Demas,</hi> had the prophetick and miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost; That Persons of this Character may totally apostatise to a Life of Wickedness, Heresy, and even Atheism, it would make Nothing against the <hi>Perseverance</hi> of sound Believers: for all these Attainments may be supposed without the least Degree of true justifying <hi>Faith.</hi>—And more than this amounts to, I don't find so much as attempted by our Adversaries.</p>
            <p>If any should urge in this Case the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Care, <hi>lest when he had preached to others, he himself should be a Castaway:</hi> I answer, No more can be fairly argued from it, than that they who actually persevere to eternal Life, do obtain the End of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls, <hi>in the Way of Watchfulness</hi> and holy <hi>Diligence.</hi>—It does not prove, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> was anxiously afraid, he should eventually be <hi>cust away:</hi> but that he knew, <hi>he</hi> (as well as others) must use the appointed <hi>Means</hi> in order to prevent it, among which a Fear of Caution and Circumspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one, and of the first Importance.—Nor does
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:004710_0260_0000000000000000"/>
it prove, that any true Believer is liable to finally miscarry: but that they who do obtain eternal Life, must and shall persevere in the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> by which alone it is to be obtain'd and hop'd for. And this is the Character of every true Believer, that he doth persevere to eternal Life, in the Way of holy Vigilance, <hi>keeping his Body in Subjection, lest he should be a Cast-away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther it's <hi>objected</hi> against this Doctrine, That <hi>it opens a Door to Licentiousness.</hi> For (say they) if once Persons can imagine themselves in a <hi>justified</hi> State, they may give the Reins to their Lusts, and a Loose to their sensual Appetites; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing entertain Hopes of Salvation.</p>
            <p>I answer, the Objection is founded upon an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Nature and Properties of a true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Faith.</hi> A true Faith <hi>purifies the Heart, works by Love,</hi> and <hi>overcomes the World.</hi> No Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can upon good Grounds take the Comforts of a justified State; but from a Consciousness of these Fruits of Faith, the Purity of his Heart, and Sanctity of his Life. So that this Doctrine (whatever abusive Application may be made of it) has no direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to Licentiousness. But it is so far from this, that Nothing is, or can be, such a constant Source of real vigorous Christianity and vital Piety, as the Manifestations of the Love of God to our Souls, and the Evidences of his Favour. And it may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly determined, that such Persons cannot be in a justified State, upon whom the imaginary Evidences of God's Favour have a contrary Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="unknown:004710_0261_0000000000000000"/>All that now remains, is to make some brief IMPROVEMENT of what has been said.</p>
            <p>USE I. <hi>This teacheth us, that we have no grounded Hope of eternal Salvation, but what flows from the Evidences of our Justification.</hi>—Multitudes indeed presume upon Acceptance with Christ at his coming, that have no such Foundation to build upon. But alas! these are like to meet with a dreadful Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, when it comes to the Trial.</p>
            <p>Do they hope, that they may possibly be in God's <hi>Favour,</hi> though they want the<hi>Evidences</hi> of it? Alas, what can this mean, but that they hope though they don't know <hi>why;</hi> and that they hope, when they have no <hi>Reason</hi> to conclude, that they shall not be eternally miserable?</p>
            <p>Do they hope, from Designs and Expectations of <hi>future</hi> Repentance and Faith in Christ? At this Kate, why may not every impenitent Sinner in the World, entertain the same Hope, upon the same Grounds? But what Reason can any Man have, to expect an Interest in Christ <hi>hereafter,</hi> that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects him <hi>now?</hi> Such cannot expect it, from a Prospect of <hi>better</hi> Dispositions in <hi>themselves.</hi> For a Continuance in a Christless State will make their Hearts worse, certainly not better; 'twill harden, rather than soften them.—They can't expect it, from the <hi>Grace of God.</hi> For he has no where sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Offer of his Grace to 'em, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their future Acceptance of it. Surely the Neglecting, Abusing, and Affronting his Grace, is not the Way to obtain it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:004710_0262_0000000000000000"/>Do they entertain Hope, from the infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> and Goodness of God? But they ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he is just, as well as merciful; and that it belongs to his Name, that he <hi>will by no Means clear the guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do they hope in the <hi>Merits</hi> of the Redeemer? These are a sufficient Foundation of Hope, if they have an Interest in them; but not else. Their Hopes therefore can't justly be more than proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to their Evidences of this. All further Hope is Presumption. All further Expectations of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are like to end in Amazement and Confusion at last.</p>
            <p>With what Compassion should we therefore look upon a poor stupid presumptuous Generation of Men, who are crying <hi>Peace and Safety to themselves,</hi> while walking <hi>in the Imaginations of their own Hearts;</hi> and quieting their Consciences with Hopes of Heaven, without Experience of a Work of Grace in their Souls.—Alas, how vast is the Number of such self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving Hypocrites! How great a Part of our People every where, are thus weaving the <hi>Spider's Web;</hi> and are like to perish <hi>with a Lie in their right Hand!</hi> How very few, that have a rational well-grounded Hope of appearing at the right Hand of Christ, when he comes! And where will all the Rest appear, at the great and terrible Day of the Lord!—</p>
            <p>How much does it therefore concern us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

That we have chosen the Lord Jesus Christ for our Portion, received him upon his own Terms, and do depend upon him only, as <hi>the Author of our eternal Salvation;</hi> That our Faith in him is accompany'd with the concomitant Graces and Fruits of the blessed Spirit, in our Hatred of every sinful Way, in our Love to God and Christ, &amp; our Love to Men, especially the Children of God; and that we shew forth <hi>our Faith by our Works,</hi> by living to God, in an habitual Course of <hi>spiritual Thoughts, Tempers and Behaviours.</hi>—How much does it concern us, not to entertain Hopes of Salvation; but upon these or such like Evidences of our Justification!

            <p>USE II. <hi>This administers solid substantial Comfort to the true Believer, notwithstanding all the Darkness, Desertions, Troubles, and Temptations, that he may meet with in this militant State.</hi>—Though there be no Encouragement to any, to be careless and secure (This, as I have observ'd, would be an Evidence against their Sincerity and Hope) there is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, glorious Encouragement to <hi>the Mourners in</hi> Zion. <hi>Blessed are they that mourn: For they shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Christians, as have had special Manifestations of the Love of God to their Souls, are liable to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Darkness and Distress, when they have lost those sensible Views of God's gracious Presence.—The Time was, when they could clearly discover some lively Exercise of the Graces of the Holy Spirit:
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:004710_0264_0000000000000000"/>
but now their Souls are covered with Darkness and Deadness. They can't find those vigorous Actings of Faith and Love, which heretofore have warmed and comforted their Hearts. The sacred Flame now seems almost extinguished.—The Time was, when they were greatly refreshed by their Intercourse with Heaven, in the Duties of religious Worship. Then they could say, <q>Truly our Fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: <hi>but now</hi> their Beloved has withdrawn himself, and is gone; Their Souls cleave to the Dust; and they cannot quicken them.</q>—The Time was, when they could have such lively Impressions of the Things unseen and eternal, as carried them above the World and its Vanities, sweetned their Expectations of Death, and made them <hi>rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God:</hi> but now their Prospect is dark, their Faith weak, and their Hope almost cut off. This is ready to plunge them into the <hi>Psalmist's</hi> Discouragements and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. <q>Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favourable no more? Is his Mercy clean gone for ever? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in Anger shut up his tender Mercies?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But remember, poor Soul, that those whom Christ loves, he <hi>loves to the End.</hi> Tho' you cannot &amp; ought not to fit down contented in such a State; yet you may be supported with this comforting Conclusion: <q>There is no Condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus.—Who is he that condemneth those for whom Christ has died; or who shall separate them from the Love of Christ?</q> Your Father which gave you to Christ, <hi>is greater than all;</hi> and
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:004710_0265_0000000000000000"/>
none shall pluck you out of your Father's Hands. He has promised, that <hi>he will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee</hi> (Heb. xiii. 5.) And he will be as good as his Word. Trust in him therefore, with humble Courage and Confidence. Resolve with holy <hi>Job, If he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> Be content to follow him in the Dark. If you can find Comfort no where else, do as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> did in your Case: <q>Call to Remembrance the Song you have had in the Night.</q> Say of your Doubtings and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <q>This is my Infirmity; but I will remember the Years of the right Hand of the most High.</q> I will support my Soul with the Manifestations of the Love of Christ, that I have heretofore experienced: and I will renew my Pursuit of these blessed Manifestations, I will still <hi>follow hard after him,</hi> 'till I find him.—In this Way you will first or last know by happy Experience, that <q>Light is sown for the Righteous, and Gladness for the upright in Heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps you are afraid, that you may meet with such <hi>shocking Trials,</hi> as will be too hard for you. You may be afraid, that you may meet with <hi>Persecution</hi> for the Cause of Christ, and like saint-hearted Soldiers you shall quit the Field. Or you may be afraid, that you shall be terrified and dismay'd with the Approach of <hi>Death;</hi> and dishonour your Profession by your Terrors and Despondings.—If this be your Case, check your Unbelief, and say with the Psalmist, <q>Why art thou cast down, O Soul! Why art thou disquieted within me! Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, who is the Health of my Countenance and my God.</q>
               <pb n="251" facs="unknown:004710_0266_0000000000000000"/>
Though you have no Strength nor Sufficiency of your own to depend upon, is not the Power, the Goodness and the Faithfulness of God, a sufficient Refuge for your distressed Soul? Trust him. <q>The eternal God is thy Refuge; and underneath are the everlasting Arms. As thy Days, so shall thy Strength be. When thou passest through the Waters, he will be with thee; and through the the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walkest through the Fire, thou shalt not be burnt; neither shall the Flame kindle upon thee: for he is the Lord thy God, the holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.</q> He has been often try'd in such Distresses; and never yet fail'd those that uprightly believed and trusted in him. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be your constant Support, that he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who has promised, that "All Things shall work together for Good, to them which love God, to them which are called according to his Purpose.</p>
            <p>USE III. Let this be improv'd by Way of <hi>solemn Admonition to every one,</hi> to look to it that you <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> the Truth and Reality of your <hi>Justification,</hi> by your <hi>Perseverance</hi> in Faith and Holiness.</p>
            <p>Instead of encouraging your selves in a Life of Carelesness, Sensuality, and Security, from the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine before us, the Improvement of it should be the quite contrary Way.—If <hi>Perseverance</hi> be the certain Consequence of a justified State, then <hi>Apostasy</hi> in any from the Profession and Practise of Godliness is a sad Evidence, that such have never indeed attained to that safe and happy State. Every Degree of Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should therefore awaken you to the greatest
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:004710_0267_0000000000000000"/>
Watchfulness over your Hearts and Lives, to the greatest Diligence in Duty, and to the most earnest and importunate Applications to the Throne of Grace, for the Incomes and Influences of the blessed Spirit, to excite, quicken and invigorate you in the Ways of God.</p>
            <p>What though some of the Children of God, have been recovered from great and remarkable Falls into Sin? How much greater is the Number of those, that have securely flattered themselves with Dreams of their good Estate, but were not <hi>of them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the saving of the Soul,</hi> and finally have <hi>drawn back unto Perdition?</hi>—When you think of the Falls of <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter,</hi> and other Servants of God; think also of <hi>Judas, Demas, Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Phyletus, Phygellus, Hermugenes,</hi> with other Hypocrites and Apostates: And think that it's impossible for you to know, that you are not of the latter Sort, while in a <hi>backsliding</hi> Way, under the Power of your Corruptions.</p>
            <p>Instances of the Imperfections of the Children of God, are left on sacred Record, to comfort those whose Hearts are right with God, and are following hard after Him, notwithstanding their Darkness and Infirmity: but not design'd to encourage the careless and secure in their Declensions and Apostasies. <q>Thou standest by Faith; be not therefore high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear. Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</q> Press on with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and constant Diligence, <q>toward the Mark for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Christ Jesus:</q> always considering, that those, all those,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:004710_0268_0000000000000000"/> 
and none but those <q>who endure to the End, shall be saved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now unto Him, that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you saultless before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Glory with exceeding Joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, Dominion, and Power, both now and ever. Amen.</q>
