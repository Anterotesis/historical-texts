            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TOGETHER with theſe Letters, I beg leave to lay before my Readers ſome account of the ſteps by which I was induced to write them, and to ſolicit the exerciſe of candor and indulgence to their Author.</p>
            <p>I had gone to Sierra Leone with the hope of doing ſomething towards the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Miſſion to the natives; and, after a reſidence of fourteen months, I returned to England, from a conviction that I could not effect my purpoſe. I am fully of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Miſſions would ſucceed in thoſe parts, if they were taken up with proper ſpirit, and conducted in a proper manner. The natives are friendly and tractable, and appear deſirous of information in religion as well as in letters. The lives and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Miſſioners would be ſafe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> of life would be found plentiful and cheap; and European accomodations (as far as it is compatible with ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) might be procured at Free-Town, Bence Iſland, or from the ſhips which trade in that river. Independent of other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant things, which apply pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all Miſſions, I know nothing pecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar as objectionable to African Miſſions,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032281_0003_0FF1B199CFD223F0"/>but the matter of health. The inſalubrity of the climate has indeed been much exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated, but it will ever remain an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible truth, that the children of the North do not generally enjoy health and longevity under the line. Perhaps the heat of Bengal may be greater than that of Sierra Leone; but until the laſt place be brought into the ſame ſtate of cultivation as the firſt, it will not be found ſo healthy. Great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are daily making at Free Town, and the benefits, which reſult from them, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of health, are already felt in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But African Miſſionaries cannot enjoy the advantages of Free Town. They muſt, I conceive, become inhabitants of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive villages, and as thoſe villages ſeldom contain more than ſixty or eighty adults, I ſhould ſuppoſe, that, to effect the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the natives, Miſſionaries muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come itinerant, as well as ſtationary: ſo that they will be obliged to take the country as it is. Whether any Gentleman will come forward to countenance Miſſions there, or whether Chriſtian Miniſters of any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination will embark in the undertaking, time muſt determine.</p>
            <p>I ſaid I returned to England from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that I could not effect my purpoſe—this requires explanation. I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf to take a ſickly, delicate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and young children, and place them
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032281_0004_0FF1B19CD40624F8"/>in an African wood, where I muſt leave them for one half of my time, while I was engaged in rambling from village to village. Acquainted as I am with their health and habits, I could hardly indulge a rational hope of their being able to ſupport the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of ſuch a life for many months. Had I conſidered this point well, I had never gone to Sierra Leone; but, miſled by my partial attachments, I hoped what I wiſhed rather than what I had reaſon to expect. I hoped I might unite the Chaplainſhip of Free Town with my miſſionary purſuits, and by that means reconcile the duty I owed to my family, by providing them needful accomodations, with that duty I owed to God, in propagating his truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I had ſoon reaſon to ſee that my hopes, in that reſpect were unfounded and chimerical.—Whether this reaſon for my return will be thought ſatisfactory by others I don't know; but it is ſo to my own conſcience. This, as far as I know myſelf, was my <hi>principal</hi> reaſon for relinquiſhing the undertaking; for though I had other reaſons of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable weight which concurred to influence my conduct, yet I believe ſuch is my predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction for the ſervice, that had I been a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man, I ſhould have perſiſted in my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe notwithſtanding all the remonſtrances of my judgment. The reaſons I refer to are the following. The more I conſidered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032281_0005_0FF1B19E841AD7A0"/>of a Miſſion, eſpecially in a country like Africa wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re the tribes are thinly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the more I was convinced that very little was to be done by one man, or even by three or four men. As a miniſter of the eſtabliſhment I did not dare hope to find miniſters to act with me. If in this I have wronged the Church to which I belong I am ready to aſk pardon; and ſhall rejoice to find facts to diſprove my judgment, and to ſhame my temerity. Whether other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries would be ſent there, with whom I could act in uniſon was very problematical. From the ſmall ſample I had of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and ſufferings of ſuch an undertaking, I had room to entertain a very ſerious doubt whether I had piety and ſtrength of mind for a Miſſion. The united force of all theſe reaſons determined my judgment, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ever will determine it, to decline all perſonal engagement in the ſervice.</p>
            <p>If my readers are curious to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did nothing in Africa as a Miſſionary, I am ſorry that a regard for truth obliges me to anſwer, <hi>nothing</hi> but preach one ſingle ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, by means of an interpreter. If they ſtill enquire but could you do no more? I confeſs ingenuouſly, I might have done more than I did; but nothing like what thoſe who are unacquainted with my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there may expect I ought to have done. I had gone out with a full determination to
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032281_0006_0FF1B1A01A64AB08"/>ſpend ſome months at King Nambanna's town, which is on a ſmall iſland about ten miles from Free Town, and I had every reaſon to promiſe myſelf all kindneſs and encouragement from that worthy old man. But it was four months before my Colleague joined me, and ſet me at liberty from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of the colonial chaplainſhip. At this critical time, when I was preparing to go to Robanna, the king was ſinking under a malady which in a few weeks carried him off. His town then became the ſeat of bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanal riot for two or three months, while the King's Cry, or funeral rites were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; and, not many weeks after, my Colleague was called to the Weſt Indies, when my duty in the Colony, finally exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poſſibility of reſiding any time among the natives. I might have preached a dozen or twenty ſermons in the ſame way I preached the firſt, and my reaſon for not doing ſo, is not much to my honor. The truth is, I ſaw I could not carry my point—I felt I had acted precipitately—I charged myſelf with folly and vanity—I lamented having left my Pariſh in England—and having placed myſelf in a ſituation to which I began to think divine providence had never called me—I had ſtruggled through much oppoſition—ſuffered ſome reproach—and had ſtaked all I had to ſtake, on an engagement of which I could make little or nothing—and
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032281_0007_0FF1B1A7A6BFDC60"/>I anticipated every reproach and cenſure I was to ſuffer when I return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to England. My ſpirits were broken, ſleep and appetite forſook me, and my health ſuffered infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more from the exerciſes of my mind, than in did from the influence of climate, and from diſeaſe. Not being able to do what I wiſhed rendered me incapable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was really in my power. It ſhould be obſerved that preaching four or five time a week in the Colony, was ſome labor; and that as in the laſt few months the rains and a ſmart fever impeded my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, ſo for the firſt four months after my arrival, I could find no place to lay my head aſhore, and my confinement on ſhip board was not favorable to my miſſionary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
            <p>Unſucceſsful in my own attempts, I could not diveſt myſelf of the intereſt I took in Miſſions; nor could I conceive that the failure of a hundred attempts of the kind ought to diſcourage Chriſtians from obeying the plain commands of Chriſt, and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a duty which would be obligatory ſo long as there were Heathens in the world. The ſubject appeared to me to ſleep in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. I perceived there were reaſons why Miniſters declined calling general at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it. One of the firſt things a man would here, who ſhould write to engage others in Miſſions is. Why do you not engage
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032281_0008_0FF1B1A9315D9E78"/>in Miſſions yourſelf? He would find much to cenſure, and little to commend; and we all know the inevitable conſequence—<hi>retati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi> If he mean reproof ſhould be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, he muſt preſs it home; and when that reproof came addreſſed to the Miniſters of Chriſt, he could not avoid ſome appearance of arrogance and ſelf-opinion. Nevertheleſs, I thought it ought to be done by ſome body; and as I had gone ſo far, I was willing to go a little farther. I had ſuffered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and I determined whatever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might be of laying the ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, I would meet them, rather than leave any thing undone which I could do to ſerve the Heathens. I therefore wrote theſe letters before I left Africa, and after much heſitation, and being often ready to throw them in the fire, they are now print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Since they came from the preſs, I have had an opportunity of collecting the opinions of ſeveral friends, ſome of which were of a nature ſo far from flattering and pleaſant to my feelings, that I immediately ſtopped the ſale of them, and have delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated earneſtly whether I ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them to oblivion. But after continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome days in a ſtate of painful ſuſpence, I determined to venture them into the world, only cancelling the firſt preface and ſubſtituting another, in which I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſupport my claim to be treated
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:032281_0009_0FF1B1ADB03245A8"/>with candor, ingenuouſly confeſs what I conceive to be the faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of my book, and promiſe if I lived to make a ſecond edition, to ſtrike out, or correct every paſſage which I can deem as really objectionable.</p>
            <p>That I have failed, in ſome reſpects, in writing theſe Letters I can eaſily believe. I ventured on no eaſy taſk; and it might well have exerciſed the humility, meekneſs, courage, and wiſdom of the moſt aged and experienced Miniſter, to have delivered the truths I have done, in ſuch a manner as not to expoſe himſelf to reproach on one or other quarter. What I thought truth in my ſecret ſoul, I have avowed openly on the houſe top, without reſerve, and without palliation. But accuſtomed to receive the moſt mortifying truth myſelf, I have not been ſufficiently careful to reeommend it to my readers by ſoftening the ſeverity of her aſpect. Occupied wholly with the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and dignity of the ſubject, I have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to conciliate that eſteem for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſeems neceſſary to gain attention to the ſubject itſelf. The ſubject unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called for ſevere cenſure, and I was more warmly intereſted in it than on any other which could have employed my pen. I feared lenient applications would defeat my purpoſe in writing, and in bending all my ſtrength to enforce what I had to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and to be felt as well as read, I may
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:032281_0010_0FF1B1AF3A55F1D8"/>have been betrayed into a degree of aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which carries in it an air of ſelf-import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of diſreſpect to my Brethern in the miniſtry. On a favorite ſubject I may have played the egotiſt. Having never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed my pen in this way, I have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no aid from thoſe decencies of addreſs, to which he is accuſtomed, who is practiſed in the habit of writing. That I have been in any degree actuated by malice I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious; and, for a moment, to degrade and vilify the ſervants of Chriſt, was as far from my intention as to blaſpheme Him they ſerve. If I have pained any worthy mind, but eſpecially if I have injured reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and her Miniſters, I ſhall not only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it as my misfortune, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God confeſs it as my <hi>Sin,</hi> with ſhame and ſorrow. Having meant well, ſhall never juſtify me to myſelf for having expreſſed my good intentions with impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per language, and in an improper ſpirit.—I wiſh the raphſodical addreſs to Europe in the Eighth Letter had been exchanged for a few ſtrong facts and plain arguments. I wiſh the laſt few ſentences of my cenſures on the Eaſt India Company had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged from my Seventh Letter, as petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and irritating— I wiſh the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I wiſh I had ſoftened ſeveral other ſtrong touches of my pen, and that the whole book breathed more affection, and had leſs ſpirit. But were I to write the whole over again, I fear while I corrected one fault I ſhould commit another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the heavieſt cenſure that has been paſſed on my Letters be juſt, they ought to be deſtroyed; for ſhould I write them ten times over, they will always have ſtamped upon them the characters of my own mind. If vanity be their prominent feature, I ſhall not eaſily learn to be meek and lowly in heart; and until I can regenerate myſelf entirely, whatever I write will have one or other diſguſting feature of the man of ſin. But whatever the ſentiments of good men may be of me and my poor performance. I promiſe to labor to conform to them; for it will be ſafer to ſtand by their opinion than by my own.</p>
            <p>I hope the ingenuouſneſs of this preface m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But before I take my leave may I not ſubmit to ſuch of my readers as fear God the following queries? Can a fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like me, obſcure the ſun? Shall my faults call more ſtrongly for your cenſure than the miſeries of millions call for your pity and relief? Should the cauſe of Chriſt be implicated with the defects of a character like mine? Will gold become droſs in the hand of a ſhoe-black, or one truth in this book be falſified becauſe it is written by my pen?</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave to preſent my tribute of the general approbation due to the Rev. Mr. Carey, a Miniſter of the Particular Baptiſts, for publiſhing two years ago, "An Enquiry into the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians to uſe means for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Heathens." I recommend the peruſal of this treatiſe to my Readers; and, if it may operate as an inducement with them to comply with my requeſt, I have the pleaſure to aſſure them, that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman has given to his precepts the force of example, by actually embarking in a Miſſion to India.</p>

               <p>FROM the pulpit, and from the preſs, we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hear loud calls on Chriſtians to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the intereſts of their ſeveral Churches. One while, we of the Eſtabliſhment turn the attention of our brethern to the alarming progreſs of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and exhort each other to a ſkilful oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Sectaries. Another while, Diſſenters rouſe the languid zeal of their people, deſcanting on the excellence of their own modes of faith and worſhip, and indulging vehement invective againſt the avarice, the ſloth, and the lordlineſs of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians. We talk of the <hi>Intereſts of the Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, the Diſſenting Cauſe, the Baptiſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Intereſt, the Methodiſt Cauſe,</hi> and the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:032281_0014_0FF1B1BB8E3D7E18"/>like, until we loſe ſight of the <hi>Chriſtian Cauſe, the Common Intereſts</hi> of mankind, and the diligent, peaceable ſervice of our Maſter. Thus do we forſake the ſublime of religion, ſink into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of partizans, and inſpire our flocks with a fierce, ſectarian zeal. We firſt baptize our ſecular intereſts and evil tempers into the name of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted and lowly Jeſus; and, then, contend for them, with as much warmth and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nacity, as tho' they involved our ſalvation. Is not this to fight for Barabbas, and to crucify Jeſus?</p>
               <p>While we are engaged after this goodly ſort, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity increaſes, immoralities are multiplied, the ſpirit of the world domineers in the Church; and its pomps and vanities inſult the ſtandard of the croſs. While the Miniſters of Chriſt ſleep, and indulge their eaſe; while they ſacrifice to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and muſes; while they aſpire to the reputation of polite learning, or profound ſcience; while they toil in philoſophical reſearch, or in planting and watering the tree of civil liberty, our Adverſary ſleeps not. With unwearied vigilance, he makes head againſt the kingdom of Chriſt; and, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with poſſeſſing his own dominions in peace, he wars on the little territory of Jeſus, makes bold inroads into the heart of Chriſtendom, and ſtrives to diſpoſeſs us of what we have won from his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by the labor of ages, and with the blood of an army of martyrs.<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent ſtate of France ſtrongly proves the aſſertion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But a few years have elapſed, ſince a learned Engliſhman entered upon a calculation to ſhew, that were the habitable world divided into thirty parts, nineteen would be claimed by the Heathen, ſix would fall to the Mahometan, and five only would remain to be apportioned among the divided
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032281_0015_0FF1B1C00BFB3320"/>followers of the catholic Jeſus. Whether this calculation be ſtrictly accurate is of trivial conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but we muſt all be deeply affected by the lamentable view of human nature which it affords us. Alas! if every ſincere Chriſtian may ſay, with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My heart teacheth me the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the ungodly;</hi> and, if to this, he may add, as we all allow he may, My own houſe, my own favorite ſect, my own privileged country, and the Chriſtian Church, give ſad teſtimony to the extenſive ſovereignty exerciſed by the God of this world, To what concluſion are we led with reſpect to the religious ſtate of the Heathen and Mahometan nations?</p>
               <p>The concluſion is obvious: if the nature of man be eſſentially the ſame, in every age and climate; and, if the Chriſtian religion be true, the people, who have not our advantages, muſt greatly ſuffer from the want of them; and bad as Chriſtendom is, the Heathen world muſt be much worſe, being ſunk more deeply than ourſelves in <hi>poſitive</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vice. If this mode of reaſoning be thought exceptionable, I appeal to matter of fact, as far as we are acquainted with it, by thoſe who have viſited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Chriſtian Miniſters are too well acquainted with the grand, excluſive privileges of Chriſtianity, to admit a doubt of what I aſſert. Whatever ſentiments, Reverend Brethern, may be entertained by others on this ſubject, you cannot be ungrateful for the bleſſings of revelation; and, whilſt you rejoice in thoſe bleſſings, you muſt have a benevolent deſire to communicate them to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>who know not the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi>

When we conſider this deep ſpiritual poverty of a major part of our fellow-men, we are admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it becomes us to do ſomething for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. On this we ſeem agreed; but, I am ſorry to remark, that we agree, more generally, to neglect our duty, than to acknowlege its obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Satisfied with the cold approbation of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which it is impoſſible for us not to feel, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs proſpects of wretchedneſs too oppreſſive for our faith and love; and conſole ourſelves with the unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible hope, that the Almighty will execute, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how, and at ſome time, by worthier hands, a work too great, and too dangerous, for us little men.</p>
               <p>Fathers, Brethren, Miniſters of Chriſt, in the preſence of God, I charge you—I charge myſelf, with betraying the grand intereſts of our Maſter, by refuſing to propagate his goſpel. I charge you with the habitual, open violation of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Go, preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> I charge you with the unſpeakable guilt of burying in a napkin, thoſe unſearchable riches, which the Apoſtle St. Paul thought it the honor of his life to preach to the Gentiles. Laſtly, I charge you with doing this without ſhame, without remorſe, and, almoſt without an effort to do the contrary. Theſe, Reverend Brethren, are heavy charges; but I ſhall not find it difficult to avoid the puniſhment of a calumniator, by ſubſtantiating them in the progreſs of theſe letters, which have for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſpread of the Goſpel, and the ſalvation of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>To this object, therefore, I ſolicit your attention. And, by the mercies of God, I beſeech you—by the blood of Jeſus, and by our common hope, grant me a patient hearing. Suffer not my obſcurity to operate as a prejudice againſt the cauſe I plead. I neither deprecate your cenſure, nor dare I deſpiſe it. But permit me to hope, that no infelicities of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032281_0017_0FF1B1C6294DA778"/>ſtyle, nor defect of genius, nor of judgment, with which the ſubject is propoſed, may be allowed to obſcure its ſplendor, or detract from its worth. Would to God that ſome one among you, whoſe name is venerable among the Churches, had ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward to ſave me from the odium of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs! But ſince You, who have characters to loſe, do not care to hazard them by becoming reprovers in the midſt of your brethren, allow me, who am without a name, to aſpire to the honor of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cenſure for telling truths, which none of us like to hear, or wiſh to believe; and for telling them, with that plainneſs which they require.</p>
               <p>When I conſider, on the one hand, the promiſe and faithfulneſs of God, who cannot lie, and, on the other, the noble cauſe I eſpouſe, I am animated with ſtrong confidence and hope. I come forward, not as a ſectary, nor as the leader of a ſect. I am not encumbered with polemic armour, nor heated with polemic zeal. It is not a queſtion in ſcience, politics, or morals, which I lay before you. The ſubject I aſſert involves the honor of our Religion, the ſincerity of her Miniſters, the glory of Chriſt, and the beſt intereſts of men. The delegation I pretend to is authoritative; and I am juſtified in ſpeaking, with all boldneſs, the truths of the God I ſerve, in the goſpel of his Son. Diſpenſe then, I beſeech you, with all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimentary forms; and allow me to addreſs you, with miniſterial freedom, and to plead the cauſe I have undertaken, with that undiſguiſed and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous warmth, which it is calculated to inſpire.</p>
               <p>He that fears men, when he ſhould ſpeak boldly for God; and timidly diſſembles truths, which, if felt aright, ſhould be told with the ſtrongeſt tones of abhorrence, indignation, and contempt, will hardly ſucceed in writing upon Miſſions. The ſubject calls for enthuſiaſm. It requires vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032281_0018_0FF1B1C8A837B720"/>Thoſe feelings which carried me acroſs the water, I ſtill cheriſh in my breaſt. They will never forſake me. I rejoice in them. I with to impart them to every Miniſter of Chriſt, and to every child of God. This I cannot hope to do, if I diſguiſe or palliate them. It would concern me much to incur the cenſure of treating my Brethren in the miniſtry with indecent freedom; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that truth, however ſevere, will offend the ſervants of truth: or that any of my Brethren ſuppoſe themſelves entitled to uſe freedoms with the laity, which they will not bear from the meaneſt of their own body. No, Brethren. While you criticiſe my letters, you will applaud my deſign. The eſteem you entertain for integrity will give mildneſs to your cenſures; and, whatever faults your better judgment may diſcover in this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, your good wiſhes will accompany it into the world, and your prayer of faith draw down the divine bleſſing upon it.</p>
               <p>From the mercenaries of the Chriſtian Church, my ſoul turns with loathing. Though I could move mountains, they would remain immoveable. Though I could inſpire every real Chriſtian with all the ſenſations of my own heart, the unprincipled wretch; who ſees nothing in the goſpel miniſtry but an affluent and genteel profeſſion, is vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to no ſentiment contained in theſe letters. Like Simon Magus, he, has neither part nor lot in this matter—Nor have I any thing to do with <hi>mere</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts. The waters flow no higher than their ſprings. The ſpirit of theſe letters is. I flatter myſelf, the ſpirit of Chriſt—a ſpirit which they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and, with the things of which, they are unacquainted. In their good opinion, I ſhall, therefore, think myſelf to ſtand high, if I may paſs for a well-meaning enthuſiaſt. Under God, Reverend Brethren, my hopes reſt on You, who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032281_0019_0FF131089D4BF060"/>are what you are called, <hi>Chriſtian Miniſters</hi>—on you who were indeed <hi>moved</hi> to engage in the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and are animated by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love of the Savior who ſo greatly loved you, and by a real regard for the loſt ſheep, for whom our great Shepherd died. You feel your charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You have bowels and mercies. You are the diſintereſted benefactors of mankind, and whatever concerns the kingdom of your Lord you call your own. For you theſe letters are written, and to you they belong. But, in them your pious flocks will, alſo, claim a part, as large as that intereſt, which they have in the Son of David.</p>
               <p>As the elect of God, holy and beloved, let us, then, mind the things of Chriſt, to whom we are ſet apart as a peculiar people; and revolve all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means of advancing that glorious kingdom, for the coming of which we daily pray. Such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations will diſpoſe our hearts to peace. They will beat down many controverted ſubjects, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent magnitude, to the humble level of their real importance. As we muſe the fire will kindle; and our Churches and public Meetings, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and cloſets ſhall atteſt the animated devotion, with which one Spirit ſhall teach us to cry, <hi>Let the people praiſe thee, O God, yea, let all the people praiſe thee!</hi> On a ſubject like this, we cannot think long without feeling its attractions. It will teach us to make our requeſts to the Inſpirer of every great deſign; and, then, to reſt on his grace, his power, and his faithfulneſs, to accompliſh the purpoſes of our hearts. As we advance, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements will vaniſh. Obſtacles will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when we learn to think them ſurmountable. Difficulties will be ſubdued, as we acquire courage to cope with them. And, when the honor, glory, and immortality of our ineſtimable reward, are ſet full in our view, no forms of death and ſuffering
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032281_0020_0FF1B1CF01189FD8"/>will affright us. Inſtead of that deſpondency, which has long frozen our benevolent wiſhes, hope, like the returning ſun, will bring an early ſpring and fruitful ſummer on our ſouls. The ſpirit of our religion, lulled to lethargic ſlumbers, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive with the energies of the apoſtolic age; and the Church will again become illuſtrious, by her victories over the kingdoms of this world.</p>
               <p>And Thou, Lord Jeſus, afflicted Father of the Chriſtian Name, bleſſed Martyr of Humanity, blameleſs Pattern, univerſal Prieſt, unerring Teacher, omnipotent King of Truth, of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and of peace, deign from thy glorious throne to ſmile on this weak attempt, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this poor offering! It is a tribute I preſent, for the life thou haſt given, for the blood thou haſt ſhed, and for the joyous hopes thou haſt inſpired, to cheer, and to direct my mortal pilgrimage. Meek Spring of heavenly Wiſdom, boundleſs Ocean of univerſal, ardent, unprovoked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcouraged Charity, pour thy Spirit into my breaſt, and into the breaſts of all thy ſervants whom I here addreſs. Teach me and them to intereſt ourſelves in this bleſſed work, as becomes men, who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by thy venerable name, and honored by the miniſtration of thy glorious goſpel! Baptize us with the fire of that love which is ſtronger than death! Delightfully oppreſs our gratitude with the everlaſting mountains of thy benefits, until every ſentiment of frail mortality be ſuppreſſed—until faith give us the victory over the world—over life and death, until love compel us to exclaim, <hi>Yea, doubtleſs, and I count all things but droſs that I may win Chriſt; and I am willing not only to ſuffer bonds, but to die for the ſake of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom I am crucified unto the world and the world to me.</hi>

               <p>THE genius and ſpirit of our religion, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters aſcribed to our Lord of the Second Adam, of the High Prieſt after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck, and of a Savior to all people, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of ſimilar ſignificance; the various ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſpeak of the benefits of his death and interceſſion, of his kingdom and reign; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and promiſes, loudly declare the intention of God, that this laſt and moſt perfect diſpenſation of the everlaſting goſpel ſhould be the religion of every tribe, and kindred, and tongue. Nay, we are repeatedly aſſured, in the moſt explicit lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that it ſhall be ſo—that the truth and mercy, the peace and righteouſneſs of our Meſſiah's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whatever temporary checks they may ſuffer, ſhall, in the end, overcome all oppoſition; and that altho' the river of God may, for a time, be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored and polluted, by the pernicious ſoil over
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032281_0022_0FF1B1D5216C4640"/>which it has rolled it's tide, yet it ſhall, at laſt, free itſelf from every foreign mixture, and ſend forth it's ten thouſand pure ſtreams, to gladden all the nations of the globe.</p>
               <p>How ought our minds to be affected by theſe proſpects? May we not infer from each article of this enumeration, and, much more, from the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate force of them all, that it is our obvious, bounden duty, as ſervants of God, as ſoldiers of Chriſt, and as friends of ſuffering humanity, to exert all our ſtrength in diſſeminating the goſpel? Is it not in our power to do, or, at leaſt, to attempt ſomething <hi>worthy</hi> of the cauſe? Have we not ſhips, which viſit every part of the world? Have we not money—money in abundance, if we were ſatisfied to live with Chriſtian ſimplicity, and could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to part with it, as men ſhould do, who have a better treaſure in heaven? Have we not miniſters who prefer this line of ſervice, and would gladly embark for the moſt barbarous clime, if they were aſſured of <hi>ſpirited</hi> ſupport, and had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope, that the fruits of their labor would not die with themſelves? And, if we really have it in our power thus to ſerve mankind, and to ſpread our Redeemer's glory, Is it not <hi>criminal, baſe, infamous</hi> to neglect it? Is not this infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated negligence an open violation of the precepts of both tables of the law? Do we love God, revere his majeſty, approve his precepts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourſelves bound, by every tie, to ſerve him, with all our talents, and with all our ſtrength? How does this love, this reverence, this approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this conviction, accord with the aſtoniſhing coldneſs, with which we look upon a world, full of cruel habitations; where virtue and piety ſkulk in corners; where ſin is univerſal, uncontrolled and almoſt unchecked; where the Eternal Majeſty is affronted by the abominable idols of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032281_0023_0FF1B1D6A8CE3290"/>and the beaſtly image of a corrupt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>We ſay, that to love our neighbor as ourſelves, and to do unto all men as we would they ſhould do unto us, is the conſentaneous voice of the Prophets and Apoſtles, of the law and goſpel. We ſay well; but do we do as we ſay, and practice as we believe? Do we love in word and in tongue only, or in deed and in truth? Speak ye deſolate ſhores of Africa; declare ye bloody fields of Indoſtan; bear your impartial teſtimony, ye numerous iſlands of the Weſtern and Pacific oceans! Alas! my Brethern, we dare not abide the iſſue of the appeal. We have not done unto them, as we would, were circumſtances changed, that they ſhould have done unto us. The richeſt fruit of our philanthropy has been a cold, ineffective pity. We have ſaid, Be ye free, be ye civilized, be ye converted; but we have eaten as heartily, ſlept as ſoundly, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as expenſively, and enjoyed every good thing within our graſp as freely, as though they had been as happy as ourſelves. We have had no fellowſhip with the Savior in his agony and bloody ſweat, in his prayers and tears for the ſalvation of mankind. Provided we may live in peace and comfort, do a little good in England, accumulate fortunes, marry wives, take care of our children, and <hi>creep</hi> into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at laſt, we appear ſatisfied to leave our Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to propagate his own goſpel in the world.</p>
               <p>To theſe conſiderations, which muſt have weight on ingenuous minds, permit me to remind you of the ſolemn ſanction of divine command. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are ſome of the laſt emphatic words of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as they ſtand recorded by St. Mark &amp; St Mat-thew:—<hi>Go into all the world, and preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every creature; and teach all nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032281_0024_0FF1B1D9C89DCF80"/>all things, which I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shall we ſay, theſe injunctions were laid on the Apoſtles only? Impoſſible! The genius of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and the ſpirit of the precept, forbid, ſuch an interpretation. Let it be obſerved, 1ſt. The Apoſtles did not preach the goſpel in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries beyond the limits of the Roman empire; and it was, in the nature of things, impoſſible that they ſhould preach it to all nations. 2. Had our Lord meant the command to oblige the Apoſtles only, it would have been ſufficient to promiſe his protection and bleſſing to the end of their lives and miniſtry, without adding that grand amplification, <hi>Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</hi> 3. The ſame reaſons, why the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſhould preach the goſpel to every creature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in all their force at this day; and ſo far from being antiquated and obſolete, gain new ſtrength with the lapſe of ages. 4. Whatever excluſive privileges the Apoſtles enjoyed, as the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgators of Chriſtianity, yet the office and duty of every miniſter of the goſpel is, in ſpirit and ſubſtance, the ſame as theirs. From all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, it appears, that when our Lord ſpoke theſe authoritative words, he had in contemplation all his miniſters of every age and nation, as well as his immediate diſciples; and that we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe engaging in miſſions, without contempt of his authority, and a ſhameful derilection of our duty to God and men.</p>
               <p>I made bold to charge you, Honorable Brethern, (implicating myſelf in the ſame charge) with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the grand intereſts of our Maſter, with the habitual, open violation of his commands, and with burying in a napkin the ſacred depoſitum of the goſpel. I think it unneceſſary to enter into a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032281_0025_0FF1B1DB6A0AA648"/>formal proof of criminations, which the whole tenor of theſe letters is intended to ſubſtantiate. But, after adducing, from the Scriptures, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under which we act, and juſtify our miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Britain, am I not authorized to appeal to your conſciences, and aſk you, Whether you are not guilty of what I lay to your charge? What monies have we ſubſcribed, what aſſociations have we formed, what prayers have we offered up, what animated exhortations have we given to our ſtocks and to one another on the ſubject of miſſions? How ſhall we exonerate ourſelves from the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crime of which we are guilty? Shall we ſay, we were ignorant of our duty? The world will reclaim, How dare you teach us our duty as Chriſtians, while you continue ſo groſly ignorant of your own duty as Miniſters? If we plead, that we had not ſufficiently conſidered our duty, is not every man juſtified in retorting, And why did you not conſider it, before you entered upon the goſpel miniſtry? In truth, we have no excuſe; and it will beſt become us, to bluſh and weep in ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to abhor ourſelves, and to repent in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>Were I ever ſo much diſpoſed, it would hardly be in my power to exaggerate our fin and ſhame. You know, better than I can tell you, that the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate reaſon of any, and of all the commandments, is the will and precept of God; and that we evince the ſame contempt of his authority, by the wilful neglect of one clear, poſitive duty, as though we neglected them all. According to the ſpirituality of the commandment we are chargeable with the perdition of all the poor Heathens whom our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might have ſaved: and aſſuredly, their ſouls will the Lord require at our hands. Contraſt the infamy of our conduct with the grandeur of our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032281_0026_0FF1B1E02323AE88"/>calling, and the powers of language fail to give juſt coloring to our ſin!</p>
               <p>Had the Apoſtles of our Lord, conducted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards us, as we conduct ourſelves to the Heathen world, not all the refinements of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, would have emancipated us from the worſhip of Thor and Woden. But bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their religion was of a different temper. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the commiſſion of their Sovereign, they declined not to engage in this warfare. Having counted the coſt, they entered into the combat, like men determined to conquer or to die. Confident of the ſuperlative excellence of the cauſe, for which they had drawn the ſword, they threw away the ſcabbard, and diſdained capitulation with the world. The love of Chriſt, which we coldly talk of, they warmly felt. They had beheld his glory, were witneſſes of his holy life and bleſſed death, his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over the grave, and his aſcenſion to heaven. Their faith was a commanding evidence of things unſeen, and gave a preſent ſubſiſtence to things hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, they knew, emphatically, by the witneſs of that Spirit in their hearts, which was at once tho ſeal of their adoption, and the earneſt of their inheritance, the <hi>immenſe grace</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. His poverty had made them rich—rich in grace, rich in faith, rich in the promiſe and vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God who cannot lie; nor would they have bartered theſe riches for all the kingdoms of the world, and all their glory. Poſſeſſed of a lively hope, they purified themſelves as God is pure; and, enriched by the liberality of Chriſt, they ſold their poſſeſſions and gave them to the poor, ſeeking for themſelves better riches. As ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims they expected to be hated by the world; and determining faithfully to diſcharge the miniſtry they had received, they knew they muſt ſuffer
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032281_0027_0FF1B1E32DF332E8"/>perſecution; and that men, who hated to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, would purſue to the death thoſe bold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who obtruded the holy light of truth, and forcibly diſpelled the darkneſs congenial to their crimes. To ſuffer for Chriſt was their glory and their joy. Stripes, chains, and death were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the higheſt honors of the kingdom of that Jeſus who expired on a croſs; beſtowed as the prize of valor, and the reward of extenſive ſervices and of the moſt approved integrity. Unawed by thoſe terrors which ſhake our breaſts, as far as reaſon would permit, they aſpired after theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; lived in hope of the crown of martyrdom; and envied the felicity of their fellows, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it before them. The croſs of Chriſt had crucified them to the world and the world to them. In the ſtrong light which flowed from it, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held poverty and riches, eaſe and torture, honor and infamy, life and death, with a placid mind; and the great world, and all that it contained, was contracted to a point of vanity, before the faded luſtre of that eye, which wept over its ſins and miſeries. Before that object of endleſs aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, adoration and love, they died to themſelves and revived again to live to him. They were not their own but his. His blood had bought them, and his love <hi>conſtrained</hi> them to do and ſuffer all things for his ſake. They had no reſerves, no drawbacks on their faith; but, having given in their names to Chriſt, they would have judged themſelves worthy of the fate of Annanias and Saphira, if they defrauded him of their lives and fortunes. With them, all was ſacred. It was their meat and drink to do the will of God, and to finiſh the work he had given them. The Apoſtles led the way and other Miniſters followed, from province to province, and from kingdom to king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Their King was in the midſt of them, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032281_0028_0FF1B1E806DAB708"/>they ſaw, by faith, that ſtandard, with that inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was afterwards feigned to have been ſeen by the politie Conſtantine. The world fell before ſuch combatants; and its pomps and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, its riches and honors, its ſcience and learning, its arts and arms, its potentates and gods, were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the doctrine of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>In this manner did the firſt Chriſtians propagate their religion, being mighty, in deed and word; and, living rather than ſpeaking great things, they put to flight all the armies of the aliens. Their conqueſts were marked, not with the blood of their enemies, but with their own. Truth and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs where their arms; and patient ſuffering, and the doctrine of a crucified Savior, above all miraculous gifts, were the true grounds of the aſtoniſhing ſucceſs which attended their preaching. But the tide of conqueſt was checked too ſoon; and although, for a few centuries, ſome illuſtrious names ſupported the honor of the Chriſtian arms, yet the myſtery of iniquity, which began to work in the days of the Apoſtles, quickly ſpread, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the roſe of the Church, ſubverting its faith, and corrupting its morals, until it begat a race of men more deſperately wicked than Heatheniſm ever bred, and ſuch alone as could be produced by the <hi>Corruptions of Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, I will not now demand your attention to the melancholy deſolations of the Church: nor is it my intention to ſoil, with a detail of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of a corrupt Chriſtianity, this letter in which I have endeavored to rouſe you from your ſlumbers, by enforcing the command of Chriſt; and, to provoke you to emulation, by exhibiting the labors and triumphs of the firſt believers. They have done greatly; and, though dead, they ſtill live and ſpeak to the followers of their faith. It is our part to record their actions, and to give
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032281_0029_0FF1B1EB18CF93E8"/>them the applauſe they have earned ſo well. But we muſt do more. We muſt tread in their ſteps, and derive encouragement from their example. We muſt <hi>prove</hi> ourſelves their ſucceſſors, by occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying the extenſive field they cultivated. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do this, the praiſes we laviſh on them, will be, as were the ſepulchres built for the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by the phariſaic Jews, the monuments of our hypocriſy and guilt. Surely, our Lord, his Apoſtles, his Martyrs and Confeſſors, lived and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for the benefit of England nor of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alone.—O my God incline us to call a faſt, to proclaim a ſolemn aſſembly, to bathe our altars with our tears, to confeſs our ſins and treachery, to ſound an alarm in God's holy mountain, and to animate each other to the glorious warfare to which we are pledged!</p>
               <p>The night is far ſpent, and the day is at hand. The latter ends of the world are fallen upon us, and we have many conſiderations to excite us, if it were poſſible, to more than apoſtolic labors. The Eaſt, from which the day ſprings from on high firſt vſited us, has long been loſt to Chriſt; and the creſcent of Mahomet ſtill uſurps the places where the croſs once triumphed. In the Weſt, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Antichriſt, accurſed of God and man, is ſinking under the reiterated ſtrokes of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. The God of the Chriſtians is baring his arm, and expoſing the nakedneſs of the Scarlet Whore with whom the nations of the earth have committed ſpiritual fornication. The prayers of the ſpirits under the altar are heard; and a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God is avenging the blood of his ſaints, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her to drink of the blood of her children. Yet a little while, and we ſhall hear the cry, <hi>Babylon the Great is fallen;</hi> and ſee the Almighty burning her, as with fire from heaven, by the very hands which erected and ſupported her hierarchy.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032281_0030_0FF1B1ECB1850468"/>The ſhouts of triumphant atheiſm, and the ſcoffs of a vain philoſophy invade our ears. Unheard of prodigies meet our eyes, and ſuſpend our ſouls with aſtoniſhment and horror. The ſame ſpirit and principles, which have regenerated one Chriſtian nation to atheiſm, are working in others, and will, probably, produce the ſame effect. We ſhall ſoon ſee kindling upon Spain, Portugal and Italy, that conflagration, which nothing but the pure ſtreams of the Reformation can extinguiſh. Even in this bleſſed land of civil and religious liberty, where religion has reared her moſt auguſt temple, we have much to fear; and no human wiſdom can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the Almighty may not purge our tin and droſs, with the ſame fire, which conſumes the wood, the hay and the ſtubble of Churches more corrupted than our own. Vain are all the admonitions of our Maſter, if we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſigns of the day, and put forth thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions to which they call us.</p>
               <p>It is not for the Potentates of Europe to guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee the welfare of Religion. She diſdains all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign aids. She calls not for the ſuccor, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the obedience of earthly Kings. We, the Miniſters of Chriſt, are called upon to give the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aids of which ſhe can admit; and ſhe demands our talents, our labors, our fortunes, our influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and our lives. Let us fly to the ſuccor of our beſt mother, the afflicted Church of Chriſt. O let us no more fall out by the way. Let liberal Churchmen and conſcientious Diſſenters, pious Calviniſts &amp; pious Arminians, embrace with frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal arms. Let the preſs groan no longer with our controverſies; and let the remembrance of the petty intereſts we have contended for be buried in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting oblivion. Let us vote that Miniſter, who turns one ſinner from the error of his life, a wiſer man than he, who demonſtrates the being of a God;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032281_0031_0FF1B1EE7251D9E8"/>and ſtudy to live and preach like St. Paul, rather than to ſpeak and write with Cicero. Let us for ever forſake the Schools; and build our religion on facts, and not on arguments; on the power of God, and not on the wiſdom of man. Chriſtianity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes herſelf to the heart. To the heart, then, which is the great ſtrong hold of Satan, and the inexhauſtible magazine of infidel ſophiſtry, let us direct our war. Let us be frequent in our pulpits, and from thence boldly denounce the menaces and promiſes of Heaven. Let the crucified Jeſus be the prominent figure of our goſpel; and be held forth, for what he really is, our ſtrength, our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and our ſalvation. Let us not viſit and converſe as other men; but always intent on the object of our commiſſion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> guardian angels among our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, adviſe, exhort, reprove with all long ſufferance and ſound doctrine. Let us not dare to bury our light for ſix days out of ſeven; but on every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſion, when our flocks can be convened, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our faithful diligence in declaring God's word. Let us beware of what the world calls <hi>Prudence;</hi> and ſee that we do not ſhun the croſs of Chriſt, and enervate his noble religion, by over anxious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to render it reſpectable to men of corrupt minds, deſtitute of the truth, and whoſe oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the goſpel, does not originate in the defect and obſcurity of its evidences, but in inveterate hatred of its holineſs and heavenly-mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>But let not our zeal, piety, and benevolence ſtop here. Let us caſt our eyes upon the Continent. Let us extend our views to the ends of the earth. Let us, henceforth, conſider it as our indiſpenſible duty to do all that lies in our power, to preach the goſpel to <hi>every creature.</hi> Let Miſſions be treated no more with cold neglect, or be vilified with charges of enthuſiaſm. But in public and private, from the pulpit and from the preſs, let us ſpeak of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032281_0032_0FF1B1F346333820"/>them as becomes their dignity; and recommend them, with that forcible and perſuaſive eloquence, with which the love of God and man ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us.</p>
               <p>If we do this, with becoming diligence and zeal, we ſhall ſoon have it in our power to confute a plauſible objection, with which infidels blaſpheme our religion. The partial diffuſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will then be ſeen to have originated, not with God, but men. The philanthropy of God our Savior will ſhine forth in its proper amplitude, as extending to all men; and we, the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſhall be made to confeſs, with honeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality and ingenuous ſhame, that the wretched ignorance and abominable vices of the Heathen are chargeable on our wicked diſobedience to our Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's commands. O let us no longer give place to unbelief, idly affecting commiſeration to that wretchedneſs, which we have it in our power to relieve; but ariſe and aſſert our integrity and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. We have the key of promiſe in our hands; let us uſe it with courage, and bring to light thoſe priſoners of many generations.</p>

                  </gap> we reflect on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in all its extent, we muſt ſee our labors in a very diminutive point of view. Were our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet the bloody Mahomet, were our religion a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032281_0034_0FF1B1F9A3A98FF8"/>mere moral ſyſtem, were its ſanctions of leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration than they are, were our own ſincerity and the welfare of the world not connected ſo intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are, in the propagation of Chriſtianity, I would celebrate our good deeds in the moſt jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſtrains. But, when I look on the myriads of men who <hi>lie in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> when heaven and hell open on my ſoul, and caſt their light upon our labors; or when I ſtand by the ſide of the ſuffering Savior of the Heathen, and my bible tells me, that He whom I ſee expiring in agony, is GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, ſhame, grief, and indignation oppreſs my feelings. I caſt up the ſum of our labors, and, amidſt ſuch objects, mark it with a cypher. Alas! it is evident, we are ſtill in the infancy of things; and that the miſſionary ſpirit has not yet warmed the boſom of the Church. Contemplate theſe objects, Reverend Brethern, which I have ſet before you; and ſay, Whether I can with truth and modeſty compliment you on our atchievements? Or can merit cenſure, for repeating the queſtion, What monies have we ſubſcribed, what aſſociations have we formed, what prayers have we offered up, what animated exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have we given to our flocks and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the ſubject of Miſſions? Greenland is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only Heathen Country, in which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine religion of Chriſt has gained a <hi>firm</hi> footing for ſeveral centuries.</p>
               <p>Neither a hiſtory of Miſſions, nor even a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of them, can have place in the narrow limits of my plan. A few obſervations on the views, with which they have been ſet on foot; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in which they have been conducted; and the ſucceſs, which has attended them, is all that I ſhall offer to your attention in this letter.</p>
               <p>Miſſions have ſometimes been ſet on foot with very improper views. Such were the Miſſions of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032281_0035_0FF1B1FF94BB9630"/>the Jeſuits in Paraguay, California, and other parts of Spaniſh America. Their end was the ſubjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poor ſavages to the dominion of Spain; and Chriſtianity was a mere ſtate engine, by which it was hoped the minds of freemen might with more facility, be bowed to the yoke of ſlavery. Whether thoſe good Fathers were more honeſt than their employers, and were really deſirous to conſult the happineſs of their converts, or were ſtimulated only by ambitious and lucrative motives, as they ſtand charged by their enemies, I will not preſume to ſay. But we know well what was the end of thoſe Miſſions. In one day, all the Jeſuits in South America were ſeized, their Order aboliſhed, and the ultima ratio regum—cannon and muſkets, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with ſuch good ſucceſs to the miſerable Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranis, that, if they were not made good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they were, at leaſt, converted into what the Court of Spain had much more at heart—paſſive, ſpiritleſs ſlaves. The Miſſions among the Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Indians, while that country made a part of the French dominions, appear to have originated in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar motives. Happily, their cataſtrophe was leſs bloody. The miſſionaries, indeed, fell by the hands of the untractable ſavages they would have converted to ſlavery and chriſtianized ſuperſtition. They themſelves ſtill remain to be exterminated, as tribes of their brethern have been, by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bayonet and American riflemen. The Miſſions of the Portugueſe in Angola, Abyſſinia, and India, had very different things in view than the ſalvation of men's ſouls. The ſame may be ſaid, I fear, of many other Catholic Miſſions. In this reſpect, Proteſtants are not ſo blameable: nevertheleſs, we are not, altogether, without having been actuated by unworthy views. Proteſtant powers have not made religion the pretext for conqueſt; for they have, in general, valued it ſo little, that provided
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032281_0036_0FF1B2011D86BF10"/>they might carry on their commerce in peace, and cut the throats of the Heathens, whenever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted their encroachments, they have left them to take care of their own ſouls; as if it was thought Chriſtianity could do them no good, and the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they ſuffered from us merited no compenſation. But, to quicken the ſlow movements of piety, even among Engliſh Proteſtants, ſome patrons of Miſſions have not diſdained to apply the ſtimulus of intereſt. Miſſions would civilize the ſavage—He would ſoon be taught to value European luxuries —Furs would purchaſe our coarſe goods. Thus were Miſſions connected with manufactures and commerce, and gain became a pedeſtal for godlineſs to ſtand upon. If this mode of reaſoning be thought allowable with thoſe, who are not to be influenced by more appropriate motives, I affirm, from certain knowlege, that it brings a ſlur on all undertakings of the kind. I add, that if ſuch an argument ſhould engage men of improper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to act in aſſociations for Miſſions, and to have any weight in the conduct of them, Miſſions will ſuffer more injury from their counſels, than they can derive benefit from their liberality. The giving <hi>glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> and the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>peace and good will among men upon earth</hi> are the only motives, which ſhould influence theſe attempts; and, if we think to promote the cauſe of God, by arguments addreſſed to the corrupt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of man, we ſhall cut off our legs, before we ſet out in the race.</p>
               <p>The manner, in which Miſſions have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, has been as different, as the views i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In South America, the ambition and avarice of the Jeſuits, or their piety (God knows which) were ſubſervient to the politics of the Court of

                  </gap>id; and this co-operation, ſo long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, gave an aſtoniſhing momentum to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. The Pope, the King of Spain, and zealous Catholics enriched their funds; and, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral lives of the Spaniards might not perjudice the Indians againſt the faith of Chriſt, they were prohibited from any intercourſe with the Nations, who were to be converted. The Jeſuits, on their part, embarked in the undertaking in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They conducted the enterprize with wiſdom, courage, and perſeverance, Many of them were the victims of their zeal; falling by the hands of the Indians, or in conſequence of the hardſhips they endured. The members of that learned Order were metamorphiſed into maſons, carpenters, and ſmiths, and at once, inſtructed their converts in the arts of life and in the truths of religion, They prevailed; and collected the wandering tribes into villages, where they appear to have lived happy under their lenient government. But the queſtion was, Whom theſe poor creatures ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege for their maſter, the Jeſuits, or the King of Spain? Hence thoſe jealouſies, which termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ruin of the Miſſions, and the abolition of the Order of Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>In Japan and China, we have memorable docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the proweſs of that celebrated Order. Francis Xavier was himſelf a hoſt. His labors were wonderful; and through every unhappy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium that we are to contemplate his character, he appears a man of the firſt magnitude. An eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, ſuperior to the queſtionable miracles, with which his biographers adorn his life, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the reverence in which he was held by the Japaneſe, and the hatred with which he was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his companions from Portugal. He ſeems to have been too good for their purpoſes. The men, who have ſince borne witneſs to his worth, were
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032281_0038_0FF1B20768D87B60"/>thoſe on whom his death is chargeable. It is well known, that this Apoſtle of the Indies expired in the Iſland of Sanchian, deſerted by all his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at the time he was endeavoring to penetrate into China.—But the indefatigable Sons of Loyala ſoon trod in the ſteps of this famous leader. After ſurmounting innumerable obſtacles, which were thrown in their way from the policy of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, and the contempt and jealouſy in which they held Europeans, they ſound means to recommend themſelves to the Emperor and the Mandarins of his Court; and obtained many privileges and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies for their Order. Their ſkill in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, Aſtronomy, and other ſciences, and their elegant and expenſive preſents of curious pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mechaniſm, gave them great influence in a kingdom, whoſe Monarchs have given the moſt diſtinguiſhed patronage to men of letters and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Their converts in Japan and China ſoon amounted to ſeveral hundred thouſands; numerous churches were built; books of religion were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into the native languages; and their affair wore an aſpect, ſo favorable, as to promiſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and extenſive eſtabliſhment of the Roman religion, in both thoſe empires.

They ſuppoſed the ſavor of the Sovereign the beſt ſecurity for their labors; and ſoon became accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed courtiers. The nobility, offended at the intereſt which a few obſcure ſtrangers had acquired with the Prince, united to deſtroy them. The Dominicans, who had been aſſociated in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, quarrelled with the Jeſuits; and their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ill offices rendered the Emperor ſuſpicious of

Great numbers of the Jeſuits and of their converts ſuffered with invincible fortitude; and, in their laſt moments, approved a hope full of immortality. Chriſtianity may be conſidered as exterminated in both thoſe great Empires; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that in the laſt, a few diſguiſed prieſts ſtill find means to conceal themſelves in Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Jeſuits ſtand convicted of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their proſelytes large indulgence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh ſuperſtition; but I ſee not why Proteſtants ſhould be <hi>ſurpriſed</hi> at their conduct, and much leſs, why Papiſts ſhould <hi>criminate</hi> it. Men, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſaint worſhip to that Moloch, Dominick, and other illuſtrious villains of the papal calendar, could not deal rigorouſly with the Chineſe, for ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar honors they paid to the benevolent Confuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and the ſpirits of their progenitors. Nor do I ſee, why we ſhould think ſo meanly of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. Thouſands of them died for their religion and if, amidſt all the trumpery of antichriſtian ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, we can diſcover ſpirits ſo pure and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated as thoſe of a Fenelon and Paſchal, I think there is great reaſon to believe, that the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing features of revealed religion, rendered doubly impreſſive from their novelty, might produce the moſt ſalutary effects on the converts of China and Japan.</p>
               <p>Of the attempts which have been made by the Society for Foreign Miſſions, I wiſh to ſpeak in handſome terms. But, I am ſorry to obſerve, that there is nothing on the face of the accounts of their proceedings, which have been laid, from time to time, before the Public, upon which I can ground a compliment. Their money and their labors have
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032281_0040_0FF1B20C40386968"/>been extremely unproductive; and, I fear very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is to be expected from that quarter, until a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alteration takes place in the ſpirit of the Church of England, and in the manner in which her miſſions are conducted. We ſeem almoſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of the zeal and courage required for theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. I believe the Society are frequently at a loſs to find miſſionaries; and, under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, are often obliged to take up with improper characters. We have no diſcipline. We have no common habits to unite our miſſionaries. They are thinly ſcattered in Miſſions, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the advantages of numbers equal to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, nor acting with united ſtrength and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, they cannot have great ſucceſs. Let cauſe and effect be compared together, and it will appear that theſe attempts have been as fruitful, as was to be expected from the manner in which they were conducted. The Society in Scotland for propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian Knowlege have deſerved well of their country; and have made many attempts to convert and civilize the North-American Savages. Some of their miſſionaries have been apoſtolic men, and God has bleſſed their labors with conſiderable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. They have evinced a true ſpirit of Miſſions, by expoſing their perſons to all the dangers and hardſhips of living among ſavages. If this Society has erred in any thing, it is in expoſing theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men ſingly and alone, to contend with all the diſcouragements of ſuch undertakings. This muſt have thrown a great damp on their activity, depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſpirits, injuring their health, and accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating their death. No human mind can at all times ſupport itſelf under diverſified ſuffering and diſappointment. If any man on earth needs the ſupport of a few kindred ſpirits to cheer his heart, invigorate his zeal and ſupport his patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, it is a miſſionary to Heathens. David Brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerd,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032281_0041_0FF1B20F58D14968"/>and a few ſuperior minds, may have walked through life, without the conſolation of a friend and comforter. But the converſion of Heathens will never be effected by a few ſuch characters. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon men muſt be employed, and Miſſions, to be ſucceſsful, muſt be rendered, as much as poſſible, common things. Perhaps, we are hardly juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in expoſing inſulated individuals in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of trial; and let them anſwer our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ever ſo well, their ſucceſs will always be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the object of Miſſions, which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive ſpread of Chriſt's religion. I know not that the Dutch have merited commendation by their miſſionary labors. I am equally ignorant of what has been done by the Swedes. The Danes are entitled to the approbation of their fellow Chriſtians for their labors of love in Greenland and in the Eaſt; but as I can ſpeak of them only in general terms, and my principal intention is to confine my obſervations to what has been done among ourſelves, I dare form no eſtimate of their ſervices.</p>
               <p>The Moravian Brethren, have been among us, what the Jeſuits were in the Roman Church. They have labored, and ſuffered, and effected <hi>more than all of us.</hi> Their motives have been pure; their miſſionaries unblameable; their ſelf denial, courage, hardihood and perſeverance admirable; and their ſucceſs ſuch as to give general encouragement. They have never provoked perſecution among the Heathens, nor incurred reproach among Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by a ſecular, ſordid, turbulent ſpirit. Their ſucceſs cannot be referred to the learning of their Miniſters, the richneſs of their funds, or the names and influence of great patrons. The caſe was for otherwiſe: in all theſe reſpects they have lain under heavy diſcouragements. We muſt then account for their ſucceſs upon other principles;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032281_0042_0FF1B2125FDD3618"/>and they are, I think, very obvious. Their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries have been men of ardent piety. The Brethren had it in their power to hold out no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper inducements to them. They are all of them volunteers; for it is an inviolable maxim, with the Moravians, to <hi>perſuade</hi> no man to engage in miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They ſeldom make an attempt where there are not half a dozen of them in the Miſſion. They live together in one family, and, where they find it neceſſary, labor with their own hands. Hence their Miſſions are leſs expenſive, than thoſe of any other people; they can engage in more Miſſions, than they would otherwiſe be able to ſupport; and their miſſionaries are enabled to ſubſiſt, where thoſe of other denominations would ſtarve. Their miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries are entirely of one mind, as to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they teach, their mode of inculcating them, and the diſcipline they exerciſe over their flocks. Their habits are congenial; and, accuſtomed for a courſe of years to give ſcrupulous attention to every rule of their Church, few caſes can occur to produce diverſity of judgments among them. They live together with the regularity of a monaſtic inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the frequent ſtated returns of devotional exerciſes keep up the ſpirit of piety. They have each of them their proper department in the family, and occupied as they are, with ſtudy, private and public devotion, preaching, and the various exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the paſtoral care, they have no time to be idle. If any of their miſſionaries are carried off by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or caſuality, men of the ſame ſtamp are ready to ſupply their place; and the office of a miſſionary does not go about knocking at a hundred door; doomed to be rejected by them all, as too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the Church of England Miſſions.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032281_0043_0FF1B2184D9A6430"/>together, and placed in circumſtances, where the zeal and abilities of an individual, however great, can effect little.</p>
               <p>The Methodiſts have lately entered upon this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, and bid fair to run it with the ſame ſucceſs. The character of their miniſters, the nature of their diſcipline, and the integrity of their views, are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar, in many reſpects, to thoſe of the Moravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But there are alſo ſome features, in which they are ſtrongly contraſted; and they will, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, produce a conſiderable difference in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſucceſs of their miſſionary warfare, both of a favorable and unfavorable kind. The zeal o the Moravian is calm, ſteady, perſevering. He would reform the world, but is careful how he quarrels with it. He carries his point by addreſs, and the inſinuations of modeſty and mildneſs, which commend themſelves to all men, and give offence to none. The habits of ſilence, quietneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent reſerve, mark his character. The zeal of the Methodiſt blazes, and burns every thing before it. He is open, active, bold, and ardent. He ſees himſelf in a puſhing world, and puſhes with the foremoſt. He cannot brook the general coldneſs; and, fearleſs of conſeque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ces, cenſures with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity what he deems cenſurable. He mixes in the world; makes a hundred different attempts to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his purpoſe; and, if baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt, which affords full ſcope to his activity. He lives in action; and is dejected and uncomfortable, if he wants active employment. The Methodiſts are know chiefly for what they have done at home; the Moravians for what they have done abroad. The Moravian diſcipline is more ſevere and complicate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a ſubmiſſion and docility in their people, again which the high idea of perſonal liberty that prevails in Europe, ſtrongly militates. The
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032281_0044_0FF1B219D6AB8338"/>Methodiſt diſcipline is more lax and liberal: and while it is ſufficiently ſtrict, in guarding men's, morals, it carries nothing in it to repel proſelytes. Itinerancy is the Palladium of Methodiſm. Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome favorable poſt, they revolve in a circle round it, perpetually making incurſions in the neighboring country, and multiplying their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits and their preachers in proportion to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. If they do not ſplit of themſelves, their is hardly any thing in the miſſionary line, which they may not attempt and ſucceed in. But they will not. I fear, be able to ſteer clear of perſecution, as the Moravians have done; nor do I conceive, that they have patience and perſeverence for a Greenland Miſſion. A Methodiſt preacher would think his life thrown away, in ſpending twenty or thirty years upon a few converts. And, I ſtarter myſelf, the Methodiſts are too well acquainted with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to engage in ſuch undertakings, while ſo many large and populous kingdoms are acceſſible to their labors.</p>
               <p>When we come to make a general eſtimate of the ſucceſs of Miſſions, both in the Roman and Proteſtant Communions, I fear, I ſhould be too li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral were I to ſay, that there are in the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world, one hundred thouſand <hi>genuine</hi> converts to Chriſtianity. And, if this be all we can ſhew for our labor, from the Reformation of Luther to the preſent day, I think it invincible demonſtration, that we have not taken up the matter with a proper ſpirit, nor conducted it in a proper manner.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing obſervations, I come to the following concluſions. Firſt, that if we continue to go on with Miſſions as we have done, we can hope for no better ſucceſs; and the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſurprize us quarrelling with each other in Europe, where we have earthly intereſts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our paſſions, and doing nothing in the reſt of the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032281_0045_0FF1B21B5F86DCA0"/>world, where all the intereſts of Chriſt are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, it will be more manly and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to renounce all our Miſſions, to deny the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of acting in them, and to acknowledge that we are mercenaries, who muſt be paid for our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſter, than thus to go on ſhamefully deceiving ourſelves, and endeavoring to impoſe on God and men, by a ſhew of zeal for religion, which has no real place in our hearts and conduct. Thirdly, miſſionaries muſt be united perfectly, in common principles and habits, and act with that energy which reſults from u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries muſt be ſound in larger numbers, and ſuitable funds muſt be eſtabliſhed for the work. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the beſt way of conducting Miſſions, and the conſideration of what ſteps it is incumbent on us to take in this buſineſs, will furniſh matter for my next Letter.</p>

But, at the requeſt of ſome friends, whom I have conſulted, and to whoſe judgment I owe much deference.

               <p>From Miniſters, as connected with each other, I expect, that they mutually communicate their views as to the moſt effectual methods of ſpreading the goſpel, and exhort each other to a generous and noble exertion of miniſterial zeal. I require them to form Aſſociations, for collecting money, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing information, procuring miſſionaries, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the variety of concerns, which fall under the conſideration of Miſſions. In theſe Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I wiſh thoſe Miniſters to come forward, whoſe character and ſervices give them moſt reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, and will enable them to promote effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe they undertake. Laſt of all, having once engaged, I would have the Aſſociation to be actuated by <hi>a true ſpirit</hi> of Miſſions. They ſhould be zealous, active, indefatigable. Any Miniſter who is not warmly affected to Miſſions, ſhould be excluded from the acting Committee. What theſe Gentlemen are, their miſſions will be. Having in their power the choice of miſſionaries, and the management of the Miſſion, they will not fail to give to the whole undertaking the features and complexion of their own characters.—This is the ſum of my requiſitions; and I ſlatter myſelf that there is in it, nothing irrational, nothing, to the performance of which our calling does not oblige us.</p>
               <p>The ſmall ſucceſs which has attended Miſſions ſhould incline us to ſuſpect, that they have not been conducted in the moſt eligible way; and diſpoſe us to examine with candor any new method, which may be propoſed.

                  </gap>. But as I do not preſume to dictate to any man on the ſubject; ſo I am aware that no one
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032281_0048_0FF1B2264A95B398"/>plan can be formed, which will equally apply to Nations, who differ in their degree of civilivation, their police, their religion, and the face of their country. Whoever, therefore, are intruſted with the execution of our plans, ſhould have the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary power, of deviating in their application, as the reaſon of the caſe ſhall demand. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation premiſed, a general view of the nature of Miſſions, and of the ſtate of the Heathen Nations, may enable us to infer ſomething as to the line of conduct moſt likely to enſure ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Before we can juſtify ſanguine hopes, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable alteration in favor of religion muſt take place among ourſelves. We cannot give to others, what we do not poſſeſs; and before our zeal will acquire ſufficient momentum to effect great things for the ſalvation of the Heathens, it is neceſſary that a more general and ſerious care ſhould prevail about the ſalvation of our own ſouls. While we look for this deſirable change, we cannot do better than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our miſſionary engagements; which will have the moſt favorable operation in bringing it about. Great deſigns and great undertakings form great men. They call forth the talents, of which we never ſuppoſed ourſelves to be poſſeſſed; and give an exhibition of ſplendid virtues, which do not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the common paths of life. Courage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rage, and zeal enkindles zeal. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſs, in any one miſſion, would encourage many undertakings; and the activity exerted in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Heathens, would naturally call atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ways and means of doing good among our own countrymen.</p>
               <p>Want of ſucceſs is the moſt fatal objection which lies againſt Miſſions. We have not taken proper ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                     </gap>e</hi> for it. A few hundred converts have been conſidered, as a great thing; and a ſew thouſand
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032281_0049_0FF1B229565B34A0"/>have been the he plus ultra of our hope. A revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution muſt take place in our id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as on the ſubject. We muſt hope for great things. We muſt attempt great things. Until this is done, <hi>tolerable ſucceſs</hi> is not to be expected. There is a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the object we embrace, and the zeal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion we ſhow in accompliſhing it. Such limited views as theſe preclude exertion. Whereas, where great advantages are propoſed, men are forward to incur great expences, and to run great riſks. Let us, then, determine to give a fair trial to Miſſions, and undertake ſomething which will help us to form a reaſonable judgment of what is, or is not to be expected from them. Let our object be to evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelize the Iſlands of the South Sea, or to obtain for Chriſtianity <hi>a firm footing</hi> and <hi>extenſive ſpread</hi> in India, China, Tibet, Borneo, Perſia, Tartary, and other great kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The preparations we make muſt be anſwerable to the views we adopt. Men and money are the nerves of war. A few ſcattered miſſionaries, and paltry funds, are inadequate to ſuch conqueſts. But, as our ſtrength is ſmall, and our forces new levies, unpractiſed to theſe perilous encounters, I would recommend to no Denomination of Chriſtians to engage in a ſecond Miſſion, until experience has convinced them that they are more than equal to the firſt. We muſt alſo be reſolved to take the field in the very boldeſt line of ſervice. A Miſſion, eſpecially ſuch a Miſſion as I propoſe, is one of thoſe enterprizes where the meaſures which, at firſt ſight, appear the moſt hazardous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are the moſt deliberate and ſucceſsful. Men, who are not diſpoſed to run all chances, and to undergo ſufferings, which on the relation might freeze the blood of thoſe who hear them quietly by their fire ſides, have no buſineſs in Miſſions. And, if miſſionaries of this caſt are not to be bad, we
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032281_0050_0FF1B22B2424F5D0"/>may, without any great detriment to the Chriſtian Cauſe, wait with patience until ſuch characters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the world. Men of other diſpoſitions will do, as little as has been done: and if a few indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of a peculiar turn of mind are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh a large ſphere of uſefulneſs in Europe for the hope of converting a handful of people in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, they will not have many followers: But they will furniſh for us, at home, a pretext for talking about greater things, than we have godlineſs or courage to perform.</p>
               <p>I give my advice that no Miſſion, of the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription I have pointed out, be undertaken with a ſmaller number than ten or twelve miſſionaries; and that number ſhould be increaſed in a treble or quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proportion, as the ſucceſs attending the Miſſion may require. To procure a large ſupply of miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, I propoſe that an equal number of pious lay brethren ſhould be employed in every Miſſion, as ſchoolmaſters, tranſcribers, exhorters, and to aſſiſt in all the emergencies of the Miſſion, to which miſſionaries may not be able to give attention. Young men of twenty, or one and twenty years of age would eaſily be found among every Chriſtian people, who have good natural talents and zeal for God, which would make them rejoice to be aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our labors. Their youth and inexperience would derive inſtruction and ſupport from their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brethren, and, after a few years trial, they might be promoted to the honorable ſtation of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries. Such an eſtabliſhment would be the beſt ſeminary of education for miſſions, and, with oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional helps from Europe, be ſufficient for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Nor is this idea, altogether novel: the Unitas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ratum, in their Miſſions, have availed themſelves greatly of the piety of their lay bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>As the expence of ſupporting ſo large a number
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032281_0051_0FF1B22FC68FB000"/>of miſſionaries would be very great, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſtrength of any funds, which can, at this time, be ſet on foot, I propoſe that no miſſionary be received until he has acquainted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with one or other art, by which he may do ſomething towards his own maintenance. This is, I think, a matter of indiſpenſible neceſſity. The Apoſtles of our Lord, the Jeſuits, and the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians, have experienced the advantage of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe honeſt arts. I have elſewhere given my reaſons for diſcharging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arried miniſters from this warfare; nevertheleſs, if ſuch are to be found, as are deſirous of engaging under all the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their ſituation, let them go. With God's bleſſing, both they and their wives may be very uſeful in a miſſionary family.</p>
               <p>With ſuch difficulties and dangers before them, it would be ungenerous and unfeeling not to give to miſſionaries every comfort and accommodation we can afford; but a ſtated ſalary is, in my idea of it, unneceſſary and improper. A few books, and clothes, with the proper implements of their reſpective arts, is all they can need, and all they could retain with ſafety in an uncivilized country.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe twenty miſſionaries and lay-brethren ſafely landed in Otaheite, they muſt recommend themſelves by liberality, and purchaſe a few acres of land for cultivation, as well as a competent ſtock of the neceſſaries of the country. They will build a large houſe for their eſtabliſhment, and erect a church for divine worſhip. After they begin to be acquainted with the people and country, they may, if it be thought adviſable, make two or three more eſtabliſhments in different parts of the Iſland. They will form vocabularies, and reduce the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to rule; make obſervation on all they ſee and hear, write it down, and commit it to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they will acquaint themſelves with the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032281_0052_0FF1B232C4FF8A80"/>government, and manner of the natives; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to inſtruct youth, communicate all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege they poſſeſs, learn to cultivate their lands, and, to do every thing elſe needful for their ſupport. During this time they may alſo give the natives ſome hiſtorical accounts of Chriſtianity, and the leading principles of our morals. But their grand labor will be the acquisition of the language, and the improvement of their piety, as well as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of an example to the iſlanders, by the regular and frequent returns of all the exerciſes of piety and benevolence. In two years time I ſuppoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> tolerably well acquainted with the language, and thoſe who ſpeak it, their affairs in good train, and the plan of operation laid down with mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. They may now proceed to buſineſs, and open their commiſſion with due ſolemnity.</p>
               <p>If they did not before multiply their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it will now be neceſſary to do it. In each department, they will open a ſchool for <hi>youth,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than children; and others of them may be employed in travelling through the country in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular itinerancy, preaching every night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and after a circuit of a fortnight, return to the eſtabliſhment. And in this manner muſt they continue to act, increaſing their labor in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their ſucceſs, and to their numbers. If, inſtead of Otaheite, they make their attempt in India, they may conduct themſelves in much the ſame way. It may be needful to ſay that they ſhould form their eſtabliſhments in all the great cities of the empire, after the example of the Apoſtles, who ſoon formed Churches in Alexandria, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, and Rome.</p>
               <p>In miſſionary eſtabliſhments, the greateſt care ſhould be taken in giving to every man his proper department, and in preſerving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> general co-operation in all their efforts. If abſolute ruin be not the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032281_0053_0FF1B2345A59B270"/>conſequence of their acting independantly of each other, yet their ſtrength will be ſo diminiſhed by diviſion, as to produce no fruit worthy of their ſoil. If there be any concluſiveneſs in this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will ſhew the abſolute neceſſity of each miſſionary's guarding againſt pertinacity of opinion, and the encouraging of thoſe habits of faſtidious delicacy which grow upon men who are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things to conſult only their private feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.—Unleſs we can reſolve on this ſacrifice, we are not qualified to act in Miſſions.</p>
               <p>Under the conſideration of the moſt eligible way of conducting Miſſions, it may not be improper to add a few obſervations on the manner of preaching, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d the behavior with reſpect to ſome important points which will be moſt likely to give ſucceſs to miſſionaries. His doctrine and the way of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it are the firſt things I ſhall notice. He ſhould remember, that he is a preacher of the goſpel, and that it is not ſo much moral truths, as goſpel prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and motives that he is to inſtil into his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The morality of Chriſt is the moſt perfect and admirable ſyſtem which ever appeared, or can be conceived of, as applicable to the ſtate and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind. Conſidered in its due extent, it embraces our whole duty to God and men; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates not only every action of our external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but alſo forms every diſpoſition of the mind, controls every faculty of the ſoul, and exerciſes a ſovereign authority over every ſecret of the heart. It is always beautiful, and harmonizes with itſelf in all its parts. In no caſe, and to no man does it grant indulgence of unrightcouſneſs. But to preach this moral rule in all its extent is not to preach the <hi>goſpel.</hi> So far from it, that they, who have inſiſted upon it, ſo, as to obtain the name of <hi>Moral preachers,</hi> have in fact ſubverted the goſpel, and broken the moral law into a thouſand pieces, a
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032281_0054_0FF1B235F3D94CD8"/>few of which are gathered up, by thoſe who mean to go to heaven by the merit of their works, and they conſider themſelves as enriched by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial acquiſitions. Archimedes, exulting in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of an experiment in mechanics, exclaimed, <hi>Find me a place to ſtand upon, and I will move the earth!</hi> Theſe Moral Preachers, are in the very dilemma of the Philoſopher.—Could their engine move the earth, they want a ſolid ſpot to fix it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Unleſs they ſupply this defect, their boaſted morals are good for nothing; and their zeal to do good a mere beating the air. The Goſpel Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſupplies their defect, and both magnifies and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhes the law in all its extent, and ſpirituality, by placing it on the glorious, everlaſting founda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, of Chriſt crucified. Juſtice, mercy, truth, however we may differ in the application of the terms, are things, in which Heathens will think themſelves as well informed as ourfelves: But the original rectitude and ſubſequent depravity of man, the incarnation and death of the Son of God for our redemption, a free juſtification by the grace of God, a regeneration of the whole man, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent univerſal holineſs, enforced on the ground that we are not our own, but Chriſt's, the ſupernatural ſuccors of the Divine Spirit, and the commanding doctrines of eternal judgment, are things of which they have no conception. Theſe grand, forcible truths, with the varied apparatus which belong to them, are thoſe on which miſſionaries are called to inſiſt; and the crucified Jeſus is the central point from which all the lines of our divinity muſt be drawn. In a word our miſſionaries muſt be goſpel miniſters, and not merely moral ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that believeth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſaid the bleſſed Jeſus, <hi>and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> This ſhould be inſiſted on with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmneſs; but I incline to think, that we ſhould
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032281_0055_0FF1B23ABA91BE70"/>not abroad, and eſpecially in the early ſtages of our Miſſion, deal ſo freely in the figure anathema, as we do at home. In England every man profeſſes Chriſtianity, and is ſufficiently acquainted with the leading principles of our faith to criminate his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. We may argue with him from his own data, and aſſume with him a tone of authority, which will not be juſtifiable with poor Heathens. The progreſs of the human mind in the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth is not rapid, eſpecially when it is clouded with inveterate prejudices. We ſhould, therefore, be careful how we bring in our damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory clauſes prematurely, againſt a people, who are not acquainted with our principles, and can form no eſtimate of the conſequences of rejecting them. This obſervation might, perhaps, have been ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; although I hope to meet with indulgence for inſerting it.</p>
               <p>I have before ſaid, that in another place I ſhould give my reaſons for wiſhing to diſcharge married men, and fathers of families, from this warfare. Single men will be expoſed from the infirmity of their nature to think of entering into the conjugal ſtate. This is a propenſity which it would be well to diſcourage as much as poſſible, without advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far as to criminate men for complying with the imperious will of heaven. But much attention ſhould be paid to the manner in which miſſionaries ally themſelves. Upon this head no certain rules can be given. Among politer nations fewer oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities will occur of marrying into noble families, and among more ſavage tribes I fear it is hardly to be wiſhed. A <hi>heathen</hi> woman would be a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading companion for a Chriſtian Miſſionary; and the example would have a fatal tendency on our converts.</p>
               <p>The preaching of the goſpel, with fidelity and boldneſs, implies a conſiderable ſhare of publicity;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032281_0056_0FF1B23F61B09E58"/>but nothing ſhould be guarded againſt with more attention than an oſtentatious diſplay of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. While our converts are few, perſecution is not to be feared; but as truth prevails the enemy of our ſalvation will ſtir up his emiſſaries. While, therefore, we ſhun no diſcovery of ourſelves, as far as the proſperity of the goſpel is concerned, we ſhould be careful how we give a handle to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Children, by counting numbers and boaſting of noble converts. In all things, it becomes Chriſtians to carry their faculties with meekneſs; but in nothing ſhould we give ſtronger demonſtrations of humility, gentleneſs, and unaſſuming modeſty, than in the introduction of our religion among a foreign people.</p>
               <p>There are two ranks of men whom our miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould manage with peculiar caution and addreſs —I mean the Prieſts and Chiefs of a Heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially the King, if their labors ſhould fall within the ſphere of royalty. Let them remember, that, in every country, Prieſts have a ſtrong hold on the ſentiments of mankind. If they are not ſincere, humble, pious and benevolent, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite qualities may be expected to predominate in them, more ſtrongly than in other men. In moſt, perhaps all ſyſtems of Heatheniſm, there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much ſuperſtition, but alſo a large ſhare of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture.</hi> As public deceivers, Heathen Prieſts <hi>muſt</hi> be bad men. Prieſts live by their religion; hence they are the bloodieſt, and moſt malignant perſecutors. The perſecutions of the laity are affairs of policy and fanaticiſm, and are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with perſonal rancor. The Prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, at once, for his honors, his gains, and his Gods. Here we have to cope with three of the ſtrongeſt principles of human corruption, fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, covetouſneſs, and pride; all which are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to madneſs by the ſecret guilt of unprincipled
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032281_0057_0FF1B241044A7AF0"/>falſhood. It is equally the intereſt of theſe men to withſtand our words, as it is in their power to do ſo. Their friendſhip will, therefore, be ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; their aſſociation undeſirable. An obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but diſtant, and guarded reſpect will be all they merit at our hands. Fair appearances and haſty overtures ſhould not be credited from men of their character. Nor will the mind, inclining to converſion, and characterized by humility and earneſtneſs, be diſcouraged by a prudent reſerve in his inſtructor. Religious conviction is a principle too forcibly operative to be long concealed; and until it developes itſelf by unqueſtionable teſtimony, we ſhould not commit ourſelves to the dangers of an eaſy faith. If God ſhould indeed touch their hearts, they will be the moſt potent auxilliaries, and worth a hundred of their countrymen.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to Chiefs, we know that power, affluence and honor deprave the heart. They are an order of men, who do not, in general affect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As wicked men, they deſpiſe and hate it; and, as wordly politicians, they fear it. Accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to command in civil matters, which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and in which they have a natural claim to take the lead, they are forward to uſurp authority in things ſacred, over which, as God has given them no juriſdiction, ſo it is in the power of man to give them none. Did not truth compel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I ſhould wiſh not to ſay, that even Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prieſts, by bold inroads on the ſecular power, have ſtrengthened this propenſity in the great, who cannot now think themſelves in ſafety, while reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is free. Hence the bold attempts to bind this celeſtial ſtranger with the fetters of human laws. Without expatiating farther on this topic, it may ſuffice to ſay, that, on a ſmaller ſcale, religion and her miniſters muſt expect to meet, in Otaheite, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſimilar to thoſe under which ſhe labors
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032281_0058_0FF1B242A26A16D0"/>in Europe. To aſſert the freedom of religion and her miniſters calls for <hi>actions</hi> and not for words. The miſſionary muſt prove by his conduct, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, that his religion is a <hi>heavenly thing,</hi> and himſelf a <hi>heavenly man.</hi> He muſt ſhew that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has every thing to hope, and nothing to fear from religion. He muſt inviolably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to his principles; for the moment he deſerts them, and treads on unhallowed ground; that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſtretches out his hand to receive the chain, and betrays religion to the ſecular power. By af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the favor of the great we degrade our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, endanger our own ſalvation, and render the men we flatter and fawn upon worſe than they were before. Any extraordinary zeal to make noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes indicates mercenary and ambitious views. The rich are no leſs ſagacious than the poor in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the motive of our conduct. They accept our adulation, and deſpiſe us for it. Had the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Miſſionaries kept at an awful diſtance from the imperial thrones of China and Japan, they and their converts might, perhaps, have lived in peace to this day. And the imitation of their conduct, even in Otaheite, might overwhelm Proteſtant Miſſionaries in ſimilar ruin. Piety and benevolence will command eſteem, and give us all the influence we can want. Let Chriſtian Miſſionaries, and their converts, ſhew themſelves the moſt peaceable, loyal, and affectionate of ſubjects, and this not from policy, but for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing I ſhall guard miſſionaries againſt, is the uſurpation of dominion over their flocks, and particularly dominions of a ſecular kind. Such a conduct will merit the abhorrence of God and men: and muſt draw perſecution on themſelves. The ſtate of thoſe Iſlands might induce men of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, under the ſpecious pretext of civilization, to advance farther than they intended without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032281_0059_0FF1B245D93F4990"/>aware of the conſequences; and the ignorance, confidence, and docility of their converts may be expected to throw into their hands a degree of power and influence, which are liable to the vileſt abuſe. Let them, therefore, meditate on the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Church, reflect on their own weakneſs, and remember, that they, who ſucceed to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, will have a greater love of command, as they may not have their piety, and at the ſame time will be in circumſtances more favorable to the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dominion, than they themſelves now are.</p>
               <p>If Chriſtianity is no better ſerved by our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than ſhe has been for centuries paſt, all theſe admonitions may be ſpared; for they will have no occaſion to be applied; but if Miſſions ſhould be taken up in the way I propoſe, and meet with the ſucceſs, which I am ſanguine enough to flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf they would do from that way of conducting them, eſpecially in the South Sea Iſlands, they are neceſſary, and merit all attention.</p>

               <p>THE qualifications of the miſſionary enter ſo deeply into my ſubject, that I cannot paſs them by, without offering you my opinion. But on this point, as well as on many others, which I have diſcuſſed, I certainly do not mean to ſpeak as ex cathedrâ. Different opinions will prevail on what I have to offer; and they, who are above others intereſted in it, as being willing themſelves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in Miſſions, will certainly do well to abide by their own.</p>
               <p>Piety is the only baſis of the miſſionary charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Every attempt to convert others, while we ourſelves are unconverted, is abſurd and nugatory, On this it is unneceſſary to inſiſt. They, who are deſtitute of the faith and hope of the goſpel, are never likely to volunteer in this ſervice. Gold, which has transformed ſo many Apoſtles of the Devil into the Miniſters of Chriſt, might alſo make them miſſionaries; but it is our buſineſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the poſſibility of ſuch inducement. Let god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and not gain, be the only object propoſed to their choice, and we ſhall effectually ſhut the door againſt all mercenaries.</p>
               <p>But in the qualification of the miſſionary, we muſt enquire not only into the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo into the <hi>power</hi> of it. We ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure many by queſtioning their piety, who are yet not poſſeſſed of that vigorous and ſteadfaſt faith, that joyous hope, and that ſervent love, which are abſolutery neceſſary to ſupport a man under all the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032281_0061_0FF1B24D82C584B8"/>ſacrifices, dangers, hardſhips, and diſcouragements of a miſſionary warfare. The tree, that is green, flouriſhing, and fruitful, while it ſtands in a rich ſoil, and is theltered by a ſurrounding wood, might wither and die, or be torn up by its roots, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to a heath, where it enjoys-none of the ſame advantages. It is not impoſſible, that a man, whoſe piety would have ſaved himſelf and his neighbor, in England, might, in India or Otaheite, loſe his own ſoul, and become a ſtumbling block to others. This is an awful conſideration; and, if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, would prevent all raſhneſs, either in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ourſelves, or in perſuading others to engage, in Miſſions. A tolerable ſtrength and maturity of religion, will, therefore, be as needful as the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of it.</p>
               <p>Zeal is a qualification for Miſſions of a nature inferior only to piety. It is in a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree its inſeperable concomitant; and that man will hardly be defective in it, who enters upon Miſſions ſuâ ſponte, and in compliance with the bent of his own inclination. The great matter will be to determine, whether this zeal be the pure flame of piety, and has heavenly oil to feed its fire, or is the reſult of an ardent temperament and a ſplendid imagination. When there is evidently a mixture, which I ſuſpect is generally the caſe, we muſt diſcover, by a moral analyſis, what may be referred to nature, and what to grace; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on a man's qualification in this reſpect, as there is the larger ſhare of valuable bullion, or of baſe alloy.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot but indulge an obſervation, which ſtrikes me as being of conſiderable weight. A Miſſion is an undertaking ſo extremely remote from the common concerns of life, and carries in it ſo much to revolt the heart, that when men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted piety, freely offer themſelves for it, there is
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032281_0062_0FF1B24F2416E828"/>a ſtrong preſumption, that, in following the bent of their own inclinations, they do not altogether miſtake their proper object. We ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fearful in counteracting the Holy Ghoſt, who, if we would ſubmit to his wiſdom, would not fail to ſet apart proper inſtruments for the work. Should, therefore, one or other miſſionary qualification, not exiſt ſo eminently as we could wiſh, in the man who offers himſelf; yet this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble volunteering, in a cauſe, where every princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of nature muſt be laid on the croſs, ſeems to imply ſo very much, that our objections muſt be palpable indeed, before we are juſtifiable in reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. God ſeeth not as man ſeeth; and, if David's youth and unwarlike appearance had been more regarded, than the honeſt indignation and noble confidence, with which he came forward to aſſert the honor of the Lord of hoſts, Iſrael had wanted the only champion capable of upholding his glory.</p>
               <p>It is to be wiſhed that the miſſionary's zeal ſhould not have been lately kindled, but ſuch as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burned for years promiſes to continue in its beat. But his zeal may be too hot, as well as too cold. His fire ſhould be moderated, by ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the miniſtry. Zeal and conrage will be likely to precipitate an unexperienced young man into raſh meaſures and intemperance of mind; and he may fall the victim of impatience and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. It is, therefore, neceſſary that he ſhould have been taught to exerciſe a good degree of gentleneſs, patience, and long ſufferance; by being accuſtomed to wreſtle with the unruly will of men, by ſeeing many of his well meant efforts fruſtrated through invincible depravity, and by obſerving the failure of ſome of his moſt ſanguine and reaſonable expectations. Add to this, there is an art in managing men's minds, which nothing
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032281_0063_0FF1B252276DCFA0"/>but experience can teach him, and that man will have little ſkill in ruling the tempeſt of the human paſſions, who has not learned to moderate the ardor of his own feelings; and who does not know when to preſs his point and when to decline it, when to command and when to entreat; and how to avail himſelf of all the molla tempora fandi.</p>
               <p>There are ſome worthy,—ſome pious men, who are capable of every thing, and yet do very little in life. They are diſorderly in all their habits and verſatile in all their purſuits. Superior to fear, they are, unhappily, ductile, and receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of minds inferior to their own. Capable of vaſt exertions, they are naturally indolent. With a vivacity, which often ſparkles and charms, they unite a morbid melancholy which preys upon the heart. They are amiable, but not venerable. Such men may engage in Miſſions, but will hardly ſucceed in them. The miſſionary ſhould poſſeſs much ſelf denial, and be regular in all his habits. He needs not have the raizor's edge; but he muſt be as the blade of a well tempered knife. He muſt be a man of diſcipline and ſelf command.</p>
               <p>His character ſhould be diveſted of ſloth, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and indulgence. Perhaps, he ſhould rather be capable of becoming a man of letters, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually be ſo. All his habits ſhould be active rather than ſedentary. A diſpoſition favorable to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ardent and ſublime devotion, and a delight in the exerciſes of the pulpit and the paſtoral care, ſuperior to what he receives from the ſtudies of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, languages, and all things ſabſidiary to his miniſtry, ſhould preponderate in his character. In a word, he ſhould be more the active man, than the contemplative one. A ſound conſtitution, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to the viciſſitude of the ſeaſons, and capable of ſupporting the extremes of ſufferance is greatly to be deſired: but a mind ſuperior to ſuffering is a
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032281_0064_0FF1B258734A2468"/>conſideration of far more importance, than that corporeal vigor and hardineſs which is invulnerable to fatigue and want.</p>
               <p>We require in our miſſionary a diſintereſted, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous way of thinking and acting, above low cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſervile compliance, and a preſumptuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of powers to which his character does not entitle him. We would have him ſincere, open, and affectionate. Inſtead of authoritative commands we would arm him with prayers, entreaties, and tears. We expect that he ſhould have learned to bear and forbear. We think that ignorance ſhould excite his pity, and not rouſe his contempt. We would not have him ſhun the aſſociation of the poor ſavages he would convert; but we ſhould be ſorry to ſee him ſink into indolent familiarity, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating communicativeneſs, which betray a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed mind that has no guard over itſelf. Silence he ſhould have learned to eſteem as a grand partof miniſterial prudence. He <hi>muſt be</hi> an extempore preacher, and poſſeſs a facility of conveying to the mind his ideas clear and ſtrong, independent of thoſe modes of ſpeech which originate in the laws and manners of Europe. He muſt be far remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from narrow bigotry, and poſſeſs a ſpirit truly catholic. It is not Calviniſm, it is not Armin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianiſm, but Chriſtianity, that he is to teach. It is not the hierarchy of the Church of England; it is not the prinicples of Proteſtant Diſſenters, that he has in view to propagate. His object is to ſerve the Church Univerſal. It is not latitudinarianiſm of principles, but largeneſs of affection, which I recommend to the miſſionary. I would not have him indifferent to his own peculiarities, whether they reſpect the doctrines he receives as truth, or the points of eccleſiaſtical polity he conſiders as moſt friendly to religion; but I would have him thoroughly ſenſible, that the ſucceſs of his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032281_0065_0FF1B25A06952E40"/>reſts not on the points of ſeparation, but on thoſe wherein all godly men are united. He ſhould know to what place in the grand ſcale of truth he is to refer cach article of his creed; and be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more concerned to make men Chriſtians than to make them Church of England men, Diſſenters, or Methodiſts. Would to God this were more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to among us! and then, inſtead of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with jealouſy the proſperity of any other Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Chriſtians, and conſidering it as an obſtruction to the ſucceſs of our own party, we ſhall rejoice in hearing that Chriſt is preached, and ſouls are ſaved.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid on the qualifications of the miſſionary; but I ſhall finiſh this ſubject by obſerving, that his character cannot be too perfect, nor his talents too great, nor too highly cultivated for this calling. But in addition to what is includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the idea of a godly man, there is a vaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of ability, between the extremes of talents, ſo limited as to exclude a man from Miſſions or ſo great as to give him a lead in them. We may err by requiring too much, and by being ſatisfied with too little. What a miſſionary is expected to do and to ſuffer ſhould always enter into the eſtimate we make of his qualifications.</p>
               <p>The man who reads the Engliſh language and has good ſenſe enough to make uſe of Henry's commentary on the Scriptures, may be of ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit to the lower orders of people in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, though he be unfit to inſtruct the intelligent, and ſhould torture the ears of the polite. Such a man may be a very proper miſſionary to the Negro Slaves in our Weſt India Iſlands. No compaſs of talents is required for ſuch a ſituation; nor do I conceive that ſuch an engagement, will require one jot more piety, or bind him over to ſuffer more hardſhip, than he will have occaſion to exerciſe in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032281_0066_0FF1B25BAB8236D0"/>England, Such a Miſſion is rather nominal than real; as the miſſionary will preach the goſpel in thoſe Iſlands with every advantage he could enjoy in his own country.</p>
               <p>Where a language is to be learned, European comforts to be relinquiſhed, and a Miſſion is to be taken up under all the diſcouragements which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend the undertaking, we require more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced piety, warmer zeal, and better talents. The miſſionary ſhould at leaſt, be furniſhed with the rudiments of grammar, and ſome general knowlege of men and things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as poſſeſſed of an underſtanding capable of improvement, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of application to improve it. For China and other nations in an improved ſtate of civilization, he ſhould have thoſe talents, and that information, which render him reſpectable in England. But, even in China, the bulk of the people are on the ſame par of information with the common people in our own land, and many miſſionaries of inferior talents might very well be aſſociated with a few of greater ability.</p>
               <p>In the eſtabliſhment, I believe the ſentiment has prevailed pretty generally, that miſſionares ſhould be men of learning; and under the influence of this idea ſome worthy candidates for Miſſions have been rejected for inſufficiency. The Methodiſts and ſome Proteſtant Diſſenters, I am apprehenſive, incline too much to the oppoſite extreme. For I have heard it ſuggeſted among them, that their <hi>weakeſt miniſters,</hi> who can be of little ſervice in Europe, are very proper for miſſionaries. In this ſentiment there is <hi>ſome</hi> truth; but we form very erroneous ideas of Miſſions, if we ſuppoſe ſuch men <hi>only</hi> are wanting for the ſervice. We muſt have men to lead as well as to follow; and even in the Weſt India Iſlands, where I have ſuppoſed pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſſionaries of the ſmalleſt gifts to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032281_0067_0FF1B25EB150EC78"/>inſtructors for the Negroes, there are many Europeans of intelligence who will attend their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; and if we wiſh our Miſſionaries to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, there ſhould be ſome of better talents amongſt them. In every place, but the Weſt-Indies, a Miſſionary will require good talents, as well as the moſt exemplary piety. Under ſhelter of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that men of the beſt talents muſt be kept at home, we ſhall give too much encouragement to that ſelf complacency which cleaves to men of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and grant them a diſmiſſion from the ſervice, which they will be glad to avail themſelves of. But I cannot believe thoſe Gentlemen think ſoberly of themſelves, as they ought to do, who ſuppoſe themſelves too great and too conſiderable to engage in Miſſions. One would think that conſidering the nature of the work, and the diſadvantages we lie under from the want of Apoſtolic credentials, we ſhould wiſh as much as poſſible to ſupply their place by talents and learning. Piety is better than learning, and learning with piety has great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age over piety alone. Every thing elſe being equal in our Miſſions, that Miſſion will certainly be moſt productive which claims the moſt learned miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. As a man of no learning myſelf I cannot but feel it a little contemptuous for me and my poor Brethren, who are like myſelf illeterate men, to be ſhoved with ſo much good will into the hotteſt front of the battle, by men who are fitter for the work, but who claim that very fitneſs, as the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for their ſitting ſtill. On the other hand could I boaſt of talents and of letters, and conſider myſelf as a leading man in the Church, I ſhould bluſh to ſee a few ſubalterns generouſly expoſing themſelves in a warfare which I ſhunned.</p>
               <p>Let us then endeavor to preſerve a mean between theſe dangerous extremes. Let no worthy volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer be rejected for incompetence of learning; nor
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032281_0068_0FF1B2621D9CF690"/>let us allow of any man's pleading his literature and popular elocution as a diſcharge from the war. As bringing our gifts to the Lord's treaſury, let us give largely and freely, and, after all, learn to know that we are <hi>unprofitable</hi> ſervants. But though we could caſt in our ten thouſand talents, let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of treating with contempt our poor brother, who after the example of the widow, who was bleſſed in her deed, ſhall offer his two mites for the ſervice of the ſanctuary. He may, for ought we know, have preſented a richer offering than us all. Our Lord, inſtead of throwing back the widow's mites with contempt, gave high commendation to her faith and liberality.—May I never be in the place of thoſe who reject the pious candidate for Miſſions, and vilify his zeal with charges of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm and ſpiritual pride—for what? Becauſe he wants Latin and Greek! Becauſe he has the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence to offer his mite to the gracious Lord of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! Becauſe, that believing the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, he has courage and confidence in his God, to go forth with a ſling and a ſtone to encounter a Philiſtine, whoſe gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtature and formidable arms appal all the armies of our Iſrael!</p>
               <p>Somewhat ſimilar to the queſtion between learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unlearned miſſionaries, is another between married and ſingle men, which of them we ſhould conſider moſt eligible for Miſſions. But theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem to proceed, both of them, on a falſe ground. They ſuppoſe that Miniſters learned and unlearned, married and ſingle, are ſo very zealous of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this way, that our choice is puzzled, and we need great deliberation on whom we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the obſolete honors of hunger, thirſt, heat, cold, nakedneſs, ſickneſs, poverty, contempt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and death. But the caſe is altogether different. We <hi>wiſh</hi> for ſome learning in our miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032281_0069_0FF1B266D29625F0"/>but we muſt be content, for one man of letters, to receive twenty, who have no pretenſion to learning. It will be the ſame with men, who have wives and families, ſhould we prefer them. They will not generally be prevailed upon to look Miſſions in the face. And as I am more diſpoſed to reaſon from facts, than from preconceived theories, and much inclined to believe that men's minds, like waters, finds their own level, I conceive that, from the invincible averſion which men of learning and fathers of families ſhew to this buſineſs, we may arrive at the concluſion, that they are not, <hi>general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſpeaking, proper perſons for Miſſions. A few great leaders appear abſolutely neceſſary; and if learned men were equally willing to become miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, they would claim a preference; but as they are not equally willing, and as they will probably never be ſo, we not only may, but muſt give them the diſcharge they require. We muſt do the ſame with married men. I cannot perſuade myſelf that the relations of huſband and father conſidered ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in themſelves, abſolutely prohibit the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I am fully of opinion that there is a wide difference between the caſe of learned and married men inliſting for this war. If there be equal piety in the learned, learning muſt give them great advantage over the unlearned. With reſpect to the married, as they muſt be greater ſufferers in Miſſions than the ſingle, they ſhould have more zeal and piety than ſingle men to engage them to ſuffer; and, even with this advantage, the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of a wife and family muſt lay inſuperable obſtacles in the way of their acting, with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy and deciſion we may expect from ſingle men. As I find public opinion leaning much in favor of the claims of married men, it may be worth our while to ſtate the reaſons urged on both ſides, and to examine on which they are the moſt concluſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:032281_0070_0FF1B2686945DB60"/>
In favor of the married, it is urged, that their wives would be extremely ſerviceable in a miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary eſtabliſhment—that they would be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful among their own ſex, eſpecially in the Eaſt where women are ſecluded and the ſanctity of the Haram would be polluted by the preſence of any but female miſſionaries; and that they would be a ſafeguard to the characters of their huſbands, which might otherwiſe ſuffer from a miniſterial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with female converts. To enforce theſe arguments, is adduced the example of the Unitas Fratrum, who in their Miſſions generally make uſe of married men.</p>
               <p>It is granted a pious, active, healthy woman, might be ſerviceable in a miſſionary inſtitution: but it ſhould be remembered that the ſex in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are not calculated to ſupport hardſhip; that young women, who are bearing children, more frequently require to be waited upon, than are able to wait on others; and that the care of a young fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily will leave them little time to aid their huſbands miſſionary labors. And if it be conſidered that the men who will engage in Miſſions are generally ſuch as are in the prime of their years, our miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary eſtabliſhments may ſoon be expected to be very populous. With reſpect to the ſervice hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them of introducing Chriſtianity into Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic Harams, I fear they will not effect much. Huſbands have, in general, more influence in forming the religious principles of their wives, than wives have on thoſe of their huſbands. If the men are converted, they will carry their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion home to their wives; and if they can once be prevailed on to embrace our religion, it is not unreaſonable to think, that they will ſoon adopt our manners, and give us as free an intercourſe in their families as is to be wiſhed. The protection they may afford to their huſbands morals, as well
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032281_0071_0FF1B26A32BE72B0"/>as their characters, I ſhall not affect to deſpiſe; but it cannot be weighed againſt the diſadvantages they would lay them under in their work. Nor is the example of the Moravians to the point. They are in this, and many other reſpects, a ſingular people. And, if it might not give offence to the wives of miniſters of other Denominations, I ſhould ſay that their women are educated in a way which render them fitter companions for miſſionaries than any other women in the world. But, in addition to what I have here advanced, much more is to be ſaid. I have recommended Miſſions to be taken up on a larger ſcale, and with a bolder ſpirit of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, than that in which they have been hitherto conducted. If, therefore, a ſew women and their families might be ſettled in ſome ſituations, were accommodations are to be had for them, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will be unfit companions for the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger part of miſſionaries, who will be engaged in perpetual travels and labors among a Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they muſt undergo all poſſible hardſhips. I propoſe to ſend forth miſſionaries in large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and I ſuppoſe that the fruit of their labors, the humanity of the natives, and the largeſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies which can be ſent from Europe, will altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form a fund very inadequate to the ſupport of women and children. I expect, if they have the ſouls of miſſionaries in them, that they will often, between their charity and their zeal, be placed in circumſtance; ſimilar to thoſe of St. Paul, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, in want, in perils by land, in perils by ſea, and in all the varieties of ſuffering. And are theſe men to have wives and children? Will men of a ſpirit like this be likely to pine for the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a lady's lap?</p>
               <p>If I am thought to have loſt myſelf in the regions of romance and to be conjuring up inchanted caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles which never did exiſt, for the ideal pleaſure
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032281_0072_0FF1B271F1B95EC0"/>of killing giants, chaining lions, diſſolving ſpells, and freeing captive dames, I muſt perſiſt, like the Knight of La Mancha, to vindicate the ſanity of my intellect, and to affirm that the things I talk of have exiſted, and will exiſt again, and that until they are made to do ſo, I am a ſober man, and read my book accurately. The ſoundneſs of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect may rather be ſuſpected, who think of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a dozen married miſſionaries and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to India, to give them ſnug births and good ſalaries at Calcutta, or other European Settlements, where they are to ſuperintend a ſchool, and preach to a few luxurious Europeans, and ſuch Natives as care to come into their Churches. And for what purpoſe all this aſtoniſhing apparatus? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Natives of Indoſtan to Chriſtianity! And by what year of our Lord may we expect that the Goſpel will be ſpread through that Empire? As ſoon might one hope to empty the ſea by lading it out with buckets, or think of giving light to the world by the glimmering rays of half a dozen wax tapers! Surely gentlemen who will only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize Miſſions conducted on this ſcale, and grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talk to the would of their wiſh to ſpread the goſpel, cannot reproach me for credulity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. I am not weak enough to ſuppoſe an Apoſtolic work, ſuch as the converſion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations is, can be effected in any but an Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic way. Had the Apoſtles themſelves ſet down in India to teach Schools, and to act as parochial Miniſters, not all their miraculous credentials would have ſpread the goſpel there. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. Swartz, a Daniſh Miſſionary, and one of the moſt reſpectable and ſucceſsful men, who has appeared under that character in Indoſtan, has ſo and it neceſſary to travel a good deal about in preaching the goſpel; and a few others, poſſibly imitate his example—I do not mean to repreſent
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032281_0073_0FF1B27384DB7820"/>that Gentleman as properly an itinerant preacher; but only to inſiſt, that he is ſenſible, that he muſt go after the loſt ſheep, and not leave them to ſeek a faithful ſhepherd. He therefore preaches out of doors, and lays hold of every opportunity of going among them. But, I fear his example meets not with general imitation; and, if it did, as married men cannot do what ought to be done in that way, ſo the number of miſſionaries employed there is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate to the work. Whatever difficulties, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there may be in finding a ſufficient number of miſſionaries for ſuch an attempt, it muſt be done, or nothing will be done worthy of our religion—worthy of God manifeſt in the fleſh. And, if this is to be done, I believe few people will think it adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to carry wives and children into ſo hot a war. For whatever miſſionaries are willing to fuſſer in their own perſons, they will expect, and will have a right to expect, ſuch a ſupport for their wives and families, as an undertaking ſo circumſtanced could not afford them.</p>

They will be the propereſt wives for them who are born in the country, ſpeak its language, are inured to the climate, and accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the manners of the inhabitants. Such women may be able to take a ſhare in the hardſhips of a miſſionary life, and by their labor, as well as their connections, do ſomething for the ſupport
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032281_0074_0FF1B276034858E8"/>of their Huſbands. None of theſe advantages can be hoped from an European woman. If they are true converts, they will be animated by the zeal which attends ſo bleſſed a change; and that patriot love and warm attachment to our native land, which glows, more or leſs, in every human breaſt, will co-operate with it, to make them zealous auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in converting their countrymen. They will attach their huſbands to the country, and keep them ſteady to the work. Their children educated in Chriſtianity, and endeared to the country in which they are born, and have many relatives, will ſome of them tread in the ſteps of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and, though they ſhould not, they will, in other reſpects, countenance and ſupport the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which they were brought up—a religion which though they ſhould not chuſe to practice, they will hardly forſake for the deformed ſyſtems of Heathen Superſtition. Whereas, the men who carry out with them European women and their children, will always have it in contemplation one day to return to England; they will be looking out with anxiety for ways and means to accompliſh that end; and if they ſee no hope of effecting it, their lives and their deaths will be embittered by the idea of leaving the women and little ones, whom they love dearer than life, deſtitute and friendleſs in a foreign land. To ſay, they ought to put their truſt in God, is nothing to the purpoſe: for we are not enquiring what men ought to do, but what conſidering the weakneſs of nature they will be moſt expoſed to do. For my own part, I confeſs ingenuouſly, that this is a feature in Miſſions which I have never looked at, without feeling a horror which has chilled my blood; and if I, who am ſo far gone in them, do not care to make ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I ſtar ſew are to be found who will make it. Notwithſtanding, as there are among the Miniſters

               <p>AN enquiry into what may conſtitute a call to miſſions will merit ſerious diſcuſſion. Some incline to treat this queſtion with contempt, as one ſpecies of enthuſiaſtic jargon, by which religion has been diſcredited in the world: and, I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſay, it has been, at times, ſo managed, as to give color to their cenſures. Nevertheleſs, you will be of opinion with me, that much ſolid ſenſe and ſober piety are contained in it; and when we conſider that every thing valuable to man is ſtaked ea its determination, they muſt be ſtrangers to the ſentiments of the human heart, and evince a want of reaſon and ingenuouſneſs, which they charge on others, who ſuppoſe men of ſenſe will embark on the ſea of trouble, without having firſt viewed the queſtion on every ſide, and obtained that well
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032281_0076_0FF1B27F146052E8"/>grounded ſatisfaction in the propriety of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which may hereafter ſupport and comfort them under all its poſſible conſequences.</p>
               <p>The general duty of Miniſters and their flocks with reſpect to Miſſions, we ground on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Lord, the characters of his religion, the example of his Apoſtles, the declarations of his Prophets, the common principles of humanity, and the whole aggregate of argument, which ariſes from the nature of the undertaking. But unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in many other caſes, ſo in this, what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged as of common obligation is not felt as the particular duty of individuals. In this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, our Lord and his houſehold may be compared to the family of an opulent, indulgent Maſter of many ſervants, who commanding ſome unpleaſant buſineſs to be performed, but intimating his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in general terms, not addreſſed to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar domeſtic, his ſervants inſtead of readily obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commands, are all of them diſputing from his Lordſhip's Chaplain to the ſkullion in his kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, which of them is obliged to perform his will. The Chaplain is a gentleman, and is above ſuch menial offices. His Lord certainly underſtands too well the dignity of his character to addreſs ſuch orders to him. The Steward declares his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bind him no farther than to uſe his pen, and to overlook his Maſter's rents and diſburſements with fidelity. The Butler proteſts he was not hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a footman; and the underlings of the houſe with many profeſſions of good will, plead they are not qualified for doing their Lord's will. In a word, the buſineſs is either left undone, or a few poor honeſt fellows, who love their Maſter and are jealous for his honor, go forth and do their beſt; but not receiving from their fellow ſervants that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which each ought to have afforded them, the buſineſs is done in a bungling way at laſt; and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032281_0077_0FF1B280A1E454A0"/>my Lord's Chaplain, Steward, Butler, and other ſervants, inſtead of feeling that it has miſcarried principally through their fault—inſtead of being aſhamed into exertion, ſay ſome of them, that their Lord "never gave ſuch a command." others, "that the time for obeying it is not come," others, "that the bad ſucceſs of their fellows diſcourages farther attempts," and while ſome are provoked that the menials of the houſe ſhould preſume to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the buſineſs, others, "declare it is vile dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work and fit only for ſkullions and ſhoe-boys." This has been preciſely our conduct in Miſſions.</p>
               <p>But how may an individual know that this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral duty determines on him? This enquiry will be made with views as different, as are the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the men who make it: ſome to find a plauſible excuſe for declining their duty; and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from a ſincere deſire to know and to do it. To the firſt ſort, it will be impoſſible to give ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their firſt principle, <hi>I will not be a miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> precludes all conviction. Their ſecond prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>I will juſtify my diſobedience,</hi> determines them to demand ſuch reaſons, for the <hi>abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of their call, as they know, or ought to know, cannot be given them. They demand their call to be demonſtrated with intuitive evidence; and while there remains a poſſibility of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving themſelves, prudently determine to run no hazards. Be it ſo gentlemen. We diſmiſs you from the ſervice until you have acquired more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous minds. Your ſwords may remain quietly in their ſcabbards, for this is not a war in which lath will ſupply the place of ſteel. You are your own demonſtrations that God does not call you to miſſions; and whatever ſins you may ſtand accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for in the day of Chriſt, I think you will hardly be criminated under that ſtatute of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Go preach the goſpel to every creature.</hi>

                  </gap> is involved in the truth of the Goſpel. In the ſcriptures, in reaſon, in providence, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our own hearts and characters; and in our relations in private and in public life, there are to be diſcovered data, from which we may come by a ſimple proceſs of reaſoning, to a very tolerable concluſion of what is our duty in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>This call is certainly not of man, nor of the will of man. A ſenſe of the worthineſs of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and a general deſire to do the will of God, with the ſolicitations of friends who think highly of us, and who are of opinion, that there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential opening for us to go to the Heathen, do not conſtitute a ſufficient warrant for engaging. Much, very much more than all this is required. The Moravian maxim, "Never to perſuade, much leſs to urge a man to engage in miſſions," has been juſtified to them by experience; and it will appear perfectly reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the levers and pullies of human perſuaſion, by which a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to miſſions may, ſometimes, be excited to act in them, give no ſufficient momentum to the ſoul to ſupport it againſt the immenſe counterpoiſe of fleſh and blood. He, who appears poſſeſſed of the moſt lively zeal for miſſions, may deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by falſe ſire, and enthuſiaſtic feelings; but the man who wants ſire, who is merely prompted by his friends, and ſuppoſes a miſſion a matter to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged like a pariſh in England, equally deceives himſelf, though he declaims againſt enthuſiaſm, and would have its underſtand, that he is following the leſs fallacious light of reaſon. But I exhort every one, whoſe whole ſoul is not in the buſineſs, to ſtand firm againſt the perſuaſion of all men. He
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032281_0079_0FF1B286A515E198"/>may be aſſured that miſſionary work is too rough for his ductile nature. If he cannot ſay no to his friends, how ſhall he ſay no to thoſe manifold temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which will ſolicit him to return? And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech all who have claims to reaſon, to religion, or to humanity, never to attempt to perſuade any one, directly or indirectly, to do any thing more in miſſions than he can do with pleaſure and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good will. It is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that our perſuaſives can operate to change the character and in a moment to give a man ſentiments and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he never had before. It is not agreeable to the oeconomy of religion, for God to leave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his will, without inclination, as well as ability for doing it. Laſt of all, it is a moſt inhuman perſecution to inſiſt on its being the will of God that any individual ſhould engage in Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or in any degree to aſſume the province of heaven in pretending to ſearch the heart, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the conſcience. This conduct is the more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as it is an inſtrument of torture, applied to none but worthy and pious minds, where we have moſt reaſon to believe it unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>Nor will providences which appear <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> and a <hi>preſent</hi> willingneſs to engage, prove our call. Providence is a myſterious book, not eaſily legible, and beſt underſtood when read backward; and I ſhall much ſuſpect that man's call is ſhewn him by ſudden and unexpected openings of Providence, who has never before made a diſcovery of it in his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or in his own heart. From a general analogy of grace as well as nature, we are led to expect, that what is born and attains maturity in a day, will fade and die in as ſhort a term. In a miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we look for ſtrong, permanent, habits, ſuch as are formed by reiterated acts. We do not mean to limit the Holy One of Iſrael; but to reſpect Him as the God of order, means and ordinances.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032281_0080_0FF1B289AA0654D0"/>He has eſtabliſhed the connection of effects with their cauſes; and though He may and will, when He ſees good, invert the eſtabliſhed order of things we muſt not affect more than what becomes the fragility of our nature. We muſt require the horſe to be broken in for the battle. We muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the man called to Miſſions will experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſucceſſively, all the viciſſitudes of hope, fear, deſire, averſion, confidence and deſpondency, before he dips his foot in the water, or will be able to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with ſteady courage the dangers of theſe depths. If there be a man, who claims exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from common rules, and can in a moment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a miſſion without a diſpoſition previouſly formed, and, having ſo engaged, can conduct the matter aright, he is no precedent for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations premiſed, the firſt thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſtituting a call to Miſſions is ability to comply with it. Let the candidate, therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, whether he be poſſeſſed, in a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree, of the qualifications neceſſary for that ſtation. From what he has done in the miniſtry in England, he may form ſome gueſs of what he is likely to do abroad. It may alſo be proper to take the candid opinion of his miniſterial friends, whoſe favorable ſentiments will ſupport his diffidence, or whoſe honeſt cenſure may check his temerity. On this ſubject, if on any, we ſhall be ſafe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rate our qualifications; and, if we are humble, we ſhall naturally be led to do ſo. This, if it one way operates as a diſcouragement, will in another produce different effects. God giveth grace to the humble, and mon will give them honor. An ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of ourſelves will neither damp our zeal for God, nor our benevolence to men. It will not pervert our underſtandings, nor make us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor God by diſclaiming whatever degree of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032281_0081_0FF1B28CE2C98868"/>fitneſs He may give us for the work. The greater the natural and acquired talents of any man be the better; but all this is not the great thing, the one thing, the living ſpirit, the eye, the ear, the ſtrength and arms of the miſſionary, CHRISTIAN GODLINESS, THE MIND OF CHRIST, THE IMAGE OF GOD,—this is the qualification which a miſſionary cannot do without; which he cannot have in too great a degree; and which if he poſſeſs in ſtrength and vigor, his other qualifications, however ſmall, cannot be deemed defective. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, then, he cannot put to himſelf too many, or too cloſe queſtions. His ſelf denial, activity, fortitude, perſeverance, habitual dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and conſcientious adherence to order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, throughout his whole conduct, will each of them merit minute inveſtigation. If the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this enquiry be ſatisfactory to himſelf, he may be aſſured that he has, at leaſt, a ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build upon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond head of enquiry is his <hi>willingneſs</hi> to engage in miſſions. Here ſomething more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than cold approbation, or that general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to do the will of God, which influences every pious man. We look for a ſtrong, decided prediliction—<hi>a paſſion</hi> for miſſions, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the term; that ſpecies of commendable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, which enables profeſſional men to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the dignity and importance of their reſpective arts, and to purſue their object, under every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, until they have carried their art to a perfection, which men of colder minds could never have ſuppoſed it capable of receiving. I would have him poſſeſſed of that ſtrong paſſion for miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Columbus had for diſcovery, and which ſupported him for a long courſe of years againſt the ridicule of the whole world, againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of having his ſervices rejected by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032281_0082_0FF1B28F4D6083C8"/>princes, againſt the ingratitude of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand and Iſabella, and againſt the repeated muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, treachery, and baſeneſs of his companious. I would have him ſo enamoured of his object, as to conſider the hardſhip and danger of the purſuit a pleaſure rather than a pain; and to find in himſelf a diſpoſition to ſucceed, or to periſh in the attempt. If he cannot engage without a with to return to Europe, and with a full determination, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his helper, to die in the harneſs, that man has not the ſoul of a genuine miſſionary.</p>
               <p>Some of my readers will think I draw a glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing picture, and that my colorings betray the glare of enthuſiaſm. They would have their miſſionary, what they call, a prudent man, a man of reaſon and coolneſs. They will ſay that he who engages with ſo much warmth will ſoon have his fire damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and betray as much cowardice in the conflict, as he ſhewed courage before the battle. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſuch Geatlemen to give a candid interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my terms, and to eater into the ſpirit of the writer, as well as into the force of his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Human language is defective. They who uſe it are ſtill more imperfect. I may not have the felicity of expreſſing the idea I would convey, exactly ſuch as it is in my own mind; and though I could ſtamp my ideas on language as clearly and forcibly, as new coin diſplays the impreſſion of the die, yet except my thoughts had the ſame curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as the Kings coin, my reader may eaſily miſtake my meaning, where I have made none in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it; and in this manner every man who writes ſuſtains ſome cenſures which are due to the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d diſingenuouſneſs of his reader. In the light of this obſervation, I beg leave to remark, that Columbus, Cortez, Caeſar, St. Paul, and all thoſe who have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne great things in the world, have poſſeſſed a fire, and energy very uncommon; and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032281_0083_0FF1B2953B24A3E8"/>that this fire, this energy, was abſolutely eſſential to what they undertook and what they performed; but certainly this remark does not ſuppoſe that this fire alone effected every thing. They were men of knowlege, of prudence, and of that coolneſs which tempered their fire, and gave it a proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Had they not been ſupported by theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid qualities Caeſar might have periſhed like Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and St. Paul would never have been God's inſtrument for building the Church. If my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary therefore, has more zeal than good ſenſe, more fire than wiſdom to command it, he will ſoon find that inſtead of walking in the footſteps of an Apoſtle, he is flying on the waxen wings of Icarus, or driving the deſtructive car of the juvenile and preſumptuous Phaeton. Falſe fire will not diſſolve real cold, nor falſe courage ſupport the burſt of cannon.</p>
               <p>But this conceſſion made, I inſiſt upon it, the miſſionary muſt not only have true fire, but a large proportion of it; and I inſiſt upon it ſo much the more, as I ſee very little attention paid to it; as I cannot but think, that too many good men are forcing Zeno's coat upon the affectionate Jeſus; and appear more afraid of offending men by being too hot, than of diſpleaſing God by being too cold. Inſtead of bringing the world over to Chriſt by the godlike irreſiſtible charms of truth propoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falſe ornaments, we endeavor to accommedate it to corrupt minds, by propoſing it under the garb of reaſon, and with the affected ſickly air and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tottering ſteps of morality. In this manner we betray our Maſter, and loſe our own labor. And, however digreſſive this obſervation may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I affirm it has much to do with my ſubject; for until we learn to diſmiſs our moral dialect, and high ſounding talk of reaſon, there will be little right reaſon or good morals in the Church; until
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032281_0084_0FF1B298456009A0"/>we boldly take up the Croſs of the bleſſed Jeſus, and tell mankind that, in religion, there is no other reaſon, no other morals, than that godlike reaſon, thoſe divine morals which He brought down to us from his Father's boſom and treaſured up for us in his holy goſpel, we ſhall never be able to carry on a war of miſſions, nor have apoſtolic men to act in it. A miſſion, contemplated in its true ſpirit, and in all its compaſs of ſacrifice and ſuffering, is not a common thing, and men whoſe minds are of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſt are unfit for it. If, therefore, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement is ſo remote from the common courſe of things, why ſhould miſſionaries be expected to feel and think in the beaten track? If they are to live in fire, where is the abſurdity of wiſhing them to be endowed with the properties of the Salamander? If their work is apoſtolic, how is reaſon violated by expecting they ſhould claim alliance with the blood of St. Paul? — Thanks be to God, his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Son does not treat the ſoldiers of the croſs with that contempt they ſuffer from their fellow Chriſtians! No; the choiceſt conſolations and the moſt joyous hopes are their portion; and if, the afflictions of Jeſus abound in them, they will be comforted with the moſt glorious anticipations of his kingdom and of his joy.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032281_0085_0FF1B299E9F1AFA8"/>through many a well fought field, and endured the various climes of the North and South, we find much more than we are entitled to hope. St. Paul indeed was at once made a Chriſtian and the chief of the Apoſtles. Such power belongeth unto God, and ſuch honor to the man whom He will exalt. But, in ſpite of the example and exhortations of the great St. Paul, Mark fled from the work of the apoſtolic miſſion; nevertheleſs, between the wholeſome cenſures of Paul, and the conſolatory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Barnabas, his ſpirit was, through divine grace, again excited to the fight of faith, and he redeemed his character, and obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port among the Apoſtles. Let the candidate for miſſions be poſſeſſed of what degree of zeal and courage he may, no doubt the day will come, when with fears from within and fightings from without, he will be preſſed beyond meaſure, and feel that nothing but abounding grace and almighty power can conſole and ſupport him. But, if we muſt make ſome abatement for his courage when engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in actual ſervice, and jeopardying his life on the high places of the field, ſurely we ſhould require ſome tolerable degree of ardour before the ſword is drawn and blood is ſpilt. For if the man, who volunteers, and is borne on the ſtrong wing of hope, muſt expect ſuch rude ſhocks in the evil day, what are we to expect from him who enters into Miſſions without zeal or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rgy, and who is, in fact, little better than a preſſed man?</p>
               <p>The third conſideration which I ſhall notice as eſſential to a call to Miſſions is a freedom from ſuch ties as exclude the engagement; and they will be either of a domeſtic or a miniſterial nature. I have more than once expreſſed my ſentiments with reſpect to the propriety of married men and fathers of families engaging in Miſſions. Generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I do not think it adviſeable; but I dare not ſay
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032281_0086_0FF1B29B9C3FA0E0"/>it is improper. I will not diſapprove the man ſo ſituated, who ſhall engage; and, if he and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily conduct themſelves in a miſſion as the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. Egede and his houſehold did in Greenland, they ſhall have my warmeſt commendation. Nay, ſhould they through human weakneſs fail in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and perſeverance, the piety of the attempt will, with me, cover the weakneſs of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the propriety of ſuch an attempt will in my idea depend on circumſtances. The health, ſtrength, and habits of a mother and her children are to be conſidered, as well as the degree of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation which can be afforded them in a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Much will depend on the willingneſs of a miniſter's wife to ſhare his toils and perils, and very much will depend on his own ſtrength of ſoul to ſee his wife and family, languiſhing and dying, if God ſhould appoint it ſo, in conſequence of his engaging them in difficulties which they cannot ſupport. If a miniſter be poſſeſſed of this forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if his wife breathes the ſame ſpirit with himſelf; and if they both think the venture juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, let them go, and give an example to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom which we ſo greatly want. But if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inſpire his wife with his own ſentiments, I am clearly of opinion he has no call to Miſſions. I reaſon thus. If it be ſaid, that the wife of that miniſter has not piety to engage of her own free will, I anſwer Chriſtianity will not juſtify a divorce by leaving her behind him, and good ſenſe will not juſtify him to take her abroad into circumſtances of diſtreſs and danger, where all her paſſions will be armed to war againſt his peace and to diſcredit himſelf in his miniſtry. If it be ſaid, that his wife is a woman of piety, the caſe ſtands ſtill more ſtrongly againſt him, and a dreadful ſuſpicion will lie againſt his piety. For if a woman of piety, his wife, the mother of his children cannot be made to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032281_0087_0FF1B2A04E2D1AC8"/>enter into his call, I muſt ſuſpect that he carries with him abroad more religion than he exerciſes at home; and can entertain very little opinion of his converting Heathens, who cannot convert a godly woman who loves him to follow him to the world's end.—Nor would I recommend the force of ſtrong perſuaſion, much leſs any thing like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal authority, with any woman. The man who does this will find, at laſt, that he rolls the ſtone of Syſiphus, and when he thinks he has got it to the top of the hill, it will return with a double force, acquired by the velocity of its deſcent, and cruſh him to pieces. If a married man wiſhes to engage in miſſions, his firſt care is to inſpire his wife with a portion of his own zeal; if he can do ſo, well; if not I adviſe him to ſlay at home. It is a baſe unmanly thing to complain of our wives; and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were never generally vicious, baſe and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, when men did not make them ſo. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the moſt commanding thing on earth, and women who have the beſt opportunities of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their huſbands piety, and are perſonally attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, will not be the laſt to revere it. The man who charges his wife, in nine caſes out of ten, will reproach himſelf; and I affirm when we dare imitate the Apoſtles, there is little fear of our wives lagging in the race of virtue.</p>
               <p>A miniſter's flock ſhould be as dear to him, and in ſome ſenſe, dearer than his wife and children; and if we are in poſts of uncommon honor and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, it may well admit an enquiry, How far we are juſtifiable in relinquiſhing them? We are giving up a certainty for an uncertainty. The good we ſhall do abroad may bear ſmall proportion with that we leave at home. We may miſtake our call, or we may be called to die, while the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of conqueſt is reſerved for others. We may, for ought we know, groan for years under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032281_0088_0FF1B2A4D64AE0F0"/>of a precipitate conduct, and reproach ourſelves for not having better underſtood our Shepherd's voice. What the charity of others may, and ſhould, lead them to excuſe as the error of an honeſt zeal, we ſhall probably charge on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the proud volatile miſtake of an unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied heart. We may expoſe ourſelves to be the butt of thoſe cold ſpirits who never had religion enough to aſpire to excellence; to be admoniſhed with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but wounding good nature, "I always told you you, "miſtook your call, and would ſoon be glad to come home;" and to be held up as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to thoſe who would do well—"Look on that man; he began to build, and "was not able to finiſh." We may actually grieve God's ſpirit; and never recover a poſt as uſeful in the miniſtry as that we relinquiſhed. And all this may be a very righteous and neceſſary diſcipline to humble the man, who having only the qualification of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant in militia, ſhall aſpire to the rank of colonel in a regiment for foreign ſervice.</p>
               <p>Far be it from me to diſcourage any man; but I muſt hold out no falſe colors. To have a real call to miſſions is a great honor and a great felicity; but to miſtake our call is a ſad thing both to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to others. Nor is there any great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my diſcouraging the man whom God prompts by his ſpirit to embrace this calling. But ſome who are really called may be too haſty; they may miſtake their line of march, or engage before the ſignal for engaging be given.

               <p>Suppoſing the miſſionary candidate has gone over
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032281_0089_0FF1B2A661BEBF88"/>all this ground to his ſatisfaction, the only thing remaining to compleat his call will be a reaſonable proſpect of ſucceſs. To have this reaſonable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs, his meaſures muſt be well conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he muſt be provided with every help, which the nature of the undertaking can require. Let him then aſk himſelf, Have I funds equal to my undertaking, and are the patrons and conductors of the miſſion in England men of zeal and ſpirit, ſuch as I can make perfectly free with, who enter into all my views, and in whom I can perfectly confide, for every encouragement and ſupport? Do they leave me perfectly at liberty to act abroad as I ſee occaſion, not fettering me with cold theoretical councils, and preſcribing with deciſion a line of conduct to me, which amuſes them by their fire ſide to chat over with a friend? Unleſs he can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe queſtions in a ſatisfactory manner, his meaſures are not well taken; and if he is zealous in his purſuit he may leave every thing and ſuffer every thing, to go to India or Japan to ſind his hands tied behind his back when he gets there, and to pine away in vexation and diſappointment.</p>
               <p>Let him aſk farther, Have I fellow ſoldiers like minded with myſelf, and is my miſſion ſo connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conducted, that I can have a ſupply of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as my work ſhall require? Have I ſuch an acquaintance with the country where I am going, of its climate, geography, police and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as I can reaſonably expect to anſwer upon a trial with thoſe views which have engaged me to go there? If he goes alone be ſhould be a man of no little ſtatute. Though he ſhould live and die like David Brainerd, he will in that caſe only relinquiſh a greater good in England to do a ſmaller one abroad. Where a tolerable number of Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are wanting a few individuals may be converted; but the goſpel will not be ſpread—nothing will be
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:032281_0090_0FF1B2A99BBA3888"/>done anſwerable to the idea of a miſſion. And I confeſs I can ſee no reaſon for marching through fire and water to convert a Bramin in India, when with half the labor ten of our own countrymen might be converted at home; except it be to keep up the dying flame of miſſionary zeal, until Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom be ſhamed out of the folly of conducting Miſſions in this lazy, abſurd way. On the other hand, ſhould our information of the place we are going to be defective, we ſhall proceed on falſe principles, and when practice is diſcovered to be ſo oppoſite to our theory, we ſhall be liable to turn on the heel, and ſay, this is not the place to which I am called.</p>
               <p>When a miniſter has patiently examined theſe four topics, his ability, his willingneſs, his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thoſe ties which prohibit the engagement, and the reaſonable proſpect of ſucceeding, and finds them all concurring to countenance the purſuit, he will I think be in poſſeſſion of every thing which ought to be deſired, or can be obtained to make his call clear. He has nothing then to do, but to obey the dictates of his conſcience, and, caſting his care upon the Lord, to make trial of his apoſtleſhip. If he is bleſſed in his deed, he ſhall ſee of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of his Redeemer's ſoul, and of his own, and be ſatisfied. His example will provoke his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to jealouſy, and his ſucceſs encourage our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions. If he ſails, he will diſcourage no man who does not with to be diſcouraged. He may come home, and tell his Brethren ingenuouſly. <q>I have made the attempt and find myſelf inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to it. Nevertheleſs, the foundation abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firm, the obligation of the duty is the ſame, and do you who have more wiſdom and piety ſtand forward as the Champions of Chriſt and his religion. Let no man's heart fail on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; nor ſuppoſe becauſe I have done nothing,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032281_0091_0FF1B2AFE7DD23A0"/>that nothing is to be done by the many veterans who fight under the croſs. You cenſure my raſhneſs, you chide my puſillanimity, and it is of little matter that my character ſink under a weight of reproach which in many reſpects I have deſerved: but do you ariſe and be jealous for your God. Conqueſt hovers over our ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if we dare engage with ſpirit. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed defeated, but not diſcouraged; I deſpair of myſelf, but not of the cauſe of Chriſt. Go, and redeem the honor I have loſt. Wipe away this vile diſgrace, this unutterable ſhame, which reſts upon the Chriſtian name. Let it not be ſaid that in the eighteenth century, in Britain, among the thouſands of miniſters of various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations who are the glory of the Churches, that men are not to be found who feel for man, Chriſtians who are not jealous for Chriſt's glory, miniſters who cheriſh the noble emulation of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the apoſtles. If you will not act, God will raiſe up ſtones to reprove and ſhame you. If you will not act, you almoſt juſtify that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity and cowardice which you cenſure. I have been defeated, but it was in the field, and after receiving many wounds; but you, by more ſhameful cowardice, give up the cauſe for loſt without making one generous effort. I have been raſh in thinking of myſelf more highly than I ought to think, but you almoſt provoke the repetition of my raſhneſs by undervaluing Chriſt and his religion; for when you are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032281_0092_0FF1B2B16FF89808"/>heart it may infer, if this be the grand fault which lies againſt his character, it is of a kind, eſpecially when he comes to ſee and confeſs it ingenuouſly, as infers alſo ſomething which will ſupport him under its conſequences;—as will, with God's grace, lead him to real improvement, and render him more the object of eſteem, than of reproach with all who love God.</p>
               <p>Next to the ineſtimable and irreparable loſs of his own ſoul in attempting to ſave the ſouls of others, perhaps the moſt inſupportable ſhock a miſſionary can have to ſupport, far worſe than death, is that of total diſappointment, together with a diſcovery of having miſtaken his object. Yet to this total diſappointment, to this dreadful diſcovery, is every man liable who engages in Miſſions. This reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould guard us againſt precipitate determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and teach us to meet diſappointments half way. When we are ſoaring in the clouds, we ſhould often bring ourſelves to the ground, by ſaying to ourſelves," Perhaps I "may be miſtaken in my call—perhaps the moſt cruel "diſappointments await me." Such thoughts are the more needful as men of fire, and ſuch miſſionaries will be, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly need them. Too often we deceive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſuppoſing conſtitutional vivacity is Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian zeal; and, though we indulge theſe humbling conſiderations to conſolidate our ſpirits, as much as poſſible, if diſappointment be at laſt our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhall find it hard enough to ſupport the dreadful concuſſion when it comes. Few men of candid minds are wholly blind to conſtitutional fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and if the miſſionary be ſenſible that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect leans to the ſide of falſe fire, it will be doubly neceſſary for him to labor after the ſtronger quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gravity, firmneſs, and ſelf poſſeſſion; and to go forth in utramque paratus to win trophies, or to ſupport the diſgrace inevitably conſequent on an
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032281_0093_0FF1B2B302B1C9F0"/>unſucceſsful attempt. Should a miſſionary ſpirit be generally excited, many, who mean well, will be induced to venture, who, upon the trial, will find their ſtrength inſufficient for an apoſtolic warfare. They muſt, then, either relinquiſh the war, or perſiſt in it to their own ruin. In this dilemma, the man of feeling, honor, ſpirit, may find ſuch a quantum of pride, ſelf confidence, and impatience, in his compoſition, as he never before ſuſpected. His feeling, his ſenſe of honor, his ſpirit, which, with a ſhare of godlineſs, were perhaps the ſecret ſprings of his engagement, will now turn their ſtrength upon himſelf, excruciate him beyond imagination, and, if God's infinite compaſſions do not prevent him, and enable him to ſink quietly into his own nothingneſs at the feet of Jeſus, he will become the prey of that proud ſorrow, which, in ſcripture language, is ſaid <hi>to work death;</hi> or, in the phraſeology of this world, <hi>be will break his heart.</hi> The man who is <hi>perſuaded</hi> to engage in miſſions is free from this danger; but he who, with the ſemblance of apoſtolic zeal, without deep humility, meekneſs and patience, falls into this circumſtance, will experience a hurricane of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which beggars all deſcription. Much of this I have known too well; and I make this confeſſion, that my readers may learn, that I make a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>One more obſervation I ſhall make on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. if we would not diſcourage Miſſions, we muſt beware how we indulge the aſperity of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt thoſe who fail in their attempts. They have paid the penalty of their raſhneſs, as fully as any man of humanity could wiſh. We ſhould remember, it is eaſier to attempt great things than to accompliſh them; and if to the proud humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032281_0094_0FF1B2B562C13398"/>of a man's own mind, and thoſe kindlier one's of God's good ſpirit, this poor dejected mortal is to be reprehended, ridiculed, or, under the pretence of pity, to be the object of the vile contempt of baſe minds, who will engage in great and perilous undertakings? Let Chriſtians, then, imitate the dignity of a Roman Senate, and, inſtead of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring what thouſands can cenſure, and few da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IF we would ſee a general ſpread of the goſpel and multitudes of ignorant Heathen gathered into the ſold of Chriſt, we ſhould endeavor to mend the miſſionary road and to remove from it all unneceſſary turnpikes: we ſhould conſider the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which are made to Miſſions, and, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſatisfactory anſwers, ſhake off thoſe fatal diſcouragements, which counteract our exertions. I beg leave to lay before you ſuch of them as have fallen under my notice, together with ſuch anſwers as I have made to my ſeveral objectors.</p>
               <p>The firſt trite objection thrown in the teeth of the man, who ſpeaks in favor of Miſſions, is, <hi>We have Heathens enough in England, without croſſing the ſea to find them. Convert thoſe we have at home firſt and then look to thoſe abroad.</hi>—This objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reminds me of the language of our Lord, when aſſuming the cold, ſevere air of the Phariſee, he made a trial of the faith of the Syro-phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean woman, who requeſted a cure for her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—<hi>It is not meet to take the children's brean, and give it to dogs.</hi> And I think it may be well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the words of the afflicted mother, <hi>Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the children's table.</hi> If our Lord may decide the point, there was reaſon, as well as faith, in her plea. That there are Heathens in England is a melancholy truth; and it will be equally true, when Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world, as it is at this day. So that, if we wait their converſion,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032281_0096_0FF1B2BE70F4A760"/>the Heathens abroad will never be the better for our love. But, it ſhould be remembered, that our European Heathens periſh by the abuſe of that knowlege, for the lack of which other Heathens are undone. I add, that the Miniſters who go abroad, ſo far from being felt as a loſs at home, will be the means of doing more good among us, than if they had continued in England. For foreign Miſſions will have the ſame influence on religion, as foreign commerce has upon agriculture and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures. As Chriſtianity prevails abroad, ſo it will flouriſh at home. Thus, what is alledged againſt Miſſions is a ſubſtantial argument for engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them.</p>
               <p>Others object, <hi>I know not that God's time for the converſion of the Heathens be yet come. When St. Paul would have gone into Aſia, he was inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the ſpirit; and if St. Paul was miſtaken in ſuch a point, well may we be ſo alſo.</hi>—I anſwer if my objector means to prove any thing, he ſhould advance a ſtep farther, and ſay <hi>I know that God's time is not come; and becauſe St. Paul was forbidden in the courſe of his journey to preach the goſpel in Aſia before he had viſited Macedonia and Greece, (which were riper for receiving the goſpel,) therefore, Chriſtian Miniſters muſt not follow the Apoſtle's example, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, peradventure, they ſhould act under the inhibitions of the ſpirit</hi>—But is <hi>I don't know,</hi> in the lips of any man, to be oppoſed to the authoritative command of Chriſt, <hi>Go, preach the goſpel to every creature?</hi> And is it come to this, that eighteen hundred years after the death of Chriſt, and notwithſtanding the general opinion of the Church evinced, by her engaging, more or leſs, in Miſſions, from that time to this, that we are in doubt about our Maſter's will on a ſubject, which involves the ſalvation of ſo large a part of mankind? If this be the caſe, how are we
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032281_0097_0FF1B2C000CAC240"/>to know God's will? What muſt the Majeſty of Heaven do to ſatisfy our unreaſonable ſpirits? <hi>An evil and adulterous generation ſeek for ſigns.</hi> Our ſcruples ſtamp our character—St. Paul's inhibition proves the very point I contend for—that we ſhould act under the warrant of a general commiſſion. St. Paul did ſo. As a man of ſenſe he made uſe of his reaſon. He had undoubtedly ſpecious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for thinking of going firſt into Aſia; but God, who ſaw farther than he did, ordered him to take another route, and after he had fulfilled that miniſtry, he reſumed his deſign to go into Aſia and ſpent a conſiderable time there, his labors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with the ſame ſucceſs which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in other parts. We read of none of the Apoſtles looking for <hi>particular</hi> intimations of the divine will to direct their labors. Sometimes they had extraordinary intimations, and they obeyed them; but, in their general courſe, after prayer and ſerious deliberation, they did what appeared to them the moſt adviſeable. Laſtly, I aſk why are we, in religion, to contravene every principle of common ſenſe, upon which we act in all other things? Let us do our duty, and ceaſe to move the councils of Heaven for the knowlege of what the Almighty is determined to conceal. Were St. Paul on earth, and an angel from heaven were to preach the doctrine contained in the objection, I am confident, the Apoſtle would ſtrip him of his luminous apparel, and lay his doctrine under an anathema, in all the Churches.</p>
               <p>An objection, ſimilar to the one I have juſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, is urged in the following form—<hi>It appears that the order of events we are taught to expect from the Prophecies, is firſt the deſtruction of the Roman Antichriſt, then the converſion of the Jews, and, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t of all, the fulneſs of the Gentiles; in which work, the converted Jews, it is thought,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032281_0098_0FF1B2FD25BB4958"/>will be the principal inſtruments. The concluſion is, that the time is not yet come for the converſion of the Heathens, and that all our labor to effect it will be loſt.</hi> To this reaſoning, I anſwer firſt, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies comparatively obſcure ſhould not be put in competition with the obligation of clear and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit precepts. Secondly, if all be granted which this objection aſſumes, it will not follow that we ſhould look for the grand events we hope to ſee accompliſhed, in indolence and careleſſneſs. If none but Jewiſh Chriſtians dare ſignalize their zeal for truth in the apoſtolic way, nor are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with apoſtolic ſucceſs, much, very much may yet be done by us, long before we ſhall ſee righteouſneſs covering the earth, as the waters do the face of the deep. How does my object or know, whether the Lord may not make uſe of the zeal of ſincere Chriſtians in ſpreading his Goſpel, as one principal means of converting the Jews? And how many Millions may there not be brought to God, before the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in? We are told that our religion ſhall have a general ſpread, an univerſal prevalence in the world, and we are commanded to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every creature: but inſtead of occupying our talent with faithfulneſs, we fairly bury it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ten. Becauſe the time may not yet be come for the grand converſion of mankind, we take it for granted, that the day is not come for the converſion of any of them; and becauſe we do not hope for apoſtolic ſucceſs, we determine abſolutely to do nothing at all. But ſhall thoſe ſervants be pronounced bleſſed, whom the Lord ſhall find ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>A third objection ariſes from the difficulty of the undertaking. <hi>Miſſionaries at this day,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>have difficulties to ſtruggle with, which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſuperable; nor can men and money be raiſed equal to ſuch extenſive undertakings.</hi> I grant, if we
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:032281_0099_0FF1B2C313098130"/>put Omnipotence out of the queſtion, we have little encouragement to engage in this war. But, I alſo inſiſt, that the inſuperable difficulties ſpoken of exiſt only in our own cowardice. The Jeſuits ſurmounted them all. The Moravians have done the ſame. And other men, who will imitate their intrepidity, will be equally ſucceſsful. Nor are the ſums of money neceſſary for theſe undertakings ſo great as may be imagined.</p>
               <p>When we have proper miſſionaries and have learned to conduct our Miſſions aright, the expence attending them will be greatly diminiſhed. Were as large a ſum as fifty thouſand pounds per annum expended in Miſſions, what a trifle would a ſingle million of money be in the courſe of twenty years, to be raiſed among the Chriſtians of England? And while we pay fourteen or fifteen millions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for the advantage of civil government, what a ſmall offering is fifty thouſand pounds to our Immortal Sovereign for all the bleſſings of his divine religion? Say thet the ſum of thirty five thouſand pounds bounded our benevolence to our Heathen brethren, this would be one million in thirty years. Certainly this money would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably better ſpent than the millions conſumed in one year's war! In the laſt year a ſubſcription of more than twenty thouſand pounds was given to the emigrant miniſters of the Gallican Church; and immenſe ſums are laid out on the ſupport of our poor, every year. I heartily approve of this way of ſpending our money; but may I not aſk, Is the ſpread of Chriſt's religion a matter of common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that we ſhould part with money for Miſſions with as much reluctance as we would part with our blood; and think forty or fifty thouſand pounds, which a ſew Gentlemen of fortune cane afford to throw away on their pleaſures every year, too large a ſum to be applied to the firſt, the greateſt, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032281_0100_0FF1B2C6122ED4B8"/>moſt obligatory charity under heaven? And yet by the expenditure of the ſum I have mentioned might thouſands of Heathen, every year, be brought from darkneſs into light, and turned from the power of Satan to the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>The want of men is the laſt thing to be feared. There exiſts, at this day, in England, a greater number of men who wiſh for this employment, than can well be imagined. They are to be found among all Denominations. Let us but enquire after them and they will appear. But ſo long as Miſſions are diſcouraged and vilified, few of them will brand themſelves for enthuſiaſts, by expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great forwardneſs, and becoming <hi>candidates</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>It will ſtill be objected that, <hi>Facts do not juſtify theſe ſanguine hopes; for no fruit has yet been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Miſſions, worth the money, and toil, and valuable lives, which have been expended on them; and which might have been applied to better purpoſe in Europe.</hi> I anſwer, the facts alluded to, prove nothing but that Miſſions have been very improperly conducted; and, that if they are not taken up with more ſpirit, they are by no means likely to anſwer their end. But, I inſiſt, that the fruit with which they have been attended, proves undeniably what <hi>may be done,</hi> when we exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as we ought to do. I inſiſt, farther, that thoſe Miſſions though unproductive, are very juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, and have anſwered valuable purpoſes. They are juſtiſiable; for the men who have acted in them have done their duty, reſpected their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, felt for humanity, proved their faith, aſſerted the honor of their religion, and glorified the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, faithfulneſs and power of God. It ſhall not avail that the world brands their-lives with madneſs, and eſteems their deaths without honor. Wiſdom will juſtify her children. They have been
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032281_0101_0FF1B2C92D62BA88"/>
                  <hi>wiſe,</hi> inaſmuch as they have been <hi>faithful;</hi> for there is no man, who hath left father or mother, or houſe or lands, or friends or country, for the ſake of Chriſt, who ſhall not receive an hundred fold in the kingdom of God. They have alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered valuable ends. They will juſtify the ways of God to men, in the day of final account, and ſerve to illuſtrate his myſterious providence. They will condemn the Chriſtian world of unbelief. They will have given a great example to us, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen affliction, not with the people of God, but with poor Heathens, in preference to all the riches and honors of Egypt. When Chriſtendom lay aſleep, they alone heard the ſound of arms, and joined the bleſſed Captain of their ſalvation on the plains of Indoſtan, and in the froſts and ſnows of Greenland and Labrador. Like Abraham they went forth to a far country; and though the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the promiſe has not been unto them, yet, like that venerable Patriarch they have ſeen Chriſt's day and rejoiced. In the veracity of the promiſes, they have ſeen his ſeed numerous as the ſands on the ſea ſhore, and reſplendent as the ſtars of heaven. They have obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port through faith, and their bones, like thoſe of Jacob and Joſeph, have taken poſſeſſion of the land of our inheritance. They reſt in glorious hope; and though no proud Mauſoleum of theirs attracts the eye of man, prone to gaze with falſe wonder on earthly pageants, yet Angels in amicable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe will point out each hallowed ſpot, and read the general epitaph—<hi>Theſe were men of whom the world was not worthy!</hi> They plead the cauſe of Chriſt with us, nor ſhall they <hi>always</hi> plead in vain. Their voices ſhall be heard, and all Europe ſhall obey their call. They are the forerunners of the armies of Emanuel, and their labors the welcome drops which promiſe plenteous rain. Until this is
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032281_0102_0FF1B2CC5D312CD0"/>brought to paſs, they have the honor to keep alive the ſpirit of Miſſions; and will claim a large ſhare in the victories of thoſe, who ſhall come after them.</p>
               <p>Some pious men can indulge no hope of ſucceſs in Miſſions, <hi>while the wickedneſs of Europeans ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to prejudice the Heathen againſt the goſpel.</hi> We lament the fatal operation of prejudices which ariſe from that quarter, but think they are preſſed beyond all bounds of truth. No people were more prejudiced againſt Chriſtianity, nor had more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cauſe to be ſo, than the poor Indians of Califor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Paraguay; but their prejudices yielded to the force of reaſon, and the perſevering benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Jeſuits. Truth is great and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. No men are ſo brutiſh as not to be able to diſtinguiſh between a friend and an enemy; and fierce lions have been ſubdued by the blandiſhments of gentle, human kindneſs. Beyond all this we muſt look to the bleſſing of the God we ſerve, and the almighty grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. To hope the beſt is pious and wiſe.</p>
               <p>Many Moraliſts, who, though bred up in the common forms and principles of Chriſtianity, know not how to value their religion, object, <hi>The death of Chriſt was a common ſacrifice; his good ſpirit is given to all men; and if the Heathens obey the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the Spirit; they will be accepted through the merits of the Redeemer's death. Why not, then, leave them to their equitable Judge, who having given them but one talent, will not require from them the improvement of ten.</hi>—God will certainly judge them equitably, and will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to reap what he has not ſown. We grant alſo, that a Heathen may be ſaved without an explicit revelation of the goſpel, though not without ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſpirit and the ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus. But this does not prove, that the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032281_0103_0FF1B2CED8667D90"/>goſpel is not an ineſtimable gift; or that it is not out duty to carry it to them. Farther, I anſwer queſtion with queſtion; and aſk, if a man in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land may be ſaved, though he cannot read his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what need is there of his being able to read it? If ſimple reading be ſufficient, what need is there of liberal education? If man may live on bread and water, what need of a profuſion of meats and drinks? If the blind may travel from one part of the kingdom to another, by the humble helps of his dog and ſtaff, what can there be deſirable in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all the accomodations of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, carriages, and good roads? Not to preſs my objector with a hundred more ſuch queſtions, I affirm, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity gives a perfection to man which ſets him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on a level with angels; and, that the ſpiritual knowlege and piety of a Confucius or a Socrates, is no more to be compared with the attainments of the meaneſt child of God under the diſpenſation of Chriſt, than the knowlege of a Hottentot is to be weighed againſt the cultivated reaſon of a Newton.</p>
               <p>The laſt objection, I ſhall notice, is of a more unequivocal nature than all the reſt. <hi>Miſſionaries are a diſgrace to any nation. Their attempts are highly dangerous; for ſhould they ſucceed in intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Chriſtianity into the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, it would produce revolt in our Colonies, and ſubvert the Britiſh empire in Indoſtan.</hi> This objection has in ſubſtance been urged in a Britiſh Parliament, in the Weſt India Iſlands, and in the debates of the India Directors. I confeſs, I know not how to meet it in the way of argument. The men who make it are as unſit judges of Chriſtianity as the blind are of colors; and are as much diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conviction from reaſoning, as rocks are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to weep over human miſeries. As the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord however I ſhall be told I muſt be meek. Be it ſo. The objection is either true or
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032281_0104_0FF1B2D3822F4F98"/>falſe. If it be true,—if the Doctrine of Chriſt does really tend to produce revolt, and to ſubvert empires, let us open our arms to French Atheiſm. Let us renounce this religion of blood, which curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the world with everlaſting diſorders and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and rejoice that we have lived to a day, when the endleſs whirl of elements and atoms has produced ſuch noble diſcoveries. Let us deify the fieud Marat; and let us tell all our worthy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who pick pockets, cut throats, and delight in ſuch ingenuous arts, that they may diſmiſs all fears of vengeance from the crucified man of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.— But Chriſtianity never did produce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and ſubverſion of empires. It has <hi>no tendency</hi> to produce theſe dreadful conſequences. If indeed it were propoſed to ſend forth booted Apoſtles, to convert the nations by fire and ſword, the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would aſſume the color of truth, <hi>and only the color of truth;</hi> for no unprejudiced man, who ever read the goſpel would dignify ſuch miſſionaries with the epithet of <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> If on the other hand the objection be falſe, it can merit no anſwer but that of indignant ſilence.</p>
               <p>Should it be ſaid theſe apprehenſions do not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate in any tendency which the religion of Chriſt is ſuppoſed to have to operate theſe effects, but in the accidental abuſe to which it is liable from the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant zeal of miſſionaries, the implacable reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Slaves, and the bigotted ſuperſtition of the inhabitants of India, which would render them jealous of innovations in their religion, a ſatisfactory anſwer may be given on all theſe heads. Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can promiſe themſelves no advantage from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing revolt from the Government which protects them. None but good men will engage in Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they muſt abhor every doctrine which diſturbs the peace of ſociety. But a ſmall ſhare of common ſenſe, and of acquaintance with their bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032281_0105_0FF1B2D69DCA4FF0"/>will teach them the neceſſity of enforcing on their converts, that ſalutary doctrine, which St. Paul taught to the numerous ſlaves of the Roman empire—<hi>Let as many ſervants, as are under the yoke, count their own maſters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.</hi> Had the Apoſtle preached other doctrine, he would have armed one half of the world againſt the other, and excited inſurrections and maſſacres throughout the empire, in which the ſlaves were nearly as numerous as the freemen. But, if any miſſionary be blind to this wholeſome doctrine of the Scripture, and if he be deaf to the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of preaching otherwiſe, which he will not fail to hear from every quarter, let the laws claim the penalty of his raſhneſs. We will not exclaim that religion is violated by his puniſhment; and, we expect in return, that the doctrine of God be not blaſphemed, and ſober minded miſſionaries vilified, for the dangerous folly of a few hot headed men.</p>
               <p>I have not heard that any bad conſequences have ariſen in our Colonies from the labors of the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian and Methodiſt miſſionaries; and I am in hopes that the fears of my Weſt Indian countrymen are now pretty well calmed on that head. They now begin to feel the advantage of their miniſtry, and invite them to labor among their ſlaves. When once thoſe poor creatures are made real Chriſtians, they almoſt forget that they are ſlaves. They bleſs God for that afflictive providence, which tore them from their native land, and all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of life, ſince it has placed them in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances favorable to the knowlege of Chriſt, and the ſalvation of their immortal ſouls. The awful prohibitions of Chriſtianity not only wreſt the dagger from their hands, but deprive them of the inclination to uſe it. Inſtead of execrating their enemies, the love of Chriſt compels them to bleſs
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032281_0106_0FF1B2D82F156BC8"/>and pray for them. Such are the effects, with many others highly beneficial, which ſlow, natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and neceſſarily, from the introduction of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Chriſtianity into our colonies.</p>
               <p>What has been ſaid of the influence of religion in the Weſt Indies, will equally apply to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Empire in India. We grant jealouſies may poſſibly be excited among the Natives by the introduction of Chriſtianity, eſpecially among the Mahomedans, whoſe religion conſiders it as meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to make war on all miſbelievers. But, when I reflect on the general character of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Indoſtan, I cannot believe any inſurrections on that account very probable. If the Britiſh power there ſhould ſuffer ſomething in the attempt, the ſucceſs of the attempt muſt give it a ſtability which it has not yet felt. And if the ambition and avarice of the India Company do not one day ruin their affairs, there is no reaſon to fear that the God, at whoſe command empires riſe and fall, will overturn their empire for the damnable crimes of countenancing truth, piety, and benevolence. If India Directors are too far gone in earthly policy to attend to theſe reaſonings, we need not their ſervices. In Calcutta we dare aſſert the liberties of Englishmen, and the right of Chriſt's ſervants to preach the goſpel to every creature. If thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties are refuſed, and that right is laughed at, I hope the Eaſt will ſoon be filled with miſſionaries, who dare ſuffer any thing which the Governors of India dare inflict, and who, under the fierceſt fire of perſecution, ſhall ſpread, on every ſide, the light of the Glory of God, in the face of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Having run over this ſtring of objections, and, as I hope, given them a ſatisfactory anſwer, I beg leave for a moment to call your attention to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration not irrelevant to the ſubject of Miſſions.—Is nothing to be done for the millions who groan
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032281_0107_0FF1B2DB4BF04258"/>under the iron rod of Antichriſt? Will it be a ſufficient reaſon for Proteſtant Miniſters to give to Jeſus Chriſt, for not declaring the truth of the goſpel in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, that there are inquiſitions in thoſe countries, and that our lives muſt be the forfeiture of doing our duty? Would not the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in the early ages, have bluſhed at ſuch a plea? What is become of the zeal which actuated our forefathers at the Reformation? Italy abounds with Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts and Atheiſts. Even in Spain and Portugal, the gloomieſt regions of hateful ſuperſtition, there is reaſon to believe that many thouſands would give a hearty reception to the Proteſtant doctrine. Rome is now defended by Britiſh valor. Her Miniſters, who in their turn, fall under the edge of that ſword, which they once wielded until it was drunk with Proteſtant blood, may have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moderation from their ſufferings. Foſtered in the benevolent boſoms of Engliſh Proteſtants, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing a ſerious regard to religion in this country, which they could hardly believe exiſted among us, and obſerving the fraternal love which unites us, and is the happy conſequence of mutual toleration, may we not hope that this is a favorable time for diſcuſſing, with candor and benevolence, the grand truths in diſpute between the Roman and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Communions? Chriſtendom is now weary of the Papal yoke. It has been too long miſtaken by many for the eaſy yoke of Jeſus; and while they revolt from Rome, they at the ſame time renounce allegiance to God, and his Chriſt. Are no means, then, to be uſed to remedy theſe dreadful evils, but that of the exterminating ſword? Surely much may be expected from rational controverſy. Our books may be circulated through Europe, and they will convey the beſt antidote to thoſe poiſonous publications, whereby French Atheiſts are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032281_0108_0FF1B2DFC4D4C160"/>religion, morals, and government in the world. The reaſons, which vindicate the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of exhorting you to undertake Miſſions among Heathens, will evince the neceſſity of doing the ſame among the catholics and the followers of Mahomet. And may we not believe, that God will take it well at our hands, before his judgments wholly overwhelm Babylon, if we give a loud and affectionate call to all who fear God, in any degree, among her ſons, to flee from the evil to come, and to relinquiſh her Communion, before ſhe ſinks in avenging fire?</p>
               <p>Earneſtly beſeeching the God of all mercy, to give us in all theſe reſpects, and in every thing elſe which involves our duty and faithfulneſs, as Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the myſteries of Chriſt, an honeſt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened judgment.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IN a former letter, I endeavored to excite your zeal by ſetting before you the example of the Apoſtles. In the preſent letter, I ſhall attempt to call forth the ſentiments of ſhame, indignation, and ſelf contempt, by reminding you of the conduct of the children of this world, whom our Lord pronounces wiſer in their generation than the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light.</p>
               <p>Their ſuperior wiſdom is ſeen in the agreement of their principles and practices; in the fitneſs of the means they employ to the ends they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh; in the boldneſs and comprehenſion of their plans; and in the policy, energy, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, with which they effect their purpoſes. Nor is this to be wondered at. They are <hi>children of the world.</hi> They live in their own element; and breathe a congenial air. Familiarly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the objects around them, they tread a beaten path, and animate each other by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and their ſhouts. Their principles originate in their nature, are ſtrengthened by early habits, ſharpened by education, and receive their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that grand ſcience the knowlege of life, in which they find the major part of all ranks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, avowing, vindicating, applauding, and acting upon principles ſimilar to their own. They diſcover their leading intereſt with inſtinctive ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and hunt down their prey with the fierceneſs of the lion, or the crafty doublings of the fox.</p>
               <p>With the children of light, who dwell in the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032281_0110_0FF1B2E481AE5028"/>midſt of darkneſs, it is far otherwiſe. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſpirit, and manners, have little affinity with thoſe of the world; and they are naturally deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hated, and ridiculed by her children. As ſtrangers, they traverſe an unknown country; as pilgrims, they enjoy few accommodations; and as ſoldiers, they tread on hoſtile ground, and fight their way with difficulty. Too often, diſcouraged by the ſeverity of their warfare, and the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their exile, they wiſh for the wings of the dove, that they might flee away, and be at reſt. With implacable reſentments the God of this world and his armies purſue them, as the fugitives of his kingdom; and, what is worſt of all, they carry in their own breaſts traitors, who would perſuade them to return from the fatigues of the wilderneſs to the fleſh pots of Egypt. Their old man ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles againſt the new one, inveterate habits recur, and the ſtubborn principles of earthly policy, at one time, reſiſt the wiſdom which cometh from above, and, at another, modify and accommodate it to the intereſts of the fleſh. Hence religion ſits aukwardly upon us. Hence our purpoſes are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, poſtponed, or executed with a timidity and ſupineneſs, which deprive them of half their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and indicate that they poſſeſs but half our hearts.</p>
               <p>But, if the children of this world often ſeduce us to evil, they alſo afford us many admirable leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons how to do well.

               <p>Let us firſt caſt our eyes on the maſs of men, ſoldiers, ſailors, laborers, and low mechanics, who are called plebeians, the vulgar, the rabble, the herd. Theſe poor men toil to extreme laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

Thouſands of them are continually cruſhed in mines, burnt in furnaces, immerged in waters, poiſoned, ſlaughtered, wracked to death with rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm, or pine away in conſumption. Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fatal caſualties are daily hurrying them into eternity. Yet they do not complain, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and cheerful. With manly firmneſs, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the load of life, and calmly tread the path which conducts them to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd. For ſix pence a day, the ſoldier expoſes his life, and when the ball penetrates his cheſt, or his vitals palpitate on the bayonet, beguiles his anguiſh with the thought that he falls on the bed of honor, and dies in the defence of his country. For a trifling ſtipend, the mariner encounters all the dangers of the deep, and braves a war of elements. Amid thick darkneſs, loud thunder, livid lightening, and deluging rains, he mans the rocking yards, climbs the reeling maſt, or toils at the laborious pump. Faithful to his ſhipmates, and obedient to the maſter, he declines no ſervice but courageouſly keeps death at bay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſinks beneath a mountain of waters. All this do theſe poor men riſk and ſuffer, ſtrange to tell, without one Chriſtian principle to ſupport the ſoul: While we, under all the ſanctions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, boaſting patrician minds, enlarged with ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſuperior to vulgar flights, <hi>dare not</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their hardihood. A morſel of bread which is all they ſeek, and all they gain, weighs heavier on the balance than the love of Chriſt, the glory of God, the ſalvation of men, the authority of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſenſe of right, the principle of honor, and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032281_0112_0FF1B2ED70E24840"/>all the praiſe and glory of an immortal crown!! Well might our Lord exhort us to <hi>labor</hi> for the bread that periſheth not, and to <hi>agonize</hi> to enter in at the ſtraight gate!</p>
               <p>Conſider next the officers of the army and navy. They are born as well, educated as delicately, and have as large ſhare of the good things of this world as the miniſters of the goſpel. They are reſined in their ideas, often effeminate in their manners, and in their perſons, not more robuſt than ourſelves. But when their country calls for their ſwords, they come forth with a commendable gallantry; and, without the hardy habits of the private, go through the ſame fatigues, and confront the ſame perils. Not content with meeting dangers they cannot ſhun, the principle of honor, and the hope of preferment, puſh them on to ſeek occaſions of diſtinction by atchievements of heroiſm. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they have parents, wives, and children, as we have, who depend for a maintenance on the lives of which they are ſo prodigal.</p>
               <p>But how do the officers of the armies of Chriſt conduct themſelves? Little better, I am ſorry to ſay, than an undiſciplined militia, who have covenanted to fight only pro aris et focis; and who are encouraged to put on a red coat and parade in military pomp, becauſe they flatter themſelves they ſhall never be brought to puſh a bayonet. To ſee us exerciſe at home might give a high idea of our courage and proweſs, if it were not too well underſtood that we had an invincible diſlike to hard blows and long marches. Good God! what flowing eloquence, what ſtrength of reaſoning, what animated declamation, do we hear from our pulpits! What potent demonſtrations of the truths of Chriſtianity, what confutations of infidelity, what accurate inveſtigation of moral duties, what vehement recommendation of Chriſtian graces,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032281_0113_0FF1B2EF005451F0"/>employ the preſs! And who would not think, that among the many who write and ſpeak ſuch things, a tolerable number might be found to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate in foreign parts a religion of which we are ſo proud at home? Alas! while we have ſoft pulpits and well dreſſed congregations, ſnug livings and quiet cures, good food and decent clothes, and may relieve the dry ſtudy of the Apoſtles and Prophets, by wantoning in the circle of ancient and modern ſcience, we manoeuvre to admiration. But to abjure all ſcience except that of the goſpel, to compaſs ſea and land for the love of Chriſt, to proſtitute our eloquence by ſtammering in a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongue, to exchange our poliſhed friends for ſavage aſſociates, to break our conſtitution with hardſhips in a ſickly clime, and to put off the fine Gentleman, that we may put on the rough garb of Chriſt's ſoldiers, are things hardly mentioned, and never taught in our colleges and univerſities.</p>
               <p>What a pity it is, Reverend Brethren, that men like us ſo gentle and pacific, ſo averſe to the alarms of war, ſo unambitious of martyrdom, and ſo enamoured of the ſciences, ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted under the banners of a Prince who affected to be neither philoſopher, grammarian, nor rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician: who ſuffered ſo much in his own perſon as to be willing to allow ſmall intervals of repoſe to his followers; who, inſtead of putting pens in our hands, lays croſſes on our backs; and who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of deceiving us with fair ſpeeches, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hopes of ſecular emoluments, declares unce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniouſly, that if any man will not deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and follow him, although it be to certain death, he is unworthy of him!—Would to God this were a ſubject in which there was no place for theſe biting ironies. But I am ſick at heart. I bluſh for myſelf and the honor of my corps, and muſt write what I feel.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032281_0114_0FF1B2F08F1484F8"/>Shall the principle of honor, and the hope of ſlow, petty, precarious preferment, advance the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world to the rank of heroes, while the certain, glorious preferments held out to us by the Son of God have no power to move us, but are trodden under foot, as though they were huſks, or we were ſwine?</p>
               <p>Advance next, ye ſons of learning, arts, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and try upon us lagging racers, the powers of your manly eloquence, and the evidence of your demonſtrations. In the preſent century, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography and Aſtronomy have received great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, at conſiderable expence, by long, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous voyages, travels full of fatigue and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, and painful obſervations taken in the Arctie Circle, on the ſummits of the Andes, and in the Iſlands of the South Seas. By theſe undertakings the names of Cooke, Wallis, Banks, Ledyard, Haughton, Maupertius, and others, have been reſcued from oblivion, and will be handed down to poſterity, together with the names of the great Kings, whoſe commands they executed, as long as the records of ſcience ſhall ſubſiſt. But are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the tranſit of Venus, the menſuration of a degree of longitude, the ſolving the problem of a Southern Continent, objects of ſuch magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? Will they exonerate the Princes who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or the men who performed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, from the imputation of idle curioſity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable temerity, and a waſte of treaſure and of blood? If they do, and if He who made man in his own image, and redeemed him by the death of his own Son, be able to appreciate the value of an immortal ſoul, are there not inducements to draw the Miniſters of Chriſt to Africa, Aſia, and the South Seas, infinitely more worthy of a noble mind, than the acquiſition of wealth or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſcience? Shall religion refuſe to

Or, have the ambaſſadors of God leſs affiance on his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the naturaliſt who explores the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous chaſms and tremendous crater of a volcano? O God of the Chriſtians, ſuffer it no longer! If the great and ſtrong decline the conflict, let the baſe and weak again ſhew the world, that thy Majeſty condeſcends to employ the meaneſt inſtruments, and that thy religion prevails not by the wiſdom of man, but by the powers of thy ſpirit, O Lord!</p>

               <p>HAVING traced the general outline of what I have to offer on Miſſions, I leave it to be filled up by your private meditations, or by ſome abler artiſt, who may be excited to preſent you with a finiſhed piece on this intereſting ſubject. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade myſelf to lay aſide my pen, without again addreſſing to you the word of exhortation, and when ſo many are forward in calling you into the field of political, or polemic, diſcuſſion, certainly I may be bold in provoking you to love of the moſt diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted kind, and to thoſe good works which are the moſt acceptable to God, as they originate in the pureſt principles.</p>
               <p>In the Reverend Mr. Carey's Publication on this ſubject, I was ſtruck with the following paſſage, which I ſhall requeſt permiſſion to lay before you. <q>A Chriſtian miniſter is a perſon who in a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſenſe is <hi>not his own;</hi> he is the ſervant of God, and therefore ought to be wholly devoted to him.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032281_0119_0FF1B2FF6508D9A8"/>entering on that ſacred office, he ſolemnly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to be always engaged, as much as poſſible, in the Lord's work, and not to chuſe his own pleaſure or employment, or purſue the miniſtry as a thing which is to ſerve his own ends, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, or as a kind of <hi>bye work.</hi> He engages to go where God pleaſes, and to do, or endure what He ſees fit to command, in the exerciſe of his function, He virtually bids farewell to friends, pleaſures, and comforts, and ſtands in readineſs to endure the greateſt ſufferings in the work of his Lord and Maſter.—It is inconſiſtent with miniſters to pleaſe themſelves with the thoughts of a numerous auditory, cordial friends, a civilized country, legal protection, affluence, ſplendor, or even a competency. The ſlights and hatred of men, falſe friends, gloomy priſons and tortures, the ſociety of barbarians of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth ſpeech, miſerable accommodations in wretched wilderneſſes, hunger &amp; thirſt, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wearineſs, and painfulneſs, hard work, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worldly encouragement, ſhould rather be the objects of their expectation. Thus the Apoſtles acted in the primitive times, and endured hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt; and though we, who live in a civilized country, where Chriſtianity is protected by law, are not called to ſuffer theſe things while we continue here, yet, I queſtion, whether all are juſtified in ſtaying here, while ſo many are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing without the means of grace in other lands. Sure I am that it is entirely contrary to the ſpirit of the goſpel, for its miniſters to be actuated by intereſted motives. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their commiſſion is a ſufficient call for them to venture all, and, like the firſt Chriſtians, go every where preaching the goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, Reverend Brethren, are ſentiments wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032281_0120_0FF1B305976DAE40"/>of our character as the <hi>Servants of God.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by mercenary eſſayiſts and faſhionable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers they find acceptance with you, and are cheriſhed in your breaſts: but, alas! how negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent are we in giving theſe principles their proper culture! <hi>Principles</hi> did I call them?—To what a dilemma am I reduced? Shall I wound you, or wrong the truth? Better far, if it be ſo, to offend men than God. No, Brethren, I dare not call them <hi>principles,</hi> otherwiſe than as they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a ſpeculative ſublime theory, which few of us care to practiſe. In the cloſet we ſometimes meditate upon them with delight; in the pulpit we enforce them with energy; but how ſoon, how very ſoon, do we go away, and forget what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men we are?</p>
               <p>"Who is he," ſaid the beloved diſciple, <q>that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</q> Alas! of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of our Iſrael, whether miniſters or their flocks, how few are they whoſe religion will bear this teſt? Where are the holy, happy ſpirits who have <hi>overcome</hi> the world, and by a truly glorious victory caſt contempt on Macedon and Rome? Where are the men whoſe converſation is ſo in heaven, who ſo behold the glory of God, as to be raiſed above the intereſts, the hopes, the fears, the pomps and vanities of our petty ſyſtem? O how very few there are to whom we can point with our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſay, that man is truly apoſtolic! The great majority of ſuch as, in the judgment of charity, may be deemed <hi>ſincere</hi> Chriſtians, are, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in a feeble, infantile, unſettled ſtate, halting often, ſometimes ſtumbling, grieving their friends and affording triumph to their enemies. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the revival of religion which has taken place in England, in the laſt fifty years, what little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith, what coldneſs of love is there among
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032281_0121_0FF1B3089B7CC610"/>us? While we compare ourſelves among ourſelves we are all diſpoſed to aſſume praiſe; but when we place ourſelves in the light of God's countenance, with what difficulty do we endure the divine ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor? What doubts, what fears, too often repel our confidence, confound our ſpirits, ſtop our mouths and prevent the delightful accents of Abba Father, which can alone gladden our hearts?</p>
               <p>When I conſider the ſtate of things among us, I wonder that infidels have not thought it worth their while to follow, more generally, in the track of Mandeville, and relinquiſhing the attacks upon the doctrine and evidences of Chriſtianity, directed their malice to a more vulnerable art, and ſtabbed our Savior through the perſons of his followers. Where truth and brotherly kindneſs find ſo much to cenſure and lament, what havoc might we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ignorance, falſhood, and malignity? This indeed appears to have been the mode of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack adopted by Voltaire and other peſtiferous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits on the Continent. They have prevailed. The religion of Jeſus is proſcribed, his ſabbaths are changed, his croſs trampled upon, and his mediation deſpiſed. But could Voltaire and his nefarious colleagues work ſuch wonders? God forbid! The Prieſts, the Prieſts betrayed their God and their religion. Their bigotry, ſuperſtition, ſecular and ſpiritual wickedneſſes, have made their flocks infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and atheiſts, and a holy, righteous God has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them over to be deſtroyed and plundered, by the miſerable men whom they have provoked to madneſs, and cauſed to blaſpheme that venerable name by which they were called. May we ſee the rod, and learn inſtruction from their fall! May we be jealous of our miniſtry, and compel men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it, by ſo making the light of our holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to ſhine before them, that they may ſee our good works and glorify our Father who is in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032281_0122_0FF1B30A28880D88"/>heaven. The miniſtry has long fallen under great contempt among us, and the laity too generally conſider us as mere ſecular men, who declaim for pay and with vile grimace, one day out of ſeven, hold forth a language, which if true, condemns ourſelves as much as thoſe who hear us. Inſtead of blaming them, let us reform ourſelves, Inſtead of talking of the dignity of our character, let us learn to feel and to ſupport it. Let us ſhew them that we deſpiſe money, are ſuperior to popularity, and have renounced all meddling with what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign to our calling. Let us mark the example of St. Paul, "Giving," as he ſays, <q>no offence in any thing that the miniſtry be not blamed; but in all things approving ourſelves as the miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, in diſtreſſeſs, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in faſſings, by pureneſs, by knowlege, by long ſuffering, by kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteouſneſs on the right hand and on the left, by honor and diſhonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and behold we live; as chaſtened, and not killed; as ſorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us do this, and the miniſtry will hold up its head. And ſhould it be thought, that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our living in a Chriſtian country and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the protection of equal laws, diſpenſe with our exhibiting ſome of thoſe atteſtations of our miniſtry which the Apoſtle enumerates, I beg leave to obſerve that as a mere nominal Chriſtianity in our countrymen will never ſhield us from contempt, hatred, reproach, and perſecution, as far as the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032281_0123_0FF1B30CA1AA0EA8"/>laws of the land will permit, in the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our miniſtry, ſo the poſſeſſion and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of fervent and expanſive charity, both to the evil and the good, would neceſſarily make us ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize with the Apoſtles in labors, watchings, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, affliction, neceſſities, and diſtreſſes of various kinds. An attempt to do much good is the ſure way to ſuffer much evil. Provided we will let the world go on as it pleaſes, and ſee our fellow creatures poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perdition without any, or with only feeble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſave them, they will leave us alone, and perhaps ſpeak well of us; but let us throw our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their way, let us attempt to ſtem the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and we ſhall find religion will receive little better treatment at this day, than it did eighteen hundred years ago. Our meeting with ſo little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for righteouſneſs ſake, is one demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our religion does not over much gall the Devil and his children.

To what can it be aſcribed, but to the prevalence of this ſpirit, and of theſe manners, that we hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever think of them? Are not Heathens men? Have they not ſouls to be ſaved? Dare we avow other end in our miniſtry than the ſalvation of men's ſouls? Are we not commanded to go and preach the goſpel to them? Are there any diſcouragements which ſtop the children of the world in the purſuit of money; and if we loved ſouls as well as they love money would diſcouragements ſtop us? Are the miniſters of the goſpel the only men born with the ſouls of women?

And if Heathens are men, have ſouls, and and the only end of our miniſtry is the ſalvation of men's ſouls; if we are commanded to preach the goſpel to them, if we love ſouls as well as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world love money, if we are not wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the form of men, and if the ſufferings of Jeſus prohibit all puſillanimous clamors about ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and danger, is not our God jealous, does he not require cheerful, uniform obedience, and will He hold us guiltleſs, if we refuſe to obey his pleaſure?

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032281_0125_0FF1B315E728B820"/>in our ſouls, which aſpires to heavenly praiſe and glory?

This fellow had better think of his own preferment, and dream of miſſions on a ſoft bed, than thus proclaim himſelf a fool by ſuppoſing his letters can do good in the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Churchmen, Diſſenters, Methodiſts, what will you reply to this reproach? Shall we make a book to confute him? It will be found, I fear on the trial, that it is eaſier to make a hundred books, than to engage one man to prove the ſincerity of his love to periſhing ſinners, by ſacrificing himſelf and his family to their welfare. Here we are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from each other in various points, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending hard to ſhew that our own Sect, whatever it is, is lodged in the in the penetralia of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Truth, and is the foremoſt in the race for leaven; but when the queſtion is put, Which of you will forſake all, deny himſelf, take up his croſs, and, if God pleaſes, die, for his religion? It preſently appears that Churchmen, Diſſenters, and Methodiſts, are more cloſely united in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and practice than they are aware of. We all ſtraightway, with one conſent, begin to make apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies and to ſay, I pray have me excuſed, while ſome openly caſt contempt on the undertaking, and throw out evangelical jokes upon the few who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider miſſions in a ſerious light. Shall Churchmen, Diſſenters, Methodiſts, deny theſe facts, becauſe there are among each of them a few men whoſe conduct may be urged as an exception againſt them? Surely this is diſingenuous.</p>
               <p>Many of us complain of an antichriſtian union between Church and State, and that religion is
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032281_0127_0FF1B31C21583970"/>fettered, and made, like a child, to walk in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrings. We ſay that religion flouriſhed moſt when ſhe had to contend with the State, and had no other ſupport than what ſhe derived from her own native ſtrength. Let this be granted. It was ſo once, but it is a little problematical, whether it would be ſo now. "Tempora mutautur et nos matamur "in illis." Are we <hi>apoſtolic Chriſtians?</hi> Can <hi>we</hi> contend with hunger, thirſt, cold, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, perils, and the ſword? Can <hi>we</hi> walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe leading ſtrings? If we can, and if we feel them ſo gulling, ſo degrading, why do we not do ſo? Are there not two thirds of the world, where we ſhall not be inſulted by legal protection, or be paid, like ſecular men, for our labor? Have we not full opportunity of ſhewing the politicians and great men of Europe, that Chriſt, his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and people, are able to uphold their religion in the world, without their ſupport, and that we can multiply now, as in the primitive times, like the polypus, when he is cut in pieces? And yet the preciſe reaſon why we do not engage in Miſſions is becauſe we cannot enjoy that <hi>ſecular</hi> protection, and thoſe <hi>ſecular</hi> comforts, which we have in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. To follow the Son of God where he has no place to lay his head, and no other recompence to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us, than the cup he drank of and the baptiſm with which he was baptized, is more I fear than we are able to do: and until we can do ſo, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main very queſtionable, whether we can walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our leadings ſtrings.</p>
               <p>This appears to be the caſe ſo evidently, that thoſe who patronize Miſſions feel it neceſſary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize them, and to put them, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on the ſame footing as a parochial Cure in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. They are afraid of alarming us by ſhewing the dark ſide of things, and hardly conceive that there exiſts among us men, whoſe ſpirits dare aſpire
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032281_0128_0FF1B31F21628A10"/>to an <hi>apoſtolic</hi> warfare. Hence it is, that neither they nor we have faith to think of ſubduing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; nor are they to be ſubdued by a few fair weather ſoldiers, accompanied by delicate women and children, educated in faſhionable accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and accuſtomed to all the delicacies of life; who are abſolutely incapable of expoſing themſelves to ſun, or wind, or rain, or of exerciſing thoſe charities which were once the ornament and praiſe of Chriſtian matrons. I fear, I fear greatly, that I write to the winds, and that neither Chriſtian Miniſters, nor their wives, have platy enough for this engagement; and that the Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we are able to ſend out with the equipage they require for their camp, will do no more towards ſubduing India to the faith of Chriſt, than a few effeminate Aſiatics, with their Harams and dancing girls, would do in an attempt to bring Great Britain under the yoke of the Mogul.</p>
               <p>If there were abſolutely none to encourage the attempt, and nothing exiſting at this day in the form of a miſſion, the conduct of the miniſters of Chriſt would be more excuſable; but it ſeems, as if the Providence of God had kept alive ſome ſenſe of duty, and ſome examples of zeal, both among laity and clergy, to be a teſtimony againſt us, and to hold us up to infamy to future generations. What is done, indicates, that we know our duty; and what is left undone evinces, that we have no inclination to do it. We miniſters have no reaſon to complain of the laity. They are willing to give us all encouragement; nay, they <hi>invite</hi> and <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit</hi> us to engage; and freely offer to do all in their power to make us comfortable; and yet we refuſe to ſtir. I am ſorry to ſay, that this reproach falls more immediately on myſelf and other <hi>goſpel</hi> miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the eſtabliſhment. The Sierra Leone Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainſhip went a begging pretty far before it fell into
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032281_0129_0FF1B322352020D0"/>the hands of my Colleague and myſelf; and now that we have declined it, it lies neglected, as no man thinks it worth his while to pick it up. For ſome years great enquiries were made to procure an Aſſiſtant miniſter for the Reverend Mr. Johnſon, at Port Jackſon, and with infinite difficulty, that poſt is, at laſt, ſilled: but all the enquiries made among <hi>goſpel</hi> miniſters, for three years paſt, and, which are ſtill making, after an aſſiſtant for the Reverend Mr. Brown, at Calcutta, have hitherto been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. Whether this does us honor, I leave the world to judge. I ſhall however contraſt theſe facts with one from Mr. Spangenberg, a Moravian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who informs us, that when, at Bethlehem in North America, letters were read in the Brethren's congregation, ſtating, that ſeveral of their miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries had been carried off by ſickneſs in the Iſland of St. Thomas, in the Weſt Indies, <hi>that very day</hi> ſeven Brethren offered to go and replace them.— This is juſt what things ought to be, and any Church which can produce ſuch men may engage in Miſſions.</p>
               <p>That our Brethren of the various denominations of Engliſh Diſſenters have any cauſe to rejoice over us in this reſpect is more than I know. Except the Reverend Mr. Carey and a friend who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies him, I am not informed of any of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who are engaged in Miſſions. Would to God they would undertake ſomething in this way for Chriſt, which might provoke us to jealouſy!— The Reverend Dr. Coke has of late years done ſomething in this way in our Weſt India Iſlands; and might have done much more, had the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt Preachers, <hi>as a body,</hi> given him that unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal ſupport, to which his zeal in ſuch a cauſe ſhould entitle him.—Hitherto thoſe Miſſions may be conſidered as <hi>his</hi> miſſions, rather than thoſe of the Methodiſts. I am, however, happy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032281_0130_0FF1B323C80EF148"/>that his Brethren, begin to enter more heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily into the ſpirit of Miſtions, and I flatter myſelf they will now embark in them, with all their ſoul, and all their ſtrength. But, whether they do it or not, it is infinitely to be deſired that it ſhould be done by ſome of us; for however we may ſuppoſe ourſelves entitled to reprove each other about mode; of faith and forms of worſhip, upon this buſineſs, I know not who may throw the firſt ſtone. And if I take the liberty of ſpeaking ſo freely, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to God, it is not becauſe I ſuppoſe myſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to reprove others from any merit of my own; but becauſe I ingenuouſly confeſs my ſin, and am willing to come in for a full ſhare of our common ſhame.</p>
               <p>Our conduct in reſpect of Miſſions, evinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond every thing the low degraded ſtate of the Chriſtian miniſtry, and the ideas which too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevail about it threaten to degrade it ſtill lower. An improper attachment to ſecular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and honors, exerts too much of its baleful influence over thoſe whoſe principles teach them better things; but what conſequences may not be expected to flow from the lave of money, and the love of praiſe, when men of the firſt character and influence in the church avow them, as <hi>allowable motives of miniſterial conduct.</hi> Nevertheleſs, we have lived to hear them ſo avowed, and to the ſhame of human nature, but to the exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſcripture declaration, that by wiſdom man knew not God, to hear them avowed from the admirable pen of ARCHDEACON PAIEY. After ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing other reaſons to ſhew that a diſtinction of orders in the miniſtry, is moſt conducive to the general ends of its inſtitution, he concludes as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows — <q>And laſtly, that the ſame fund pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces more effect, both as an allurement to men of talents to enter into the Church, and as a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032281_0131_0FF1B32777B39138"/>to the induſtry of thoſe who are already in it, when diſtributed into prizes of different value, than when divided into equal ſhares.</q>—Paley's Moral Philoſophy, vol. 2, p. 323.</p>
               <p>God of heaven and earth, what a ſtab is this to the vitals of thy religion! I appeal to every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in England, Whether all the talents, all the learning, and all the virtues of a Paley, can ſhield the man who avows theſe ſentiments from his contempt? And yet this is the man who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us <hi>morals</hi>—who inſtructs our young miniſters— whoſe book is honored and applanded in our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities! But who that adopts theſe ſentiments will engage in miſſions? Alas, the <hi>allurement, the ſtimulus, the prizes,</hi> Mr. Paley talks of, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to cultivate their talents with as much care as he has done, and to write as well as he has written; and they may, perhaps, draw from our eccleſiaſtical lottery, as rich a prize as he has drawn; but as ſoon may the carrion crow beget a dove, as they will induce him to conduct himſelf in a miniſtry as becometh the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus it is that we are not aſhamed to drive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent bargains with the Son of God, and tell him we will ſtoop to aſſume the contemptible character of his ambaſſadors, if he will hold out to us rich and honorable prizes to allure men of our talents into the Church, and to ſtimulate our induſtry when we are in it. Truth, virtue, religion, God and heavenly glory, are no allurements, no ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, to our aſpiring minds, until they receive the currency of this world, by being attached to the fools cap of human honor, or to that pernicious metal, which can transform the Apoſtles of Satan into the miniſters of Chriſt. Others of us appear aſhamed of theſe ſimonical practices, and ſay, <q>Lord I will follow thee witherſoever thou goeſt; only ſhew me a little more indulgence than thou
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032281_0132_0FF1B32D8829C478"/>haſt ſhewed to thyſelf. Excuſe me from watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and agonizing with thee in Gethſemane. I will take up my croſs; I only deprecate the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crucified upon it. I am willing to forſake much; but compaſſionate my weakneſs, and do not command me to ſell all. I will follow thee any where on land; but O ſpare me the horrors of a voyage by ſea. I will preach for thee amongſt the pooreſt of my own nation; but do not ſend me to a ſtrange country. I acknowlege I am a miſerable ſinner, unworthy to be a door keeper in thy houſe, nevertheleſs, my elocution is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, I am much followed and applauded: Will it not be more for thy glory for me to ſtay at home, while any man of inferior talents may go and preach to the Heathens? I have heard that they offer human ſacrifices in Otaheite, eat men in New-Zealand, are abſolutely brutiſh at Port Jackſon, and that the ſcorching ſun and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy rains in Africa are inevitably fatal. O let the life of thy ſervant be precious in thy ſight! Send me not to untameable barbarians, or to a clime where I cannot be certain of my life for a day. Beſides the difficulties of theſe undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are inſuperable. It is probable I muſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the ground for my maintenance, and I have been brought up delicately from a child. Thy Apoſtles who were poor fiſhermen, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſeſſed my extenſive learning, elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and genteel notions, were well ſuited to this rough work; yet even they preached to a civilized people, and being furniſhed with miraculous powers, their labors were the more productive; but what ſhall I do who have not their advantages, and have my mind ſo vitiated by falſe learning, that I cannot ſtoop to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the goſpel? Certainly to engage in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is to plough on a rock, or to build on the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032281_0133_0FF1B33087B849B0"/>wave. O let me be any thing but a miſſionary, for my ſoul ſinks within me at the mention of it, nor can I derive any conſiderations from earth, heaven, or hell to make me willing to die for thy ſake. I am not ſingular in my opinion of miſſions, for we are all agreed clergy and laity, churchmen and diſſenters, Indian directors and parliament men, with few exceptions, that they are impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; and that if they were not, yet "miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries would be a diſgrace to any nation;" that we have no right to interfere in the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the religion of a foreign country.' They would certainly deſtroy the Slave Trade in Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; and ſome well informed, reſpectable Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the India Company, are of opinion that they would "ſubvert the Britiſh Empire in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan," which, they think, of far greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence than the eſtabliſhment of thy deſpiſed kingdom. A few wretched Pariars might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be converted, or rather made hypocrites by Chriſtian charity; but there is nothing in Thee, or thy goſpel, to influence Chiefs of the noble Caſts (whoſe ſouls are certainly more valuable than thoſe of the vile Pariars as is a thouſand to one) to forſake the religion of their anceſtors. Good Lord, what is to be done where every thing thus makes againſt us? O deſiſt from thy purpoſe! Thou art the Savior of all men, and God is a merciful Father to them all; if it pleaſe thee, thou can'ſt ſave the Heathens without the goſpel; and, if not, <hi>thy will be done.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Lord, if thou wilt force us to cultivate this unpromiſing field, do not think of ſending miſſionaries out immediately, but let lay ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters go to receive the firſt ſire, and teach the the little children reading and writing; and then will we go, and enter into their labors: for the experience of ages has taught us, that where the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032281_0134_0FF1B33213C756D8"/>preaching of the goſpel makes one Chriſtian, education makes ten. Hence inſtead of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt to the parents, and then eſtabliſhing ſchools, for the education of the children, as the Apoſtles did (who knew that the ſword of the ſpirit was of heavenly temper—an inſtrument into which the God of Glory had wrought all his attributes, we, having loſt the art of uſing it, and that vigorous arm which gives it the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit and of power) we go to work another way, by educating children firſt; and many are of opinion, that the beſt way of enlightening the Heathens is by putting the moon in the ſun's ſphere, and having children to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their parents, rather than parents to teach their children.—If Lord thou wilt ſeriouſly weigh all theſe things, we flatter ourſelves thou wilt be of our way of thinking.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wild, ludicrous, and even blaſphemous, as this ſoliloquy may be, I am perſuaded, it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſentiment, which is not the genuine effuſion of the human heart. I have traced ſome of them in my own heart, and I have detected others, in the language which has been frequently held to me on miſſions. I have only thrown them together, given them a tongue and utterance, and expoſed them without diſguiſe as they walk before God, who ſearches the heart. If miniſters and Chriſtians will not recognize what exiſts in their hearts, and lives in their lives, I have at leaſt done my duty in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it before them. If they ſee themſelves in the glaſs I hold up. I truſt, with God's bleſſing, it may produce ſalutary effects, call them into action, and enable them to ſtop the mouth of malevolent reproach; that it may no longer be ſaid the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſt are, as they have been, for centuries, with comparatively few exceptions, the moſt <hi>dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,</hi>

               <p>Ought not we to have compaſſion on our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, even as God hath compaſſion on us? Have we looked into the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, and is it thus we read it? Do we dwell in God, and God in us, and can we continue thus cold and obdurate, amidſt the everlaſting burnings of his love? Olet us prove our faith by our works, and ſhew men who miſtake our doctrine, that in preaching juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, we do not ſet aſide, but eſtabliſh the moral law! By the ſongs of angels, who proclaimed peace and love at our Redeemer's birth; by the ſolemn injunction of Him who ſaid, "Ye are my friends, if ye keep my commandments;" by the glorious Pentecoſt, when every language praiſed God; by the multitudes who have waſhed their robes in the blood of the Lamb; by the acts of the Apoſtles and the ſufferings of the martyrs; by the expiring pangs of Jeſus, and by thoſe ſins of of ours which bruiſed him, and put him to grief; by their remiſſion, if we have indeed taſted that the Lord is gracious; by the fearful end of that ſervant who buried his Lord's talent; by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and execrations which reſt upon the Chriſtian name; by the rivers of Heathen blood which Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have ſhed, and which call for expiation at our hands; "if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if any bowels and mercies," I beſeech you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored and beloved Brethren, have mercy on the Heathens, and ſo fulfil the joy of your Lord.</p>
               <p>And now, Brethren, I throw myſelf at your feet; and aſk pardon for every raſh and wounding expreſſion which may have fallen from my pen. Conſcious inferiority bows me down, and nothing but a ſenſe of duty and the love of truth could have erected my mind to write with the freedom I
