            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

'Tis true I raised her from the humble cottage, to make her the companion of my life; but in her veins flows as noble blood, as if her ancestors had been a race of heroes. —Never has one thought, unworthy of her present rank, reminded me of what she was. How often, when I have been summoned to the field, has she, with her own hands buckled on my harness, and with a chearful mien gone with me to the castle gate! But yesterday, unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble presages seemed to labour in her breast. Her parting kiss was bathed in tears, and with a voice of heart-felt

her the reason of her grief. "I am an orphan," answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed she,
"ere I could lisp, I lost my mother; and but a few days since, the Vandals robbed me of my father."
Her words, her tears, sunk deep into my heart. I went —and I returned. I saw her oft, yet never saw her enough.—My uncle had fixed upon a lady of high birth to be my wife—but all in vain! Already was I bound in the soft chains of love. I laughed at ancestry and riches. I led my Adelaide to the altar.—Thanks be to heaven, I never, for a moment, have repented such a choice!

You may perhaps mistake it for ostentation, since I have so many servants, and an industrious wife may be employed to better purpose, than in bringing water from the well. I will explain this, reverend abbot. To you my birth is not a secret. Eight years are on this day elapsed, since I went down with the same pitchers to yonder well. My tears were mingled with the water; for you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at that time the Vandals had just robbed me of my father, the only prop of my poor helpless youth. Sir Theobald saw me, loved me, and made me the happiest of women. Shall I not celebrate this day? Long as I live, these pitchers shall retain their place among my bridal ornaments. Never do I fail, upon this day, as soon as I have finished my morning prayer, to visit yonder well. My reason tells me that it is to recollect my former lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. My heart tells me that it is to call to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the first words, the first looks of my dear Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald.</p>

                  <p>Presages, noble lady! Have you ever felt their influence?</p>

                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>
                  <p>Presages, or thick blood, or nervous terror—call it what you will. With fearful heart I always have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the steed which was to bear my husband to the heat of battle. But never have I felt what yesterday oppress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. Methought a world was laid upon me!—Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought a gulf divided me from my beloved Theobold!—

                  <p>Be not so quick in your conclusions. Presages are the warnings of the Almighty. 'Tis true; your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band now returns in health. For this we render thanks to God and to St. Norbert. Yet is there nothing but life, for which you tremble? I know full well, fair lady, that strict fidelity lies nearer to the heart of one who loves like you. How if—(which heaven forefend, but our tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ever on the watch)—how if Satan, in an enticing moon-light night, should have availed himself of some fair heathen, to ensnare the pious knight. I have seen these fiery dames. Lust is their idol: Modesty can find no sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary with them; and Sir Theobold, as they say, inherited warm blood from old Sir Hugo.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037744_0023_100EFCE574DACEB8"/>
Doubtless you have rooted out the heathen tribes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned their altars, abolished their idols, and brought their gold and silver chalices for the service of the church.</p>

                  <p>Ha! There it is! There is Wulfingen!—Hail, castle of my fathers! Hail, ye moss grown towers! In blooming manhood I forsook you. In drooping age I now again behold you. I left these gates, accompanied by a hundred valiant warriors: the swords of the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens have slain them, and I return alone.
<stage>(<hi>Descends the hill, and, for a few moments, surveys the castle with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent emotion.</hi>)</stage>
All is as I left it. No stone is broken: no tree is fallen. I could almost fancy that the swallows' nests against the wall were still the same.—There, in the shade of yonder towering oak, I, for the last time, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to my heart my weeping wife, and blessed the child that hung upon my knee. There, beneath the roof of yonder straw-thatched cottage, I for the last time held the infant in my arms, the offspring of my crime, the source of my never-ceasing anguish. Alas! what a crowd of sensations, which have slept for three-and-twenty years, wake in this solemn moment! Great God of Heaven! I thank thee, that thy angel, thro' so many perils, has thus brought me to the habitation of my fathers, were it but to lay my sapless bones with their's.—How my heart beats! Even more than at the storm of Ptolemais. Each tree, each stone could I ask, is my wife, and is my son alive?— The windows of the castle are forsaken: the bridge is down: No reaper in the field. Here peace must reign, or the plague must have exhausted its fury.—Thou guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian angel of my latter days! whisper to me whether joy awaits me in this castle: or, shall I turn again to Pales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and seek some heap of earth, where the poor pilgrim may repose in peace for ever?</p>

                  <p>Each day of absence, when friends meet again, is a fresh drop in the cup of joy. Be thankful to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, old man, for such bliss as yours is dealt with a spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand. My husband, also, had a father, who, more than twenty years ago, followed our emperor to the holy land. There probably he perished. Have you, in your travels, never heard the name of Sir Hugo of Wulfingen?</p>

                  <p>I mean, that if domestic virtues flourish but in one generation, I can have no pretentions to them.— My ancestors possessed no castles: Their names were

                  <p>Fear it not, noble lady. As far as I can answer for him, he is incapable of such injustice. At first it may have some effect, and bring a frown upon his forehead;— for you know not how difficult it is to shake off the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of our childhood—Proud, and assured of having trod them under foot, still at every turn they rise again. Yet sure I am, Sir Hugo's forehead will be clouded for one moment only. And when he sees and hears, that you, by stedfast love deserve your husband's heart, that you fulfil with diligent attention, the duties of a mother, he will not deny his blessing on the union.</p>

                  <p>For more than twenty years, Hugo of Wulfingen has been my friend. I have fought at his side in Parthia, Media, Mesipotamia, and Persia. Oft, with fraternal love, we bound each other's wounds, inflicted by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of our enemies. Oft, with fraternal love, we shared the last dry crust, the last poor draught: until the wayward chance of war divided us. For when the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Frederick died, he went towards Askelon with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Richard, surnamed Coeur de Lion. There was the battle between Saladin and us. Fierce and bloody was the contest. Many a valiant knight was left upon the field. Among the rest your father was supposed to have fallen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I spent many tedious years in vain enquiries after him. At length, weary with toil, I, eight months since resolved on my return to this my native land, when unexpectedly, I found old Hugo among the sultan's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners in Babylon.</p>

                  <p>Thus it is Sir knight. He pines away in grievous thraldom. How was his visage altered! Scarce could I recollect the features of my friend. His cheeks were sallow—his eyes sunk—his beard long and knotted. With tears he threw his arms and chains around my neck, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that he saw no end to his miserable days. He showed me his bed: It was a stone—a potsherd filled with water was his drink—a little rice was all his meagre diet.</p>

But how my body is exhausted by the noontide heat, and labor, to which I am not enured; how the blood gushes from my back upon my keeper's whip: how the cold dews, and the unwholesome damps of night within this prison, rob me of sleep, of health and peace— this, friend, thou dost not see."</p>

                  <p>A sigh! I understood thee. She is dead—Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soul is gone, to denounce vengeance against me, at the throne of God.</p>

                  <p>What say'st thou? Is she dishonoured?</p>

                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir knight, prepare yourself for a recital—To you the world is not unknown—You are well aware what chance—fate—Oh God! my tongue denies its office —Your hair will bristle towards heaven, your blood congeal with horror in your veins.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>To whom dost thou say this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have lived full six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. For five-and-thirty I have been a knight.— Since I forsook the cradle, I have been the sport of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, have learnt to distinguish truth from error—If she be not dishonoured, speak! I am prepared for all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>For fifteen years your daughter was educated as my own. She increased in stature, beauty, worth. She enchanted every youth, attended on my age, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on my wife's decease, my little household. Never did any one suspect her to be other than the real daughter of old Bertram. My wife died, and carried the secret with her to the grave. I alone was able to solve the mystery of her descent. I knew your sentiments, Sir knight; I resolved never to withdraw the veil which covered what was past; and as she now had reached a proper age, I
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037744_0034_100EFCFB54CE5AE0"/>
cast my eyes around, in search of some good lad, who would promote her happiness.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Right, old man! such was my wish.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>The inscrutable designs of Providence have will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it otherwise—Once, on a festival in honour of our guardian saint, the villagers proceeded early to the abbey leaving behind them only the old men. To my daughter too, I granted permission to accompany her friends, as I myself was unable to attend her. The neighboring Van<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dals had waited for this moment, when all our strength was absent. They fell upon our village, where not more than fifty persons were left, plundered our dwellings, drove away our cattle, and took the old men prisoners who had staid behind—among the rest myself. Eight years past away. I was a slave among the heathens—my daughter dead to me, and I to her. But this morning— (Oh! why have I survived it?)—but this fatal morning I was released from bondage by your son. I came, and found your daughter—in the arms of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor one, nor the other. I still am waiting for the dreadful story which will cause my hair to bristle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Blessed Virgin! is not this dreadful enough?— Your son the husband of your daughter—your grandsons sprung from incest—your family subjected to the churches ban!—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Is Adelaide faithless? Is my son a robber? Are my grandsons villains?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh no, no! There lies all the misery. They love each other with such strong affection, and yet must part forever. They have children too, who resemble angels,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037744_0035_100EFCFCDB547D90"/>
and these little innocents they must resign to scorn and infamy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Must!—And who shall force them?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Heavens! Can you ask, sir knight? Are you a christian, and would suffer this abomination?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not? Old man, thy scruples I can pardon. Papal superstition has instilled them, ignorance of the world has nursed them, and custom given them gigantic strength—But let us view a little closer the shadow which so much startles thee. What mischief can ensue from this connexion? Two hearts, attached by a double tie, what increase can their love, their happiness admit? A mother by a brother, are not the children still more precious?—Are not the parents still more envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>All true, sir knight. But—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Hold: The picture is not half complete. I have but painted them within the castle: let us now look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out—Can a good father and a tender husband be a bad neighbour?—Can he covet his neighbour's property, who, with <hi>this</hi> wife, and <hi>these</hi> children, thinks himself far richer than a prince?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Just and true, sir knight. But the sin—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Sin! Whom does it affect? Not <hi>me.</hi> Perhaps <hi>thee.</hi> Be easy, old man. This phantom too, I dare be sworn, I can dissolve. Yet, there are higher duties, thou wilt say, than I have mentioned.—Duties towards God—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Alas! There it rests—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Hold again!—Will he pray less fervently? and mark! his prayer is not the urgent and insatiable covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of riches and of honours. 'Tis gratitude which streams from a contented heart. Will he fight less bravely for his country and the church, than the vagabond whose cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is not fired by any thought on wife and child? Will he, with less piety receive the holy sacrament, when he beholds the companion of his life devoutly kneeling by his side? Will the pangs of conscience, in his last hour, assail him, because true to the impulse of nature, he has given to his native land two useful citizens, to the world two honest men, to heaven two angels?—No! no! no!— With joyful assurance will he appear, accompanied with
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037744_0036_100EFCFE61113D90"/>
his wife and children, before the throne of the Almighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receive his sentence without trembling, and join his voice to the halelujah's of the blessed—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>But God's absolute commandment that we should not—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>I know what thou would'st say. God's first commandment was the happiness of us his creatures.— This commandment is as old as the creation. It extends to every nation, every religion. What Moses, through the mouth of God, established for the welfare of a single state, what, perhaps, may really promote the welfare of every state, must, at least, be subject to exceptions, and never was a case more worthy of exception—Here, then, old man, give me thy hand with confidence, and let this secret be concealed forever. Still let Adelaide be Bertram's daughter.—Rejoice with me, at the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our children—Rejoice, and be silent.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>As God may have mercy on me in my dying hour, I cannot, sir knight, I cannot. That inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness of an avenging God rises in opposition to your arguments. You have addressed my senses—they are weak—address my heart, and I will listen to you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>Thy heart!—Shall I paint the misery which thou bring'st upon us all? Shall I describe the horrible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressess of my children, and my grand-children—the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of thy old master?—Shall I—(unwillingly I do it) shall I remind thee of the many kindnesses which I pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed first on thy old parents, and since on thee?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <stage>(falling and embracing his knees)</stage>
Oh, no, dear sir! To you I am obliged for all. 'Tis written in my heart. But pay more reverence to God than man— Sacrifice the temporal rather that risk the eternal. Oh! could you feel the pangs of hell, which rage within me, you would have compassion on me. Oh! that I could erase the tale of horror from my recollection! At least, let me shake the burden from my heart at the confession chair. Our reverend abbot—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <stage>(with grim ferocity)</stage>
Peace! Listen to me for the last time. If the misery of my children, the distresses of their boys, the despair of thy benefactor, can have no effect upon thee—hear this solemn oath, which, on the word and honour of a knight, I pledge in the ear of the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037744_0037_100EFD0057A5F868"/>
Almighty. If, with a single look, a syllable, or sign, thou darest to hint at this our secret, with my own hand I'll plunge my sword into thy heart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                  <p>Do with your servant as may be your will.— My last breath shall bless you. But my troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science orders me, in terms more dreadful than your oath, to ensure the salvation of my soul. As yet your children may do penance for their sin, and through temporal mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ascend to spiritual bliss. But tell me—what can I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when your son appears before the dread tribunal of the Judge, and thus accuses me: "This man was privy to it.

Then—perhaps—I might—</p>

                  <speaker>Hu.</speaker>

                  <p>Such are the cursed fruits of superstition! But what must I expect in this approaching hour? Theobald must be tried, ere I venture the discovery. Should he be so weak as to prefer the dogmas of a monk to the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law of nature—should his head and heart too be sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by bigotry, let my tongue be silent, and let Bertram die. 'Tis better that one, already on the brink of the grave, should be a victim to his blindness, than that my whole race should fall a sacrifice to prejudice, and sink forever.</p>

                  <p>My son, more than three hundred years are passed away, since Hans of Wulfingen built this castle. He was the first of all our race, whose own valour girded on his loins the sword of knighthood. Our emperor, Conrad the first, dubbed him in the year nine hundred and twelve, upon the very field, where he had shed his blood, in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his native country against Hungary. He married Wulſhild of Sickingen, and from love towards her, he called this castle Wulfingen. He was slain in a quarrel for an image of Saint Paul, which his attendants had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly suffered to be stolen. This, his son,
<stage>(pointing to the second picture)</stage>
Egbert of Wulfingen, was accused of having murdered one Count Baldwin. The sacred tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal before which he was tried, obliged him to attest his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037744_0040_100EFD074AB5E5C8"/>
by the sword, He was slain, but his last breath affirmed the accusation to be false and villainous.
<stage>(<hi>Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the third picture</hi>)</stage>
his son, Maximilian of Wulfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen asserted, at some jovial banquet, that the image of the Virgin Mary, which worked miracles at Emmerick, was a pious fraud. He was in consequence, secretly assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the instigation of the monks— <stage>(pointing to the fourth picture)</stage>
His son Henry of Wulfingen, not profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the example of his father, dared to utter some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning words against the pope's authority, was subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ban, and forsaken by his friends, died broken-hearted.
<stage>(<hi>pointing to the fifth picture</hi>)</stage>
His son Albert of Wulfingen, fearful and weak from the example of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the education of a monk, gave half his fortune to the cloisters, endowed the church with many of his best demesnes, died with a relique in his hand, and was almost cannonized— <stage>(<hi>pointing to the sixth picture</hi>)</stage>
His son Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Wulfingen, went on an excursion to convert the heathens to our christian faith. His heart betrayed him. He became attached to a fair heathen, and was compelled to leave her, because she continued faithful to the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of her forefathers. He married Maria of Simmern, who bore one son, but ill supplied to him the place of the good heathen. He arrived at a discontented old age, and died.
<stage>(<hi>pointing to the seventh picture</hi>)</stage>
My grandfather, Otto, of Wulfingen, from some long smothered resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was assaulted by three villains of the house of Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engen, as he was returning, somewhat weary, from the chace. They slew him, and took refuge in a Benedictine cloister, where, for a sum of money, they were pardoned in the name of God, and not a mortal dared to bring an accusation.
<stage>(<hi>pointing to the eighth picture</hi>)</stage>
My father, Francis, of Wulfingen, wishing to revenge his father's death, and enraged in a just cause, struck a lay brother of the Benedictines, was subjected to the ban, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and died in misery. Well can I recollect the grief of my poor mother! But of that no more. I myself, my son, I myself have completed this number of unhappy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whom superstition has plunged into destruction.— I am not ashamed to tell thee, that for one moment, I have been a villain—and what man is without such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? One only wicked deed has been to me the source
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037744_0041_100EFD08CFB46A90"/>
of endless agony. Thy mother was a good woman, though beauty was not her inheritance. She loved me while I was but her friend. It was not in my power to press her with ardour to my bosom. For her I seldom felt desire, and often avoided her embraces. Whether she were ever conscious of what passed within me, I am ignorant. She herself, (God reward her for it) she herself never uttered one harsh word to me, never received me with a frown, and <hi>forced</hi> from me, my whole respect. Bint this was all— My love— <stage>(stammers)</stage>
I must disclose it as a warning to my son—my love was oft bestowed on prostitutes, and every woman but my wife, inflamed my passions.— Once, on a parching summer's day, I met a lovely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the field. Her name was Rosamond. She was an orphan. She had nothing left in this wide world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her honour—and of that I robb'd her—Thou start'st, thou shuddrest—Right, my son. Let this moment never be eras'd from thy remembrance—Heaven is my witness I had ever been an upright man—except in this one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Dost thou see the tear that starts into my eye? Of these I have shed millions, yet each still scalds my soul as if it were the first. The poor creature bore a girl in secret and expired. I entrusted the unhappy fruit of my transgression to an honest boor, whose wife had lately been delivered of a dead child. He swore eternal secresy, and reared the forsaken being as his own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—My peace of mind was gone. In motion, or on my pillow, the palid image of my Rosamond was floating in my sight. In motion or on my pillow, her dying groans assailed my ear. To regain tranquility I vowed an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the holy land against the Saracens, forsook my wife, my child, and country, to follow our emperor Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, the Red-beard, and in the name of God, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men, who never had offended me. Oft as I plunged my sword into the vitals of a Saracen, I fancied that his blood would cleanse me from my sin. In vain! I writh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myself, in anguish, on the holy tomb. In vain! I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed severe penance on myself, and went through many a weary pilgrimage. In vain! nor scourge nor absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could avail to cure the viperous sting of conscience —At length I was dangerously wounded in a skirmish,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037744_0042_100EFD0AF1148788"/>
and taken prisoner by the sultan of Babylon. There, for twenty years, I languished in the fetters of the infidels, till at last, with other knights, I was ransomed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Greeks. Weary of a delusive world, full of anxious wishes to behold my family and home, I took a pilgrim's staff, and am this day returned—I find my wife no more, and my daughter
<stage>(keenly rivetting his eye upon his son)</stage>—in the arms of her brother.</p>

                  <p>Heaven be praised! Thou hast fulfilled my every hope. Be at ease. I wished to prove thy sentiments.— Adelaide is thy sister, but therefore is not less thy wife. Were such a marriage in such circumstances sinful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, he would have planted natural abhorrence in the hearts of both. What is wholesome to society at large, is not always a law for a solitary instance. Be of good courage, then, my son, trust in God, love thy wife, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to make thy children honest, and deserve the blessing,

break this promise, may the eternal punishment annexed to perjury, fall upon me! may absolution never restore my peace of mind! may the torments of conscience fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, whithersoever despair may drive me! may it follow me to my death-bed, and torment me in my last moments! May I pray in vain, and when I pray for death, may it be to no purpose. May no sacrament, no priestly benedictions have power to discharge me from this oath! May the grave to which they once will carry me, also be the grave of my secresy, I swear it—so help me God. Amen.

It is done. Embrace me both. The feeling of rest, which these three-and-twenty years was strange to me, returns this day to my bosom: the serene view of a happy old age brightens again this day. I feel so happy, every thing around me appears in a more pleasing light. Come, my son! come to the arms of my double daughter!

weak old man! thy brains are distracted—Cool thy blood, thou seest ghosts. Throw a glance upon yonder pious couple, on yonder children of innocence, but one glance of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it needs no more—What fiend, if he had served in hell for thousands of ages, what fiend would venture to draw upon him the curse of those babes!—But am I not threatened by the damnation of the church! Will they not vomit me out of its bosom? Give me up a prey to the torments of conscience in my last hour? Conscience? have I only a conscience? Are not Hugo and his noble son partners in the deception? Does their example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to my ease?—Ah! tripple chains of love fetter those innocent hearts, the lustre of wordly things dazzles their eyes, eternity vanishes before their view—

Eight years have elapsed, and God has suffered this crime to pass unpunished, no lightening has struck this castle— no hail devastated Wulfingen's fields, the husband, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the wife, the sister—the offspring of incest—all are alive, wake every morning to new happiness—praise their maker with sincerity of mind, yet nothing has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them. God marked the brother as a murderer, why not the incestuous man?—Audacious being! dost thou venture to question God's forbearance? to dive into his secret counsels—Miserable wretch! art thou perhaps chosen to put a stop to those horrors? and yet darest to be silent?—look forward to your last hours, when thou wilt pray for consolation, when the priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thy confession, and before thou canst utter one word, an evil spirit strangles thee! When thou art panting for the holy sacrament, and receive it but to eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! When thou continuest in thy sins, and the devils carry thee before the Almighty's throne!—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way compassion!—Away, fear of man!—I must save my soul! I must save my soul! rocks are laying upon me! abysses open below me!

                  <p>That were wrong. Nor, does he require it. But where can I find opportunity to exercise them? since the last tournament, at Regensburg, I have not left our castle. Here no one ever visits us, except our stern old uncle, who prefers the pictures in this room, to all the conversation of a simple woman.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>
                  <p>Your visits, reverend abbot! Why, yes. Have I ever been uncivil to you? And even if I were, your office teaches you to bear with the failings of your flock.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cyr.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet not to hold my peace, but by good advice endeavour to amend them. Your conduct to me borders on disdain,
<stage>(<hi>with a look of tenderness</hi>)</stage>
and I have not deserved it from you.</p>

                  <speaker>Cyr.</speaker>
                  <p>Is of little value to the heart.</p>

                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>
                  <p>Have you a heart too? I thought it was your duty to renounce it, when you received the tonsure.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cyr.</speaker>
                  <p>My duty! Yes. Yet it will often rebel against my inclination. Ail these oaths and ceremonies are but a farce, to catch the multitude. The church is not so cruel to her children. To be an example to the world we must <hi>appear</hi> to be poor, chaste, and obedient. But to require, that, in private too, this oath should be inviolable, were to magnify the monk to an angel.</p>

                  <p>Noble lady, understand me right. I mean to say, the virtue of a mortal must be reckoned in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his strength. I myself can solemnly swear, that since I wore this sacred garb, I never have departed from my duty.

Let no true believer have compassion on their hunger and their thirst. Let fire and water be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them through the holy Roman empire! Let him be defiled who dares to touch them! Let this castle, the seat of rank abomination, be demolished, and not one stone left upon another! Let the armour of the knight be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at his feet! Let him and the partner of his infamy be chained together to a pile of wood, and vomit forth their sinful souls amidst the flames, to the glory of God's commandments! Then, head-strong being, when the fire shall have reached thy hair, and when the smoke already chokes thy utterance, then call in vain for succour and relief to the despised Cyrillus. With the smile of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied revenge, I'll listen to thee, and withdraw the glowing coals, to feast upon thy lengthened sufferings.

Begone, ye lures to sin!—I cannot command my heart. 'Tis the heart of a fond loving wife—a sister's love is foreign to it. —God has passed his heaviest denunciation upon incest. —Did not the abbot say this?—Did he not curse me and my children?—Did not the holy Virgin arm me by a miracle?—Was it not the finger of the Highest, which pointed to the sacrifice, ordained to be offered to him by my hands?—Oh temporal and eternal welfare of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the most sacred of a mother's cares, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if, in this hour my strength forsakes me?— Come nearer, my pretty ones.
