            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It would be unaccountable Stupidity in me, not to maintain the moſt Lively and Awful Senſe of Divine Rebukes, which the Holy GOD has ſeen meet in Spotleſs Sovereignty to diſpenſe to me, my Family and People, in delivering us into the hands of thoſe that Hated us: who Led us into a ſtrange Land; <hi>My Soul has Theſe ſtill in Remembrance, and is Humbled in me:</hi> However GOD has given us plentiful occaſion to Sing of Mercy as well as Judgment.

It is moſt Notorious that nothing was thought too Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult by you to Effect this Deſign; in that you readily ſent your own Son, Mr. <hi>William Dudley,</hi> to undergo the hazards &amp; hardſhips of a Tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Voyage, that this affair might be Tranſacted with Succeſs; which muſt not be forgotten, as an Expreſſion of your great Solicitude &amp; Zeal to recover us from the Tyranny &amp; Oppreſſion of our Captivity.</p>

                  <p>Not long after, the Holy, and Righteous God, brought us under great Trials, as to our Perſons and Families, which put us under a neceſſity, of ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Him in a Wilderneſs, the diſtreſſing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and calamities of our Relations; Yea, that call'd on us notwithſtanding ſeeming preſent frowns, to reſolve by His Grace not to be ſent away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bleſſing. <hi>Jacob</hi> in wreſtling has the hollow of his Thigh put out of joint; and it is ſaid to him, <hi>Let me go:</hi> yet he is rather animated, to an Heroical Chriſtian reſolution to continue earneſt, for the bleſſing, than diſcouraged from asking.</p>

My loſs, and the loſs of my Children was great, our hearts were ſo filled with Sorrow, that nothing but the comfortable hopes of her being taken away in Mercy, to her ſelf, from the evils we were to ſee, feel and ſuffer under; (and joyn'd to the Aſſembly of the <hi>Spirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> to reſt in Peace, and <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of glory;</hi> and the good pleaſure of God thus to exerciſe us,) could have kept us from ſinking under, at that time.

                  <p>We were again call'd upon to March, with a far heavier <hi>Burden on my Spirits,</hi> than on my <hi>Back,</hi> I beg'd of God, to Over-rule in His Providence, that the Corpſe of One ſo dear to me, and of one whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, He had taken to dwell with Him in Glory, might meet with a Chriſtian burial, and not be left for Meat, to the Fowls of the Air, and Beaſts of the Earth: A Mercy that God graciouſly vouchſafed to grant. For God put it into the hearts of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to come out as far as ſhe lay, to take up her Corpſe, recarry it to the Town, and decently to

bury it, ſoon after. In our March they killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Sucking Infant of one of my Neighbours; and before Night, a Girl of about Eleven years of Age. I was made to Mourn, at the Conſideration of my Flocks being ſo far a Flock of Slaughter, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being Slain in the Town, and ſo many Murdered in ſo few Miles from the Town; and from fears what we muſt yet expect, from ſuch who delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imbrued their hands in the blood of ſo many of His People. When we came to our lodging Place, an Indian Captain from the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> ſpake to my Maſter about killing of me, and taking off my Scalp. I lift up my heart to God, to implore His Grace, and Mercy in ſuch a time of need; and afterwards I told my Maſter, if he intended to kill me, I deſired he would let me know of it, aſſuring him that my Death after a promiſe of Quarter would bring the guilt of blood upon him. He told me he would not kill me: We laid down and Slept for God Suſtained and kept us. In the Morning we were all called before the chief <hi>Sachems</hi> of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua's,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> that a more equal diſtribution might be made of the Priſoners, among them: at my going from the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> my beſt Clothing was taken away from me. As I came nigh the Place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of the Captives met me, and told me, they thought the Enemies were going to burn ſome of us, for they had peeled off the bark from ſeveral Trees, and acted very ſtrangely. To whom I replyed, They could act nothing againſt us, but as they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of God, and I was perſwaded, He would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch Severities. When we came to the <hi>Wigwam</hi>

                  <p>In our fourth days March the Enemy killed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Neighbours, who being nigh the time of Travail, was wearied with her Journey. When we came to the great River, the Enemy took <hi>Slayes</hi> to draw their Wounded, ſeveral of our Children, and their Packs; and Marched a great pace. I Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled many hours in Water up to the ankles: near Night I was very Lame, having before my Travel wrong'd my anckle-bone and ſinews: I thought, ſo did others, that I ſhould not be able to hold out to Travel far. I lift up my Heart to God (my only refuge) to remove my Lameneſs, and carry me through with my Children and Neighbours, if He judg'd it beſt; however I deſired God would be with me in my great Change, if He call'd me by ſuch a Death to Glorify Him: and that He would take care of my Children, and Neighbours, and bleſs them; and within a little ſpace of time, I was well of my Lameneſs, to the joy of my Children, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that ſaw ſo great an alteration in my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling.</p>
                  <p>On the Saturday, the Journey was long and tedious; we travelled with ſuch ſpeed, that four Women were tired, and then Slain by them who led them Captive.</p>

Accordingly ſhe was killed that day. I mention it to the end, I may ſtir up all in their Young Days, to improve the Death of CHRIST by Faith, to a giving them an holy boldneſs in the day of Death.</p>
                  <p>The next day we were made to Scatter one from another into ſmaller Companies; and one of my Children carryed away with <hi>Indians,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts.

We tarryed there three days, till we had roſted and dryed the Meat. My Maſter made me a pair of <hi>Snow-ſhoes,</hi> for (ſaid he) <hi>You cannot poſſibly Travel without;</hi> the <hi>Snow</hi> being knee-deep. We parted from thence heavy laden; I Travelled with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on my back, with <hi>Snow-ſhoes Twenty-five</hi> Miles the firſt day of wearing them; and again the next day till afternoon; and then we came to the <hi>French River.</hi> My Maſter at this place took away my pack, and draw'd the whole load on the Ice: but my bones ſeemed to be miſplaced, and I unable to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with any ſpeed. My feet were very ſore, and each Night I wrung <hi>Blood</hi> out of my <hi>Stockings,</hi> when I pulled them off. My <hi>Shins</hi> alſo were very ſore, being cut with <hi>Cruſty Snow,</hi> in the time of my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling without <hi>Snow-ſhoes.</hi> But finding ſome dry <hi>Oak-leaves,</hi> by the River banks, I put them to my <hi>Shins,</hi> and in once applying of them, they were healed. And here my Maſter was very kind to me, would alwayes give me the beſt he had to Eat; and by the goodneſs of God, I never wanted a <hi>Meals Meat,</hi> during my Captivity; tho' ſome of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Neighbours, were greatly Wounded, (as I may ſay) with the Arrows of <hi>Famine,</hi> and <hi>Pinching want;</hi> having for many dayes nothing but <hi>Roots</hi> to live upon, and not much of them neither. My Maſter gave me a piece of a BIBLE; never diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me in Reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or in <hi>Praying</hi> to God.

                  <p>My March on the <hi>French River</hi> was very ſore, for fearing a <hi>Thaw,</hi> we Travelled a very great pace; my Feet were ſo bruiſed, and my joynts ſo diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by my Travelling in <hi>Snow-ſhoes,</hi> that I thought it unpoſſible to hold out. One Morning a little before break of day, my Maſter came &amp; awaken'd me out of my Sleep, Saying, <hi>Ariſe, Pray to God, and Eat your Breakfaſt, for we muſt go a great way to day.</hi> After Prayer, I aroſe from my knees, but my feet were ſo <hi>Tender, Swoln, Bruiſed,</hi> and full of <hi>Pain,</hi> that I could ſcarce ſtand upon them, without holding on the <hi>Wigwam.</hi> And when the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, <hi>You muſt run to day;</hi> I anſwered, I could not run: My Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pointing out to his Hatchet, ſaid to me, <hi>Then I muſt daſh out your Brains, and take off your Scalp.</hi> I ſaid I ſuppoſe then you will do ſo, for I am not able to Travel with ſpeed. He ſent me away alone, on the Ice. About Sun half an hour high, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took me, for I had gone very ſlowly, not thinking it poſſible to Travel Five Miles. When he came up he called me to <hi>Run;</hi> I told him I could go no faſter; he paſſed by without ſaying one Word more: So that ſometimes I ſcarce ſaw any thing of him for an hour together. I Travel'd from about break of day, till dark, never ſo much as ſet down at noon to Eat Warm Victuals; Eating frozen Meat, which I had in my Coat Pocket, as I Travel'd. We went

God Wonderfully ſupported me, and ſo far renewed my Strength, that in the afternoon I was Stronger to Travel than in the forenoon. My Strength was reſtored and renewed to admiration. We ſhould never diſtruſt the care and compaſſion of God, who can give <hi>Strength to them who have no might, and power to them who are ready to faint.</hi>

                  <p>When we entred on the Lake the Ice, was very rough, and uneven, which was very grievous to my feet, that could ſcarce endure to be ſet down on the Smooth Ice, on the River; I lift up my cry to God in Ejaculatory requeſts, <hi>That He would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my State, and ſome way or other relieve me.</hi> I had not Marched above half a Mile, before there fell a <hi>Moiſt Snow,</hi> about an inch and half deep, that made it very ſoft for my feet, to paſs over the Lake, to the place where my Maſters Family was.

We again began a March for <hi>Shamblee,</hi> we ſtay'd at a branch of the Lake, and feaſted Two or Three days on <hi>Geeſe</hi> we killed there.

This Village is about Fifteen Miles from <hi>Mont-Royal.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were very kind to me: A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Place, took me into his Houſe, and to his Table; and lodged me at Night on a good <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-bed.</hi> The Inhabitants, and Officers were very obliging to me, the little time I ſtay'd with them, and promiſed to Write a Letter to the Governour in Chief, to inform him of my paſſing down the River. Here I ſaw a Girl taken from our <hi>Town,</hi> and a young Man, who informed me, that the greateſt part of the <hi>Captives</hi> were come in, and that <hi>Two</hi> of my Children were at <hi>Mont-Royal;</hi> that many of the Captives had been in, <hi>Three Weeks</hi> before my arrival: Mercy in the midſt of Judgment!

My Maſter took hold of my hand to force me to <hi>Croſs my ſelf,</hi> but I ſtrugled with him, and would not ſuffer him to guide my hand, upon this he pulled off a <hi>Crucifix</hi> from his own neck, and bad me <hi>Kiſs</hi> it; but I refuſed once and again; he told me <hi>be would daſh out my brains with his Hatchet if I refuſed.</hi> I told him I ſhould ſooner chuſe death then to Sin againſt God; then he ran and catcht up his Hatchet, and acted as tho' he would have daſhed out my Brains; ſeeing I was not moved, he threw down his Hatchet, ſaying, <hi>he would firſt bite off all my nails if I ſtill refuſed;</hi> I gave him my hand and told him, I was ready to ſuffer, he ſet his teeth in my thumb nails and gave a gripe with his teeth, and then ſaid, <hi>no good Miniſter, no love God, as bad as the Devil;</hi> and ſo left off. I have reaſon to bleſs God who ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened me to withſtand; by this he was ſo diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged as never more to meddle with me about my Religion. I aſkt leave of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to Pray with thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> of our Town that were with me, but they abſolutely refuſed to give us any permiſſion to pray one with another, and did what they could to prevent our having any diſcourſe together.</p>

to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> deſiring them to order my being ſent up to him to <hi>Mont-Royal,</hi> upon which one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> went with my two Maſters, and took me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, as alſo two more of <hi>Deerfield,</hi> a man and his Daughter about <hi>Seven</hi> years of Age. When we came to the Lake, the Wind was tempeſtuous &amp; contrary to us, ſo that they were afraid to go over; they Landed and kindled a fire, &amp; ſaid they would wait a while to ſee whether the Wind would fall or change. I went a ſide from the Company among the Trees, and ſpread our caſe with the temptations of it before God, and pleaded that He would order the ſeaſon ſo, that we might not go back again, but be furthered on our Voyage, that I might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſee my Children and Neighbours, and converſe with them, and know their ſtate. When I returned, the Wind was more boiſterous, and then a ſecond time, and the Wind was more fierce; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon my ſelf for my unquietneſs, and the want of a reſigned will to the Will of God. And a third time went &amp; bewailed before God my anxious cares, and the tumultuous workings of my own heart, begg'd a Will fully reſigned to the Will of God, and thought that by the Grace of God I was brought to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to whatever God ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, Upon my return to the Company, the Wind was yet high; the Jeſuit and my Maſter ſaid, come we will go back again to the Fort, for there is no likelihood of proceeding in our Voyage, for very frequently ſuch a Wind continues three days, ſometimes fix; after it continued ſo many hours, I ſaid to them, <hi>the Will of the Lord be done;</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001340_0033_0FB283F30969DDC8"/>
and the Cannoe was put again into the River, and we embarqued. No ſooner had my Maſter put me into the Cannoe, and put off from the Shoar, but the Wind fell, and coming into the middle of the River, they ſaid, <hi>We may go over the Lake well enough:</hi> and ſo we did. I promiſed, if God gave me Opportunity I would ſtir up others to Glorify God in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſevering, committing their ſtraights of heart to Him; <hi>He is a Prayer bearing God, and the Stormy Winds obey Him.</hi> After we paſſed over the Lake, the <hi>French</hi> where ever we came were very compaſſionate to us.</p>
                  <p>When I came to <hi>Mont-Royal,</hi> which was Eight Weeks after my Captivity; the Governour <hi>de' Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel</hi> redeemed me out of the hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> gave me good Clothing, took me to his Table, gave me the uſe of a very good Chamber; and was in all reſpects relating to my outward man, courteous and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to admiration.

The Governour gave orders to certain Officers to get the reſt of my Children out of the hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and as many of my Neighbours as they could.

to ſpeak with, or ſee my Child, if I came that my labour would be loſt; and that the</hi> Macqua's <hi>would aſſoon part with their hearts, as my Child.</hi> At my return to the City, I with an heavy heart carryed the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Governour, who, when he read it, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry, and endeavoured to comfort me, aſſuring me, <hi>I ſhould ſee it, and ſpeak with it;</hi> and he would to his utmoſt endeavour its ranſom: Accordingly he ſent to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> who were in the City, and bid them improve their intereſt for the obtaining the Child. After ſome days, he went with me in his own Perſon to the Fort. When we came thither, he diſcourſed with the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> after which my Child was brought into the <hi>Chamber</hi> where I was. I was told I might ſpeak with her, but ſhould be permitted to ſpeak to no other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Perſon there. My Child was about Seven years old; I diſcourſed with her near an hour; ſhe could Read very well, and had not forgotten her <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> and was very deſirous to be redeemed out of the hands of the <hi>Macqua's,</hi> and bemoaned her State among them, telling me how they prophaned God's <hi>Sabbath's:</hi> and ſaid, <hi>She thought that a few days before they had been mocking the Devil, and that one of the Jeſuits ſtood and look'd on them.</hi> I told her, ſhe muſt <hi>Pray to God</hi> for His Grace every day; She ſaid, <hi>She did as ſhe was able, and God heipt her:</hi> but ſays ſhe, <hi>They force me to ſay ſome Prayers in</hi> Latin, <hi>but I dont underſtand one word of them, I hope it wont do me any harm.</hi> I told her, ſhe muſt be careful ſhe did not forget her <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſhe had learnt by heart.

me, almoſt every thing I ſpake to her; and ſaid, <hi>She was much afraid ſhe ſhould forget her Catechiſm,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none to inſtruct her. I ſaw her once a few days after in the City, but had not many Minutes of time with her, but what time I had, I improved to give her the beſt advice I could. The Governour la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much for her redemption, at laſt he had a promiſe of it, in caſe he would procure for them an <hi>Indian</hi> Girl in her ſtead. Accordingly he ſent up the River ſome hundreds of Leagues for one, but it was refuſed, when offered by the Governour: he offered them an hundred pieces of Eight for her Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it was refuſed. His Lady went over to have beg'd her from them, but all in vain; its there ſtill; and has forgotten to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Oh! that all who peruſe this Hiſtory would joyn in their ſervent requeſts to God, <hi>with whom all things are poſſible,</hi> that this poor Child, and ſo many others of our Children who have been <hi>caſt upon God from the Womb,</hi> and are now <hi>Out-caſt ready to periſh,</hi> might be gathered from their diſperſions, and receive <hi>Sanctifying Grace</hi> from God! When I had diſcourſed with the Child, and was coming out of the Fort, one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> went out of the Chamber with me, and ſome Souldiers, to convey me to the <hi>Cannoe.</hi> I ſaw ſome of my poor Neighbours, who ſtood with longing expectations to ſee me, and ſpeak with me, and had leave from their Salvage Maſters ſo to do. I was by the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thruſt along by force, and permitted only to tell them ſome of their Relations (they askt after) were well in the City, and that with a very audible voice; being not permitted to come near to them. After

my return to the City I was very Melancholly, for I could not be permitted ſo much as to <hi>Pray</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who dwelt in the ſame houſe. And the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> who came to ſee me, were moſt of them put back by the Guard at the door, and not ſuffered to come &amp; ſpeak with me. Sometimes the Guard was ſo ſtrict that I could ſcarce go aſide on neceſſary occaſions without a repulſe; and whenever I went out into the City (a favour the Governour himſelf never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed when I ask it of him) there were ſpies to watch me, and to obſerve whether I ſpake to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Upon which I told ſome of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they muſt be careful to call to mind &amp; improve former Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and endeavour to ſtand at a further diſtance for a while, hoping that after a ſhort time I ſhould have more liberty of converſing with them. But ſome ſpies ſent out, found on a <hi>Sabbath Day</hi> more then <hi>Three</hi> (the number we by their order publiſhed were not to exceed together) of us in Company, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Prieſt; the next day one of the Prieſts told me, I had a greater number of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with me, and that I had ſpoken ſomething reflecting on their <hi>Religion.</hi> I ſpake to the Governour that no forcible means might be uſed with any of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives reſpecting their Religion; he told me, <hi>He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no ſuch thing.</hi> I am perſwaded that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour if he might act as himſelf, would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch things to be done as have been done, and that he never did know of ſeveral things acted againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

Prieſts ſaid to me, <hi>Dont flatter your ſelves in hopes of a ſhort Captivity; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>There are two young Princes contending for the Kingdom of</hi> Spain; <hi>and a Third, that care was to be taken for his Eſtabliſhment, on the Engliſh Throne.</hi> And boaſted what they would do to <hi>Europe;</hi> and that we muſt expect not only <hi>Europe,</hi> but in <hi>New-England</hi> the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Popery.</hi> I ſaid, Glory not, God can make great changes in a little time, and revive His own Intereſt, and yet Save His poor afflicted People.

But after a few days a young Gentleman came to my Chamber, and told me, that one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> (after we had done Dinner) made a few Diſticks of Verſes &amp; gave them to his Scholars
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001340_0041_0FB28405EDFBBA80"/>
to Tranſlate into <hi>French:</hi> he ſhew'd them to me. The import of them was, 
  <q>That the King of <hi>France</hi> his Grand-Son had ſent out his Huntſmen, &amp; that they had taken a <hi>Wolf,</hi> who was ſhut up, and now he hopes the Sheep would be in ſafety.</q>
I knew at the reading of them what he aimed at, but held my Peace, as tho' I had been ignorant of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Obſerving this reproaching Spirit, I ſaid in my Heart, <hi>If God will bleſs, let men curſe if they pleaſe;</hi> and I look'd to God in CHRIST the Great Shepherd to keep his ſcattered Sheep among ſo many <hi>Romiſh Revenous Wolves,</hi> and to remember the reproaches where with his Holy Name, Ordinances, and Servants were daily reproached.

For</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>We hear you had dayes of Faſting and Prayer before the Fleet came to</hi> Quebeck; <hi>God would not regard your Prayers, but heard ows, &amp; almoſt in a miraculous way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us when aſſaulted, and refuſed to hear your</hi> Faſt-day-Prayers <hi>for your Preſervation, but heard ours for your Deſolation, and our Succeſs.</hi> They boaſted alſo of their <hi>King,</hi> and his greatneſs, and ſpake of him as tho' there could be no Settlement of the World, but as he pleaſed; reviling us as in a low &amp; languiſhing caſe, having no King, but being under the Government of a <hi> Queen:</hi> And ſpake as tho' the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> would in a ſhort time be Emperour. From this day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God gave them to hear ſorrowful Tidings from <hi>Europe:</hi> That a War was commenced againſt the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſo their Enemies increaſed. Their <hi>Biſhop</hi> taken, &amp; <hi>Two Millions</hi> of Wealth with him. News every year more diſtreſſing and impoveriſhing of them; and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſo far from being <hi>Emperour,</hi> that he is diſpoſſeſs'd of his <hi>Dukedom;</hi> &amp; <hi>France</hi> ſo far from being ſtrengthned by <hi>Spain</hi> that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Spain</hi> like to be an occaſion of the Weakning and Impoveriſhing their own Kingdom: they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo reporting.

againſt <hi>New-England</hi> turn'd back aſhamed; and they diſcouraged and diſhearten'd, and every year very exerciſing fears &amp; cares, as to the <hi>Salvages</hi> who live up the River. Before the return of that Army, they told me, We were led up &amp; down and Sold by the Heathen, as Sheep for the Slanghter, and they could not deviſe what they ſhould do with us, we ſhould be ſo many Priſoners, when the Army returned. The <hi>Jeſuit</hi> told me, It was a great Mercy that ſo many of our Children were brought to them, and that now eſpecially ſince they were not like ſpeedily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, there was hope of their being brought over to the <hi>Romiſh Faith.</hi> They would take the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Children born among them, and againſt the conſent of their Parents <hi>Baptize</hi> them.

                     <hi>Jeſuits</hi> coming out of the Houſe, and he came in after dinner; and preſently it was propounded to me, if I would ſtay among them and be of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I ſhould have a great and honourable Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>King</hi> every year. The Superior of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> turned to me, and ſaid, 
  <q>Sir, you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted much grief and ſorrow for your ſeparation from ſo many of your Neighbours and Children; if you will now comply with this offer and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, you may have all your Children with you; and here will be enough for an honourable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance for you and them.</q>
I anſwered, <hi>Sir,</hi> If I thought your Religion to be true, I would imbrace it freely without any ſuch offer, but ſo long as I believe it to be what it is, the offer of the whole World is of no more value to me than a <hi>Blackberry;</hi> and manifeſted ſuch an abhorrence of this propoſal, that I ſpeedily went to take my leave and be gone. Oh! <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſet down, why in ſuch a hurry, you are alone in your Chamber, divert your ſelf a little longer,</hi> and fell to other diſcourſe, and within half an hour ſays again: Sir, I have one thing earneſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of you, I pray pleaſure me! I ſaid, let your Lordſhip ſpeak; (ſaid he,) I pray come down to the Palace to morrow morning, and honour me with your Company in my <hi>Coach</hi> to the great Church, it being then a <hi>Saints</hi> day. I anſwered ask me any thing wherein I can ſerve you with a good Conſcience, and I am ready to gratifie you, but I muſt yet ask your excuſe here; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went away from him.

me, and alſo made an enquiry with my ſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had by any action given encouragement for ſuch a temptation. Not many days after, and a few days before Governour <hi>de' Vaudrel</hi> coming down, I was ſent away Fifteen Miles down the River, that I might not have opportunity of converſe with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I was courteouſly treated by the <hi>French,</hi> and the Prieſt of that Pariſh; they told me he was one of the moſt Learned men in the Country; he was a very ingenious man, zealous in their way, but yet very familiar. I had many diſputes with the Prieſts who came thither, &amp; when I uſed their own Authors to confute ſome of their Poſitions; my Books borrowed of them were taken away from me, for they ſaid, <hi>I made an ill uſe of them.</hi> They having many of them boaſted of their Unity in Doctrine and Profeſſion, were loth I ſhould ſhow them from their own beſt approved Authors, as many different Opinions, as they could charge againſt us. Here again, a Gentleman in the preſence of the Old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and a Prieſt, offered me his Houſe, and whole Living, with aſſurance of <hi>Honour, Wealth</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi> if I would imbrace their ways. I told them, I had an indignation of Soul againſt ſuch offers on ſuch terms, as parting with what was more valuable than all the World; alleadging, <hi>What is a man profited if he gain the whole World, &amp; loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times told, I might have all my Children if I would comply, and muſt never expect to have them on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other terms; I told them, my Children were dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to me than all the world, but I would not deny

                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Truths</hi> for the having of them with me; <hi>I would ſtill put my truſt in God who could perform all things for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am perſwaded that the Prieſt of that Pariſh where I kept, abhorred their ſending down the Heathen to commit Outrages againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>it was more like committing Murders, than managing a War.</hi> In my Confinement in this Pariſh, I had my undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed opportunities to be humbly imploring Grace for our ſelves, for Soul and Body, for His protecting preſence with <hi>New-England,</hi> and His diſappointing the bloody deſigns of Enemies; that God would be a little Sanctuary to us in a Land of Captivity, and that our Friends in <hi>New-England,</hi> might have Grace to make a more thankful and fruitful improvement of means of Grace than we had done; who by our neglects find our ſelves out of Gods Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>On the Twenty-firſt of <hi>October,</hi> 1704. I received ſome Letters from <hi>New-England,</hi> with an account that many of our Neighbours eſcaped out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in the Fort, and that my <hi>Dear Wife</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried and decently <hi>Buried.</hi> And that my Eldeſt Son who was abſent in our deſolation, was ſent to <hi>Colledge</hi> and provided for; which occaſioned Thanksgiving to God in the midſt of Afflictions, and cauſed <hi>Prayers</hi> even in <hi>Canada,</hi> to be going daily up to Heaven for a Bleſſing upon <hi>Benefactors,</hi> ſhowing ſuch kindneſs to the deſolate and afflicted.

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001340_0047_0FB28414A8BE2148"/>
would tell me my Children, ſometimes my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were turned to be of their Religion. Some made it their work to allure poor Souls by flatteries and great promiſes, ſome threatned, ſome offered abuſive carriages to ſuch as refuſed to go to Church and be preſent at Maſs; for ſome they induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived to get them Married among them. A Prieſt drew up a <hi>Compendium</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Catholick Faith,</hi> and pretended to prove it by the Scriptures, telling the <hi>Engliſh, that all they required was contained in the Scriptures, which they acknowledged to be the Rule of Faith and Manners;</hi> but it was by Scriptures hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly perverted and abuſed. I could never come to the ſight of it, (tho' I often earneſtly entreated a Copy of it) until I was a Shipboard for our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for <hi>New-England;</hi> but hearing of it, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to poſſeſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with their danger of being cheated with ſuch a pretence. I underſtood they would tell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that I was turn'd, that they might gain them to change their Religion; theſe their endeavours to ſeduce to <hi>Popery</hi> were very exerciſing to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in my Solitarineſs I drew up theſe following Sorrowful, Mournful, Conſiderations, tho' unus'd to, &amp; unskilful in <hi>Poetry,</hi> yet in a plain ſtile for the uſe of ſome of the Captives, who would ſometimes make their ſecret Viſits to me, which at the deſire of ſome of them, are here made publick.</p>

                  <p>THE Hearts of ſome were ready to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged &amp; ſink, ſaying, <hi>They were out of ſight, and ſo out of mind.</hi> I endeavoured to perſwade them, we were not forgotten, that undoubtedly many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were continually going up to Heaven for us. Not long after came Capt. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with Letters from His <hi>Excellency</hi> our GOVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR, to the Governour of <hi>Canada,</hi> about the Exchange of Priſoners; which gave a revival to many, and raiſed expectations of a return. Theſe viſits from <hi>New-England</hi> to <hi>Canada</hi> ſo often, greatly ſtrengthened many who were ready to faint; and gave ſome check to the deſigns of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to gain Proſelytes. But Gods time of deliverance was not yet come, as to ſome particular Perſons, their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations &amp; Tryals were increaſed; and ſome abuſed becauſe they refuſed a compliance with their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions. A young Woman of our Town met with a new Trial. For on a day, a <hi>French</hi> man came into the room where ſhe was, and ſhewed her his <hi>Beads,</hi> &amp; boaſted of them, putting them near to her; She knock'd them out of his hands on the floor; for which ſhe was beaten, and threatned with Death, and for ſome dayes impriſoned. I pleaded with God His over-ruling this firſt Eſſay for the deliverance of ſome, as a pledge of the reſt being delivered in due time. I improved Capt. <hi>de Beauville</hi> who had
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001340_0050_0FB2841D32703B40"/>
alwayes been very friendly, to interceed with the Governour for the return of my Eldeſt Daughter; and for his purchaſing my Son <hi>Stephen,</hi> from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> at St. <hi>Francois</hi> Fort; and for liberty to go up and ſee my Children and Neighbours at <hi>Mont-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> Divine Providence appeared to a moderating my Affliction, in that <hi>Five</hi> Engliſh Perſons of our Town were permitted to return with Capt. <hi>Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> among whom went my Eldeſt Daughter. And my Son <hi>Stephen</hi> was redeemed and ſent to live with me: he was almoſt quite Naked, and very Poor; he had ſuffered much among the <hi>Indians.</hi> One of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> took upon him, to come to the <hi>Wigwam</hi> and Whip him, on ſome complaint that the <hi>Squaws</hi> had made, that he did not Work enough for them. As to my Petition for going up to <hi>Mont-Royal</hi> to ſee my Children, and Neighbours, it was denyed; as my former deſire of coming up to the City before Capt. <hi>Livingſtons</hi> coming was.

A frame of Spirit when wrought in me by the Grace of God, giving the greateſt content and ſatisfaction; and very often a fore-runner of the Mercy ask'd of God, or a plain demonſtration, that the not obtaining my

                  <p>As I was able, I ſpread the caſe before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching of him to diſappoint them of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to Proſelyte any of the Captives by this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem; and by the goodneſs of God it was not very Serviceable: for the Souldiers Converſation was ſuch, that ſeveral among the <hi>French</hi> themſelves judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed it to be a <hi>Forgery.</hi> And tho the Captain ſpoken of was the Governours Lady's Brother, I never more heard any concernment or care to get him out of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

at the <hi>Mendicant Fryars Church,</hi> on one of their <hi>Feaſt Days,</hi> in honour of a great <hi>Saint</hi> of <hi>their Order,</hi> and that at Five a Clock Maſs in the Morning, near Two hundred Perſons preſent.

                  <p>When I was in the City in <hi>September,</hi> I ſaw two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maids who had lived with the <hi>Indians</hi> a long time.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prieſts, after Mr. <hi>Dudley'</hi>s going from <hi>Canada,</hi> was ready to think their time was ſhort, for gaining <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proſelytes, and doubled their diligence and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001340_0054_0FB2842480816500"/>
wiles, to gain over Perſons to their Perſwaſion. I improved all opportunities I could, to Write to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that in that Way I might be Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them. But many or moſt of my Letters treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Religion were intercepted, and burnt. I had a Letter ſent down to me by order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, that I had a liberty of Writing to my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Friends, which ſhould be continued; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I Wrote about indifferent things, and ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them about the points in controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us: And if I were ſo hardy as to Write Letters otherwiſe, they ſhould endeavour to prevent their being delivered. Accordingly, I found many of them were burnt. But ſometimes notice would be given to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that there were Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written, but that they were burnt; ſo that their Writing was ſomewhat uſeful tho' never peruſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe they judged thoſe Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Popery.</hi> Many of our Letters Written from <hi>New-England,</hi> were never delivered, becauſe of ſome expreſſions about Religion in them. And as I ſaid before, after Mr. <hi>Dudley'</hi>s departure from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> endeavours were very vigorous to ſeduce. Some were flattered with large Promiſes, others were threatned, and beaten, becauſe they would not turn. And when two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women, who had alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Religion were ſick in the <hi>Hoſpital:</hi> they kept with them Night and Day, till they dyed; &amp; their friends kept from coming to viſit them: after their death they gave out, that they dyed in the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> and were received into their <hi>Communion.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Death Maſſes were ſaid for them; &amp; they
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001340_0055_0FB284290CD746F8"/>
buried in the <hi>Church-yard</hi> with all their Ceremonies. And after this, Letters ſent into all parts to inform the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that theſe two Women turn'd to their Religion, before their Death, and that it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to follow their Example, for they could not be more obſtinate than theſe Women were in their Health, againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, and yet on a <hi>Death bed</hi> imbraced it. They told the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who lived near, <hi>That our Religion was a dangerous Religion to dye in.</hi> But I ſhall hereafter relate the juſt grounds we have to think theſe things were falſehoods.</p>
                  <p>I was informed, there was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Girl bid to take and wear the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and <hi>Croſs her ſelf:</hi> She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; they threatned her, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and they took up her Clothes, and made as tho' they would correct her; but ſeeing her chuſing indeed to ſuffer rather than comply, they deſiſted and tyed the <hi>Croſs</hi> about her Neck. Some were taken &amp; ſhut up among their Religious, and all ſorts of mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſed to gain them.</p>
                  <p>I received a Letter from one of my Neighbours, wherein he thus bewails.
   <q>I obtained leave of my Maſter, to go to the <hi>Macqua</hi>-Fort to ſee my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that I had not ſeen for a long time: I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Letter from my Maſter; to ſhew that I had leave to come. When I came to the Fort, I heard one of my Children was in the Woods. I went to ſee a Boy I had there, who lived with one of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> I had juſt askt him of his Welfare; he ſaid his Maſter would come preſently; he durſt not ſtay
  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001340_0056_0FB2842A96FAB0C0"/>
  to ſpeak with me now, being in ſuch awe of his Maſter. On which I withdrew, and when his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came in, I went and askt leave of him to ſpeak with my Child, and ſhewed him my Letter. But he abſolutely refuſed to let me ſee or ſpeak with him; and ſaid, I had brought no Letter from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and would not permit me to ſtay in the Fort, tho' I had Travelled on foot near Fifty Miles for no other errand than to ſee and ſpeak with my Children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Perſon with another <hi>Engliſh</hi> man laſt Spring, obtained leave of the Governour General, to go to the ſame Fort on the ſame errand, &amp; carried Letters from the Governour to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that he might be permitted to ſpeak with his Children. The Letter was deliver'd to the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> who told him, his Son was not at home, but gone a Hunting. Whenas he was hid from them, as he heard after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo the poor man loſt his labour a ſecond time. Theſe men ſay, that when they returned to <hi>Mont-Royal,</hi> one <hi>Laland,</hi> who was appointed as a ſpy, always to obſerve the motions of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> told them, that one of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had come in before them, and had told the Governour that the Lad was gone out a Hunting. And that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man who accompanyed this poor man, went out into the Woods in hopes of finding the Lad; and ſaw him, but the Lad run away, and that he followed him &amp; call'd after him, but he would not ſtop; but holding but a Gun threatned to ſhoot him down, if he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and ſo he was diſcouraged, and turn'd back. And ſays <hi>Laland, You will never leave going to ſee your
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001340_0057_0FB2842D19AE7E50"/>
Children &amp; Neighbours, till ſome of you are kill'd.</hi> But the men told him, it was an abſolute lye, let who would report it; for they had neither ſeen the Lad, nor did they go into the Woods to ſearch after him. They judge this was told to the Governour, to prevent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the future going to ſee their Children and Neighbours. Some of ours ſay, they have been little better than abſolutely promiſed, to have their Children who are among the Salvages, in caſe they themſelves would imbrace <hi>Popery.</hi> And that the Prieſts had ſaid, <hi>They had rather the Children ſhould be among the</hi> Indians, <hi>as they did, than be brought out by the</hi> French, <hi>and ſo be in a readineſs to return for</hi> New-England.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Maid</hi> of our Town was put into a Religious houſe among the <hi>Nuns,</hi> for more than two years, and all ſort of means, by flatteries, threatnings, and abuſive carriages uſed to bring her to turn. They offered her Money, which when refuſed, eſpecially the latter part of the time, they threatned her very much; ſent for her before them, commanded her <hi>to Croſs her ſelf.</hi> She refuſed, they hit her a box on the Ear; bid her again, ſtill ſhe refuſed. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a rod with Six branches full of knots to be brought; and when ſhe refuſed, they ſtruke her on the hands, with their renewing their Commands; and ſhe ſtood to her refuſals, till her hands were fill'd with Whales, with the blows. But one ſaid, Beat her no more, we will give her to the <hi>Indians,</hi> if ſhe wont turn. They pinch'd her Arms till they were black &amp; blue; and made her go into their Church, and becauſe ſhe would not <hi>Croſs her ſelf,</hi> ſtruke her
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001340_0058_0FB2842E53484398"/>
ſeveral blows with their hands on her face. A <hi>Squaw</hi> was brought in and ſaid, <hi>She was ſent to fetch her to the Indians:</hi> but ſhe refuſed; the <hi>

This poor Girl had many Prayers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven for her daily, and by name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Trials were more known to ſome of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than the Trials of others, who lived more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from them.</p>

But when he ſaw flattering Promiſes of rewards, and threatnings were ineffectual, he ſtruke him with a ſtick he had in his hand; and when he ſaw that would not do, he made him get down on his Knees about an hour, and then came and bid him make the ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and that without any delay; he ſtill refuſed. Then he gave him a couple of Strokes, with a Whip he had in his hand; which Whip had three Branches and about twelve great knotsty'd in it.

He told me, he thought with himſelf that if he was in my caſe, he ſhould be willing to know the worſt, and therefore told me as he would have deſired to have known if in my place. I thank'd him, acknowledging it a favour to let me know of it: But the News was ready to Over-whelm me with Grief and Sorrow. <hi>I made my complaint to GOD, and Mourned before Him; Sorrow and Anguiſh took hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</hi> I ask'd of God to direct me what to do, and how to Write, and find out an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a Letter to him; and committed this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to his Providence. I now found a greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a Patient, Quiet, Humble, Reſignation to the Will of God than I ſhould otherwiſe have known, if not ſo tryed. Here I thought of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and Tryals; my Wife and Two Children kill'd, and many of my Neighbours; and my ſelf, ſo many of my Children and Friends in a Popiſh Captivity, ſeparated from our Children, not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to them to inſtruct them in the Way they ought to go; and cunning crafty Enemies, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all their ſubtilty to inſinuate into Young ones, ſuch Principles as would be pernicious.

they have of Educating their Children; and faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it!</hi> I Mourned when I thought with my ſelf that I had one Child with the <hi>Macqua's,</hi> a ſecond turn'd to <hi>Popery,</hi> and a little Child of Six years of Age, in danger from a Child to be inſtructed in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> and knew full well that all endeavours would be uſed to prevent my ſeeing or ſpeaking with them. But in the midſt of all theſe God gave me a ſecret hope, that He would magnify His Power and free Grace, and diſappoint all their crafty deſigns. <hi>When I look'd on the right hand and on the left, all refuge failed, and none ſhewed any care for my Soul.</hi> But God brought that Word to uphold me; <hi>Who is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can ask or think.</hi> As alſo that, <hi>Is any thing too hard for God?</hi> I Pray'd to God to direct me; and Wrote very ſhort the firſt time, and in general terms, fearing leaſt if I ſhould Write about things in controverſy, my Letters would not come to him.

Tho' the Saints ſee and know God in a Glorious manner, yet they have not an inſinite knowledge; and it does no wayes follow that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee God, they know all Prayers that are directed to them upon the Earth. And God has no where in His Word told us, that the Saints have ſuch a knowledge. Beſides, were it a thing poſſible for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001340_0070_0FB284548318DCA8"/>
them to have a knowledge of what Prayers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to them, it does not follow that they are to be Pray'd to, or have religious honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon them. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can neither give one Scripture Precept of Example for Praying to them; but God has provided a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who knows all our Petitions, and is Faithful and Merciful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and we have both Scripture Precept &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to look to Him as our Mediator and Advocate with the Father. Further it can't be proved that its conſiſtent with the Saints being creatures, as well as with their happineſs, to have a knowledge of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from all parts of the World at the ſame time, from many Millions together about things ſo vaſtly differing one from another: and then to preſent thoſe Supplications for all that look to them, its not Humility but Will Worſhip.

We don't ſay it is not lawful to make or have a Picture, but thoſe carved Images were not in the Temple to be adored, bowed down to, or worſhiped.

                        <p>The Roman Catholick Church can't be a true Church of Chriſt, in that it makes Laws directly contrary to the Laws and Commands of Chriſt.

Yea, his whole Body, muſt be now in Heaven and in a thouſand other places, and in the mouth of every Communicant at the ſame time, and that both as a broken and unbroken Sacrifice, and be ſubject to putrefaction.

It's ſaid, 1 Cor. 10. 4. <hi>And did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink; for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> Was Chriſt literally a Rock, think you? Yea, it's abſurd to believe, that a Prieſt uttering a few words over a Wafer not above an inch ſquare, can make it a God, or the Body of Chriſt entire as it was offered on the Croſs. A blaſphemy to pretend to a power of making God at their pleaſure; &amp; then eat him, &amp; give him to others to be eaten, or ſhut him up in their Altars: that they can utter the ſame words, and make a God or not make a God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their intention, and that the people are obliged to believe that it is God, and ſo adore it, when they never hear any word of conſecration, nor know the Prieſts intention.

                  <p>THis Prieſt Mr. <hi>Meriel,</hi> has brought many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him and bid him Write them over and ſend them, and ſo he has done for many others. By this as alſo by Mrs. <hi>Stilſons,</hi> ſaying, She does not think that either of theſe Women did change their Religion before their Death; ſhe affirms alſo, that oftentimes during their Sickneſs, whilſt they had the uſe of their reaſon, they proteſted againſt the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001340_0083_0FB28474004EC7F8"/>
Romiſh Religion and Faith. Its evident that theſe Women never dyed <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but that it was a wily Stratagem of the Prieſts to advance their Religion; for Letters were ſent immediately, after their death, to uſe this as a perſwaſive argument to gain others. But God in His Providence gave in farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their fallaciouſneſs in this matter.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt Summer, one <hi>Biggilow</hi> of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> a Captive at <hi>Mont-Royal,</hi> was very Sick in the <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> and in the judgment of all with a Sickneſs to Death. Then the Prieſts and others gave out, that he was turned to be of their Religion, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their communion: But contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was brought back from the gates of Death, and would comply with none of their rites: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that whilſt he had the uſe of his reaſon, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpake any thing in favour of their Religion. And that he never diſown'd the <hi>Proteſtant Faith,</hi> nor would he now. So that they were ſilenced and put to ſhame. There is no reaſon to think that theſe two Women were any more <hi>Papiſts</hi> than he; but they are Dead and cannot ſpeak. One of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſpoken of in the fore-mentioned Letter, told me, ſhe knew of no ſuch thing, and ſaid Mr. <hi>Meriel</hi> told her, that he never heard a more fervent and affectionate Prayer, than one which <hi>Eſther Jones</hi> made a little before her Death. I am verily perſwaded, that he calls that Prayer to God ſo full of affection and confeſſion, the confeſſion made by her of the Sins of her whole Life. Theſe two Women always in their health, and ſo in their Sickneſs, oppoſed all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principles, as all that knew them can teſtify,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001340_0084_0FB284761F8C4B40"/>
ſo long as they could be permitted to go and ſpeak with them. One of theſe Women was taken from the <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> and the other, namely <hi>Eſther Jones</hi> from <hi>Northampton.</hi>

                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1706. Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> came again to <hi>Canada,</hi> with Letters from His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency our GOVERNOUR, at which time I was a few days at <hi>Quebeck.</hi> And when I was there, One Night about Ten a Clock, there was an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> that made a report like a Cannon, and made the Houſes to tremble: It was heard and felt many Leagues, all along the Iſland of <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> and other places. When Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> came the ſecond time, the Adverſaries did what they could to retard the time of our return, to gain time to ſeduce our Young Ones to <hi>Popery.</hi> Such were ſent away who were judged ungainable, and moſt of the Younger ſort ſtill kept. Some ſtill flattered with Promiſes of reward; and great Eſſayes to get others Married among them. One debauched, and then in Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Hours of time Publiſhed, taken into their Communion &amp; Married; but the poor Soul has had time ſince to lament her Sin &amp; Folly, with a bitter cry; and aſks your Prayers, that God of His So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Grace would yet bring out of the horrible Pit, ſhe has thrown her ſelf into.

A man of a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a deſirable Converſation: in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his laſt Sickneſs he made me a Viſit (before he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

As he had ſeveral times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, living not above two Miles from me over the River, at the Iſland of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> about Six Weeks or Two Months. After his Death, the <hi>French</hi> told me, <hi>Zebediah</hi> was gone to Hell and Damned: For, ſaid they, He has appeared ſince his Death (to one <hi>Joſeph Egerly,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, who was taken the laſt War) in flaming fire, telling him, he was Damned for refuſing to imbrace the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when ſuch pains were uſed to bring him to the true Faith, and for being inſtrumental to draw him away from the <hi>Romiſh Communion,</hi> forſaking the Maſs; and was therefore now come to advertiſe him of his danger. I told them, <hi>I Judged it to be a Popiſh Lye:</hi> Saying, <hi>I bleſs God our Religion needs no lyes to uphold, maintain, and eſtabliſh it, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> theirs did.</hi> But they affirmed it to be true, telling me, how God approved of their Religion, and Witneſſed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly againſt ours. But I ſtill told them, I was perſwaded his Soul was in Heaven, and that theſe reports were only deviſed fables to ſeduce Souls.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001340_0086_0FB284787B4A3900"/>
For ſeveral Weeks they affirmed it, telling me, that all who came over the River from the Iſland affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it to be a truth. I beg'd of God to blaſt this Helliſh Deſign of theirs, ſo that in the iſſue it might be to render their Religion more abominable, and that they might not gain one Soul by ſuch a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem. After ſome weeks had paſſed in ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, there came one into my Landlords Houſe, affirming it to be a truth reported of <hi>Zebediah,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Joſeph Egerly</hi> had been over the River, &amp; told one of our Neighbours this Story. After a few hours I ſaw that Neighbour, and aſkt him whether he had ſeen <hi>Egerly</hi> lately; he ſaid yes, What News told he to you? None ſaid he. Then I told him what was affirmed as a truth; he anſwered, <hi>Egerly</hi> ſaid nothing like this to him, and he was perſwaded he would have told him, if there had been any truth in it. About a week after this, came one <hi>John Boult</hi> from the Iſland of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> a Lad taken from <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> a very ſerious ſober Lad of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Seventeen years of Age; he had often before came over with <hi>Zebediah</hi> to viſit me. At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, he much lamented the loſs of <hi>Zebediah,</hi> and told me, that for ſeveral weeks they had told him the ſame Story, affirming it to be a truth, and that <hi>Egerly</hi> was ſo awakened by it, as to go again to Maſs every day, urging him; ſince God in ſuch a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous way offered ſuch conviction of the truth of their Religion, and the falſhood &amp; danger of ours, to come over to their Religion, or elſe his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be dreadfully aggravated. He (ſaid he) could have no reſt for them day and night; but
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001340_0087_0FB2847AD658D340"/>
(ſaid he) I told them their Religion was contrary to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and therefore I would not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; &amp; that I did not believe what they ſaid. And ſays he, to me, one day I was ſitting in the houſe, and <hi>Egerly</hi> came in, and I ſpake to him before the whole Family (in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, for he could not ſpeak much <hi>Engliſh</hi>) and askt him of this Story, he anſwered, <hi>it's a great falſhood,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, nor have I ever reported any ſuch thing to any body; and that he had never been at the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After which I took my Pen and wrote a Letter to one Mr. <hi>Samuel Hill,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captive, taken from <hi>Wells,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> &amp; his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ebenez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r Hill</hi> to make a diſcovery of this lying Plot, to warn them of their danger, and aſſure them of the falſhood of this report; but the Letter fell into the hands of the Prieſts, and was never delivered. This <hi>Egerly</hi> came home with us, ſo that they gained nothing but ſhame by this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem: God often diſappoints the crafty devices of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>In the latter end of Summer, they told me they had News from <hi>New-England</hi> by one who had been a Captive at <hi>Boſton,</hi> who ſaid that the Miniſters at <hi>Boſton</hi> had told the <hi>French</hi> Captives, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion was the only true Religion; and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:001340_0088_0FB28481CB10AC10"/>
that as a confirmation of it, they would raiſe a dead perſon to life before their eyes for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and that having perſwaded one to feign himſelf dead, they came and pray'd over him, and then commanded him in the <hi>Name of Chriſt</hi> (whoſe Religion they kept pure) to ariſe, they call'd and commanded, but he never aroſe; ſo that inſtead of raiſing the Dead, they killed the Living; which the bereav'd Relations diſcovered. I told them, it was an old Lye and Calumny againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> new vamped, and that they only change the perſons and place: but they affirmed it to be a truth; I told them I wondred they were ſo fond of a faith propagated, and then maintain'd by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words.</p>
                  <p>We were always out of hopes of being returned before Winter, the ſeaſon proving ſo cold in the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> and were praying to God to prepare our hearts, with all holy ſubmiſſion to his Holy Will, to Glorify his Holy Name in a way of paſſive Obedience in the Winter. For my own part, I was informed by ſeveral who came from the City, that the Lord <hi>Intendant</hi> ſaid, if <hi>More</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and brought word that <hi>Battis</hi> was in Priſon, he would put me into Priſon, and lay me in Irons. They would not permit me to go into the City, ſaying, I always did harm when I came to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if at any time I was at the City, they would perſwade the Governour to ſend me back again.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of laſt <hi>June,</hi> the Superior of the Prieſts came to the Pariſh where I was, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001340_0089_0FB28489B006E048"/>
told me, he ſaw I wanted my Friend Captain <hi>de Beauville,</hi> and that I was ragged. But ſays he, your obſtinacy againſt our Religion diſcourages from providing better Cloaths; I told him it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter going in a ragged Coat, than with a ragged Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of laſt <hi>June,</hi> went out an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Five Hundred <hi>Maqua's</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> with an intention to have fallen on ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Towns down <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, but lighting on a <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When they were promiſing themſelves another Winter, to draw away the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Popery, came News of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Briganteen a coming, and that the Honourable Capt. <hi>Samuel Appleton</hi> Eſqr. was coming Ambaſſador, to fetch off the Captives, and Capt. <hi>John Bonner</hi> with him. I cannot tell you how, the Clergy and others laboured to ſtop many of the Priſoners, to ſome Liberty, to ſome Mony, and yearly Penſions were offered, if they would ſtay. Some they urged to tarry at leaſt till the Spring of the year, telling them it was ſo late in the year, they would be loſt by Shipwrack if they went now; ſome younger ones they told, if they went home they would be Damned and burn in Hell for ever, to affright them; day and night they were urging of them to ſtay. And I was threatned to be ſent aboard, without a permiſſion to come aſhoar again, if I ſhould again diſcourſe with any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

who were turned to their Religion; at <hi>Mont-Royal</hi> eſpecially all crafty endeavours were uſed to ſtay the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They told my Child, <hi>if he would ſtay, he ſhould have an honourable Penſion from the King every year, and that his Maſter, who was an old man, and the richeſt in</hi> Canada, <hi>would give him a great deal; telling him if he returned he would be poor, for</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>your Father is poor, has loſt all his Eſtate; it was all burnt.</hi> But he would not be prevailed with to ſtay; and others were alſo in like manner urged to ſtay, but God graciouſly brake the ſnare and brought them out. They endeavoured in the Fall of the year, to have prevailed with my Son to have gone to <hi>France,</hi> when they ſaw he would not come to their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion any more. One Woman belonging to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts, who had by their perſwaſions, Married an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Captive taken the laſt War, came away with her Huſband, which made them ſay, they were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ever perſwaded her to turn to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then to Marry. For inſtead of advancing their Cauſe by it, they had weakened it, for now they had not only loſt her, but another they thought they had made ſure of. Another Woman belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> who had been flattered to their Religion, to whom a Bible was denied, till ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to embrace their Religion, and then had the promiſe of it for a little time, opening her Bible whilſt in the Church and preſent, at Maſs, ſhe read the fourth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> &amp; received ſuch conviction whilſt reading, that before her firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſhe fell off from them, and could never be prevailed with any more to be of their Religion.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. They who have had Mercies, have had them from God. God is the beſtower and giver of all our good things: All our Mercies come to us by a Divine Providence, and ordering; not by caſualty and accident, neither are they of our own procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and purchaſing, or others, ſo as to exclude the providential diſpoſing of God. 'Tis God who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the Captivity of Zion, Pſal. 126. <hi>begin. When the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: Then was our mouth filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and our tongue with ſinging. Then ſaid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad: turn again our Captivity O Lord.</hi> The very Heathen, acknowledge the good things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon, and done for the Church, to be from God; and Gods own People acknowledge Him for the Mercies granted, and humbly ſupplicate Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from Him for the future. 'Tis God who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the out-caſts of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> 'tis He who takes away the Captives of the Mighty, the Prey of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Who contends with them that contend with us, &amp; ſaves our Children.

                     </gap> Sometimes, God in a more immediate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way and manner, confers bleſſings and mercies, ſometimes in a more ordinary and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate way; but his Providence is to be acknowledged in all: not one ſingle Mercy comes to us, without a commiſſion from that God by whom our very Hairs are numbred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It well becomes thoſe who have had eminent Mercies, to be ſhowing to others what great things God hath done for them. Therefore you find the holy Pſalmiſt calling upon others, to give a liſtning ear, whilſt he makes a Narration of the Salvations he had from God, Pſal. 66.16. <hi>Come and hear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt. Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe God aimed at the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Own Honour and Glory, in the giving and dealing out of theſe Mercies. God makes and diſpoſeth all things for His own Honour and Glory. All Works of Providence, are ſome way or other to advance the Honour &amp; Glory of God in the World. The glory of His Power, Wiſdom, Mercy, Juſtice and Holineſs, are ſome way or other advanced in a declarative and manifeſtative way and manner. Now it well becomes us, to fall in with the deſign of God, and in an active manner to be giving Him Glory. That God deſigns to have Glory given to Him, is evident from, Pſal. 50. 15. <hi>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi> Exod. 7.5. <hi>And the Egyptians ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I ſtretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the Children of Iſrael from among them.</hi> God has a deſign to magnify His Power, Mercy and Covenant Faithfulneſs, in the eyes of the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>d. Reas.</hi> Becauſe God has given us direct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and poſitive Commands, in this Way to be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of Him. <hi>God is our Lord and Law-giver,</hi> and He requires that among other ways of ſhowing forth His Praiſes, we do it by rehearſing His Praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Acts, to the Children of Men. So that in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, and anſwering that High &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end we were made for; its requiſite that in this way we glorify God. Its enough, that the great God who hath taken us into <hi>Covenant Relation</hi> to Himſelf, has enjoyned us, to ſhew forth His Praiſes in rehearſing to others the Salvations, and Favours we have been the Subjects of. The fore-mentioned Scriptures, with many others that might be enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, ſufficiently demonſtrate, that God calls for our thankful acknowledgments in this Way; and upon the account of this being ſo agreeable to the revealed and preceptive Will of God, the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth himſelf, as in Pſal. 145.4, 5, 6. <hi>One Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall praiſe thy works to another, and ſhall declare thy mighty acts. I will ſpeak of the glorious honour of thy Majeſty; and of thy wondrous works. And men ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatneſs.

And therefore in obedience to Gods Command, that you may be under advantages to Glorify God; I will now make a report, of ſome of the great things God has done for thoſe, you have been putting up ſo many Prayers to God for.

                        <p>God has upheld many poor Souls under all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſadvantages, as to a getting of Knowledge, and kept them from falling, though crafty Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were under all advantages, and painful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſeduce them. Being without <hi>Bibles, Miniſters,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Friends</hi> to confer with, daily harraſed with Temptations, and Tempters: Some threatned, ſome flattered, ſome ſhut up and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Monaſteryes, where no means were uneſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gain them to change their Religion.</p>
                        <p>God has ſtrengthened to go through tedious Journeys, and renewed ſtrength, when they were even fainting in their Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to Travel Five Miles, and yet enabled to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at leaſt Forty in a day. Remarkably ordering ſeaſons, ſo as to be for their comfort in their Travels; cauſing a Moiſt Snow to fall on the Lake, only to ſuch a height as to make it eaſy to their Swoln and Wounded feet: Changing the Winds for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, in petty Voyages in their tickliſh Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes.</p>
                        <p>They have found God a little Sanctuary to them, in the Land of Strangers; even there have found the Conſolations of God through Chriſt not to be ſmall; ſo that ſome of the moſt joyful and refreſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from Heaven, have been given in to their Souls, when under all ſorts of outward afflictions.</p>
                        <p>They have found God a God hearing Prayers, when they have gone to Him with their moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult caſes, preſerving them from falling; recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs from falls; to a making void the counſels

of Adverſaries, diſappointing of them in the things they dealt moſt Proudly in. God has brought His to a reſignation to His Will, and then appeared deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Mercies, as the very caſe did require.</p>
                        <p>God has Sanctified to ſome, their former <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſolemn attendances on Duties of Piety, Private as well as Publick; and a Religious Education to be an unanſwerable Objection, againſt ſuch who were zealous for the <hi>Traditions of Men,</hi> to a viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning Gods Sabbaths. They durſt not embrace that Religion whoſe Principles as well as Practiſes, were ſo contrary to the Precepts of Gods holy Word. Oh! how ſhould <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi> be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from hence to uſe their utmoſt care, that Gods Sabbaths may be duely Sanctified by all under their charge; and that they would be exemplary before others, in a due obſervance of Holy Time.</p>
                        <p>God has made the falls of ſome to <hi>Popery,</hi> a means for the recovery of others; and making thoſe things, by which the adverſary thought to encreaſe their numbers and proſelytes, to be occaſional of recovering ſuch who from their youth had been educated in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> way; having been taken Captives when young. Don't be diſcouraged and ſay, your Friends and Relations have (being Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated when young) for a long time lived in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and therefore no hopes of recovery; for God can make dry bones, very dry to live, and can in ways unthought of by you, both recover them after they have fallen, and return them again. The Adverſaries have ſometimes, pretended mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for the confirmation of their Religion, that
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:001340_0107_0FB28081D744AE28"/>
they might ſeduce to Popery; in fallacious ways cauſed reports that ſome Captives dyed <hi>Papiſts;</hi> that one appeared in <hi>Flames of Fire</hi> to bear a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> but God has in his wiſe Providence, made known their falſhoods and lyes.</p>
                        <p>They have ſought to perſwade ſome, by Sums of Mony to change their Religion, offering honour and advancement to them at the ſame time; but God has enabled to reſiſt and hate ſuch allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>The reading the fourth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> a means of recovering one from <hi>Popery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God has made ſome with an heroical, yea with a right Chriſtian Courage to welcome Death. Oh let every one get ſuch a preparedneſs for DEATH, that a ſudden DEATH may not be a terror!</p>
                        <p>God has made ſome by the want of Sanctuary Mercies, to ſet an higher value upon the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of JESUS CHRIST. Oh learn to prize, and improve them, leſt God teach you by the briars and thorns of the Wilderneſs, the worth of them, and weep when you ſet down at the Rivers of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God has ſtrengthened ſome to ſtand, when they have not only been threatned with all cruelties if they refuſed, but when the Hatchet has been lift up, with a threatning of ſpeedy death in caſe of refuſal.

Divine Bounty and Goodneſs, to be declaring what great things God has done for them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore,</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Beware of a <hi>ſtupid, ſenſeleſs, ſlothful Spirit. The works of God are ſought out of them that have pleaſure in them.</hi> Some won't be at the pains to recollect the paſſages of Divine Providence; won't commit them to writing, or to their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and therefore ſoon forget them; they never wiſely obſerve the heightning circumſtances of their Mercies.</p>

Hereby you will alſo intereſt your ſelves in the <hi>Prayers</hi> of others; to have many Prayers going daily to God for you, how great a favour is it!

                     <p>The Glorifying God, is the greateſt and chiefeſt concern of gracious Souls; and the Glorifying of God here, is the way to be Glorifyed by, and with God for ever.
