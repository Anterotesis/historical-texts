            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <q>We frequently fall into error and folly, not becauſe the true principles of action are not known, but becauſe, for a time, they are not remembered. He may therefore juſtly be numbered among the benefactors of mankind, who contracts the great rules of life into ſhort ſentences, that may be eaſily impreſſed on the memory, and taught by frequent recollection to recur habitually to the mind.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſelections of leſſons for reading in ſchools now in uſe, are numerous, and many of them contain excellent eſſays of various kinds. But in general, thoſe eſſays are too long, to be read at once; and when they are divided into parts, and read at different times, it is obvious that the connection is entirely broken, and that a great part of the advantages propoſed to be derived from reading are loſt.</p>
            <p>To obviate this objection, the volume now offered to the public, is principally compoſed of ſhort paſſages, each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in itſelf, and independent of the reſt. When children read in claſſes, each may have an entire ſubject.</p>
            <p>To ſome of the extracts, it may perhaps be objected, that they are above the underſtanding of youth: But it is believed their capacities are too frequently under-rated; and that it often happens, through ſuch a pernicious miſtake, that they ſpend their time in reading idle tales and ſtories, when they might be employed in treaſuring up a ſtore of uſeful maxims to guide them through the thorny path of life with ſafety and honour to themſelves and advantage to the community.</p>
            <p>In making the ſelection, conſiderable pains have been taken. Many of the works of the moſt celebrated writers have been carefully examined—and numerous paſſages adorn the work from Shakeſpeare, Dryden, Milton, Pope, Young, Watts, Rowe, Addiſon, Swift, Brooke, Fielding, Hervey, Johnſon, Price, Monteſquieu and others of equal reputation. To familiarize the riſing generation with the peruſal of ſuch illuſtrious writers, can hardly fail to prove ſalutary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:037099_0003_100C4BE7B1E8B3F0"/>
The introduction of political ſentiments into a work intended principally for youth, will probably be cenſured by ſome perſons. It may not therefore be improper to offer the reaſons that led to the adoption of this plan.</p>
            <p>In countries where the eſtabliſhed form of government is monarchy, moſt of the elementary books uſed to inſtruct children in their native language, are calculated to impreſs on their youthful minds, a prejudice in favour of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting order of things. National glory, (which means the ſpreading havoc and deſtruction among other nations), the ſplendor of monarchy, and the advantages of conqueſt, are diſplayed in the moſt captivating and glowing colours. <hi>This system is the result of profound policy.</hi> An early bias is thus given to the mind, which in moſt caſes "grows with its growth," and often retains its influence to the laſt ſtage of decrepitude.</p>
            <p>And is not ſuch a ſyſtem at leaſt as proper and neceſſary in this country as elſewhere? Should not endeavours be uſed to impreſs on the riſing generation, a reſpect and reverence for the forms of government under which we live? Our conſtitutions are all grounded on the rights of the citizens to liberty and the ſecurity of property, and on the grand principle, that the officers of government, legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative as well as executive, are all the agents of the people, deputed to perform for them thoſe functions which they cannot execute themſelves. In every one of them are recogniſed thoſe grand and ſublime truths, the defence of which has rendered ſo many men illuſtrious in the Engliſh annals—thoſe principles for which
<q>
                  <l>a Hampden ſtruggled, and a Sydney bled—</l>
               </q>
thoſe principles, in fine, which are to be found in a greater or leſs degree, through the writings of the beſt men of all ages and nations.</p>
            <p>On this ground, it is preſumed that vaſt advantages muſt accrue from ſubjecting to the peruſal of youth, ſuch a variety of elegant paſſages, tending to ſhew in the ſtrongeſt light the advantages of liberty, of peace, of good order—the dignity of human nature—to inſpire an abhorrence of war—and to diſplay its tremendous conſequences, in all
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037099_0004_100C4BEAD26CF6F8"/>
their native deformity, ſtripped of the impoſing gloſs which artful and intereſted men have ſpread over them.</p>
            <p>The names of the writers are generally given, partly as a tribute of gratitude towards thoſe whoſe writings have ſerved to complete this work—partly to facilitate a compariſon between the ſentiments of men in different ages—and partly with a view of exciting the reader's curioſity to ſearch into their works complete. It is not pretended that a ſublime truth can receive any corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the celebrity of the man who wrote it. The ſentiment, that
<q>
                  <l>The pureſt treaſure mortal times afford,</l>
                  <l>Is ſpotleſs reputation. That away,</l>
                  <l>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay,</l>
               </q>
is an eternal axiom, and, whether ſanctioned with the name of a Shakeſpeare or a Dennis, muſt carry conviction to every correct mind. In like manner, the poſition in page 240,—<q>No man is better born than another, unleſs he is born with better abilities, and a more amiable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</q> needs not the prop of Seneca's name to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand aſſent.</p>
            <p>With theſe few remarks this ſmall work is ſubmitted to the candour and indulgence of the public, whoſe deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on its utility ſhall be acquieſced in by the editor. He may have eſtimated too high the probable beneficial effects of his labours. This is ſo common an error as to be perhaps a venial one. But whatever may be its tendency or its ſucceſs, he can never be deprived of the ſolid ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ariſing from a perfect conſciouſneſs of having uſed his moſt earneſt endeavours to promote the beſt intereſts of his fellow men.</p>

               <head>OF ELOCUTION.</head>
               <p>ELOCUTION is a branch of oratory, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and importance of which is greater than is generally thought; inſomuch that eloquence takes its name from it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eloquentia ab eloqui. I uſe the word Elocution here in its common and vulgar ſenſe, to ſignify utterance, delivery, or pronunciation, in which ſenſe we frequently uſe it in the Engliſh language, and which its Latin etymology very well juſtifies; tho' I know ſome good writers apply to it a different idea, in conformity to the ſenſe in which the Latin orators uſed the word elocutio. But it is no uncommon thing for derivative words in one language to be taken in a different ſenſe from that, in which the words they are derived from are taken in another.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It was much cultivated by Quintilian, and before him by Cicero, and before him by M. Antonius; but before his time, it was too much neglected by the Roman orators: Which made him ſay, "he had ſeen many men famous for eloquence, but not one of them that underſtood elocution."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037099_0014_100C4C006B2092B8"/>
But what ſtreſs was laid upon it by the Greek orators, appears from that celebrated ſaying of Demoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes; who being aſked, what was the firſt principal thing in oratory? anſwered, Pronunciation; being aſked again, what was the ſecond? replied, Pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And what was the third? Pronunciation. Denoting that in his judgment the whole art, ſpirit, and power of oratory conſiſted in this.</p>
               <p>Cicero, and after him Quintilian, divided oratory into five parts: 1. Invention—by which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ourſelves with ſuitable and ſufficient materials for a diſcourſe. 2. Diſpoſition—by which they meant the diviſion of their ſubject into parts and ſentences, according to the moſt natural order; and conſequently the proper diſtribution and arrangement of their ideas. 3. Elocution—by which they always meant, what we call Diction; which conſiſts in ſuiting our words to our ideas, and the ſtyle to the ſubject. 4. Memory, or a faculty of clearly diſcerning and retaining our ideas, and of calling to mind the propereſt words by which to expreſs them. 5. Pronunciation; or the art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the voice and geſture in ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>So that by pronunciation, the antients underſtood both Elocution and Action; and comprehended in it the right management of the voice, looks, and geſture. To the former of theſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the right management of the voice in reading or ſpeaking; which is indifferently called by us, Elocution and Pronunciation, I ſhall here confine myſelf.</p>
               <p>The great deſign and end of a good pronunciation is, to make the ideas ſeem to come from the heart; and then they will not fail to excite the attention and affections of thoſe that hear us: from which the great benefit and uſefulneſs of this too much neglected art may be ſeen.</p>

               <head>OF BAD PRONUNCIATION.</head>
               <p>The ſeveral faults of pronunciation are theſe following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the voice is too loud.</p>
               <p>This is very diſagreeable to the hearer, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to the ſpeaker.</p>
               <p>It will be very diſagreeable to the hearers, if they be perſons of good taſte: who will always look upon it to be the effect either of ignorance or affectation.</p>
               <p>Some will impute it to your ignorance, and ſuppoſe that you were never inſtructed better ſince you left the reading ſchool; where children generally get a habit of reading in a high-pitched key, or a uniform elevated voice, without any regard to emphaſis, cadence, or a graceful elocution.</p>
               <p>Others will impute it to affectation; or a deſign to work upon their paſſions; which will immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the deſign, if you had it. For if you would effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually move the paſſions, you muſt carefully conceal your intention ſo to do; for as ſoon as the mind perceives you have ſuch a deſign upon it, it will be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon its guard. However, none but the moſt low, weak, and mechanical minds will be affected with mere dint of ſound and noiſe. And the paſſions ſo raiſed, leave no laſting or valuable effects upon the mind, and anſwer no good purpoſe or end; becauſe the underſtanding hath nothing to do with ſuch impreſſions, and the memory no handle by which to retain or recall them. Not to ſay, it often anſwers a bad end; affects the mind in a wrong place, and gives it a falſe bias. However this may be thought to become the ſtage or the bar, it leaſt of all befits the pulpit; where all ought to be ſolemn, ſerious, rational, and grave as the ſubjects there treated of.</p>
               <p>It is falſe oratory then to ſeek to perſuade or affect by mere vehemence of voice. A thing that hath been often attempted by men of mean furniture, low genius,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037099_0016_100C4C0708B2B710"/>
or bad taſte, among the antients as well as the moderns. A practice which formerly gave the judicious Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian great offence; who calls it not only clamouring, but furious bellowing; not vehemence, but downright violence.</p>
               <p>Beſides, an overſtrained voice is very inconvenient to the ſpeaker, as well as diſguſtful to judicious hearers. It exhauſts his ſpirits to no purpoſe; and takes from him the proper management and modulation of his voice according to the ſenſe of his ſubject; and, what is worſt of all, it naturally leads him into a tone.</p>
               <p>Every man's voice indeed ſhould fill the place where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaks; but if it exceed its natural key, it will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſweet nor ſoft, nor agreeable, becauſe he will not be able to give every word its proper and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another fault in pronunciation is when the voice is too low.</p>
               <p>This is not ſo inconvenient to the ſpeaker, but is as diſagreeable to the hearer, as the other extreme. And inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to the generality of hearers a too low voice is much more diſpleaſing than a too loud one; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who are troubled with an impediment in hearing, and thoſe who are beſt pleaſed with a lively and pathetic addreſs, as moſt are. It is always offenſive to an audience to obſerve any thing in the reader or ſpeaker that looks like indolence or inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The hearer will never be affected whilſt he ſees the ſpeaker indifferent.</p>
               <p>The art of governing the voice conſiſts a good deal in dexterouſly avoiding theſe two extremes: at leaſt, this ought to be firſt minded. And for a general rule to direct you herein, I know of none better than this—carefully to preſerve the key, that is, the command of your voice; and at the ſame time, to adapt the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrength of it to the condition and number of the perſons you ſpeak to, and the nature of the place you ſpeak in.—It would be altogether as ridiculous in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037099_0017_100C32916CA8F3F0"/>
a general who is haranguing an army to ſpeak in a low and languid voice, as in a perſon who reads a chapter in a family to ſpeak in a loud and eager one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another fault in pronunciation is a thick, haſty, cluttering voice.</p>
               <p>This is, when a perſon mumbles, or clips, or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his words, that is, leaves out ſome ſyllables in the long words, and never pronounces ſome of the ſhort ones at all; but hurries on without any care to be heard diſtinctly, or to give his words their full ſound, or his hearers the full ſenſe of them.</p>
               <p>This is often owing to a defect in the organs of ſpeech, or a too great flutter of the animal ſpirits; but oftener to a bad habit uncorrected.</p>
               <p>Demoſthenes, the greateſt orator Greece ever produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, had, it is ſaid, nevertheleſs, three natural impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in pronunciation; all which he conquered by invincible labour and perſeverance. One was a weakneſs of voice; which he cured by frequently declaiming on the ſea-ſhore, amidſt the noiſe of the waves. Another was a ſhortneſs of breath; which he mended by repeating his orations as he walked up a hill. And the other was the fault I am ſpeaking of; a thick mumbling way of ſpeaking; which he broke himſelf of by declaiming with pebbles in his mouth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another fault in pronunciation is when perſons ſpeak too quick.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any fault more common than this, eſpecially among young perſons, who imagine they can read very well, and are not afraid of being ſtopped in their carreer by the unexpected intervention of any hard word. And ſcarce any bad habit of the voice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered with more difficulty; tho' one would imagine nothing is more eaſy.</p>
               <p>This manner of reading may do well enough when we are examining leaſes; peruſing indentures; or reciting acts of parliament, where there is always a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037099_0018_100C4C0C6A044D48"/>
great ſuperfluity of words; or in reading a newſpaper, where there is but little matter that deſerves our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but is very improper in reading books of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſtruction, and eſpecially the ſacred ſcriptures, where the ſolemnity of the ſubject or the weight of the ſenſe demands a particular regard. But it is moſt of all inexcuſable to read forms of prayer in this manner as acts of devotion.</p>
               <p>The great diſadvantage which attends this manner of pronunciation, is, that the hearer loſes the benefit of more than half the good things he hears, and would fain remember, but cannot. And a ſpeaker ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a regard to the memory, as well as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of his hearers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is alſo a fault to ſpeak too ſlow.</p>
               <p>Some are apt to read in a heavy, droning, ſleepy way; and through mere careleſſneſs make pauſes at improper places. This is very diſagreeable. But to hem, hauk, ſneeze, yawn, or cough, between the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, is vaſtly more ſo.</p>
               <p>A too ſlow elocution is moſt faulty in reading trifles that do not require attention. It then becomes tedious. A perſon that is addicted to this ſlow way of ſpeaking ſhould always take care to reward the hearer's patience with importan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſentiments, and compenſate the want of words by a weight of thoughts; and give his diſcourſe its proper quantity of ſolid ſenſe, that, as we ſay, what it wants in length it may make out in breadth.</p>
               <p>But a too ſlow elocution is a fault very rarely to be found, unleſs in aged people, and thoſe who naturally ſpeak ſo in common converſation. And in theſe, if the pronunciation be in all other reſpects juſt, decent, and proper; and eſpecially if the ſubject be weighty or intricate, it is very excuſable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. An irregular or uneven voice, is a great fault in reading.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037099_0019_100C4C0EB51BCF58"/>
That is, when the voice riſes and falls by fits and ſtarts, or when it is elevated and depreſſed unnaturally, or unſeaſonably, without regard to ſenſe or ſtops; or always beginning a ſentence with a high voice, and concluding it with a low one, or <hi>vice versa;</hi> or always beginning and concluding it with the ſame key. Oppoſite to this is.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A flat, dull, uniform tone of voice, without emphaſis or cadence, or any regard to the ſenſe or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of what is read.</p>
               <p>This is a habit, which children who have been uſed to read their leſſons by way of taſk, are very apt to fall into, and retain as they grow up, ſuch a monotony as attorney's clerks read in, when they examine an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed deed. This is a great infelicity when it becomes habitual; becauſe it deprives the hearer of the greateſt part of the benefit or advantage he might receive by a cloſe attention to the moſt weighty and intereſting parts of the ſubject, which ſhould always be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed or pointed out by the pronunciation—For a juſt pronunciation is a good commentary.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the greateſt and moſt common fault of all is reading with a tone.</p>
               <p>No habit is more eaſy to be contracted than this, or more hard to be conquered. This unnatural tone in reading and ſpeaking is very various; but whatever it be, it is always diſguſtful to perſons of delicacy and judgment.</p>
               <p>Some have a womaniſh ſqueaking tone; which, perſons whoſe voices are ſhrill and weak, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, are very apt to fall into.</p>
               <p>Some have a ſinging or canting tone, which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic ſpeakers generally much affect, and by which their hearers are often much affected. Others affect a high, ſwelling, theatrical tone; who being ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the fame of fine orators, lay too much emphaſis on every ſentence, and thereby tranſgreſs the rules of true oratory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037099_0020_100C4C109E5307F0"/>
Others affect an awful and ſtriking tone, attended with ſolemn grimace, as if they would move you with every word, whether the weight of the ſubject bear them out or not. This is what perſons of a gloomy or melancholy caſt of mind are moſt apt to give into.</p>
               <p>Some have a ſet uniform tone of voice; which I have already taken notice of.—Others, an odd, whimſical, whining tone, peculiar to themſelves, and not to be deſcribed—only that it is laying the emphaſis on words which do not require or deſerve it.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged, there are ſome kinds of tone which, though unnatural, yet, as managed by the ſpeakers, are not very diſagreeable—and the mind muſt be much on its guard that can remain unmoved thereby.</p>
               <p>When I have been affected with hearing orators de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver common or obſcure ſentiments in ſuch a ſtriking tone, I have endeavoured carefully to examine into the true reaſon of that emotion, or what it was that excited that affection in my mind; and have found that it could not ariſe from the mere tone of the ſpeaker—which of itſelf was unnatural and diſagreeable—nor from the weight of the ſubject—which was no more than common—but from the earneſtneſs, life and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity with which he ſpake, and his appearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be much affected with what he delivered; which two things will never fail to move an audience. And why they may not be as well obſerved and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed without a tone as with one, I cannot conceive. And without theſe a tone itſelf would have no power to move; as it hath no other ſubſerviency to raiſe the paſſions than as it ſolemnizes the ſubject, and ſeems to ſhew the ſpeaker's heart engaged. Pity that thoſe two ends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <head>HOW TO AVOID A BAD PRONUNCIATION.</head>
               <p>To this end the few following rules may be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you would not read in too loud or too low a voice, conſider whether your voice be naturally too low or loud; and correct it accordingly in your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary converſation: by which means you will be better able to correct it in reading. If it be too low, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with thoſe that are deaf; if too loud, with thoſe whoſe voices are low. Begin your periods with an even moderate voice, that you may have the command of it, to raiſe or fall it as the ſubject requires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To cure a thick confuſed cluttering voice, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom yourſelf, both in converſation and reading, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce every word diſtinct and clear. Obſerve with what delib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ration ſome converſe and read, and how full a ſound they give to every word; and imitate them. Do not affect to contract your words, as ſome do, or run two into one. This may do very well in converſation, or in reading familiar dialogues, but is not ſo decent in grave and ſolemn ſubjects; eſpecially in reading the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>It appears from Demoſthenes's caſe, that this fault of pronunciation cannot be cured without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, nor will you find his remedy effectual without pains and perſeverance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To break a habit of reading too faſt, attend dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the ſenſe, weight, and propriety of every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence you read, and of every emphatical word in it. This will not only be an advantage to yourſelf, but a double one to your hearers; for it will at once give them time to do the ſame, and excite their attention when they ſee yours is fixed. A ſolemn pauſe after a weighty thought is very beautiful and ſtriking. A well timed ſtop gives as much grace to ſpeech as it does to muſic. Imagine that you are ſpeaking to perſons of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037099_0022_100C4C1556A35960"/>
ſlow and unready conceptions; and meaſure not your hearer's apprehenſion by your own. If you do, you may poſſibly out-run it. And as in reading you are not at liberty to repeat your words and ſentences, that ſhould engage you to be very deliberate in pronouncing them, that their ſenſe may not be loſt. The eaſe and advantage that will ariſe both to the ſpeaker and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by a free, full, and deliberate pronunciation is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be imagined.</p>
               <p>I need lay down no rules to avoid a too ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation; that being a fault which few are guilty of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To cure an uneven, deſultory voice, take care that you do not begin your periods either in too high or too low a key; for that will neceſſarily lead you to an unnatural and improper variation of it. Have a careful regard to the nature and quantity of your points, and the length of your periods; and keep your mind intent on the ſenſe, ſubject, and ſpirit of your author.</p>
               <p>The ſame directions are neceſſary to avoid a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otony in pronunciation, or a dull, ſet, uniform tone of voice. For if your mind be but attentive to the ſenſe of your ſubject, you will naturally manage and mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate your voice according to the nature and importance of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To avoid all kinds of unnatural and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable tones, the only rule is to endeavour to ſpeak with the ſame eaſe and freedom as you would do on the ſame ſubject in private converſation. You hear no body converſe in a tone; unleſs they have the uncouth accent of ſome other country, or have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> into a habit of altering the natural key of their voice when they are talking of ſome ſerious ſubject in religion. But I can ſee no reaſon in the world, that when in common converſation we ſpeak in a natural voice with proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and emphaſis, yet as ſoon as we begin to read, or talk of religion, or ſpeak in public, we ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately aſſume a ſtiff, aukward, unnatural tone. If we are indeed deeply affected with the ſubject we read
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037099_0023_100C4C16DA6D9C18"/>
or talk of, the voice will naturally vary according to the paſſion excited; but if we vary it unnaturally, only to ſeem affected, or with a deſign to affect others, it then becomes a tone, and is offenſive.</p>
               <p>In reading then attend to your ſubject, and deliver it juſt in ſuch a manner as you would do if you were talking of it. This is the great, general and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant rule of all; which, if carefully obſerved, will correct not only this but almoſt all the other faults of a bad pronunciation; and give you an eaſy, decent, graceful delivery, agreeable to all the rules of a right elocution. For however apt we are to tranſgreſs them in reading, we follow them naturally and eaſily enough in converſation. And children will tell a ſtory with all the natural graces and beauties of pronunciation, however aukwardly they may read the ſame out of a book.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="lesson">
               <head>OF GOOD PRONUNCIATION.</head>
               <p>A good pronunciation in reading, is the art of managing and governing the voice ſo as to expreſs the full ſenſe and ſpirit of your author in that juſt, decent and graceful manner, which will not only inſtruct but affect the hearers; and will not only raiſe in them the ſame ideas he intended to convey, but the ſame paſſions he really felt. This is the great end of reading to others, and this end can only be attained by a proper and juſt pronunciation.</p>
               <p>And hence we may learn wherein a good pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in ſpeaking conſiſts; which is nothing but a natural, eaſy, and graceful variation of the voice, ſuitable to the nature and importance of the ſentiments we deliver.</p>
               <p>A good pronunciation in both theſe reſpects is more eaſily attained by ſome than others; as ſome can more readily enter into the ſenſe and ſentiments of an author, and more eaſily deliver their own, than others can;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037099_0024_100C4C19F700E6F0"/>
and at the ſame time have a more happy facility of expreſſing all the proper variations and modulations of the voice than others have. Thus perſons of a quick apprehenſion, and a briſk flow of animal ſpirits (ſetting aſide all impediments of the organs) have generally a more lively, juſt, and natural elocution than perſons of a ſlow perception and a flegmatic caſt. However, it may in a good degree be attained by every one that will carefully attend to and practice thoſe rules that are proper to acquire it. Which leads me therefore to conſider</p>

               <p>To this end the obſervation of the following rules is neceſſary.</p>

               <head>OF PAUSES.</head>
               <p>WITH reſpect to pauſes, you will in a great meaſure in reading be directed by the common ſtops or points, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Comma (,)—Semi-colon (;)—Colon (:)—Period (.)—Interrogation (?)—and Admiration (!).</p>
               <p>Theſe points ſerve two purpoſes—to diſtinguiſh the ſenſe of the author, and—to direct the pronunciation of the reader.—A comma ſtops the voice, while we may privately tell one—a ſemi-colon, two—a colon, three—and a period, four.</p>
               <p>To break a habit of taking breath too often in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accuſtom yourſelf to read long periods, ſuch as the ſixteen firſt lines in Milton's Paradiſe Loſt.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037099_0025_100C4C1B82008ED8"/>
—theſe long pauſes are very proper; as they at once compoſe and affect the mind, and give it time to think. It will alſo be very helpful to the ſpeaker's voice; and give his pronunciation the advantage of variety, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <head>OF EMPHASIS.</head>
               <p>THE next thing to be regarded in reading is the Emphaſis; and to ſee that it be always laid on the emphatical word.</p>
               <p>When we diſtinguiſh any particular ſyllable in a word with a ſtrong voice, it is called Accent; when we thus diſtinguiſh any particular word in a ſentence, it is called Emphaſis; and the word to diſtinguiſhed the Emphatical word. And the emphatical words (for there are often more than one) in a ſentence, are thoſe which carry a weight or importance in themſelves, or thoſe on which the ſenſe of the reſt depends; and theſe muſt always be diſtinguiſhed by a fuller and ſtronger ſound of voice, wherever they are found, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of a ſentence. Take for inſtance thoſe words of the ſatiriſt.
<q>
                     <l>Get plàce and weàlth, if poſſible, with gràce,</l>
                     <l>If not, by àny means get weàlth and plàce.</l>
                     <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
                  </q>
In theſe lines the emphatical words are accented; and which they are, the ſenſe will always diſcover.</p>
               <p>Some ſentences are ſo full and comprehenſive, that almoſt every word is emphatical: For inſtance, that pathetic expoſtulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel,
<q>Why will ye die!</q>
In this ſhort ſentence, every word is emphatical, and on which ever word you lay the emphaſis, whether the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037099_0026_100C4C1E6BBE4DA0"/>
firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth, it ſtrikes out a different ſenſe, and opens a new ſubject of moving expoſtulation.</p>
               <p>Some ſentences are equivocal, as well as ſome words; that is, contain in them more ſenſes than one; and which is the ſenſe intended can only be known by obſerving on what word the emphaſis is laid. For inſtance—"Will you ride to town to-day?"—This queſtion is capable of being taken in four different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, according to the different words on which you lay the emphaſis. If it be laid on the word <hi>you,</hi>—the anſwer may be—"No, but I intend to ſend my ſervant in my ſtead."—If the emphaſis be laid on the word <hi>ride</hi>—the proper anſwer might be—"No, I intend to walk it."—If you place the emphaſis on the word <hi>town</hi>—it is a different queſtion; and the anſwer may be—"No, for I deſign to ride into the country"—And if the emphaſis be laid upon the words <hi>to-day</hi>—the ſenſe is ſtill ſomething different from all theſe; and the proper anſwer may be—"No, but I ſhall to-morrow"—Of ſuch importance oftentimes is a right emphaſis, in order to determine the proper ſenſe of what we read or ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The voice muſt alſo expreſs, as near as may be, the very ſenſe or idea deſigned to be conveyed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical word; by a ſtrong, rough, and violent, or a ſoft, ſmooth, and tender ſound.</p>
               <p>Thus the different paſſions of the mind are to be expreſſed by a different ſound or tone of voice. Love, by a ſoft, ſmooth, languiſhing voice;—Anger, by a ſtrong, vehement, and elevated voice;—Joy, by a quick, ſweet, and clear voice;—Sorrow, by a low, flexible, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted voice;—Fear, by a dejected, tremulous, heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting voice;—Courage hath a full, bold, and loud voice;—and Perplexity, a grave, ſteady, and earneſt one. In Exordiums the voice ſhould be low;—in Narrations, diſtinct;—in Reaſoning, ſlow;—in Perſuaſion, ſtrong; it ſhould thunder in Anger—ſoften in Sorrow—trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Fear—and melt in Love.</p>

               <p>In an Antitheſis, one contrary muſt be pronounced louder than the other.</p>
               <p>In a Climax, the voice ſhould always riſe with it.</p>
               <p>In Dialogues, it ſhould alter with the parts.</p>
               <p>In Repetitions, it ſhould be loudeſt in the ſecond place.</p>
               <p>Words of quality and diſtinction, or of praiſe or diſpraiſe, muſt be pronounced with a ſtrong emphaſis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No</hi> emphaſis, is better than a wrong or miſplaced one. For that only perplexes; this always miſleads the mind of the hearer.</p>

            <div type="lesson">
               <head>OF CADENCE.</head>
               <p>THIS is directly oppoſite to emphaſis. Emphaſis is raiſing the voice, cadence is falling it; and when right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed is very muſical. Beſide cadence of voice, there is cadence of ſtile—That is, when the ſenſe being almoſt expreſſed and perfectly diſcerned by the reader, the remaining words, which are only neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the period, gently fall of themſelves, without any emphatical word among them. If our author's lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage be pure and elegant, his cadence of ſtile will naturally direct the cadence of voice.</p>
               <p>Cadence generally takes place at the end of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; unleſs it cloſes with an emphatical word.</p>
               <p>Every parentheſis is to be pronounced in cadence; that is, with a low voice, and quicker than ordinary; that it may not take off the attention too much from the ſenſe of the period it interrupts. But all apoſtrophes and proſopopaeias are to be pronounced in emphaſis.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
               <p>IF you would acquire a juſt pronunciation in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you muſt not only take in the full ſenſe, but enter into the ſpirit of your author: For you can never convey the force and fulneſs of his ideas to another, till you feel them yourſelf. No man can read an author he does not perfectly underſtand and taſte.<note n="*" place="bottom">The great rule which the maſters of rhetoric ſo much preſs, can never enough be remembered; that to make a man ſpeak well, and pronounce with a right emphaſis, he ought thoroughly to underſtand all that he ſays, be fully perſuaded of it, and bring himſelf to have thoſe affections which he deſires to infuſe into others. He that is inwardly perſuaded of the truth of what he ſays, and that hath a concern about it in his mind, will pronounce with a natural vehemence that is far more lovely than all the ſtrains that art can lead him to. An orator muſt endeavor to feel what he ſays, and then he will ſpeak ſo as to make others feel it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame rules are to be obſerved in reading poetry and proſe: Neither the rhyme nor the numbers ſhould take off the attention from the ſenſe and ſpirit of the author. It is this only that muſt direct the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in poetry as well as proſe. When you read verſe, you muſt not at all favor the meaſure or rhyme; <hi>that</hi> often obſcures the ſenſe and ſpoils the pronunciation: For the great end of pronunciation is to elucidate and heighten the ſenſe; that is, to repreſent it not only in a clear, but a ſtrong light. Whatever then obſtructs this is carefully to be avoided, both in verſe and proſe. Nay, this ought to be more carefully obſerved in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe than proſe; becauſe the author, by a conſtant attention to his meaſure and rhyme, and the exaltation of his language, is often very apt to obſcure his ſenſe; which therefore requires the more care in the reader to diſcover and diſtinguiſh it by the pronunciation. And if when you read verſe with proper pauſe, emphaſis, and cadence, and a pronunciation varied and governed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037099_0029_100C4C24EB343228"/>
by the ſenſe, it be not harmonious and beautiful, the fault is not in the reader but the author. And if the verſe be good, to read it thus will improve its harmony; becauſe it will take off that uniformity of ſound and accent which tires the ear, and makes the numbers heavy and diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>Another important rule to be obſerved in elocution is—ſtudy Nature.—By this I mean your own natural diſpoſitions and affections. And thoſe ſubjects that are moſt ſuitable to them, you will eaſily pronounce with a beautiful propriety: and to heighten the pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the natural warmth of the mind ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have its courſe under a proper rein and regulation.</p>
               <p>Study the natural diſpoſitions and affections of others. For ſome are much more eaſily impreſſed and moved one way, and ſome another. And an orator ſhould be acquainted with all the avenues to the heart.</p>
               <p>Study the moſt eaſy and natural way of expreſſing yourſelf, both as to the tone of voice and the mode of ſpeech. And this is beſt learned by obſervations on common converſation—where all is free, natural, and eaſy—where we are only intent on making ourſelves underſtood, and conveying our ideas in a ſtrong, plain, and lively manner, by the moſt natural language, pronunciation and action. And the nearer our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation in public comes to the freedom and eaſe of that we uſe in common diſcourſe—provided we keep up the dignity of the ſubject, and preſerve a propriety of expreſſion—the more juſt, natural, and agreeable it will generally be.</p>
               <p>Above all things, then, ſtudy nature—avoid affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—never uſe art, if you have not the art to conceal it. For whatever does not appear natural, can never be agreeable, much leſs perſuaſive.</p>
               <p>Endeavor to keep your mind collected and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed—Guard againſt that flatter and timidity of ſpirit,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037099_0030_100C4C285EFD6920"/>
which is the common infelicity of young, and eſpecially baſhful perſons, when they firſt begin to ſpeak or read in public. This is a great hindrance both to their pronunciation and invention; and at once gives both themſelves and their hearers an unneceſſary pain. It will by conſtant oppoſition wear off—and the beſt way to give the mind a proper degree of aſſurance and ſelf-command at ſuch a time, is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Endeavor to be wholly engaged in your ſubject; and when the mind is intent upon and warmed with it, it will forget that awful deference it before paid to the audience, which was ſo apt to diſconcert it.</p>
               <p>If the ſight of your hearers, or any of them diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you, keep your eyes from them.</p>
               <p>Be ſure to keep up a life, ſpirit, and energy in the expreſſion; and let the voice naturally vary according to the variation of the ſtile and ſubject.</p>
               <p>Whatever be the ſubject, it will never be pleaſing, if the ſtyle be low and flat; nor will the beauty of the ſtyle be diſcovered, if the pronunciation be ſo.</p>
               <p>Cicero obſerves there muſt be a glow in our ſtyle if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>To attain a juſt and graceful pronunciation, you ſhould accuſtom yourſelves frequently to hear thoſe who excel in it, whether at the bar or in the pulpit—where you will ſee all the ſore-mentioned rules exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, and be able to account for all thoſe graces and beauties of pronunciation which always pleaſed you, but you did not know why.</p>

acquainted with the rules of it, will make the imitation more eaſy. You will obſerve a certain agreeableneſs of manner in ſome orators, that is natural to them, not to be reduced to any rule, and to be learnt by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation only; nor by that, unleſs it be in ſome degree natural to you.</p>
               <p>You ſhould frequently exerciſe yourſelf to read aloud according to the foregoing rules.—It is practice only that muſt give you the faculty of an elegant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation. This, like other habits, is only to be attained by often repeated acts.</p>
               <p>Orators, as well as poets, muſt be born ſo, or they will never excel in their reſpective arts: But that part of oratory which conſiſts in a decent and graceful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, provided there be no defect in the organs of ſpeech, may be attained by rule, imitation, and practice; and, when attained, will give a beauty to ſpeech, a force to thoughts, and a pleaſure to the hearers, not to be expreſſed; and which all will admire, but none can imitate, unleſs they are firſt prepared for it by art and nature—In ſhort, the great advantage of a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation is, that it will pleaſe all, whether they have no taſte, a bad taſte, or a good taſte.</p>

part of mankind endeavor to procure in the little circle of their friends and acquaintance. The pooreſt mechanic, the man who lives upon common arms, gets him his ſet of admirers, and delights in that ſuperiority which he enjoys over thoſe who are in ſome reſpect beneath him. This ambition, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the ſoul of man, might methinks receive a very happy turn; and, if it were rightly directed, contribute as much to a perſon's advantage, as it generally does to his uneaſineſs and diſquiet.</p>
               <bibl>SPECTATOR.</bibl>
               <p>If we look abroad upon the great multitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and endeavor to trace out the principles of action in every individual, it will, I think, ſeem highly probable, that ambition runs through the whole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that every man, in proportion to the vigor of his complexion, is more or leſs actuated by it. It is indeed no uncommon thing to meet with men, who by the natural bent of their inclinations, and without the diſcipline of philoſophy, aſpire not to the heights of power and grandeur; who never ſet their hearts upon a numerous train of clients and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor other gay appendages of greatneſs; who are contented with a competency, and will not moleſt their tranquility to gain an abundance. But it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be concluded, that ſuch a man is not ambitious. His deſires may cut out another channel, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him to other purſuits; the motive may be, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſtill the ſame; and in thoſe caſes, likewiſe, the man may be equally puſhed on with the deſire of diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Though the pure conſciouſneſs of worthy actions, abſtracted from the views of popular applauſe, be to a generous mind an ample reward; yet the deſire of diſtinction was doubtleſs implanted in our natures as an additional incentive to exert ourſelves in virtuous excellence.</p>

This paſſion, like all others, is frequently perverted to evil and ignoble purpoſes; ſo that we may account for many of the excellencies and follies of life upon the ſame innate principles; to wit, the deſire of being remarkable. For this, as it has been differently cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by education, ſtudy, and converſe, will bring forth ſuitable effects, as it falls in with an ingenious companion, or a corrupt mind: it does alſo expreſs itſelf in acts of magnanimity or ſelfiſh cunning, as it meets with a good or weak underſtanding. As it has been employed in embelliſhing the mind, or adorning the outſide, it renders the man eminently praiſe-worthy or ridiculous. Ambition, therefore, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined only to one paſſion or purſuit; for as the ſame humours, in conſtitutions otherwiſe different, affect the body after different manners, ſo the ſame aſpiring principle within us ſometimes breaks forth upon one object, ſometimes upon another.</p>
               <p>It cannot de doubted, but that there is as great a deſire of glory in a ring of wreſtlers or cudgel-players, as in any other more refined competition for ſuperiority. No man, that could avoid it, would ever ſuffer his head to be broken, but out of a principle of honor.</p>

               <p>Of all the impertinent wiſhes which we hear expreſſed in converſation, there is not one more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a gentleman, or a man of liberal education, than that of wiſhing one's ſelf younger. It is a certain ſign of a fooliſh or a diſſolute mind, if we want our youth again only for the ſtrength of bones and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news which we once were maſters of. It is as abſurd in an old man to wiſh for the ſtrength of a youth, as it would be in a young man to wiſh for the ſtrength of a bull or a horſe. Theſe wiſhes are both equally out of nature, which ſhould direct in all things that are not contradictory to juſtice, law, and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Age in a virtuous perſon of either ſex carries in it an authority, which makes it preferable to all the pleaſures of youth. If to be ſaluted, attended, and conſulted with deference, are inſtances of pleaſure, they are ſuch as never fail a virtuous old-age. In the enumeration of the imperfections and advantages of the younger and later years of man, they are ſo near in their condition, that methinks it ſhould be incredible we ſee ſo little commerce of kindneſs between them.</p>
               <p>If we conſider youth and age with Tuſly, regarding the affinity to death, youth has many more chances to be nearer it than age; what youth can ſay, more than an old man, "I ſhall live till night?" Youth catches diſtempers more eaſily, its ſickneſs is more violent, and its recovery more doubtful. The youth, indeed, hopes for many more days; ſo cannot the old man. The youth's hopes are ill grounded; for what is more fooliſh than to place any confidence upon an uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? But the old man has not room ſo much as for hope; he is ſtill happier than the youth; he has already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed

what the other does but hope for: one wiſhes to live long, the other has lived long. But, alas, is there any thing in human life, the duration of which can be called long? There is nothing, which muſt end to be valued for its continuance. It hours, days, months, and years, paſs away, it is no matter what hour, what day, what month, or what year we die. The applauſe of a good actor is due to him at whatever ſcene of the play he makes his <hi>Exit.</hi> It is thus in the life of a man of ſenſe; a ſhort life is ſufficient to manifeſt himſelf a man of honour and virtue; when he ceaſes to be ſuch, he has lived too long; and, while he is ſuch, it is of no conſequence to him how long he ſhall be ſo, provided he is ſo to his life's end.</p>

Such is the condition of life that ſomething is always wanting to happineſs.

               <p>We ſhould caſt all our actions under the diviſion of ſuch as are in themſelves good, bad, or indifferent; and to direct them in ſuch a manner, that every thing we do, may turn to account at that great day when every thing we have done will be ſet before us.</p>
               <p>A good intention, joined to a good action, gives it its proper force and efficacy; joined to an evil action, extenuates its malignity, and in ſome caſes may take it wholly away; and joined to an indifferent action, turns it into a virtue, and makes it meritorious, as far as human actions can be ſo.</p>
               <p>In the next place, to conſider in the ſame manner the influence of an evil intention upon our actions. An evil intention perverts the beſt of actions, and makes them in reality what the fathers have termed the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the heathen world, ſo many <hi>ſhining ſins.</hi> It deſtroys the innocence of an indifferent action; and gives an evil action all poſſible blackneſs and horror,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037099_0042_100C4C4593CC4C60"/>
or, in the emphatical language of holy writ, makes <hi>ſin exceeding ſinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is then of unſpeakable advantage to poſſeſs our minds with an habitual good intention, and to aim all our thoughts, words, and actions at ſome laudable end, whether it be the glory of our maker, the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or the benefit of our own ſouls.</p>

               <p>The chief rule to be obſerved in the exerciſe of this dangerous office of giving ADVICE, is to preſerve it pure from all mixture of <hi>intereſt</hi> or <hi>vanity;</hi> to forbear admonition or reproof when our conſciences tell us that they are incited, not by the hopes of reforming faults, but the deſire of ſhewing our diſcernment, or gratifying our own pride by the mortification of another. It is not indeed certain that the moſt refined caution will find a proper time for bringing a man to the knowledge of his own failings, or the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous benevolence reconcile him to that judgment by which they are detected. But he who endeavours only the happineſs of him whom he reproves, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have either the ſatisfaction of obtaining or deſerving kindneſs: if he ſucceeds, he benefits his friend; and if he fails, he has at leaſt the conſciouſneſs that he ſuffers for only doing well.</p>
               <bibl>RAMBLER.</bibl>
               <p>Advice, as it always gives a temporary appearance of ſuperiority, can never be very grateful, even when it is moſt neceſſary, or moſt judicious; but, for the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037099_0043_100C4C47EE275690"/>
ſame reaſon, every one is eager to inſtruct his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. To be wiſe or to be virtuous, is to buy dignity and importance at a high price: but when nothing is neceſſary to elevation but detection of the follies or the faults of others, no man is ſo inſenſible to the voice of fame as to linger on the ground.</p>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <p>There is nothing which we receive with ſo much reluctance as advice. We look upon the man who gives it us, as offering an affront to our underſtanding, and treating us like children or idiots. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo difficult as the art of making advice agreeable: the pens of the ancients and moderns have been exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this occaſion. How many devices have been made uſe of to render this bitter potion palatable! Some convey their inſtruction to us in the beſt choſen words; others in the moſt harmonious numbers; ſome in points of wit, and others in ſhort proverbs.</p>
               <p>But among all the different ways of giving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that which pleaſes the moſt univerſally, is <hi>fable:</hi> it excels all others, becauſe it is the leaſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore the moſt delicate. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we reflect, that upon the reading of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we are made to believe we adviſe ourſelves. We peruſe the author for the ſake of the ſtory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the precepts rather as our own concluſions than his inſtructions. This is confirmed by the examples of the wiſe men of old, who choſe to give council to their princes in this method; an inſtance of which we have in a <hi>Turkish</hi> tale, which informs us, that the Sultan <hi>Mahamoud,</hi> by his perpetual wars abroad, and his tyranny at home, had filled his dominions with ruin and deſolation, and half unpeopled the <hi>Persian</hi> empire. The Viſier to this cruel Sultan pretended to have learned of a certain Derviſe, to underſtand the language of birds; ſo that there was not a bird that could open his mouth, but the Viſier knew what it ſaid. As he was one evening with the Emperor, in their return from hunting, they ſaw a couple of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037099_0044_100C4C497298DD98"/>
owls upon a tree that grew near an old wall out of a heap of rubbiſh. <hi>I would fain know,</hi> ſays the Sultan, <hi>what these two owls are saying to one another; listen to their discourse, and give me an account of it.</hi> The Viſier approached the tree, pretending to be very attentive to the two owls. Upon his return to the Sultan, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have heard part of their conversation, but dare not tell you what it is.</hi> The Sultan would not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch an anſwer, but forced him to repeat, word for word, every thing the owls had ſaid. <hi>You muſt know then,</hi> ſaid the Viſier, <hi>that one of these owls has a son, and the other a daughter, between whom they are now upon a treaty of marriage. The father of the son said to the father of the daughter, in my hearing: Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I consent to this marriage, provided you will settle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your daughter fifty ruined villages for her portion. To which the father of the daughter replied; instead of fifty, I will give her five hundred, if you please. God grant a long life to Sultan</hi> Mahamoud; <hi>whilst he reigns over us, we shall never want ruined villages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtory ſays, the Sultan was ſo touched with the fable, that he rebuilt the towns and villages which had been deſtroyed, and from that time forward conſulted the good of his people.</p>

Since the circulation of the blood has been found out, and many other great diſcoveries have been made by our modern anatomiſts, we ſee new wonders in the human frame; and diſcern ſeveral important uſes for thoſe parts which the ancients knew nothing of. In ſhort, the body of man is ſuch a ſubject, as ſtands the utmoſt teſt of examination. Though it appears formed with the niceſt wiſdom, upon the moſt ſuperficial ſurvey of it, it ſtill mends upon the ſearch, and produces our ſurpriſe and amazement in proportion as we pry into it.

               <p>When a government flouriſhes in conqueſts, and is ſecure from foreign attacks, it naturally falls into all the pleaſures of luxury; and as theſe pleaſures are very expenſive, they put thoſe who are addicted to them upon raiſing freſh ſupplies of money, by all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of rapaciouſneſs and corruption; ſo that avarice and luxury often become one complicated principle of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in thoſe whoſe hearts are wholly ſet upon eaſe, magnificence and pleaſure.

At ſuch times, men naturally endeavour to outſhine one another in pomp and ſplendor; and having no fears to alarm them from abroad, indulge themſelves in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all they can get in their poſſeſſion; which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally produces avarice, and an immoderate purſuit after wealth and riches.</p>

               <p>And this, ſaid he, putting the remains of a cruſt into his wallet—and this ſhould have been thy portion, ſaid he, hadſt thou been alive to have ſhared it with me. I thought by the accent, it had been an apoſtrophe to his child; but 'twa to his aſs, and to the very aſs we had ſeen dead on the road, which had occaſioned <hi>La Fleur's</hi> miſadventure. The man ſeemed to lament it much; and it inſtantly brought into my mind <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho's</hi> lamentation for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.</p>
               <p>The mourner was ſitting on a ſtone bench at the door, with the aſs's pannel and its bridle on one ſide, which he took up from time to time—then laid them down—look'd at them—and ſhook his head He then took the cruſt of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it ſome time in his hand—then laid it upon the bit of his aſs's bridle—look'd wiſtfully at the little arrangement he had made—and then gave a ſigh.</p>

The ſimplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and <hi>La Fleur</hi> among the reſt, whilſt the horſes were getting ready; as I continued ſitting in the poſt-chaiſe, I could ſee and hear over their heads.</p>
               <p>—He ſaid he had come laſt from <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had been from the furtheſt borders of <hi>Franconia;</hi> and had got ſo far on his return home, when his aſs died. Every one ſeemed deſirous to know what buſineſs could have taken ſo old and poor a man ſo far a journey from his own home.</p>
               <p>It had pleaſed heaven, he ſaid, to bleſs him with three ſons, the fineſt lads in all <hi>Germany:</hi> but having in one week loſt two of them by the ſmall-pox, and the youngeſt falling ill of the ſame diſtemper, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if Heaven would not take <hi>him</hi> from him alſo, he would go in gratitude to <hi>St. Jago,</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the mourner got thus far on his ſtory, he ſtopp'd to pay nature her tribute—and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>He ſaid Heaven had accepted the conditions, and that he had ſet out from his cottage, with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of his journey—that it had eat the ſame bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</p>
               <p>Every body who ſtood about, heard the poor fellow with concern—<hi>La Fleur</hi> offered him money—the mourner ſaid he did not want it—it was not the value of the aſs—but the loſs of him—The aſs, he ſaid, he was aſſured, loved him,—and upon this, told them a long ſtory of a miſchance upon their paſſage over the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> mountains, which had ſeparated them from each other three days: during which time the aſs had ſought him as much as he had ſought the aſs, and they had ſcarce eat or drank till they met.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thou haſt one comfort, friend, ſaid I, at leaſt, in the loſs of the poor beaſt; I'm ſure thou haſt been a merciful maſter to him.</q>—<q>Alas! ſaid the mourner, I thought ſo when he was alive—but now
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037099_0063_100C4C7791A2C540"/>
he is dead, I think otherwiſe.—I fear the weight of myſelf and my afflictions together have been too much for him—they have ſhortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to anſwer for.</q>—Shame on the world! ſaid I to myſelf—Did we love each other but as this poor ſoul lov'd his aſs—'twould be ſomething.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What we fear may not come to paſs. No human ſcheme can be ſo accurately projected, but ſome little circumſtance intervening may ſpoil it. He who directs the heart of man at his pleaſure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the thoughts long before, may, by ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand accidents, or an immediate change in the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of men, diſconcert the moſt ſubtle project, and turn it to the benefit of his own ſervants.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we ſhould conſider, though the evil we imagine, ſhould come to paſs, it may be much more ſupportable than it appeared to be. As there is no proſperous ſtate of life without its calamities, ſo there is no adverſity without its benefits. Aſk the great and powerful, if they do not feel the pangs of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and ambition. Enquire of the poor and needy, if they have not taſted the ſweets of quiet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Even under the pains of body, the infidelity of friends, or the miſconſtructions put upon our lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actions, our minds (when for ſome time accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to theſe preſſures) are ſenſible of ſecret flowings of comfort, the preſent reward of a pious reſignation. The evils of this life appear like rocks and precipices, rugged and barren at a diſtance; but at our nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach we find little fruitful ſpots and refreſhing ſprings, mixed with the harſhneſs and deformities of nature.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, we may comfort ourſelves with this conſideration, that, as the thing feared may not reach
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037099_0064_100C4C7A5845C690"/>
us, ſo we may not reach what we fear. Our lives may not extend to that dreadful point which we have in view. He who knows all our fallings, and will not ſuffer us to be tempted beyond our ſtrength, is often pleaſed, in his tender ſeverity, to ſeparate the ſoul from its body and miſeries together.</p>
               <p>If we look forward to him for help, we ſhall never be in danger of falling down thoſe precipices, which our imagination is apt to create. Like thoſe who walk upon a line, if we keep our eye fixed upon one point, we may ſtep forward ſecurely; whereas an imprudent or cowardly glance on either ſide will infallibly deſtroy us.</p>

               <p>Is a mark of politeneſs. It is univerſally agreed upon, that no one, unadorned with this virtue, can go into company without giving a manifeſt offence. The eaſier or higher any one's fortune is, this duty riſes proportionably. The different nations of the world are as much diſtinguiſhed by their cleanlineſs, as by their arts and ſciences. The more any country is civilized, the more they conſult this part of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We need but compare our ideas of a female Hottentot and an Engliſh beauty, to be ſatisfied of the truth of what hath been advanced.</p>
               <p>In the next place, cleanlineſs may be ſaid to be the foſter mother of love. Beauty indeed moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly produces that paſſion in the mind, but cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs preſerves it. An indifferent face and perſon, kept in perpetual neatneſs, has won many a heart from a pretty ſlattern. Age itſelf is not unamiable, while it is preſerved clean and unſullied: like a piece of metal conſtantly kept ſmooth and bright, we look on it with more pleaſure than on a new veſſel which is cankered with ruſt.</p>
               <p>I might obſerve farther, that, as cleanlineſs renders us agreeable to others, ſo it makes us eaſy to ourſelves;

that it is an excellent preſervative of health; and that ſeveral vices deſtructive both to mind and body, are inconſiſtent with the habit of it.

What is it but cuſtom, that renders many of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of food and ſauces elegant in Britain, which would be aukward and nauſeous to the inhabitants of China, and indeed were nauſeous to us when we firſt taſted them? what but cuſtom could make thoſe ſalutations polite in Muſcovy, which are ridiculous in France and England? We call ourſelves indeed the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter nations: but it is <hi>we</hi> who judge thus of ourſelves; and that fancied politeneſs is oftentimes more owing to cuſtom than reaſon. Why are the forms of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent garments counted beautiful, and thoſe faſhions of our anceſtors the matter of ſcoff and contempt, which in their days, were all decent and genteel? It is cuſtom that forms our opinion of dreſs, and reconciles us by degrees to thoſe habits which at firſt ſeemed very odd and monſtrous. It muſt be granted, there are ſome garments and habits which have a natural congruity or incongruity, modeſty or immodeſty, gaudineſs or gravity; though for the moſt part there is but little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in theſe affairs; but what little there is of reaſon, or natural decency, cuſtom triumphs over it all.

               <head>CONVERSATION.</head>
               <p>The converſation of moſt men is diſagreeable, not ſo much for want of wit and learning, as of good-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>If you reſolve to pleaſe, never ſpeak to gratify any particular vanity or paſſion of your own, but always with a deſign either to divert or inform the company. A man who only aims at one of theſe, is always eaſy in his diſcourſe. He is never out of humour at being interrupted, becauſe he conſiders that thoſe who hear him, are the beſt judges whether what he was ſaying could either divert or inform them.</p>
               <p>A modeſt perſon ſeldom fails to gain the good will of thoſe he converſes with, becauſe nobody envies a man who does not appear to be pleaſed with himſelf.</p>
               <p>We ſhould talk extremely little of ourſelves. Indeed what can we ſay? It would be as imprudent to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our faults, as ridiculous to count over our fancied virtues. Our private and domeſtic affairs are no leſs improper to be introduced in converſation. What does it concern the company how many horſes you keep in your ſtables? Or whether your ſervant is moſt knave or fool?</p>
               <p>A man may equally affront the company he is in by engroſſing all the talk, or obſerving a contemptuous ſilence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:037099_0085_100C4CAC80648278"/>
Before you tell a ſtory, it may be generally not amiſs to draw a ſhort character, and give the company a true idea of the principal perſons concerned in it; the beauty of moſt things conſiſting not ſo much in their being ſaid or done, as in their being ſaid or done by ſuch a particular perſon, or on ſuch a particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all the advantages of youth, few young people pleaſe in converſation; the reaſon is, that want of experience makes them poſitive, and what they ſay is rather with a deſign to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than any one elſe.</p>
               <p>It is certain that age itſelf ſhall make many things paſs well enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much younger.</p>
               <p>Nothing, however, is more inſupportable to men of ſenſe, than an empty formal man who ſpeaks in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, and decides all controverſies with a ſhort ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This piece of ſtupidity is the more inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as it puts on the air of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Whenever you commend, add your reaſons for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo: it is this which diſtinguiſhes the approbation of a man of ſenſe from the flattery of ſycophants, and admiration of fools.</p>
               <p>Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the whole company is pleaſed with it. I would leaſt of all be underſtood to except the perſon rallied.</p>
               <bibl>GUARDIAN.</bibl>
               <p>Obſerve this rule in general; whenſoever it lies in your power to lead the converſation, let it be directed to ſome profitable point of knowledge or practice, ſo far as may be done with decency; and let not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and the hours be ſuffered to run looſe without aim or deſign, and when a ſubject is ſtarted, paſs not haſtily to another, before you have brought the preſent theme of diſcourſe to ſome tolerable iſſue, or a joint conſent to drop it.</p>

               <p>There are thouſands ſo extravagant in their ideas of contentment, as to imagine that it muſt conſiſt in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing in this world turn out the way they wiſh—that they are to ſit down in happineſs, and feel themſelves ſo at eaſe at all points, as to deſire nothing better and nothing more. I own there are inſtances of ſome, who ſeem to paſs through the world as if all their paths had been ſtrewed with roſe buds of delight;—but a little experience will convince us, 'tis a fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to go upon.—We are born to trouble; and we may depend upon it whilſt we live in this world we ſhall have it, though with intermiſſions—that is, in whatever ſtate we are, we ſhall find a mixture of good and evil; and therefore the true way to contentment is to know how to receive theſe certain viciſſitudes of life,—the returns of good and evil, ſo as neither to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by the one, or overthrown by the other, but to bear ourſelves towards every thing which happens with ſuch eaſe and indifference of mind, as to hazard as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as may be. This is the true temperate climate fitted for us by nature, and in which every wiſe man would with to live.</p>

               <p>The foundation of content muſt ſpring up in a man's own mind; and he who has ſo little knowledge of human nature as to ſeek happineſs by changing any thing but his own diſpoſition, will waſte his life in fruitleſs efforts, and multiply the griefs which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to remove.</p>

Enquiries after happineſs, and rules for attaining it, are not ſo neceſſary and uſeful to mankind as the arts of conſolation, and ſupporting one's ſelf under afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The utmoſt we can hope for in this world, is contentment; if we aim at any thing higher, we ſhall meet with nothing but grief and diſappointment A man ſhould direct all his ſtudies and endeavours at making himſelf eaſy now, and happy hereafter.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, if all the happineſs that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the whole race of mankind in this world were drawn together, and put into the poſſeſſion of any ſingle man, it would not make a very happy being: though, on the contrary, if the miſeries of the whole ſpecies were fixed in a ſingle perſon, they would make a very miſerable one.</p>

               <p>A man ſhould always conſider how much he has more than he wants. I am wonderfully pleaſed with the reply which <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> made to one who condoled him upon the loſs of a farm: <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have three farms ſtill, and you have but one; ſo that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me.</hi> On the contrary, fooliſh men are more apt to conſider what they have loſt than what they poſſeſs; and to fix their eyes upon thoſe who are richer than themſelves, rather than on thoſe who are under greater difficulties. All the real pleaſures and conveniences of life lie in a narrow compaſs; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward, and ſtraining after one who has got the ſtart of them in wealth and honour.</p>

               <p>The credulous man is ready to receive every thing for truth, that has but the ſhadow of evidence; every new book that he reads, and every ingenious man with whom he converſes, has power enough to draw him into the ſentiments of the ſpeaker or writer. He has ſo much complaiſance in him, or weakneſs of ſoul,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037099_0097_100C4CC880C017C8"/>
that he is ready to reſign his own opinion to the firſt objection which he hears, and to receive any ſentiments of another that are aſſerted with a poſitive air and much aſſurance. Thus he is under a kind of neceſſity, through the indulgence of this credulous humour, either to be often changing his opinions, or to believe inconſiſtencies.</p>
               <p>The man of contradiction ſtands ready to oppoſe every thing that is ſaid: he gives but a ſlight attention to the reaſons of other men, from an inward ſcornful preſumption, that they have no ſtrength in them. When he reads or hears a diſcourſe different from his own ſentiments, he does not give himſelf leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether that diſcourſe may be true; but employs all his powers immediately to confute it. Your great diſputers, and your men of controverſy, are in contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual danger of this ſort of prejudice: they contend often for victory, and will maintain whatſoever they have aſſerted, while truth is loſt in the noiſe and tumult of reciprocal contradictions; and it frequently happens, that a debate about opinions is turned into a mutual reproach of perſons.</p>
               <bibl>WATTS.</bibl>
               <p>The prejudice of credulity may in ſome meaſure be cured, by learning to ſet a high value upon truth, and by taking more pains to attain it; remembering that truth often lies dark and deep, and requires us to dig for it as hidden treaſure; and that falſhood often puts on a fair diſguiſe, and therefore we ſhould not yield up our judgment to every plauſible appearance. It is no part of civility or good breeding to part with truth, but to maintain it with decency and candor.</p>
               <p>A ſpirit of contradiction is ſo pedantic and hateful, that a man ſhould take much pains with himſelf to watch againſt every inſtance of it: he ſhould learn ſo much good-humour, at leaſt, as never to oppoſe any thing without juſt and ſolid reaſon for it: he ſhould abate ſome degrees of pride and moroſeneſs, which are
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037099_0098_100C4CCC526532B0"/>
never-failing ingredients in this ſort of temper, and ſhould ſeek after ſo much honeſty and conſcience, as never to contend for conqueſt or triumph; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view his own reaſons, and to read the arguments of his opponents, if poſſible, with an equal indifferency, be glad to ſpy a truth, and to ſubmit to it, though it appear on the oppoſite ſide.</p>

               <p>A genealogiſt ſets forth to a prince that he is deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a direct line from a count, whoſe kindred, three or four hundred years ago, had made a family compact with a houſe, the memory of which is extinguiſhed. That houſe had ſome diſtant claim to a province, the laſt proprietor of which died of an apoplexy. The prince and his council inſtantly reſolve that this province belongs to him of divine right. The province, which is ſome hundred leagues from him, proteſts that it does not ſo much as know him; that it is not diſpoſed to be governed by him; that before preſcribing laws to them, their conſent at leaſt was neceſſary: theſe allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not ſo much as reach the prince's ears; it is inſiſted on that his right is inconteſtible. He inſtantly picks up a multitude, who have nothing to do and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to loſe; clothes them with coarſe blue cloth; puts on them hats bound with coarſe white worſted; makes them turn to the right and left; and thus marches away with them to glory.</p>
               <p>Other princes, on this armament, take part in it to the beſt of their ability, and ſoon cover a ſmall extent of country with more hireling murderers, than Gengis Kan, Tamerlane and Bajazet had at their heels.</p>

               <p>Theſe multitudes furiouſly butcher one another not only without having any concern in the quarrel, but without ſo much as knowing what it is about.</p>
               <p>Sometimes five or ſix powers are engaged, three againſt three, two againſt four, ſometimes even one againſt five, all equally deteſting one another, and friends and foes by turns, agreeing only in one thing, to do all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief poſſible.</p>

               <p>Oppreſſed with gloomy melancholy, I threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on my bed, in order to forget what I had ſeen, and ſtill more what I had read. Sleep ſoon invaded my ſenſes. Eternal Juſtice appeared in the ſky to judge the ſons of men. The ſkeleton of Alexander, of Macedon, and that of a robber and murderer, were ſummoned to appear.—"Look, Alexander," ſaid Juſtice, <q>Look upon thy competitor;—this robber wanted only power and ſtrength to equal thee, and he would have made uſe of the ſame means as thou to ravage the world. His courage was as great as thine; but being conſtrained by obſtacles, he was obliged to murder his fellow-creatures by night. Thoſe who attend to ſee my laws put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, were fortunately able to bring him to the ſcaffold; there he confeſſed his crimes, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged he deſerved the moſt ſhameful puniſhment.</q>

fall on thy head. Power ſupported thy iron arm, that cruſhed mankind; thou deſtroyedſt my laws by firing of towns; thou didſt oblige terrified mortals to erect altars to thee; thou didſt ſtab the boſom of friendſhip; the ſcandal of thy victories has led kings aſtray, who, taking example by thee, have been unjuſt. Approach, cruel Caeſar, thou who wept before the ſtatue of this murderer, ambitious of deſerving ſuch another. Nothing could ſtop thy career, neither the genius of Rome, nor the tears of thy country. Armed with a poniard, thou ſtabbedſt her whilſt ſhe invited thee to her arms. Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyedſt the wiſdom of ſix ages of glory, in order to eſtabliſh on their ruins horrible deſpotiſm. Get thee gone, thy name begins to be as deteſtable as thoſe of Tamerlane, Attila, Charles the XIIth, and Gengiſkan.—Wiſe men have proſcribed their odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive genius; it is only the blind mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude who are ſtill ſeduced, and who, in their low ideas, cannot diſcriminate between the powerful criminal who eſcapes puniſhment, and the obſcure guilty who ſuffers juſtly.</p>
                  <p>Princes, conquerors, generals, warriors, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pompous titles you bear, vile ambitious wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, bloody men, ſhudder!—You have accuſtomed mankind to deſtroy each other; you have made war an habitual ſcourge, and ever growing trade; you have dared to embelliſh murder with the pompous name of glory; it is you, undoubtedly, will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the crimes you have made them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;—but who ever comes to offer you the hand ſtained with blood, he that could put a ſtop to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or avoid being an accomplice in it, or has been a volunteer to ſerve your wrathful purpoſes for baſe intereſt; he, I ſay, will be as guilty as yourſelves. By what authority dare a mortal inflict death? Does not his exiſtence belong to God who created him? Deſtruction is an outrage againſt the Divine Being.

Shudder, cruel murderers, in my preſence! nothing can excuſe you; the blood of your brethren cries aloud for vengeance. Even he who is ſtained with only one bloody ſpot, ſhall be tormented ſeveral ages by the devouring fire of repentance. You will ſtill even ſob with ſorrow, when the clemency of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God will vouchſafe to abſolve you; for I muſt tell you, that ſtain is indelible.</p>
                  <p>Your motive was to merit the admiration of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages. Well, you are condemned to ſuffer until that happy period when an enlightened people will execrate war and thoſe who light the horrible torch. Alexander! thy name muſt be held in deteſtation over all that country where thou wouldſt be deified; all thoſe who followed thy example muſt be ranked among the profligate villains before thou canſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any forgiveneſs.—May this time not be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant as the reparation of thy crimes would require!—Suffer patiently; you already begin to be deteſtable; thy exploits already begin to be looked upon as barbarous and unjuſt; wiſe men have ſtampt with diſgrace thy impious imitators.</p>

Deſpotiſm delights in war. It is its element. As the bull knows, by inſtinct, that his ſtrength is in his horns, and the eagle truſts in his talons; ſo the deſpot feels his puiſſance moſt, when ſurrounded by his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery arrayed for battle. With the ſword in his hand, and his artillery around him, he rejoices in his might, and glories in his greatneſs. Blood muſt mark his path; and his triumph is incomplete, till death and deſtruction ſtalk over the land, the harbingers of his triumphant cavalcade.</p>

When men high in command, men of fortune and family, fall, their deeds are blazoned, and they figure in hiſtory; but who, ſave the poor widow and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, enquire after the very names of the rank and file? There they lie, a maſs of human fleſh, not ſo much regretted by the deſpots as the horſes they rode, or the arms they bore. While ſhips often go down to the bottom, ſtruck by the iron thunderbolts of war, and not a life is ſaved; the national loſs is eſtimated by the deſpot, according to the weight of metal waſted, and the magnitude and expence of the wooden caſtle.</p>

               <p>In all diſputes between the people and their rulers, the preſumption is at leaſt upon a par in favor of the people. Experience may perhaps juſtify me in going farther. Where popular diſcontents have been very prevalent, it may well be affirmed and ſupported, that there has been generally ſomething found amiſs in the conſtitution or in the conduct of government. The people have no intereſt in diſorder. When they do wrong, it is their error and not their crime. But with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party of the ſtate it is far otherwiſe. They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may act ill by deſign as well as by miſtake. <q>The revolutions which occur in great ſtates, are not the effect of chance or the caprice of the people. Nothing diſguſts the grandees of a kingdom ſo much as a weak or deranged government. But the people never revolt through a thirſt of innovation, but through impatience of ſuffering.</q> Theſe are the words of a great man; of a miniſter of ſtate [Sully] and a zealous aſſerter of monarchy. What he ſays of revolutions is equally true of all great diſturbances.</p>

Far from any reſemblance to thoſe propoſitions in geometry and metaphyſics, which admit no medium, but muſt be true or falſe in all their latitude; ſocial and civil freedom, like all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in common life, are variouſly mixed and modified, enjoyed in very different degrees, and ſhaped

                  </gap>, I <hi>meet anxiouſly diſſuade</hi> all who love mankind and their country. Faction and violence are deſpotic in the extreme. They bring all the evils of tyranny, without any conſolation, but that they are uſually tranſient; whereas tyranny is durable. They deſtroy themſelves, or, are deſtroyed by force in the hands of a ſuperior power. In either caſe, much is <hi>loſt</hi> to the cauſe of liberty; becauſe the perſons who have been betrayed by their paſſions into exceſſes, were probably <hi>ſincere;</hi> and if they had been alſo <hi>diſcreet</hi> and moderate, would have been effectual as well as zealous promoters of the public good. It is certain, that very honeſt men are very apt to be betrayed into violence by their warmth of temper. They mean good and do ill. They become the inſtruments of diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate knaves; and are often led into extravagances by the very party againſt whom they act, in order that they may be expoſed, and become obnoxious to cenſure.</p>
               <p>Wiſdom is gentle, deliberate, cautious. Nothing violent is durable. I hope the lovers of liberty will ſhew the ſincerity of their attachment by the wiſdom of their conduct. Tumultuary proceedings always exhibit ſome appearance of inſanity. A blow ſtruck with blind violence may inflict a wound or a bruiſe, but it may fall in the wrong place; it may even injure the hand that gives it, by its own ill-directed force.</p>

A treacherous friend is the moſt dangerous enemy; and both religion and virtue have received more real diſcredit from hypocrites, than the wittieſt profligates, or infidels could ever caſt upon them; nay, farther, as theſe two in their purity, are rightly called the bands of civil ſociety, and are indeed the greateſt of bleſſings; ſo when poiſoned and corrupted with fraud, pretence, and affectation, they have become the worſt of civil cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and have enabled men to perpetrate the moſt cruel miſchiefs to their own ſpecies.</p>

               <p>The firmneſs and conſtancy of a true friend is a circumſtance ſo extremely delightful to perſons in any kind of diſtreſs, that the diſtreſs itſelf, (if it be only temporary, and admit of relief) is more than compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated, by bringing this comfort with it.</p>

               <p>So many qualities are neceſſary to the poſſibility of friendſhip, and ſo many accidents muſt concur to its riſe and its continuance, that the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind content themſelves without it, and ſupply its place as they can with intereſt and dependence.</p>
               <bibl>RAMBLER.</bibl>
               <p>Many have talked in very exalted language of the perpetuity of friendſhip: of invincible conſtancy and unalienable kindneſs; and ſome examples have been ſeen of men who have continued faithful to their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt choice, and whoſe affections have predominated over changes of fortune and contrariety of opinion. But theſe inſtances are memorable, becauſe they are rare. The friendſhip which is to be practiſed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by common mortals, muſt take its riſe from mutual pleaſure, and muſt end when the power ceaſes of delighting each other.</p>

complaint, and too numerous for removal. Thoſe who are angry may be reconciled. Thoſe who have been injured may receive a recompenſe; but when the deſire of pleaſing, and willingneſs to be pleaſed, is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently diminiſhed, the renovation of friendſhip is hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; as when the vital powers ſink into languor, there is no longer any uſe of the phyſician.</p>

               <p>There are few ſubjects which have been more writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon, and leſs underſtood, than that of friendſhip. To follow the dictates of ſome, this virtue, inſtead of being the aſſuager of pain, becomes the ſource of every inconvenience. Such ſpeculatiſts, by expecting too much from friendſhip, diſſolve the connection, and, by drawing the bands too cloſely, at length break them. Almoſt all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they perſuade us to friendſhips, which we find impoſſible to ſuſtain to the laſt; ſo that this ſweetner of life, under proper regulations, is by their means, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered inacceſſible or uneaſy. It is certain, the beſt method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it, in ſome meaſure, make itſelf; a ſimilitude of minds or ſtudies, and even ſometimes a diverſity of purſuits, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all the pleaſures that ariſe from it. The current of tenderneſs widens, as it proceeds; and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good-nature for each other, when they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Friendſhip is like a debt of honour; the moment it is talked of, it loſes its real name, and aſſumes the more ungrateful form of obligation. From hence we find, that thoſe who regularly undertake to cultivate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings, which dependence gathers round us, is almoſt ever unfriendly: they ſecretly wiſh the term of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the moſt virtue, are prepared to reſerve all their affections for their patron, only in the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037099_0145_100C4D3496EA8BF0"/>
hour of this decline. Increaſing the obligations which are laid upon ſuch minds, only increaſes their burthen; they feel themſelves unable to repay the immenſity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent reſentment at the hand that is ſtretched out with offers of ſervice and relief.</p>

Muſt real tragedies be forever act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſtage of human life? Muſt men go on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be tormentors and executioners of men?

Taxes on <hi>neceſſaries</hi> are uſually cauſed by war. The poor, however, are not eaſily excited to inſurrection. It is a baſe calumny which accuſes them. They are naturally quieſcent; inclined to ſubmiſſion by their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and willing to reverence all their ſuperiors who behave to them juſtly and kindly. They deſerve to be uſed well. They deſerve confidence. But oppreſſion and perſecution may teach them to lift their gigantic arm, and then vain will be reſiſtance. Let not wars then be wantonly undertaken, which, beſides their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and inhumanity, tend more than any thing elſe, by increaſing taxes, to compel inſurrection. The poor man hears great praiſes beſtowed on the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he lives under, and perpetual panegyrics on the conſtitution. He knows little of general politics.

               <p>By the force of habit, and inveterate national preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, abuſes are rendered ſacred, and not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, come to be conſidered as rightful privileges; and thoſe inſtitutions, which were the offſpring of chance or violence, to be extolled as the moſt perfect produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reaſon, ſounded in the original and unalterable principles of nature. Such was the Britiſh government, and ſuch has been the force of habitual prejudice upon the people of that kingdom. That government has, indeed, received many improvements, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of the age; but they have generally been wreſted by force from the reigning powers, or interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a revolution of the crown. Many reſpectable characters long conſidered them as ſo many violations of the moſt ſacred rights. The greater part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:037099_0159_100C4D55A4A38828"/>
appear fully perſuaded, that all farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are impracticable, and that becauſe their gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment was once the beſt, perhaps, which exiſted in the world, it muſt, through all the progreſſive advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in knowledge, in morals, and in manners, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the beſt, a pattern of unchanging perfection, though, in its principles, it is much too limited for the preſent ſtate. It is probable that all improvements in the government, will be oppoſed and prevented by thoſe in power, who are intereſted in the preſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, till the improvements of an enlightened age, ſhall produce a violent concuſſion in the combat with ancient prejudices, and ſtruggle through a ſcene of tumult, outrage, and perhaps civil war, to arrive at ſome inconſiderable amelioration, in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>The government of the United States of America exhibits a new ſcene in the political hiſtory of the world; a number of integral republics, each claiming and exerciſing all the powers of internal ſovereignty, within the limits of their reſpective juriſdictions, formed into one general government, with powers of legiſlation for all national purpoſes, and the power of executing all their laws, within the ſeveral ſtates, on the individual citizens, and that independently of the local authority. The experiment was new, and the ſucceſs has, hitherto, exceeded the moſt ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of its advocates. A ſituation ſo complicated, ſo different from that of ſimple governments, which have been the ſubject of theſe ſketches, will have an effect, if not upon the laws of nature, from which the general principles are ultimately derived, yet to give a different modification to thoſe principles, owing to the different combinations and relative circumſtances of the conſtituent parts; and will have an influence on its organization, and the execution of its laws.</p>

               <p>There are two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orts of people in the world, who with equal degrees of health and wealth, and the other comforts of life, become the one happy, and the other miſerable. This ariſes very much from the different views in which they conſider things, perſons, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; and the effect of thoſe different views upon their own minds.</p>
               <p>In whatever ſituation men can be placed, they may find conveniencies and inconveniencies: in whatever company, they may find perſons and converſation more or leſs pleaſing: at whatever table, they may meet with meats and drinks of better and worſe taſte, diſhes better and worſe dreſſed: in whatever climate, they will find good and bad weather: under whatever gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, they may find good and bad laws, and good and bad adminiſtration of thoſe laws: in whatever po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, or work of genius, they may ſee faults and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: in almoſt every face, and every perſon, they may diſcover fine features and defects, good and bad qualities.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances, the two ſorts of people above-mentioned, fix their attention—thoſe who are diſpoſed to be happy, on the conveniencies of things, the pleaſant parts of converſation, the well dreſſed diſhes, the goodneſs of the wines, the fine weather, &amp;c. and enjoy all with chearfulneſs. Thoſe who are to be unhappy, think and ſpeak only of the contraries. Hence they are continually diſcontented themſelves,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:037099_0173_100C4D799A240058"/>
and, by their remarks, four the pleaſures of ſociety; offend perſonally many people, and make themſelves every where diſagreeable. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, ſuch unhappy perſons would be the more to be pitied. But as the diſpoſition to criticiſe, and to be diſguſted, is perhaps taken up originally by imitation, and is, unawares, grown into a habit, which, though at preſent ſtrong, may nevertheleſs be cured, when thoſe who have it are convinced of its bad effects on their felicity: I hope this little admonition may be of ſervice to them, and put them on changing a habit, which, though in the exerciſe it is chiefly an act of imagination, yet has ſerious conſequences in life, as it brings on real griefs and misfortunes. For as many are offended by, and nobody loves this ſort of people; no one ſhews them more than the moſt common civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſpect, and ſcarcely that; and this frequently puts them out of humour, and draws them into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and contentions. If they aim at obtaining ſome advantage in rank or fortune, nobody wiſhes them ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or will ſtir a ſtep, or ſpeak a word to favour their pretenſions. If they incur public cenſure or diſgrace, no one will defend or excuſe, and many join to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their miſconduct, and render them completely odious: if theſe people will not change this bad habit, and condeſcend to be pleaſed with what is pleaſing, without fretting themſelves and others about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, it is good for others to avoid an acquaintance with them; which is always diſagreeable, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very inconvenient, eſpecially when one finds one's ſelf entangled in their quarrels.</p>
               <p>An old philoſophical friend of mine was grown from experience, very cautious in this particular, and carefully avoided any intimacy with ſuch people. He had, like other philoſophers, a thermometer to ſhew him the heat of the weather; and a barometer, to mark when it was likely to prove good or bad; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037099_0174_100C4D7B1DEA10D8"/>
no inſtrument invented to diſcover, at firſt ſight, this unpleaſing diſpoſition in a perſon, he, for that purpoſe, made uſe of his legs; one of which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably handſome, the other, by ſome accident, crooked and deformed. If a ſtranger, at the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, regarded his ugly leg more than his handſome one, he doubted him. If he ſpoke of it, and took no notice of the handſome leg, that was ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my philoſopher to have no further acquaintance with him. Every body has not this two legged inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but every one, with a little attention, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſigns of that carping, fault-finding diſpoſition, and take the ſame reſolution of avoiding the acquaintance of thoſe infected with it. I therefore adviſe thoſe critical, querulous, diſcontented, unhappy people, that if they wiſh to be reſpected and beloved by others, and happy in themſelves, they ſhould <hi>leave off looking at the ugly leg.</hi>

God made no diſtinction of perſons; but behold a being, born to a ſceptre, though a poor, puny, ſhivering mortal like the reſt, preſumes to ſell, and let out for hire, theſe images of God, to do the work of butchers, in any cauſe, and for any pay-maſter, on any number of unoffending fellow creatures, who are ſtanding up in defence of their hearths, their altars, their wives, their children, and their liberty. Great numbers of men, trained to the trade of human butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are conſtantly ready to be let to hire, to carry on the work of deſpotiſm, and to ſupport, by the money they earn in this helliſh employment, the luxurious vices of the wretch who calls them his property. Can that ſtate of human affairs be right and proper, which permits a miſcreant, ſcarcely worthy the name of a man, ſunk in effeminacy, the ſlave of vice, often the moſt abominable kind of vice, ignorant and illiterate, debilitated with diſeaſe, weak in body as in mind, to have ſuch dominion over hundreds of thouſands, his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors by nature, as to let them out for pay, to murder the innocent ſtranger in cold blood?</p>

As pride is ſometimes hid under humility, idleneſs is often covered by turbulence and hurry. He that neglects his known duty, and real employment, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally endeavors to croud his mind with ſomething that may bar out the remembrance of his own folly, and does any thing but what he ought to do, with eager diligence, that he may keep himſelf in his own favor.</p>

               <p>There is no virtue ſo truly great and god-like as juſtice. Moſt of the other virtues are the virtues of created beings, or accommodated to our nature as we are men. Juſtice is that which is practiſed by God himſelf, and to be practiſed in its perfection by none but him. Omniſcience and Omnipotence are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the full exertion of it. The one to diſcover every degree of uprightneſs in thoughts, words, and actions. The other, to meaſure out and impart ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rewards and puniſhments.</p>
               <p>As, to be perfectly juſt is an attribute in the divine nature, to be ſo to the utmoſt of our abilities is the glory of man.

               <p>When a nation once loſes its regard to juſtice; when they do not look upon it as ſomething venerable, holy, and inviolable; when any of them dare preſume to leſſen, affront or terrify thoſe who have the diſtribution of it in their hands; when a judge is capable of being influenced by any thing but law, or a cauſe may be recommended by any thing that is foreign to its own merits, we may venture to pronounce that ſuch a nation is haſtening to its ruin.</p>
               <p>I always rejoice when I ſee a tribunal filled with a man of an upright and inflexible temper, who, in the execution of his country's laws, can overcome all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fear, reſentment, ſolicitation, and even pity itſelf. Whenever paſſion enters into a ſentence or deciſion, ſo far will there be in it a tincture of injuſtice.

               <p>Nothing is more unjuſt than to judge of a man by too ſhort an acquaintance, and too ſlight inſpection; for it often happens, that in the looſe and thoughtleſs, and diſſipated, there is a ſecret radical worth, which may ſhoot out by proper cultivation. That the ſpark of heaven, though dimmed and obſtructed, is yet not extinguiſhed, but may, by the breath of counſel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation be kindled into a flame. To imagine that every one who is not completely good, is irrevocably abandoned, is to ſuppoſe that all are capable of the ſame degree of excellence; it is, indeed, to exact from all, that perfection which none ever can attain. And ſince the pureſt virtue is conſiſtent with ſome vice, and the virtue of the greateſt number, with almoſt an equal proportion of contrary qualities, let none too haſtily conclude that all goodneſs is loſt, though it may for a time be clouded and overwhelmed; for moſt minds are the ſlaves of external circumſtances; and conform to any hand that undertakes to mould them, roll down any torrent of cuſtom in which they happen to be caught, or bend to any importunity that bears hard againſt them.</p>

               <p>It may be ſaid, that a too great jealouſy of liberty is equally dangerous with a too great confidence; that as the latter may plunge us into ſlavery, the former may into anarchy: I ſhould allow ſome weight to this objection, if in the whole courſe of our hiſtory, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutation, in a ſingle inſtance, could be produced of theſe poſitions; that the ſpirit of liberty is ſlow to act, even

I muſt therefore repeat that the keeping alive the jealous ſpirit of liberty is a common cauſe; that a deteſtation of tyrants, or even of thoſe who lean to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, is inſeparable from this ſpirit; that Charles the Firſt was a tyrant in principle and in action; that thoſe who labour to reconcile us to his conduct and character, would deſtroy the ſpirit of liberty, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately eſtabliſh the principle of non-reſiſtance; that a junto of mercenaries and court retainers do labour to theſe purpoſes; that it is, therefore, the duty of every common citizen, who has the intereſt of his country at heart, to exert continually whatever force he has to defeat their purpoſes; or, at leaſt, weaken their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for in mechanics, the ſmalleſt force continually applied will overcome the moſt violent motions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to bodies.</p>

Kings who have weak underſtandings, bad hearts, and ſtrong prejudices, and all theſe, as it often happens, inflamed by their paſſions, and rendered incurable by their ſelf-conceit and preſumption; ſuch kings are apt to imagine, and they conduct themſelves ſo as to make many of their ſubject; imagine, that the king and the people in free governments are rival powers, who ſtand in competition with one another, who have different intereſts, and muſt of courſe have different views: that the rights and privileges of the people are ſo many ſpoils taken from the rights and prerogative of the crown; and that the rules and laws, made for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and ſecurity of the former, are ſo many diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their dignity, and reſtraints on their power. A patriot king will ſee all this in a far different and much truer light. He will make one and but one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between his rights and thoſe of the people: he will look on his to be a truſt, and theirs a property; and that his people who had an original right to the whole by the law of nature, can have the ſole indefea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible right to any part.—</p>

               <p>Inſtead of wondering that ſo many kings, unfit and unworthy to be truſted with the government of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, appear in the world, I have been tempted to wonder that there are any tolerable, when I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the flattery that environs them moſt commonly from the cradle, and the tendency of all thoſe falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are inſtilled into them by precept and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by the habits of courts, and by the intereſted ſelfiſh views of courtiers. They are bred to eſteem themſelves of a diſtinct and ſuperior ſpecies among men, as men are among animals.</p>
               <p>Louis the Fourteenth was a ſtrong inſtance of the effect of this education, which trains up kings to be tyrants, without knowing that they are ſo. That op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion under which he kept his people, during the whole courſe of a long reign, might proceed, in ſome degree, from the natural haughtineſs of his temper; but it proceeded, in a greater degree, from the principles and habits of his education. By this he had been brought to look on his kingdom as a patrimony that deſcended to him from his anceſtors, and that was to be conſidered in no other light: ſo that when a very conſiderable man had diſcourſed to him at large of the miſerable condition to which his people was reduced, and had frequently uſed this word, <hi>l'etat,</hi> [the ſtate;] though the king approved the ſtubſtance of all he had ſaid, yet he was ſhocked at the frequent repetition of this word, and complained of it as of a kind of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to himſelf.</p>

This capital error, in which almoſt every prince is confirmed by his education, has ſo great extent and ſo general influence, that a right to do every thing iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in government may be derived from it. But, as if this was not enough, the characters of princes are ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many more ways by their education.</p>

Incircled by corrupters, knaves, and hypocrites, they accuſtom themſelves to look upon their fellow creatures with diſdain, and to ſet no value on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the ſycophants, who careſs their vices, and live in perpetual inactivity and idleneſs.

               <p>Louis XIV. at once the greateſt and meaneſt of mankind, would have excelled all the monarchs in the univerſe, if he had not been corrupted in his youth by baſe and ambitious flatterers. A ſlave during his whole life to pride and vain glory, he never in reality loved his ſubjects even for a moment; yet expected at the ſame time, like a true deſpotic prince, that they ſhould ſacrifice themſelves to his will and pleaſure. Intoxicated with power and grandeur, he imagined the whole world was created ſolely to promote his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He was ſeared, obeyed, idolized, hated, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and abandoned. He lived like a ſultan, and died like a woman.</p>
               <p>It is therefore impoſſible there ſhould ever be a great man among our kings, who are made brutes and fools of all their lives, by a ſet of infamous wretches who ſurround and beſet them from the cradle to the grave.</p>

The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has anſwered beyond conception. They flouriſh infinitely.

They who are honoured with this mark of diſtinction are called knights, and the king himſelf is always the head of the order.

In ſhort, while an European king has a yard of blue or green ribbon left, he need be under no apprehenſion of wanting ſtateſmen, generals, and ſoldiers.</p>

               <p>Thoſe who are poſſeſſed of exorbitant power, who pant for its extenſion, and tremble at the apprehenſion of loſing it, are always ſufficiently artful to dwell with emphaſis, on the evils of licentiouſneſs; under which opprobrious name, they wiſh to ſtigmatize liberty. They deſcribe the horrors of anarchy and confuſion, in the blackeſt colors; and boldly affirm, that they are the neceſſary conſequences of entruſting the people with power. Indeed, they hardly condeſcend to recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the idea of the people; but whenever they ſpeak of the maſs of the community, denominate them the mob, the rabble or the ſwiniſh multitude. Language is at a loſs for appellatives, ſignificant of their contempt for thoſe who are undiſtinguiſhed by wealth or titles, and is obliged to content itſelf with ſuch words as reptiles, ſcum, dregs, or the many-headed monſter.</p>
               <bibl>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</bibl>
               <p>Licentiouſneſs and deſpotiſm are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that one is the licentiouſneſs of great men, and the other the licentiouſneſs of little men; or that by one, the perſons and property of a people are ſubject to outrage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion from a king, or a lawleſs body of grandees; and that by the other, they are ſubject to the like outrages from a lawleſs mob. In avoiding one of theſe evils, mankind have often run into the other. But all well-conſtituted governments guard equally againſt both.
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:037099_0225_100C4DD30B5C2460"/>
Indeed of the two, the laſt is, on ſeveral accounts, the leaſt to be dreaded, and has done the leaſt miſchief. It may truly be ſaid, if licentiouſneſs has deſtroyed its thouſands, deſpotiſm has deſtroyed its millions. The former having little power, and no ſyſtem to ſupport it, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſſarily finds its own remedy; and a people ſoon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it. But a deſpotiſm, wearing a form of government, and being armed with its force, is an evil not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered without dreadful ſtruggles. It goes on from age to age, debaſing the human faculties, levelling all diſtinctions, and preying on the rights and bleſſings of ſociety. It deſerves to be added, that in a ſtate diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by licentiouſueſs, there is an animation which is favourable to the human mind, and puts it upon exerting its powers; but in a ſtate habituated to deſpotiſm, all is ſtill and torpid. A dark and ſavage tyranny ſtifles every effort of genius, and the mind loſes all its ſpirit and dignity.</p>

               <p>The liberty of the preſs is eſſential to the ſecurity of freedom in a ſtate: it ought therefore to be inviolably preſerved.</p>
               <bibl>Conſtitution of NEW-HAMPSHIRE.</bibl>
               <p>The people have a right to freedom of ſpeech, and of writing and publiſhing their ſentiments, concerning the tranſactions of government—and therefore the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs ought not to be reſtrained.</p>

               <p>As long as there are ſuch things as printing and writing, there will be libels: it is an evil ariſing out of a much greater good.—However it does not follow that the preſs is to be ſunk for the errors of the preſs:—for it is certainly of much leſs conſequence that an innocent man ſhould now and then be aſperſed than that all men ſhould be enſlaved.</p>
               <p>Many methods have been tried to remedy this evil. In Turkey and the Eaſtern monarchies, all printing is forbid; which does it with a witneſs; for if there can be no printing at all, there can be no libels printed; and by the ſame reaſon there ought to be no talking, leſt the people ſhould talk treaſon, blaſphemy, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; and for a ſtronger reaſon yet, no preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the orator has an opportunity of haranguing often to a larger auditory than he can perſuade to read his lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations: but I deſire it may be remembered, that there is neither liberty, arts, ſciences, learning, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in theſe countries.</p>
               <p>But another method has been thought on in theſe weſtern parts of the world, much leſs effectual, and yet more miſchievous than the former, namely, to put
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:037099_0230_100C4E10CF8269C8"/>
the preſs under the protection of the prevailing party, and authoriſe libels on one ſide only, and deny the other ſide the opportunity of defending themſelves.</p>
               <p>What miſchief is done by libels to balance all theſe evils? They ſeldom or never annoy an innocent man, or promote any conſiderable error, Wiſe and honeſt men laugh at them, and deſpiſe them, and ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows always fly over their heads, or fall at their feet. Moſt of the world take part with a virtuous man, and puniſh c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lumny by their deteſtation of it. The beſt way to prevent libels is not to deſerve them. Guilty men alone fear them, or are hurt by them, whoſe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions will not bear examination, and therefore muſt not be examined. 'Tis fact alone which annoys them; for if you tell no truth, I dare ſay you may have their leave to tell as many lies as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame is true in ſpeculative opinions. You may write nonſenſe and folly as long as you think fit, and no one complains of it but the bookſeller. But if a bold, honeſt, and wiſe book ſallies forth, and attacks thoſe who think themſelves ſecure in their trenches, then their camp is in danger, and they call out all hands to arms, and their enemy is to be deſtroyed by fire, ſword, or fraud. But 'its ſenſeleſs to think that any truth can ſuffer by being thoroughly ſearched, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined into; or that the diſcovery of it can prejudice right religion, equal government, or the happineſs of ſociety in any reſpect: ſhe has ſo many advantages above er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that ſhe wants only to be ſhown to gain admiration and eſteem; and we ſee every day that ſhe breaks the bonds of tyranny and fraud, and ſhines through the miſts of ſuperſtition and ignorance: and what then would ſhe do, if theſe barriers were removed, and her fetters taken off?</p>

               <p>It is apprehended, that arbitary power would ſteal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its progreſs, and were there not an eaſy method of conveying the

The ſpirit of the people muſt frequently be rouſed, in order to curb the ambition of the court, and the dread of rouſing this ſpirit muſt be employed to prevent that ambition. Nothing is ſo effectual to this purpoſe as the liberty of the preſs, by which all the learning, wit and genius of the nation may be employed on the ſide of freedom, and every one be animated to its defence. As long therefore as the republican part of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can maintain itſelf againſt the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the preſs open, as of importance to its own preſervation.</p>

When I reflect upon man; and take a view of that dark ſide of him which repreſents his life as open to ſo many cauſes of trouble—when I conſider how oft we eat the bread of affliction, and that we are born to it, as to the portion of our inheritance—when one runs over the catalogue of all the croſs reckonings and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful items with which the heart of man is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden reſources the mind is enabled to ſtand it out, and bear itſelf up as it does, againſt the impoſitions laid upon our nature.</p>

               <p>Men are gregarious in their nature; they form to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſociety, not merely from neceſſity, to avoid the evils of ſolitude, but from inclination and mutual attachment. They find a poſitive pleaſure in yielding aſſiſtance to each other, in communicating their thoughts and improving their faculties. This diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in man is the ſource of morals; they have their foundation in nature, and receive their nouriſhment from ſociety. The different portions of this ſociety, that call themſelves nations, have generally eſtabliſhed the principle of ſecuring to the individuals who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a nation, the excluſive enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour; reſerving however to the governing power the right to reclaim from time to time ſo much of the property and labour of individuals as ſhall be deemed neceſſary for the public ſervice.

Perhaps in a more improved ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, the time will come, when a different ſyſtem may be introduced; when it ſhall be found more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial to the ſocial nature of man to exclude the idea of ſeparate property, and with that the numerous evils which ſeem to be entailed upon it.</p>

What is the life or the limb of a poor man, in their opinion? Not ſo much as the life or limb of a favorite pointer or race-horſe. They are always eager to augment the army. They would build barracks in every part of the country, and be glad to ſee a free country over-run, like ſome of the enſlaved nations of the continent, from eaſt to weſt, from north to ſouth, with men armed to overawe the ſaucy advocates of charters, privileges, rights, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations.</p>

This they completely effect with a weak and credulous maſter, nor can the moſt cautious and penetrating elude their machinations.</p>
               <p>Miniſters become a ſort of miniature kings in their turn. The king has been uſed to hear thoſe things only which were adapted to give him pleaſure, and it is with a grating and uneaſy ſenſation that he liſtens to communications of a different ſort. He has been uſed to unheſitating compliance; and it is with difficulty he can digeſt expoſtulation and oppoſition. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriſing politician expects the ſame pliability in others that he exhibits in himſelf; and the fault which he can leaſt forgive is an ill timed and inauſpicious ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity.</p>
               <p>Expecting this compliance from all the coadjutors and inſtruments of his deſigns, he ſoon comes to ſet it up as a ſtandard by which to judge of the merits of all other men. He is deaf to every recommendation but that of a fitneſs for the ſecret ſervice of government, or a tendency to promote his intereſt, and extend the ſphere of his influence. The worſt man with this argument
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:037099_0246_100C4E203A10C6D0"/>
in his favor will ſeem worthy of encouragement; the beſt man who has no advocate but virtue to plead for him will be treated with ſuperciliouſneſs and neglect.—To obtain honor, it will be neceſſary to pay a ſervile court to adminiſtration, to bear with unaltered patience their contumely and ſcorn, to flatter their vices, and render ourſelves uſeful to their private gratification. To obtain honors, it will be neceſſary, by aſſiduity and intrigue, to make to ourſelves a party, to procure the recommendation of lords and the good word of women of pleaſure and clerks in office. To obtain honor, it will be neceſſary to merit diſgrace. The whole ſcene conſiſts in hollowneſs, duplicity, and falſehood. The miniſter ſpeaks fair to the man he deſpiſes, and the ſlave pretends a generous attachment, while he thinks of nothing but his perſonal intereſt.</p>

               <p>If you aſk me where to look for thoſe beautiful ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning qualities of prime miniſters and the great favorites of princes, that are ſo finely painted in dedications, addreſſes, epitaphs, funeral ſermons, and inſcriptions? I anſwer, there, and no where elſe. Where would you look for the excellency of a ſtatue, but in that part which you ſee of it? It is the poliſhed outſide only that has the ſkill and labour of the ſculptor to boaſt of; what is out of ſight is untouched. Would you break the head or cut open the breaſt to look for the brains or the heart, you would only ſhew your ignorance and deſtroy the workmanſhip. This has often made me compare the virtues of great men to your large china jars; they make a fine ſhow, and are ornamental to a chimney; one would, by the bulk they appear in, and the value that is ſet upon them, think they might be very uſeful, but look into a thouſand of them, and you will find nothing but duſt and cobwebs.</p>

any ill action he is ſtill prompted to it; accordingly the ambition of a prince is never ſo dangerous as baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul in his counſellers.</p>

               <p>No man is nobler born than another, unleſs he is born with better abilities and a more amiable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They who make ſuch a parade with their family pictures and pedigrees, are, properly ſpeaking, rather to be called <hi>noted</hi> or <hi>notorious</hi> than <hi>noble</hi> perſons. I thought it right to ſay this much, in order to repel the inſolence of men who depend entirely upon chance and accidental circumſtances for diſtinction, and not at all on public ſervices and perſonal merit.</p>
               <bibl>SENECA.</bibl>
               <p>Virtue is nobility. Perſonal merit, uſeful, generous, benevolent exertion, the only honorable diſtinction. The trappings which every taylor can make to clothe a poor puny mortal, add no real dignity. In ages of ignorance, they might ſtrike with awe. Thoſe ages are no more. Nor will they ever return, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the efforts of petty deſpots, (fearing the loſs of thoſe diſtinctions which they know they never earned,) to keep the people in the groſſeſt ignorance.</p>
               <p>God Almighty, who gives his ſun to ſhine with as much warmth and radiance on the cottage as on the palace, has diſpenſed the glorious privilege of genius and virtue to the poor and middle claſſes, with a bounty perhaps ſeldom experienced in any of the proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to hereditary or official grandeur. Let us call to mind a few among the worthies who have adorned the ages that have elapſed: Socrates; was he <hi>noble</hi> in the ſenſe of a king at arms? Would he have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to be bedizened with ribands, and ſtars, and garters? Cicero; was he not a <hi>novus homo?</hi> a man unconnected with patricians, and deriving his glory
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:037099_0249_100C4DF166AB79A0"/>
from the pureſt fountain of honor, his own genius and virtue? Demoſthenes would have ſcorned to owe his eſtimation to a pedigree.</p>

               <p>The greateſt ſcholars, poets, orators, philoſophers, warriors, ſtateſmen, inventors and improvers of the arts, aroſe from the loweſt of the people. If we had waited till courtiers had invented the art of printing, clock-making, navigation, and a thouſand others, we ſhould probably have continued in darkneſs to this hour. They had ſomething elſe to do, than to add to the comforts and conveniencies of ordinary life. They had to worſhip an idol, with the incenſe of flattery, who was often much more ſtupid than themſelves, and who ſometimes had no more care or knowledge of the people under him, or their wants, than he had of arts or literature.</p>
               <p>The education of the middle claſſes is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the education of thoſe who are called <hi>great people.</hi> Their time is leſs conſumed by that vanity and diſſipation which enfeebles the mind, while it precludes opportunity for reading and reflection. They uſually have a regard to <hi>character,</hi> which contributes much to the preſervation of virtue. Their honor and integrity are valued by them, as pearls of great price. Theſe are their ſtars, and theſe their coronets. They are for the moſt part attached to their religion. They are temperate, frugal, and induſtrious. In one particular, and that one adds a value above all that <hi>courts</hi> can give, they greatly excel the great, and that particular is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. They are in earneſt in their words and deeds. They have little occaſion for ſimulation and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Courtiers are too often varniſhed, fictitious perſons, whom God and nature never made; while the people preſerve the image unaffected, which the Supreme Being impreſſed when he created man.</p>

In like manner it is in the diſpoſitions of ſociety; the civil economy is formed in a chain as well as the natural; and in either caſe the breach but of one link puts the whole in ſome diſorder. It is, I think, pretty plain, that moſt of the abſurdity and ridicule that we meet with in the world, is generally owing to the impertinent affectation, of excelling in characters men are not fit for, and for which nature never deſigned them.</p>

               <p>While good faith reigned upon the earth, a ſimple promiſe was ſufficient to inſure confidence. Oaths owe their origin to perfidy. Man was not required to call upon the God that heard him to witneſs his veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till he deſerved no longer to be believed. Magiſtrates and ſovereigns, to what do your regulations tend? You either oblige the man of probity to lift up his hand, and call heaven to witneſs, which with him is a requiſition as injurious as it is uſeleſs; or you compel an oath from the mouth of a reprobate. Of what value can the oath of ſuch a man appear to you? If the oath be contrary to his own ſecurity, it is abſurd. If it be conſonant with his intereſt, it is ſuperfluous. Does it argue a knowledge of the human heart, to give the debtor his choice between his ruin and a falſehood; or the criminal his option between death and perjury? Will the man whom motives of revenge, intereſt, or wickedneſs, have determined to give a falſe teſtimony, be deterred by the fear of committing one crime more?

deſpiſed it, before he complied with it? Is it not a ſpecies of impiety to introduce the name of God in our wicked diſputes? Is it not a ſingular mode of making heaven, as it were, an accomplice in the guilt, to ſuffer that heaven to be called upon, which never has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted nor ever will contradict the oath? How intrepid, therefore, muſt the falſe witneſs become, when he has with impunity called down the divine vengeance on his head, without the fear of being convicted?

The truth is—the ſoul is generally in ſuch caſes ſo buſily taken up and wholly engroſſed by the object of pity, that ſhe does not attend to her own operations, or take leiſure to examine the principles upon which ſhe acts.</p>

               <p>Poverty has, in large cities, very different appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is often concealed in ſplendor, and often in extravagance.

               <p>It is the great privilege of poverty to be happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied, to be healthful without phyſic, and ſecure without a guard; to obtain from the bounty of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what the great and wealthy are compelled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by the help of artiſts, and the attendance of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and ſpies.</p>
               <bibl>RAMBLER.</bibl>
               <p>There are natural reaſons why poverty does not eaſily conciliate. He that has been confined from his infancy to the converſation of the loweſt claſſes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, muſt neceſſarily want thoſe accompliſhments which are the uſual means of attracting favour; and though truth, fortitude, and probity, give an indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able right to reverence and kindneſs, they will not be diſtinguiſhed by common eyes, unleſs they are bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by elegance of manners; but are caſt aſide, like unpoliſhed gems, of which none but the artiſt knows the intrinſic value, till their aſperities are ſmoothed, and their incruſtations rubbed away.</p>

               <p>One of the chief advantages derived by the preſent generation from the improvement and diffuſion of philoſophy, is deliverance from unneceſſary terrors, and exemption from falſe alarms. The unuſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, whether regular or accidental, which once ſpread conſternation over ages of ignorance, are now the recreations of inquiſitive ſecurity. The ſun is no more lamented when it is eclipſed, than when it ſets, and meteors play their corruſcations without prognoſtic or prediction.</p>

Many men in our times, who wiſh to extend and aggrandize that power, from whoſe arbitrary boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they derive all the honour they are capable of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endeavour to throw contempt on philoſophy. It may indeed be doubted whether they all know the meaning of the word; but they know it implies a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not derived from princes, and therefore they wiſh to degrade it. Their fountain of honour, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, has no reſemblance, in its nature or efficacy, to the famed fountains of Parnaſſus: it conveys no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, except that which diſplays itſelf in the tumor of pride.</p>
               <p>The preſent age has heard upſtart noblemen give to philoſophers (whoſe genius and diſcoveries entitle them to rank, in reaſon's table of precedency, above every nobleman in the red book) the opprobrious appellation of wretches and miſcreants. Philoſophy and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have been mentioned by men, whoſe attainments would only qualify them for diſtinction in a ball-room, with expreſſions of hatred and contempt due only to thieves, murderers, the very outcaſts and refuſe of human nature.</p>
               <bibl>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</bibl>
               <p>Philoſophy, ſo far from deſerving contempt, is the glory of human nature. Man approaches by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what we conceive of celeſtial purity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Without the aid of philoſophy, the maſs of mankind, all over the terraqueous globe, would have ſunk in ſlavery and ſuperſtition, the natural conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of groſs ignorance. Men at the very bottom of ſociety, have been enabled by the natural talents they poſſeſſed, ſeconded by favorable opportunities, to reach the higheſt improvements in philoſophy; and have thus lifted up a torch in the valley, which has expoſed the weakneſs and deformity of the caſtle on the mountain, from which the oppreſſors ſallied, in the night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpread deſolation with impunity. Deſpots, the meaneſt, the baſeſt, the moſt brutal and ignorant of
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:037099_0265_100C4E694BD3D8E8"/>
the human race, would have trampled on the rights and the happineſs of men unreſiſted, if philoſophy had not opened the eyes of the ſufferers, ſhewn them their own power and dignity, and taught them to deſpiſe thoſe giants of power, as they appeared through the miſts of ignorance, who ruled a vaſſal world with a mace of iron. Liberty is the daughter of philoſophy; and they who deteſt the offspring, do all that they can to vilify and diſcountenance the mother.</p>
               <p>But let us calamly conſider what is the object of this philoſophy, ſo formidable in the eyes of thoſe who are bigotted to ancient abuſes, who hate every improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and who wiſh to ſubject the many to the control of an arbitrary few. Philoſophy is ever employed in finding out whatever is good, and whatever true. She darts her eagle eye over all the buſy world, detects error and miſchief, and points out modes of improvement. In the multiform ſtate of human affairs, ever obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to decay and abuſe, it is her's to meditate on the means of melioration. She wiſhes to demoliſh nothing but what is a nuiſance. To build, to repair, to ſtrengthen, and to poliſh, theſe are the works which ſhe delights to plan; and, in concerting the beſt methods of directing their accompliſhment, ſhe conſumes the midnight oil. How can ſhe diſturb human affairs, ſince ſhe dwells in contemplation, and deſcends not to action? neither does ſhe impel others to action by the arts of deluſive eloquence. She applies to reaſon alone; and if reaſon is not convinced, all that ſhe has done, is ſwept away, like the web of Arachne.</p>

Pride, according to the doctrine of ſome, is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal paſſion. There are others, who conſider it as the foible of great minds; and others again, who will have it to be the very foundation of greatneſs; but to real greatneſs, which is the union of a good heart with a good head, it is almoſt diametrically oppoſite; as it generally proceeds from the depravity of both, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certainly from the badneſs of the latter. Indeed a little obſervation will ſhow us, that fools are the moſt addicted to this vice, and a little reflexion will teach us that it is incompatible with true underſtanding.

               <p>The abſurd and abominable doctrine, <hi>that private vices are public benefits,</hi> it is hoped will be blotted from the memory of man, and expunged from the catalogue of human follies, with the ſyſtems of government which gave it birth. The ground of this inſulting doctrine is, that advantage may be taken of the extravagant foibles of individuals to increaſe the revenues of the ſtate; as if the chief end of ſociety were, to ſteal money for the government's purſe! to be ſquandered by the governors, to render them more inſolent in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions! it is humiliating, to anſwer ſuch arguments as theſe; where we muſt lay open the moſt degrading retreats of proſtituted logic, to diſcover the poſitions on which they are founded. But <hi>orders</hi> and <hi>privileges</hi> will lead to any thing: once teach a man, that <hi>some are born to command, and others to be commanded;</hi> and after that, there is no camel too big for him to ſwallow.</p>

               <p>What employment, in the buſy ſcene in which man engages from the cradle to the tomb, is more worthy of him than political diſcuſſion? It affords a field for intellectual energy, and all the fineſt feelings of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. It exerciſes and ſtrengthens every faculty. It calls forth latent virtues, which elſe had ſlept in the boſom, like the diamond in the mine. And is this employment, thus uſeful and honorable, to be confined to a few among the race of mortals? Is there to be a monopoly of political action and ſpeculation? Why then did heaven beſtow reaſon and ſpeech, powers of activity, and a ſpirit of enterprize, in as great perfection on the loweſt among the people, as on thoſe who, by no merit of their own, inherit wealth and high ſtation? Heaven has declared its will by its acts. Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travenes it; but time, and the progreſſive improvement of the underſtanding, will reduce the anomaly to its natural rectitude. And if a few irregularities ſhould ſometimes ariſe in the proceſs, they are of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance when weighed with the happy reſult; the return of diſtorted ſyſtems to truth, to reaſon, and the will of God. Occaſional ferments, with all their inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, are infinitely preferable to the putreſcence of ſtagnation. They are ſymptoms of health and vigor; and though they may be attended with tranſient pain, yet while they continue to appear at intervals, there is no danger of mortification.

We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator with certain unalienable rights; that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs; that to ſecure theſe rights, governments are inſtituted among men, deriving their juſt powers from the conſent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſtitute new government, laying its foundation on ſuch principles, and organizing its powers in ſuch form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

The whole buſineſs of the poor is to adminiſter to the idleneſs, folly, and luxury of the rich; and that of the rich, in return, is to find the beſt methods of confirming the ſlavery and increaſing the burdens of the poor. In a ſtate of nature it is an invariable law, that a man's acquiſitions are in proportion to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. In a ſtate of artificial ſociety, it is a law as conſtant and as invariable, that thoſe who labour moſt,

enjoy the feweſt things; and that thoſe who labour not at all, have the greateſt number of enjoyments. A conſtitution of things this ſtrange and ridiculous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion. We ſcarce believe a thing when we are told it, which we actually ſee before our eyes every day without being the leaſt ſurpriſed. I ſuppoſe that there are in Great-Britain upwards of an hundred thouſand people employed in lead, tin, iron, copper, and coal mines; theſe unhappy wretches ſcarce ever ſee the light of the ſun; they are buried in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth; there they work at a ſevere and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal taſk, without the leaſt proſpect of being delivered from it; they ſubſiſt upon the coarſeſt and worſt ſort of fare; they have their health miſerably impaired, and their lives cut ſhort, by being perpetually confined in the cloſe vapour of theſe malignant minerals. An hundred thouſand more at leaſt are tortured without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by the ſuffocating ſmoke, intenſe fires, and conſtant drudgery neceſſary in refining and managing the products of thoſe mines. If any man informed us that two hundred thouſand innocent perſons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſo intolerable ſlavery, how ſhould we pity the unhappy ſufferers, and how great would be our juſt indignation againſt thoſe who inflicted ſo cruel and ignominious a puniſhment? This is an inſtance, I could not wiſh a ſtronger, of the numberleſs things which we paſs by in their common dreſs, yet which ſhock us when they are nakedly repreſented. But this number, conſiderable as it is, and the ſlavery with all its baſeneſs and horror, which we have at home, is nothing to what the reſt of the world affords of the ſame nature. Millions daily bathed in the poiſonous damps and deſtructive effluvia of lead, ſilver, copper, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenic. To ſay nothing of thoſe other employments, thoſe ſtations of wretchedneſs and contempt in which civil ſociety has placed the numerous <hi>enſans perdus</hi> of her army. Would any rational man ſubmit to one of the moſt tolerable of theſe drudgeries, for all the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

enjoyments which policy has made to reſult from them? By no means. And yet need I ſuggeſt, that thoſe who find the means, and thoſe who arrive at the end, are not at all the ſame perſons. On conſidering the ſtrange and unaccountable fancies and contrivances of artificial reaſon, I have ſomewhere called this earth the Bedlam of our ſyſtem. Looking now upon the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſome of thoſe fancies, may we not with equal reaſon call it likewiſe the Newgate and the Bridewell of the univerſe? Indeed the blindneſs of one part of mankind co-operating with the frenzy and villainy of the other, has been the real builder of this reſpectable fabric of political ſociety. And as the blindneſs of mankind has cauſed their ſlavery, in return, their ſtate of ſlavery is made a pretence for continuing them in a ſtate of blindneſs; for the politician will tell you grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that their life of ſervitude diſqualifies the greater part of the race of man for a ſearch of truth, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them with no other than mean and inſufficient ideas. This is but too true; and this is one of the reaſons for which I blame ſuch inſtitutions</p>

It ſeems to be agreed that in England there is leſs wretchedneſs and diſtreſs than in moſt of the kingdoms of the continent. In England the poor's rates amount to the ſum of two millions ſterling per annum.

               <p>There is hardly any prince without a favorite, by whom he is governed in as arbitrary a manner as he governs the wretches ſubjected to him. Here the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is doubled. There are two courts and two intereſts; both very different from the intereſts of the people. The favorite knows that the regard of a tyrant is as inconſtant and capricious as that of a woman; and concluding his time to be ſhort, he makes haſte to fill up the meaſure of his iniquity, in rapine, in luxury, and in revenge. Every avenue to the throne is ſhut up. He oppreſſes, and ruins the people, whilſt he
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:037099_0298_100C4E57CE7B5A08"/>
perſuades the prince, that thoſe murmurs raiſed by his own oppreſſion are the effects of diſaffection to the prince's government. Then is the natural violence of deſpotiſm inflamed, and aggravated by hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. To deſerve well of the ſtate is a crime againſt the prince. To be popular, and to be a traitor, are conſidered as ſynonymous terms. Even virtue is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as an aſpiring quality, that claims an eſteem by itſelf, and independent of the countenance of the court. What has been ſaid of the chief, is true of the inferior officers of this ſpecies of government; each in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince exerciſing the ſame tyranny, and grinding the people by an oppreſſion, the more ſeverely felt, as it is near them, and exerciſed by baſe and ſubordinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For the groſs of the people, they are conſidered as a mere herd of cattle; and really in a little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no better; all principle of honeſt pride, all ſenſe of the dignity of their nature is loſt in their ſlavery. The day, ſays Homer, which makes a man a ſlave, takes away half his worth; and in fact he loſes every impulſe to action, but that low and baſe one of fear.—In this kind of government human nature is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed, and inſulted, but it is actually degraded and ſunk into a ſpecies of brutality.</p>

               <p>Moſt of the titles of nobility, and other civil diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were taken from war: as a marquis, a duke, a count, a baron, a landgrave, a knight, an eſquire. The inventors of arts, the improvers of life, thoſe who have mitigated evil and augmented the good allotted to men in this world, were not thought worthy of any titular diſtinctions. The reaſon is indeed ſufficiently obvious: titles were originally beſtowed by deſpotic kings, who required and rewarded no other merit but that which ſupported them by violence in their arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary rule. In ſome countries they are now given, for the ſame reaſons, to thoſe who effect the ſame purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not by war only, but by corruption.</p>

               <p>The death-bed ſhews the emptineſs of titles in a true light. A poor diſpirited ſinner lies trembling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehenſions of the ſtate he is entering on; and is aſked by a grave attendant, how his holineſs does? Another hears himſelf addreſſed under the title of highneſs or excellency, who lies under ſuch mean cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of mortality as are the diſgrace of human nature. Titles at ſuch a time look rather like inſults and mockery than reſpect.</p>

War never fails to exhauſt the ſtate, and endanger its deſtruction, with whatever ſucceſs it is carried on. Though it may be commenced with advantage, it can never be finiſhed without danger of the moſt fatal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of fortune. With whatever ſuperiority of ſtrength an engagement is begun, the leaſt miſtake, the ſlighteſt accident, may turn the ſcale and give victory to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Nor can a nation that ſhould be always vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious proſper: it would deſtroy itſelf by deſtroying others: the country would be depopulated, the ſoil untilled, and trade interrupted: and what is worſe, the beſt laws would loſe their force, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners inſenſibly take place. Literature will be neglected among the youth; the troops, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own importance, will indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the moſt pernicious licentiouſneſs with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the diſorder will neceſſarily ſpread through all the branches of government.</p>

It is wonderful with what coolneſs and indifference the greater part of mankind ſee war commenced. Thoſe that hear of it at a diſtance, or read of it in books, but have never preſented its evils to their minds, conſider it as little more than a ſplendid game, a proclamation, an army, a battle, and a triumph. Some indeed muſt periſh in the moſt ſucceſsful field, but they die upon the bed of honor, <hi>reſign their lives amidſt the joys of conqueſt,</hi> and, <hi>filled with England's glory, smile in death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The life of a modern ſoldier is ill repreſented by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic fiction. War has means of deſtruction more formidable than the cannon and the ſword. Of the thouſands and ten thouſands that periſhed in our late conteſts with France and Spain, a very ſmall part ever felt the ſtroke of an enemy; the reſt languiſhed in tents and ſhips, amidſt damps and putrefaction; pale, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, ſpiritleſs, and helpleſs; gaſping and groaning, unpitied among men, made obdurate by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of hopeleſs miſery; and were at laſt whelmed in pits, or heaved into the ocean, without notice and without remembrance. By incommodious encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and unwholeſome ſtations, where courage is uſeleſs, and enterprize impracticable, fleets are ſilently diſpeopled, and armies ſluggiſhly melted away.</p>
               <p>Thus is a people gradually exhauſted, for the moſt part with little effect. The wars of civilized nations make very ſlow changes in the ſyſtem of empire. The public perceive ſcarcely any alteration but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of debt; and the few individuals who are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, are not ſuppoſed to have the cleareſt right, to their advantages. If he that ſhared the danger enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the profit, and after bleeding in the battle grew rich by the victory, he might ſhew his gains without envy. But at the concluſion of a ten years war, how are we recompen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

commiſſaries, whoſe equipages ſhine like meteors, and whoſe palaces riſe like exhalations.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the men who, without virtue, labour, or hazard, are growing rich as their country is impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; they rejoice when obſtinacy or ambition adds another year to ſlaughter and devaſtation; and laugh from their deſks at bravery and ſcience, while they are adding figure to figure, and cypher to cypher, hoping for a new contract from a new armament, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the profits of a ſiege or tempeſt.</p>

               <p>When I was a child, at ſeven years old, my friends on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a ſhop where they ſold toys for children; and being charmed with the ſound of a <hi>whistle,</hi> that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whiſtling all over the houſe, much pleaſed with my <hi>whistle,</hi> but diſturbing all the family.
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:037099_0309_100C4EA1856C4288"/>
My brothers, and ſiſters, and couſins, underſtanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the reſt of my money; and they laughed ſo much at me for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the <hi>whistle</hi> gave me pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This however was afterwards of uſe to me, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion continuing in my mind; ſo that often, when I was tempted to buy ſome unneceſſary thing, I ſaid to myſelf, <hi>Don't give too much for the whistle;</hi> and ſo I ſaved my money.</p>
               <p>As I grew up, came into the world, and obſerved the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who <hi>gave too much for the whistle.</hi>

               <p>When I ſaw any one too ambitious of court favors, ſacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repoſe, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have ſaid to myſelf, <hi>This man gives too much for his whistle.</hi>

               <p>When I ſaw another fond of popularity, conſtantly employing himſelf in political buſtles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect; <hi>He pays, indeed,</hi> ſays I, <hi>too much for his whistle.</hi>
