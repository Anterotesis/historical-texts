            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>And in Your faith and favour hope to live.</l>
            <l>We heard, (and it to us did Sorrow bring)</l>
            <l>The much-lamented death of the late King;</l>
            <l>And, with but too much Truth, did calculate</l>

            <l>Those Laws, which Parliaments had made to live,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Disarm'd their Force, that they could strike no more.</l>

            <l>And daring Priests did eagerly pursue</l>
            <l>Their Patron's Orders with unbounded joy,</l>
            <l>Or to deceive us <hi>Her'ticks,</hi> or destroy.</l>
            <l>Dissenting Protestants they strove to please</l>

            <l>Th' establish't Church trampled, against all Law,</l>

            <l>The Snare was laid, the pointed hour drew nigh,</l>
            <l>Wherein our <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> was doom'd to die.</l>
            <l>Great were his <hi>hopes</hi> (who, when the Stroak was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</l>
            <l>Claim'd for <hi>Reward</hi> a <hi>double</hi> share of Heaven)</l>

            <l>Reform'd <hi>America</hi> must suffer too.</l>

            <l>Our <hi>Suffrings</hi> tell (who then could us cajole?)</l>

            <l>Were mark't a lingring Ruin to receive.</l>
            <l>They grug'd that we should harmlessly possess</l>
            <l>With Ease and Freedom this our Wilderness.</l>
            <l>Which our religious Ancestors (who fought</l>
            <l>God in a Desart Countrey) dearly bought.</l>
            <l>Our Charter, which freely we had injoy'd</l>
            <l>In three successive Reigns, is first made void;</l>
            <l>Condemn'd for forged Crimes we never knew.</l>
            <l>Nor at this distance could er'e answer to.</l>
            <l>Condemn'd unheard; their fraud would not admit</l>
            <l>A clear Defence and Legal; nor was't fit</l>
            <l>In a Court where <hi>Astraea</hi> nere' did sit.</l>
            <l>And thence were we annex't t' a Popish Crown,</l>
            <l>By which we were design'd to be undone.</l>
            <l>Then came a man to be our President,</l>
            <l>As well against the <hi>Law</hi> as our Content:</l>
            <l>But he, Alas, did only smooth the way</l>
            <l>For a Superior Lord, who made no stay.</l>
            <l>Soon came the <hi>Jersy</hi> Knight, crafty and Stout,</l>
            <l>And for his Master s Interest cut out.</l>
            <l>Soon did he and his Creatures let us know</l>
            <l>Whence all our miseries were like to grow.</l>
            <l>Knaves, Beggars, <hi>Papists</hi> form'd the triple League</l>
            <l>Which carry'd on the ruinous Intreague.</l>
            <l>We were not treated by th' insulting Knaves</l>
            <l>As free-born <hi>English,</hi> but as poor <hi>French</hi> Slaves.</l>
            <l>Taxes were rais'd, without Mercy, or Measure,</l>
            <l>To keep us low, and fill our <hi>Tyrant</hi>'s Treasure.</l>
            <l>To MAGNA CHARTA we coul'd claim no Right,</l>
            <l>Neither our own, nor <hi>English</hi> Laws would fit,</l>
            <l>But such as by Distortion, and Abuse,</l>
            <l>Would still advance the Plot to ruin us.</l>
            <l>New Laws by a small shabby Juncto fram'd,</l>
            <l>And then so surreptitiously proclaim'd,</l>
            <l>As if they chose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh when were Laws so made!)</l>
            <l>They rather should be <hi>broken</hi> than obey'd:</l>
            <l>So, if we <hi>kept</hi> or <hi>broke</hi> them, 'twas by chance;</l>
            <l>They made advantage of our <hi>Ignorance</hi>:</l>
            <l>Strain'd their own Laws beyond their true Intent,</l>
            <l>To our great Cost, Sorrow and wonderment.</l>
            <l>All that we counted dear was made a Prize</l>
            <l>To th' raging Lust and hungry Avarice</l>
            <l>Of a few tatter'd Rascals from <hi>New-York,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>More insolent than ever was <hi>Grand Turk.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Their debanch't tricks the harmless Countrey saw,</l>
            <l>But vainly sought a just redress by Law.</l>
            <l>The Law, which ev'n our smallest Trips could find</l>
            <l>Distinguish't Friends, and in <hi>their</hi> Cause was <hi>blind.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Their Lust on Honour strange Excursions made:</l>

            <l>Was a perplex't mysterious <hi>Indian-War,</hi>

            <l>For which with mighty Forces we prepare.</l>
            <l>We, who a <hi>Hundred,</hi> in the dayes of yore</l>

            <l>An Army now a thousand strong must send,</l>

            <l>Our Officers were Popish men of blood,</l>

            <l>Our Scatt ring Foes but seldom came in sight,</l>
            <l>Or if they had, we had no power to fight;</l>

            <l>We dare not kill, the <hi>Law</hi> would then pursue.</l>

            <l>And thus things stood, and thus the Plot went on,</l>
            <l>From earth to root our Her'tick Nation</l>
            <l>Here, and in our beloved Native Isle;</l>
            <l>Till Heaven on us cast a propitious smile;</l>
