            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I PROMISED I would write you all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencies in our journey; thus far, I hope, I have fulfilled it. This morning, as it would be but little out of our way to BATH, we called to ſee <hi>SAINT ROZO VILLOZO!</hi> the moſt celebrated Perſonage in this part of the country. As your life has been diſtinguiſhed by uniform attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſteady principles, adopted from inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrengthened by practice, confirmed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023501_0004_0FBFD9FD8929DEF8"/>
by reaſon and religion; and as I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your judgment will ever prevent you from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an enthuſieſt; ſo, I as ſincerely believe, your faith will not permit you to be a ſceptic—I ſhall relate to you the hiſtory of <hi>Saint Rozo Villozo,</hi> with as much accuracy as may be in my power.</p>
            <p>THIS young girl, of ſeventeen years of age, of honeſt and diſcreet parents, who live at preſent, and have done for theſe many years paſt, near <hi>Sharpsburg,</hi> was ſome time ſince alarmed about the ſalvation of her ſoul, by the influence of a ſermon ſhe heard from a <hi>Methodiſt Preacher.</hi> At this time ſhe was uſual good health. The impreſſions ſhe received were deep and powerful; her affections were engaged; her heart was warmed; and her imagination extremely elevated. <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023501_0005_0FBFDA0334A95E78"/>
theme of her ſong—That a Saviour, the Son of GOD, ſhould condeſcend to come into the world, arrayed with heavenly majeſty, and ſuffer the death at the croſs for man, who had tendered himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy any favors, was an idea ſo ſublime, it never entered her mind—but tears flowed down her cheeks. Her converſation at different times was often interrupted by an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully expreſsive than the deſcription of language. The impreſſions on her mind were ſoon viſible in her counten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>e, by a fixed and ſettled melancholy. A dejection of ſpirits—loſs of appetite—decline of health—ſtrong propensity for retirement—and, when in company, an averſion to ſpeech, with that ſolemn ſilence which marks grief too deeply fixed to be removed by utterance; ſhe often found a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023501_0006_0FBFDA051000C188"/>
relief in prayer; in offering up her heart to that GOD who is ever preſent, and ever ready to help. The ſublimity of whoſe attributes, when they firſt entered her feeble mind, unaccuſtomed to thought or reflection, ſtruck her with aſtoniſhment. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral debility ſoon prevailed over her body. For theſe ſome months paſt ſhe has, occaſionally, been confined to her bed. Her diet is extremely light, and conſiſsts moſtly of fruit. During the whole of her indiſpoſition, once in twenty-four hours, at a particular period, all the functions of the body ceaſe to perform their office. Life appears ſuſpended. During this interim, after ſhe has recovered, ſhe declares with the moſt ſolemn aſsurances, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt ſincerely believe her, that ſhe has been to Heaven—ſeen Chriſt—and partook of the pleaſures,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023501_0007_0FBFDA06D06357D0"/>
and enjoyed the company of Angels—with a great many other wild, incoherent and unconnected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
            <p>MANY thouſands of idle and curious people, from different parts of the country, have could to ſee, hear, and queſtion, to look and wonder, and wonder and look—and, if poſſible, to obtain ſome information how their affairs and concerns may ſtand in the other world; which; a little previous enquiry into their own hearts and actions, conduct and characters, would have aſcertained with more accuracy than phantom ſpirits; or <hi>Saint Rozo Villozo,</hi> paſsing and repaſsing from this world to the other.</p>
            <p>THE Methodiſts have been guilty of extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and follies, but they will never attempt, I am confident, to procure converts at the expence of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023501_0008_0FBFDA0E08997E08"/>
their reputation, by artifice, deceit, and impoſition. They have been guilty—and it is a melancholy truth, which good people muſt lament—of rouſing and alarming the paſsions, without informing the underſtanding—of ſcattering fire without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating inſtruction—of emiting a vapour, highly ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous, the ſmell of which was alone ſufficient to bewilder the ignorant, without diſcovering proper rights to direct them. And I am ſorry to obſerve, ſome have been ſent out among their preachers, whoſe morals and manners have been exceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and whoſe higheſt characteriſtic was their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, to perform the great office of unfolding the ſcriptures, to a people who really ſtood in need of it, and who would gladly have received inſtruction, if their teachers had been competent to ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023501_0009_0FBFDA11A3D45148"/>
a truſt. But the Methodiſt church, like a huge ſtructure, built in a hurry, of combuſtable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, without its proper foundation, (religious knowledge and learned men) will fall, as ſoon as the paſsions of its votaries ſubſide; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth will be illuſtrated to the world, whether a fermentation in the minds of the people, and a change in their ſentiments, in exterior garb and profeſsions, is, ultimately, favourable to the improvement of manners and morals, to ſocial hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to true and genuine religion.</p>
            <p>THAT there is any impoſition kept up upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediated plan, formed by any ſect of people to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the public, the ſimplicity of the parents, and the ſimplicity of the daughter, together with the impracticability of ſupporting of it, for any
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023501_0010_0FBFDA1358AE4490"/>
length of time, with any degree of ſucceſs, in this enlightened age, a moment's reflection precludes the poſsibility of a doubts—and a few facts will ſhew the grounds on which the idea of a premeditated impoſition ought not to be indulged.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A derangement of nerves will produce a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of ideas, infinitely varying.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. WHEN the mind has been exerciſed by any of the more violent paſsions of fear, joy, anger, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, in proportion as it has been agitated, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, to langour, to melancholy; and there it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, unleſs rouſed by introducing ſome new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and putting it under the impulſe of ſome new paſsion.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. HAD ſhe have received proper information, after the firſt impulſe of feeling was over, and her
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023501_0011_0FBFDA14CAA49048"/>
fears and terrors had ſubſided, inſtead of being gloomy and melancholy, her thoughts would have found agreeable employment in ſearching out the great truths of religion, and her whole attention would have been occupied in extending their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon her life and actions.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. AGREERABLE employment of thought or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the acquiſition of knowledge or property, baniſhes dejection and melancholy.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. THE diſcovery of religious truth muſt have as much happier influence on the mind, than any other, as it is ſuperior.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. VANITY is a univerſal feeling, it has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied every human heart, and every character, in every ſituation; and when the opportunity offers for indulging of it, the impulſe is too ſtrong to be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023501_0012_0FBFDA1D2D3FD8D8"/>
reſtrained. What at firſt might have originated in mere accident, is confirmend into a habit, and ſo long as it can be fed by the admiration of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, there is no danger but the love of being conſpicous, in daughter and parents, if it ſhould not induce them to encourage, will, at leaſt make them cautions how they remove a diſorder, which has ſupported, thus far, the deluſion.</p>
            <p>WHEN the laws which controul the connection of ſoul and body, are, periodically, once in twenty-four hours, mechanically ſuſpended, a phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is exhibited which ſeldom occurs. And when the ſoul, the inviſible principle of life and motion, paſses out and into the body, and it receives no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, if true, is not eaſily to be accounted for. But when a certain debility of conſtitution muſt be a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023501_0013_0FBFDA1E95F12830"/>
neceſsary preparation for the diſplay of theſe <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things,</hi> the myſtery unravels itſelf, and the moſt enthuſiaſtic minds would give up their impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit belief, if they would only take time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>CREDULITY and ignorance have, in every ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age of ſociety, accompanied each other. The privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of examining and inveſtigating upon rational principles, the different occurencies of the day, in the moral and natural world, is confined to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> nor do they alwsys uſe it without abuſe. If a pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet dancer, or merry Andrew can command atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one whoſe exhibitions are behind the curtain which bounds human intelligence, the characters introduced not familiar to the conceptions of the wiſeſt, the greateſt, and the beſt of men, the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

given especially coming under the garb of religion muſt command the belief of that large proportion of mankind, whoſe ignorance prevents them from examining, and whoſe credulity makes it unneceſsary. If when the novelty becomes more familiar, the admiration of the credulous ſtage for want of freſh matter to keep it up, when the air of the approaching ſeaſon, by bracing up relaxed nerves, produces a change in the conſtitution;—when in ſhort ſhe arrives at her uſual good health—the deluſion diſappears—her friends will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed to have their SAINT remain with them, without any material change for the better, in worldly or heavenly circumſtances—and <hi>ROZO VILLOZO</hi> herſelf obliged to return to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe of life—the ignorant will wonder;—
