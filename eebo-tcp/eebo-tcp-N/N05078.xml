            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Love is the ground of Happineſs; ſo a Spirit of Love is neceſſary to the Happineſs of the Creature. We can have no Pleaſure in that which we Love not; whether it be good or evil. And the better the thing Loved is, and the ſtronger the Love, the greater is the Happineſs of enjoying it. So it has been GOD's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable kindneſs to us, to make us ſuch as are capable of Loving him, who is Infinitely more Excellent than all the whole Creation. And hence our Soul is ever empty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006372_0003_102889991AAA37B8"/>of its proper and ſufficient Happineſs, while it does not enjoy GOD; and cannot be truly Happy, except it Love him ſtrongly with all its Power and Strength: which cannot be without knowing his excellent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Joh. 17.3.</p>
            <p>And Hence, as GOD is Love, and Loves to make us Happy: So he has made this the Sum and Subſtance of all our Duty. To <hi>Love the Lord with all our Heart and Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 22.37. So the ſubſtance of all our Duty and Happineſs (which are inſeparably joyned in one) is Love. And if we Love dutifully and happily, we ſhall proportion our Love to every Thing according to its worth. And hence ſhall Love GOD for his own ſake, and his Creatures for his ſake, and modify our Love to his Creatures according to their uſe and worth. He that had this Love is happy: he that wants it is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; tho' at preſent he perceive it not.</p>
            <p>Hence the whole Law is comprized in theſe two Commands, To Love the Lord our GOD with our whole <hi>Heart, Soul, Mind and Strength,</hi> and to Love our Neighbour <hi>as our ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence when Men and Devils had by Sin forfeited their Happineſs, they became Angry, Malicious, Proud, Deceitful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Goſpel of Chriſt is bro't in (ſince the everlaſting Law) to reſtore ſome of the Children of Men to the Spirit of Love again, that they may be happy, ſince Chriſt has ſatisfied Juſtice for them. Here our LORD <hi>firſt</hi> ſhews which is <hi>the firſt and great Command:</hi> And then ſays of the other, that it is <hi>like</hi> the firſt. That is, we cannot be happy without it. The Spirit of not loving our Neighbour, that evil and diſquieted Spirit, would render us in it ſelf unhappy, and uncapable of Communion with GOD, who is Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006372_0004_10288A3D4DD5FA18"/>
So I Obſerve, The Loving our Neighbours as we love ourſelves, is neceſſary unto our Duty and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here <hi>in the firſt Place</hi> enquire, What it is, to love our Neighbour as ourſelves.</p>
            <p>In order unto which, I lay down this Poſition, <hi>viz. An Unregenerate Perſon, while in that State, is uncapable of keeping this Command, according to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Explain this, I add, It is a very great <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> for an Unregenerate Perſon to love his Neighbour as he does love himſelf. It is his great Duty to love his Neighbour as he <hi>ought</hi> to love himſelf: But not as he <hi>does</hi> love himſelf. I ſhew it in theſe Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He loves himſelf <hi>for his own ſake.</hi> He loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not under GOD, but above GOD, and his love to GOD is only for himſelf and for his own ſake. He cares not for GOD's Glory otherwiſe than for his own Intereſt. He Spiritually feeds on the forbidden Fruit continually; in ſetting up for himſelf a Happineſs ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from GOD's Glory. His Religion is only to make himſelf eaſy. He ſerves his own Conſcience, and not GOD.</p>
            <p>Among many Inſtances, I name one. If he think he is not Elected to Salvation, he will not ſeek to ſerve GOD: It appears he cares not for Him, nor for his Glory. But if he think he is Elected, then he cares as little; for he thinks he is ſafe enough, and deſires not to Glorify GOD in his Life, but to take his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and live to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore, If an Unſanctifyed Perſon love his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as he loves himſelf, he is an Idolater in doing it: He ſets his Neighbour in God's Stead, to be loved for his own Sake, and not for the Sake of God's Glory by him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006372_0005_10288A44AFA3C918"/>
2. An Unregenerate Perſon loves himſelf <hi>very Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly.</hi> Becauſe he loves not GOD truly, therefore he loves not himſelf truly; for theſe Intereſts are joyned in one by GOD in our Creation, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated. He that is True to GOD is True to himſelf: And he that is Falſe to GOD is Falſe to himſelf. So are the <hi>Wicked Snared in the Work of their own Hands,</hi> Pſal. 9.16. He Labours after Humiliation, Faith and Repentance very <hi>Unfaithfully;</hi> and hence is never made Partaker of either in Truth, but is deceived with a falſe Hope. He Labours to keep off Convictions, becauſe he is afraid to truſt his Soul with Chriſt, lothe to looſe his eaſy Mind, and his good Opinion of himſelf. When he examines himſelf, <hi>Whether he be in Chriſt;</hi> he does it very <hi>Partially,</hi> takes every Argument to think all well, and takes off all that Condemns him: And if he yet cannot find himſelf in Chriſt, yet he is eaſy with falſe Purpoſes of what he will do hereafter. So that if an Unregenerate Perſon love his Neighbour as he loves himſelf, he muſt be as Treacherous to him as the Devil is, and ſeek to lead him to Hell. Alaſs how many do ſo!</p>
            <p n="3">3. An Unregenerate Perſon's love to himſelf makes him love to pleaſe himſelf in his Sinful Luſts (to GOD's Diſhonour.) Some in one thing, ſome in another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Conſtitution and Temptations: And it is Wickedneſs againſt GOD and his Neighbours Soul, to love his Neighbour ſo; yet how many do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if an Unſanctifyed Perſon love his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as he <hi>does</hi> love himſelf, it is not an Obedience to this Command of Love, but the very Reverſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet Obſerve.</hi> Some Unſanctifyed Men go beyond the Command, and yet keep it never the better: For they love their Neighbours <hi>better</hi> than they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006372_0006_10288A463ABA1E60"/>eſpecially ſuch as they have leaſt love for. For they will be angry at their Sins, and ſeek to croſs them in their Sinful Luſts, and to have them Puniſhed, or Convinced of the Evil of their way. A good thing when done in Obedience to this Command.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed what is not required but forbidden in loving our Neighbours as ourſelves. I Proceed to ſhew in the Affirmative, what is required.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We are to love our Neighbour from the ſame <hi>Motive</hi> for which we ſhould love ourſelves That is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of GOD's Image which we ſee in them, and that GOD may be Glorified by them: And the more we ſee of this in them, (in the way wherein it is our Duty to Glorify Him) the better we are to love them. And therefore (ſince the Fall) almoſt the only Motive to love them muſt be the poſſible Hope that Peradventure the Glory of GOD in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt may be Magnified in their Salvation. For this reaſon the <hi>Angels</hi> of God love us and rejoice in our Welfare, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>And hence, Thoſe we hope are brought over to Chriſt, and thoſe we hope are of GOD made Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bringing others to Chriſt, are to be Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally abundantly the more beloved. If you love your ſelf <hi>Truly,</hi> you will not love your ſelf <hi>Idolatriouſly:</hi> And therefore this will be the reaſon why you can have any Pleaſure in your ſelf. Thus you are to <hi>Love your Neighbour as your ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) We are to love our Neighbours as <hi>Truly,</hi> as <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,</hi> and as Honeſtly and Uprightly, as we love our ſelves. We are to do by them as we deſire (in the way of GOD's Glory) they ſhould do by us. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.31. We are to be as loath to hurt ourſelves. We are to cover his Frailties (if it may conſiſt with the good of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006372_0007_10288A48A0FFB160"/>his Soul) as carefully as we would have our own covered. We are to be as willing to help him in any need, as we wou'd deſire that he ſhould help us in like need. We are to take no Advantage of his Ignorance or Neceſſity in dealing with him, more than we would be willing he ſhould take of us in like Caſe. My Hearers, I demand of your Conſcience that it do it's Office, and tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do ſo or not. If you love your own Soul, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon all ſuch Occaſions; that you may find out, whether you perform this Part of loving your <hi>Neighbour</hi> as <hi>yourſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we love our Neighbour as ourſelves, we are to be as truly pleaſed with his Proſperity as with our own. We are to ſeek no Revenge upon him for Injuries done, more than we would deſire of him upon us in like Caſes: Yea no more than we would have that God ſhould take Vengeance upon us for our Sins, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 <hi>laſt.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew the Truth on both ſides, leaſt we give it a wrong Luſter. God had given each Man a peculiar Charge of himſelf, we are to Eat to preſerve our own Lives, we muſt Believe and Repent for ourſelves, in this ſenſe, another cannot do it for us, each one muſt be Saved for himſelf, or Damned for himſelf, feel Comfort for himſelf, and Trouble for himſelf, and <hi>give an account to God of himſelf.</hi> So we are not to exerciſe love in the ſame degree for our Neighbour as for ourſelves, but in the ſame Sincerity and Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) If we love our Neighbours as we ought to love ourſelves, we muſt above all, ſeek in our Capacity, to be helpful to their Souls good: for this is the greateſt kindneſs we can (in Truth) deſire from our Neighbour. To help his Body is a needful Kindneſs, but to help his Soul, is unſpeakably more needful; to Save him from Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006372_0008_10288A4C34E25098"/>
               <hi>Let the ſame Mind be in us which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phi. 2.4, 5. We are bound to <hi>Exhort one another Daily,</hi> Heb. 2.17. Each one in his Capacity, ſome in more Publick Teaching, ſome in more Private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, all in Praying for GOD's Bleſſing upon Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and all, according to their Ability, in upholding ſuch as make it their Work to Teach the Way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in upholding them to Teach ſuch as know not the need of it themſelves.</p>
            <p>This laſt is a very manifeſt Act of loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as ourſelves. If we do not expend to help their Periſhing Souls, when God has given us to ſee it; How do we love them as we love ourſelves? Or at leaſt as we ought to love ourſelves? I muſt think they love not themſelves truly, who have ſo little love to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as to think it enough to be Saved themſelves, with their own Friends, and do not with their Prayers and Endeavours, all that in them lies, to Promote the ſaving of all they can beſide.</p>
            <p>In the Second place I Enquire, <hi>Why</hi> we muſt love our Neighbour as ourſelves?</p>
            <p n="1">[1] Becauſe there is the ſame Reaſon for it. He is GOD's Creature ſo well as we, and of the ſame Kind. GOD may as well be Glorified in him as in us. It is as much for GOD's Honour that my Neighbour be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as it is that I be: And the Miſery of Hell would be as bitter to him. And if the <hi>Glory of GOD be our</hi> Reward and Treaſure, then we ſhall as truly Rejoyce to ſee another Glorify Him, as to do it ourſelves.</p>
            <p>If I only ſeek to have my ſelf and Friends Happy, and Saved, it is a Sign I love my ſelf Separate from GOD, which is <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">[2.] If we can be happy in GOD, we have His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and if we have His Image, then it will appear in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006372_0009_10288A4DC35B2D38"/>our Practice, in Reaſon and <hi>Equity;</hi> and if we have not this part of His Image, then we can never enjoy Communion with him. Now their is as much Reaſon that my Neighbour ſhould deſire to enjoy Health and Proſperity, as that I ſhould: And as much Reaſon that I ſhould wiſh his Good, as that he ſhould wiſh mine.</p>
            <p>If we Profeſs to be GOD's Children, and do not ſhew His Image, by Equity and Love, we Scandalize His Glorious Name. Mat. 5.16. <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works and Glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">[3.] The Rejoycing in the Glorious Excellencies of GOD is the Joy of Heaven. Every redeemed Soul (even the leaſt of all) is an Inſtance of GOD's Glorious Redeeming Grace, and thereby an Addition to the Joy of all the reſt, and even of the <hi>Angels,</hi> Luk. 15.10. Thus as our own Salvation (if we have it) will be matter of Everlaſting Joy in the Glory of GOD; ſo will that of our Neighbour. And hence; if we have the Grace of GOD in our Soul, we have the ſame Motive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Neighbours <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> which we have to deſire our own.</p>
            <p>From theſe things we may be Informed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reaſon why <hi>Love to the Brethren is</hi> a Mark of one <hi>Paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Foundation of the Glory, Excellence and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a Rational Creature conſiſts in Love, Love to GOD, and hence, Love to his Image, and Love to all that Glorifies Him. But Obſerve,</p>
            <p>We are not to love thoſe that <hi>Glorify GOD againſt their will,</hi> ſuch as the Devils and Damned. We are to Rejoyce that GOD is Glorified upon them: But we owe them no good will for it. But while we have any hope that they will yet <hi>Obey the Goſpel of our LORD
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006372_0010_10288A5051EEE588"/>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> we are to Love them with this hope and deſire as Sincerely as we Love ourſelves.</p>
            <p>But when a Perſon appears to <hi>have</hi> Obeyed the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we are to rejoice in him, and to love him <hi>with a pure Heart Fervently</hi> in a more peculiar manner.</p>
            <p>But as every Mark of Grace may be Counterfeited, ſo this of Love to the Brethren. For Devils and wicked Men are forced to honour the Image of GOD; it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a Majeſty with it and <hi>a Beauty of Holineſs.</hi> They are Obliged to bow before it, while they hate it. Their Conſcience declares the good eſtate of ſuch a Man. This ſometimes <hi>Torments</hi> them that they are not ſo themſelves. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. But inſtead of yielding <hi>Subdued,</hi> they ſeek Evaſions, and ſtrive to make themſelves believe it is <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,</hi> and are glad to find Evil to ſpeak of them. A Poor way to cure their own Wound! Thus they ſtrive and take pains to go quietly to Hell, and delude their own Conſcience. They love themſelves moſt Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly. So this ſort of Love to the Brethren is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Child of Grace, but of the very contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here appears, The perſon who has not this Love to GOD and his Neighbour, is a <hi>Miſerable</hi> unhappy Creature. He has not the Root of Happineſs, but of Torment. Heaven can be no Heaven to him were he there. GOD's Glory can be no Joy to him, but a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. He has the Seed of Hell Fire in him. If he have all Knowlege, and do all the great Works in the World, and dy a <hi>Martyr,</hi> and have not this Love; it all avails him nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Heaven and Hell are as Contrary in their Inhabitants as in their Natures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence.</hi> The Perſon who ſeeks to make his own Gain by his Neighbours Loſs, walks not according to Love. And how ſhall we know the <hi>Tree</hi> but <hi>by it's Fruit?</hi> Mat. 7.18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006372_0011_10288A52EAD028C8"/>
GOD's Infinite Wiſdom has made our way of Living ſo agreeable to Love (when rightly uſed) that what a Man gains honeſtly is ſome way for the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> or ſuch as deal with him are the better for it, ſo well as himſelf. What the <hi>Farmer</hi> raiſes on his Land makes ſo much the more Proviſion in the Country. The <hi>Trades-Man</hi> ſerves his Cuſtomers ſo well as himſelf, and ſupplies what is needed in the Land. The <hi>Merchant</hi> brings into the Country what it needs, and diſpoſes of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities for them. The <hi>Teacher</hi> promotes Knowlege, for the Publick Good. Thus Men need a Communion for the good of each Party, to ſhew by Similitude the Heavenly Communion.</p>
            <p>What is ours lawfully Gained, may lawfully be Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: But what is <hi>gained</hi> by anothers Loſs, in bargaining or otherwiſe, brings no good to the Publick, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of <hi>Loving our Neighbour as ourſelves;</hi> and therefore a breach of one neceſſary Rule unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>Where there is Profit on <hi>both ſides,</hi> Men may divide it as they can agree; but not to that degree, that ſhall turn all the Profit to <hi>one ſide.</hi> But what is gained by <hi>Wagers,</hi> is a ſinfully Loſt as Gained: For Men are not <hi>Lords,</hi> but only <hi>Stewards</hi> of all which GOD has lent them, and muſt as well give an account how they <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of it, as how they <hi>get</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence</hi> Such as love to ſpeak evil of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours more than good, have the mark of Hell upon them. They love not their Neighbours as themſelves. We ſee that Men naturally take the part of their neareſt Friends when they are ſpoken againſt, becauſe they have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love for them. But we ſee that in many Places, an evil Report (true or falſe) of any Perſon, will ſpread much faſter then a good Report: Whereby it appears that the moſt part love not their <hi>Neighbours</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006372_0012_10288A568AE2BE40"/>but bear them an inward Hatred, or elſe (which is as bad) that they have an inward hatred to Holineſs it ſelf (tho' they think they have it) and are glad to tell of evil Committed. My Hearers, I beg of you, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine yourſelves. It is a Point of Life and Death. Well might our LORD tell us, <hi>There be few that find the ſtrait and narrow Way to Life,</hi> Mat. 7.14.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence we ſee the Reaſon why the Devils are of ſuch a Malicious Angry Evil Temper. It is becauſe no Happineſs belongs to them, for they have Sinned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſo their Temper is become Miſerable. For <hi>Love</hi> is the Temper of Happineſs, and <hi>Anger</hi> or <hi>Hatred,</hi> the Temper of Miſery.</p>
            <p>And here we ſee that an <hi>Angry Contentious Wilful</hi> Temper in Men, carries the mark of Miſery and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. What ſhall an Angry Creature do in Heaven? Where it is <hi>all Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some vent their Anger in Religious things; and thereby not only quiet their Conſcience, but alſo build a great hope of their Grace unto Salvation: But let them read, James 3.15, 16, 17. <hi>This Wiſdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth not from above, but is Earthly, Senſual, Deviliſh. For where Envying and Stife is, there is Confuſion and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evil Work. But the Wiſdom that is from above is firſt Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle and eaſy to be Intreated,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I can excuſe a <hi>paſſionate</hi> Man, who breaks out into Raptures of Anger, and cannot help it, but upon ſecond Thot's, is grieved for it. But I know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a Wilful Contentious Perſon, who upon Mature Tho'ts, will rather <hi>Rend</hi> the Church or Town or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood than looſe his will or be tho't to have been in a wrong cauſe. Theſe often think they ſtand for the Honour of GOD, when their <hi>own</hi> will at the Bottom blinds 'em to think ſo: And their want of love to their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006372_0013_10288A583925D648"/>Neighbour makes 'em think worſe of him then he is. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55. That <hi>Love,</hi> without which all great things are nothing, is thus Deſcribed, 1 Cor, 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. (Tranſlated in our Bibles, <hi>Charity) Suffereth long, and is kind; Envieth not, Vaunteth not it ſelf, is not Puffed up, doth not Behave it ſelf unſeemly, Seeketh not her own, is not eaſily Provoked, thinketh no Evil,</hi> &amp;c. We ought to ſtand <hi>firm</hi> for the Truth of Chriſt: But if it break out into Anger and Hatred, it is Sinfully Managed. 2 Tim. 2.25. <hi>In meekneſs Inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves, if GOD Peradventer will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth.</hi> We ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to keep the Church clean from Scandalous Perſons: But if a Secret Grudge at the Perſon be at laſt found to be the cauſe of your Zeal; it will be found but a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Devil. Men need know well by what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive they are ſet on Work. The way is <hi>Narrow!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I know how to excuſe thoſe who in <hi>Families</hi> or in Neighbourhoods, are ever and anon in Anger, and giving angry Language (whether to Equals or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors.) They are much eaſier Reformed by <hi>Convincing Loving</hi> Reaſons: And if Inferiors muſt have Correction, it will take much the better Convincing Impreſſion, when few or no angry Words (which always ſeem to ſhew Revenge) are mixed with it; as Experience ſhews where it is uſed. But an angry murmering Temper looks ſo little like Heaven, and ſo much like Hell; that I muſt <hi>beg</hi> of ſuch as uſe it to conſider on what Ground they ſtand.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Here ſee what we are to aim at, in all our Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Transformed into Love, that Glorious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and a reſemblance of GOD! We loſt it by the Fall when Man ſet up for himſelf in Seperation from GOD. We became <hi>Hateful and Hating one another.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006372_0014_10288A5ADC872960"/>CHRIST came to Redeem us, and to Sanctify us and to Purify us, and turn us again into Love. Come to CHRIST to bring you to it, by his Mediation and holy Spirit. Know what Progreſs you have made of Faith in Him, by the Fruit of it in Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Know that if you make no Progreſs in that, then all you have done yet has bro't nothing to Effect; you are yet in your Sins and bear the Image of the Devil. I do not mean an Affectionate Paſſion of Love (which yet is very good in it's time and place) but I mean that Love by which Faith works in a due care for GOD's Glory and your Neighbours Good and Peace and Comfort: Which among many greater Effects makes you bear with many conſiderable Faults in others, without being angry at them, knowing how much you need the ſame from GOD.</p>
