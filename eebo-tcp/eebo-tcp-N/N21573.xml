         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>LENGTH of time, change of countries and governments, corruption of language, and haſty copies in writing, before the more exact method of printing became generally uſed, has been the means of not only introducing, without deſign, into the Hebrew Bible, an inſertion of ſome new words, but likewiſe an expulſion of ſome of the old, which produces a diſagreement in ſome few parts, and makes it differ now from what it originally was in the times of David, Solomon, and at the commencement of the Babylonian cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: ſome parts of the Engliſh tranſlation are conſequently erroneous; but they are ſo immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial as not to affect, in the leaſt, the truth of its ſacred <hi>Records,</hi> or the tendency of its divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The few parts of the Engliſh tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I am inſtructed to alter in my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the propriety will be allowed by every perſon that has diſcernment to perceive, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to believe:—beyond the limits of my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for it is preſcribed, I am not ſuffered to proceed in any word or in any way whatever.</p>
            <p>The following are the words which the Lord God ſpoke to me in a viſion, ſoon after I was
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028359_0003_0FD8C521CCECCAC8"/>
commanded to write and make known his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the good of London and general bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all nations:—There is no other man under the whole heaven that I diſcover the errors of the Bible to, and reveal a knowledge how to correct them, ſo that they may be reſtored as they were in the beginning, but yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when I began to write I believed it neceſſary to adopt the ſame language as the Scripture does, regularly imitating it in the words—ye, thee, and thou; but God ſpoke to me in a viſion of the night, and ſaid—Write in the ſame manner as I always ſpeak to you; write as other men do; write according to the cuſtom of the country you live in; you will then be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attended to, and what you write will be more eaſily underſtood.</p>
            <p>A man that has been an officer in the navy, whoſe immediate anceſtors have been ſeparated from the Jews ſuch a conſiderable length of time as to make them forget they ever belonged to the name, ſuch a man declaring himſelf openly to the world a Prophet of God, the revealed Prince allotted to order the ſudden return of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews from all nations, and govern them in the land of Iſrael, will, with ſome reaſon, I allow, excite both aſtoniſhment and doubt; but from the multiplied recorded teſtiomonies I produce, which no other on earth can, it ought not to prevail with any perſon as a juſt objection againſt believing what I write.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028359_0004_0FD8C56814674828"/>For obſerve, ſome hoſtile profeſſion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to be engaged in, to fulfil the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded judgment on the family I am deſigned to repreſent in the ſeat of government; therefore, with all the certain proofs I have and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly bring forward, with all the juſt reaſons I advance, the ſurpriſe and doubt, entertained at the beginning, ought to vaniſh in as little time as would be requiſite to read again the book which contains the account.</p>
            <p>But remember likewiſe, from the records of Scripture, that Moſes was taken away in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and remained ſeparated from his brethren for eighty years: the firſt forty of which he was reared in the palace of the king of Egypt, and educated in the language and cuſtoms of the country like one of its own native princes; yet he was revealed to the Iſraelites as the prophet of God, to order their haſty departure from Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's bondage, and afterwards to conduct them to the promiſed land.</p>
            <p>Saul, the ſon of Kiſh, after being anointed king, propheſied in company with other men, to the great aſtoniſhment of all that ſaw him.</p>
            <p>David, king of Iſrael, the greateſt favourite that ever God had on earth, whoſe wars, though many, originated at that time from neceſſity and juſtice, never undertook, but to prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of idolatry, and preſerve in the land of Iſrael a true uninterrupted worſhip of God,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028359_0005_0FD8C52302AE3010"/>
was a prophet; and for whoſe ſake, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his name, beſieging armies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and Jeruſalem ſafely delivered. Yet this great monarch, this unequalled favourite, this pattern of mercy to all kings, and who alone, of all men under heaven, poſſeſſed the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed promiſe of everlaſting national government, could not, (but the objection did not proceed from any charge of injuſtice or ſin,) for, being a man of war, and having ſhed much blood on the earth, although done by the expreſs concurrence of the Moſt High, be permitted to build at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem a temple of worſhip for him: The great honour was given to Solomon, a king of peace, his ſon and immediate ſucceſſor; ſo averſe, though neceſſitated to order it, was the Creator of the world to the effuſion of blood and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Daniel ſpake and ſaid; I ſaw in my viſion by night, and behold the four winds of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtrove on the great ſea.</p>

               <p>The lion means George the Third, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent king of England; plucking the wings of the lion, means taking away the power of the king; made ſtand on the feet as a man, with a man's heart, means his reduction to the condition of other men, and poſſeſſing ſimilar thoughts.</p>
               <p>It is more than twenty months ſince I firſt wrote to the king, queen, and miniſter of ſtate, to inform them of many things that would come to paſs; that the time was nearly accompliſhed for ſome of the judgments of God to be made manifeſt, and alſo that this prophecy was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: I beſeeched them in the moſt earneſt and reſpectful language, not to join in the war on any account whatever, or even encourage it; for the death of Louis the ſixteenth would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prevent, it was recorded, and could not be avoided; the revolution in France, and its conſequences, proceeded entirely from the judgment of God to fulfil this prophecy of Daniel: therefore all attempts to overthrow the judgment, and preſerve the monarchy by force, was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what was determined in the Scripture of Truth ſhould moſt certainly take place.</p>
               <p>The aſpect of the war was deluſive, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of ſucceſs that it held out to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028359_0010_0FD8C56F645715D8"/>
were deceitful; but thoſe encouragements of deluſion were permitted, to bring many nations under the judgment of God, and puniſh them for the heavy guilt of oppoſing his decrees.</p>
               <p>If many had no more to ſight againſt than a few men alone, or nations but one divided nation to ſubdue, then it might with reaſon be expected that the greateſt number would ſoon overcome the leaſt, and that many ſtrong nations would ſoon conquer a weak one: but it is many men fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Spirit of God, and ſtrong nations labouring in vain with their blood and treaſure to overthrow his judgment.</p>
               <p>The Lord God permits this oppoſition for three years and a half, to fulfil the determined part of this prophecy on all that oppoſe it; that done, his judgments will take place, to puniſh man and lay waſte kingdoms.</p>
               <p>St. John the Apoſtle, in the nineteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Revelation, alludes to the preſent time of the world, and means the ſame things, though differently deſcribed, as the Prophet Daniel does in the ſeventh chapter; for which I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to inſert a part, that all princes and governments may be publicly warned, that they may know the conſequences of this war, from the judgment of God, will be—death to millions, and everlaſting diſtreſs to all nations.</p>

               <p n="19">19. And I ſaw the beaſt, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together, to make war againſt him that ſat on the horſe, and againſt his army.</p>

                  <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. <hi>continued.</hi> 5. And behold, another beaſt; a ſecond, like a bear: and it raiſed itſelf up on one ſide, with three ribs in its mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its teeth; and they ſaid thus to it, Ariſe, devour much fleſh.</p>
               <p>This verſe means the preſent Empreſs of Ruſſia: She is according to the judgment of God in this prophecy, decreed to ſuffer death: and by

revelation I am informed it will be done by the hands of man.</p>
               <p n="6">6. After this, I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard: which had on its back four wings of a fowl; the beaſt had alſo four heads, and dominion was given to it.</p>
               <p>The leopard, means Louis the ſixteenth king of France: the wings of a fowl on its back, is, like the eagle's on the lion, an alluſion to the king's great moveable power.</p>
               <p>The fall of this monarch from a throne, and afterwards ſuffering death, to fulfil the judgment of God by his prophet Daniel, was impoſſible for all the armies of Europe to prevent; equally ſo as the decreed death of Charles the firſt, king of England, which is mentioned by St. John in the thirteenth chapter and third verſe of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>the deadly wound being healed,</hi> in the ſame verſe; means the <hi>recovery</hi> of monarchy <hi>by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration</hi> of Charles the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="7">7. After this I ſaw in the night viſions a fourth beaſt; and behold, it was dreadful, and terrible, and ſtrong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured, broke in pieces, and ſtamped on the reſidue (meaning the electors) with its feet; it was different from all the beaſts that were ſeen before, and it had ten horns.</p>
               <p>This great beaſt, ſo different from the others, means the preſent Emperor of Germany; the ten horns, mean the electors, or princes of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028359_0014_0FD8C57694C86B58"/>In one part of this chapter the horns are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated kings; the reaſon is, they raiſe armies, go to war, and govern with abſolute power, like them; but notwithſtanding, they all acknowledge the Emperor as their chief, and under that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ſubjection are ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to defend his empire when called on. For which, to conceal the meaning of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, until the fulneſs of time comes and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon for it to be revealed to, the viſion repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the German princes as horns of defence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Emperor's head.</p>
               <p>It devoured, broke in pieces, and ſtamped on the reſidue with its feet—means the entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the German electors; and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their territories by the Emperor: he will deſtroy them, and alſo ſpread his dominion over Italy; threatening at the ſame time all Europe, and deſpiſing its kings with their feeble efforts to oppoſe him. Rome will fall under his power, and ſo will Venice likewiſe; the former will be retaken by the French republic, but the latter will be plundered and almoſt deſtroyed. After this, to fulfil the prophecy and the judgment of God, he will ſuffer death from the hands of man.</p>
               <p>The orders of the Emperor, in the Netherlands are, that if the Auſtrian army ſhould be defeated, <hi>and it moſt ſurely will,</hi> for I am commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, as an example and warning, what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

               <p>By the ſame example, if the French army was to be defeated, even again, and again it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and conquer likewiſe; (that all the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, in the ſeventh chapter of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Daniel, may take their courſe, and be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,) to acknowledge the French republic, and make an immediate peace on the beſt terms that can be obtained, the intereſts of other nations will not be much conſulted: time, the threats of a victorious enemy, and the perilous condition of the German army, will not admit the leaſt delay.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh will ſharply remonſtrate againſt this conduct; for which their army, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible it may appear to the Government now, will be ſurrounded, diſarmed, and commanded to depart: but their General will be detained by the Auſtrian; and by revelation from the Lord God to me, he falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>The Emperor being exhauſted of money by the war, but having a large army at his command,

determines, now he has made peace with the French, and quarrelled with the Engliſh, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the plan he has for ſome time conceived the hopes of being one day able to accompliſh— his father and uncle, ſtrange as it may appear, yet it is moſt certainly true, for I am informed, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, conceived the ſame deſign, and believed the attempt eaſily practicable when the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offered, which is—<hi>the reduction of all Germany, under the ſole government of himſelf.</hi>

               <p>He begins with ſeizing on the electorate of Hanover, and plundering it quite bare: after this ſucceſs, his ambition for more extenſive dominion will riſe; it will now lead him boldly forward to ſubject and devour them all. For God, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his judgments, and this prophecy of Daniel, in chapter vii. will deliver him over, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the ſecret, but powerful workings of an evil ſpirit; becauſe his inclinations are bad: according to all that I informed the King and Queen of in May and June 1792; as he did Ahab, king of Iſrael, to accompliſh his fall, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire deſtruction of his family.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:028359_0021_0FD8C53ABA3B3DE8"/>This little horn, that grows great, and becomes ſo ambitious as to pluck up three of the other horns, to extend his own dominion, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent king of Pruſſia. He is one of the imperial electors, and to fulfil exactly what the viſions of God deſcribe him to be, he confidently calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in great words,—The preponderating mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Germanic body.</p>
               <p>The king of Pruſſia will acknowledge the French republic, and alſo make peace with it: he will oppoſe the Emperor, and likewiſe follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; by which his dominions, to fulfil the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, will be enlarged (comparatively for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only) by the addition of three electorates, when the Bear, (meaning Ruſſia,) watching for the opportunity, <hi>will riſe</hi> and devour Pruſſia at one ſide, while the Emperor deſtroys him at the other. His armies will be defeated, and his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol ſet on fire by the Bear: his life will be taken away from the earth, and his monarchy, to fulfil the everlaſting decrees of the Lord God, in the prophecy of Daniel, will be deſtroyed; never, never, to be reſtored any more.</p>
               <p>Ruſſia will aſſiſt the Emperor in the beginning to promote her favourite deſign of deſtroying the Turkiſh empire; ſhe will alſo quarrel with the Poles, and devour great numbers of them; War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw will be ſet on fire, and the government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely changed. At this time the Ruſſian army, (or Bear,) as if impatient for its food, <hi>to riſe and

devour much fleſh,</hi> will enter Turkey, and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively run over the land; treading down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring with great fury, all oppoſition in its way. At the capitol it ſtops; here are its decreed bounds; no farther it muſt go. Here the Ruſſian general divides the ſpoils of many cities with his army, and the rich provinces of Turkey between his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Here he deſpiſes the oath of fidelity, and throws away the ſubmiſſion of a ſubject—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming himſelf Emperor of Greece.</p>
               <p>After this the Swedes will enter Ruſſia, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy with great fury; even the ſhips of war and capitol will not eſcape. The Ruſſian empire will be convulſed in many parts by its general and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, each riſing up in his place, and claiming an authority to command the other: they will fight until great multitudes are deſtroyed, and the country made deſolate. The imperial family will all be cut off, and no ſucceſſor will for ever after ariſe; the government, at the ſame time, will be broke to pieces, and utterly diſſolved; never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to be reſtored any more.</p>
               <p>The Spaniſh Monarchy will ceaſe by this war, and the Stadholderſhip of Holland will be cut off cloſe to the ground; according to the viſions of God to me, in 1792, and which I communicated at that time by his ſacred command to the king and queen of England.</p>
               <p>The king of Sardinia will be dethroned, and the Popedom deſtroyed for ever! according to

the revelation of God to me, and which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Engliſh prime miniſter before the war with France was entered into; concluding what I wrote to him with theſe words—It is not all the navy of England, nor the armies of Europe united, can prevent the king of Sardinia from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dethroned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>death of the French king,</hi> as one of the particular number mentioned in the ſeventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Daniel, decreed to die, took place, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the pre-determined judgment of God by this prophet; the monarchy of France is likewiſe by the ſame judgment, aboliſhed for ever, and the preſent form of government eſtabliſhed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marvel no more that it cannot be conquered by all the armies without, nor deſtroyed by all the commotions within; if it could, by human power, the <hi>Horn</hi> (meaning the king of Pruſſia) would be the alloted man to accompliſh it: for the meaning of the prophecy is, that he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt France for three years and a half, but not to conquer the whole: he would have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept with his army in France the promiſes he made with his mouth on entering it; which were, to deliver over the towns for plunder, and the people for death, if he was oppoſed. It is for this that he is deſcribed by Daniel, to have a <hi>mouth ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies.</hi> All this would have been permitted, becauſe record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to fulfil the prophecy; to haſten his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,

both you and him in certain death? What I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted you with in 1792, and often ſince, was made known to me by <hi>viſions and revelations</hi> from the Lord God. The <hi>death of Louis</hi> XVI. and the removal of the Engliſh crown from the king's head, to a level with the ground, according to the ſeventh chapter of Daniel; the fall of the queen's palace, and the deſtruction of the tower; your own removal from adminiſtration, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards death, was among the things which I informed you of, would moſt certainly come to paſs as the evil conſequences of this deluſive war.

               <p>When I informed you that England would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this war, and the conſequences which would, in deſpite of all your efforts, flow from it, <hi>you deſpiſed me;</hi> for, at that time, the war was not intended; and to tell of evils that would moſt certainly enſue from a thing, when the thing they were to proceed from was not deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were to you the effects of folly and deceit.</p>
               <p>My knowledge of future things is given me from God; therefore what I wrote was true: A little time longer, and England will be ſo much entangled as not to be able to go forward without feeling the pains of that <hi>colonial conqueſt</hi> which is to be the cauſe of her death; nor to retire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling under that foreign blow, which will

               <p>The Lord God commands me to acknowledge the kindneſs of a poor woman, that brought me a three-penny loaf each week, every Monday morning, when I was in priſon Her name is Iſabella Wake. The priſon is Newgate.</p>
               <p>A man that died the day before, of a bad fever, and from neglect, for the want of proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I was told, made a vacancy in a room, with fourteen poor men, little air, and much crouded, for me to come into his place.</p>
               <p>The ſmall, very ſmall pennyworth of bread, with water only, except one day in the week, when there are a few ounces of beef, for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four hours, is barely ſufficient to keep life and body together. The priſon is very cloſe; there is not room enough to promote health, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary exerciſe of walking: there are no coals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028359_0065_0FD8C5CF22B93C88"/>
for fire, nor candles for light. There is no bed to lie on, nor blanket to cover one; The poor are entirely deſtitute here.</p>
               <p>When the condition of priſons, and the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of priſoners, is required for public informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is from the poor man, whoſe health is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by confinement, who has to draw his little air through a ſmall iron-barred window, who has but a ſmall pennyworth of bread allowed for the whole day to live on, that a true account is to be received; but certainly not from the officers, keepers, and contractors, who live in plenty, whoſe emoluments ſwell in proportion as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons grow crouded.</p>
               <p>Therefore be no longer aſtoniſhed that Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in one part of the Revelation is called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the great city, <hi>for ſhe is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt city in Europe, and the richeſt in the world;</hi> in another part ſhe is called Sodom; and in a third, ſhe is, as well as Rome, <hi>ſpiritually called</hi> Babylon the Great.</p>
               <p>No man, who has any knowledge of God, can juſtly ſay, that London is without guilt, and her people are without ſin; when her ſtreets are full of vice, and her priſons are full of oppreſſion.</p>

               <p>All this has been told me by revelation, from the Lord God, in viſions of the night.</p>
               <p>There are many of my family, which have heard of me, and with which the Spirit of God has given me favour, that do not want either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or ability to demonſtrate their friendſhip; but they are deterred, from a fear of offending government, and from a fear of incurring the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of guilt, by being generous.</p>

               <p n="6">6. And he ſhall turn the heart of the fathers to their children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, leſt I come and ſmite the earth with a curſe.</p>
               <p>The Elijah, mentioned in this chapter, and the meſſenger, mentioned in the firſt verſe of the third chapter, mean two diſtinct perſons. The one was the immediate meſſenger of Chriſt, when he came for the ſalvation of mankind; the other, his recorded prophet, to pronounce his judgments, and warn the world, before he comes to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>This is that great prophet, alluded to in the chapter, under the name of Elijah, and not St. John the Baptiſt: he will poſſeſs the Spirit of God equal to Elijah, and have the power of his fire in the ſame manner. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers; that is, he will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>war and violence,</hi> which ſets the old againſt the young and the young againſt the old.

               <p>The appointment of this prophet, being to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite firſt, and compel after, all nations to come into the kingdom of peace, as a neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to meet Chriſt, when he comes to viſit and judge the world: St. John the Baptiſt, for being appointed to prepare for Chriſt, preaching the ſame kingdom of peace, and promiſing, by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, mercy to all that would believe, is the real and very reaſon, that Chriſt, in the ſeventeenth chapter of St. Matthew, calls him Elias.</p>
               <p>At a former time, when I was entreating God to ſpare London, I mentioned no man by his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: but when I was writing an account of it for public information, he ſaid to me, "unleſs you write their titles, they themſelves wont know who you mean." It will appear ſtrange, becauſe I am not acquainted with any of the diſtinguiſhed perſons alluded to; but I knew every one by ſome particular act that caught my approbation, and made me remember them then. It ſeemed as if God had done this on purpoſe, for he has often ſaid to me ſince, in viſions and revelations at night, You muſt be a wall of defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to many a great man;—yes, even to ſome that deſpiſe you now. At that time, after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning

the name of William Pitt, I paſſed by that of his brother; immediately after, the Lord God reminded me of it, and, in a voice of great ſoftneſs and good nature, ſaid, There is <hi>John Pitt,</hi> won't you mention him? You don't know who he is <hi>I forgave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year of 1790 the Spirit of God begun firſt, (although I always had a preſentiment of being ſometime or other very great) to enlighten my underſtanding, and teach me to diſtinguiſh right from wrong. At that time I was an officer in the navy, and conſidering that voluntary ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I was obliged to comply with, every ſix months as a qualification to receive my pay, was unneceſſary, unjuſt, and wicked, I requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be indulged with permiſſion to receive it without; ſtating at the ſame time, the concealed and unheeded cruelty of the oath, with my own reaſons for objecting to the form: when I was told, in anſwer to my requeſt, that there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to diſpenſe with it.</p>
               <p>Soon after this I made another requeſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting my objections to voluntary ſwearing, with obſerving, That if the <hi>order of council</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced an oath in any manner or under any form whatever, and that the man it was directed to operate on, ſwore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a voluntary act—<hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult

of his own free will</hi>—would it not in the ſight of God in heaven, and every <hi>man</hi> of diſcernment under him on earth, amount to a falſe oath?</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons with theſe objections, and the letter I received from the admiralty, ſtating their inſufficient power to diſpenſe with the uſual form of ſwearing, I publiſhed at that time in the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper called the <hi>Public Advertiſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of my writing officially to the admiralty, I had occaſion to write alſo to the preſident, whom I knew to be a member of the council; with the buſineſs of ſwearing which led me to make an application, I remarked to him; that as men, whether few in number, or the encreaſed multitude of a ſenate were not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they muſt conſequently be ſubject to error. To corroborate more forcibly this aſſertion, and likewiſe to impreſs a conviction of its juſtice, I mentioned among other things a deciſion of the privy counſel relative to a native of Glaſgow, who had his ſhip ſeized in the Weſt Indies for an <hi>undeſigned</hi> infringement of the Navigation act.</p>
               <p>After a legal inveſtigation in that country, it was clearly proved and openly acknowledged, that although the apparent defect in the regiſter might authorize the ſeizure, it could not juſtify a condemnation; becauſe the commander, <hi>like an honeſt man,</hi> ſhewed it at the Cuſtom-houſe, and received the approbation of the principal officer.</p>
               <p>An appeal was lodged againſt this acquittal by
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028359_0072_0FD8C5E8E4BE76B0"/>
the ſeizing officer in the Weſt Indies, and brought before the privy council in England!—the ſhip was condemned.</p>
               <p>To conſtitute a high court of equity, its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to pronounce their judgment agreeable to that very name their exiſtence as a court is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from, muſt be governed more by the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> than the preſumptive proof. But to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a court of law, its judges muſt be directed by the expreſs letter of the act of parliament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they officiate.</p>
               <p>For example, two men go into a foreſt; while the one is fetching a blow to cut down a tree, the axe flies from the handle and kills the other: Here is a preſumptive proof of murder, and the law very juſtly brings the ſurvivor to trial. But <hi>equity,</hi> viewing this circumſtance in a proper light, declares the innocence, and acquits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Another, and more relevant to the ſeizure. A man buys a ſtamp, to legaliſe a bond for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity of trading with his money, <hi>or in plainer language, lending it on intereſt;</hi> to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this ſtamp is warrantably juſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſcribed forms of law, he ſhews it at the ſtamp-office, where it is acknowledged to be good and ſafe: after this, in conſequence of ſome defect, it is declared illegal, and the holder ſubjected to a penalty.</p>
               <p>I believe every man on earth, that has the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028359_0073_0FD8C5EA6ED71AA8"/>
faculty of diſtinguiſhing white from black, will agree with me in ſaying, that it would be repugnant to equity to fine the holder for a defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that he had no knowledge of as ſuch, and for what was authorized by the very office of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that always iſſued the ſtamps.</p>
               <p>The law ſuppoſes criminality from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but equity meaſures it from the deſign. The one is external and viſible, provided many years before it may be wanted: the one is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſpiritual, always alive in the heart of every judge that poſſeſſes prudence, learning, and penetration.</p>
               <p>When I was writing of theſe things to the Earl of Chatham, on my knees I made a ſolemn vow to the Almighty God, declaring that if he would be pleaſed to enable me, I would moſt ſurely procure an indemnification for the poor man that loſt his ſhip. Since that time the Lord God has told me, by revelation at night, That he would moſt truly enable me: for if I liked, I ſhould be Preſident of the Council, and Chancellor of the Exchequer: I ſhould have any thing that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Immediately after this, I heard another voice from heaven, ſay, The Lord have mercy on them, if they had not you for their friend and counſellor; for England is the Spiritual Egypt mentioned in the eleventh chapter of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to St. John.</p>
               <p>After making the numerous repreſentations I
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028359_0074_0FD8C5EF055130D8"/>
have mentioned, the Earl of Chatham, with great propriety, acknowledged their juſtice ſo far as to eraſe the word <hi>Voluntary</hi> from the preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed form of ſwearing: but I was then reminded of the words of Chriſt in the 5th chapter, 34th verſe of St. Matthew, and ſtrictly commanded to obey them. Soon after this, I requeſted from the admiralty, and often repeated it, a diſpenſing order that I might receive my pay without an oath; but they would not grant it.</p>
               <p>If the Earl of Chatham had ſhewn me the ſmall favour I aſked for, and certainly it would have been but a very ſmall one to him, he ſhould be held up to the world, as my friend, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and regarded; he ſhould wear ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable coronet as would make him the envy of princes; it ſhould be a coronet that no human power would ever be able to remove.</p>
               <p>As the admiralty would not give me that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable indulgence I requeſted, as they would not ſhew me that kindneſs which, as men living by the navy, they might have done with eaſe, and without prejudice to their dignity; I wanted for a bit of bread to eat: I was beſides treated ſo ill, as to be dragged to a work houſe without any legal authority, againſt every remonſtrance I could make, and againſt every threat I could make uſe of to call them to a ſtrict account for the injuſtice. The admiralty knew all this; they might have prevented it, by ordering what was
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028359_0075_0FD8C5F1EC391738"/>
due to me to be paid; but they would neither prevent the evil, nor enable me to be liberated: they would not order the payment of what was due, until open falſehood was made uſe of to ſay I was out of my ſenſes. It ſeemed as if they were under ſome private apprehenſion, though pleaſed with my diſtreſs, of being charged one day or other in the eyes of their country with unfeeling cruelty, and wanted ſome kind of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable evidence to juſtify the proceeding.</p>
               <p>Hear, therefore, all nations, and be warned by it, what the Lord God has told me by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and now commands me to write, that the injuries I received, becauſe done for obeying his word in the bleſſed, Goſpel, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them ſhould never be blotted out from the throne of heaven. Moreover, he ſaid, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that he would ſhake the Engliſh admiralty as a man would violently bread in a baſket, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he looſed the foundations of the earth, and ſhook the place in pieces.</p>
               <p>If I am out of my ſenſes, in the opinion of the admiralty, for refuſing, firſt to take an idle oath, ſecondly, a falſe one, and thirdly, to take any: Chriſt, the Saviour of the world, and him that Iſaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, who prohibits by his Goſpel in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms all kind of ſwearing, muſt, by the ſame rule of knowledge for giving ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, be out of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:028359_0076_0FD8C5F1EE603528"/>As the Quakers never ſwear, and their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to it are ſanctioned by a juſt indulgence of law; they, the king and parliament, for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indulgence, muſt, for the ſame reaſon as I am, be out of theirs.</p>
               <p>Chriſt having been abuſed at Jeruſalem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with having a devil, being mad, and out of his ſenſes, makes it the leſs aſtoniſhing for me, that am his ſervant, to be reviled in the ſame manner: For which the Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to remind all men, from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his bleſſed Goſpel, that the ſin is blaſphemy againſt his Holy Spirit, and that the puniſhment is everlaſting fire.</p>
               <p>It is from viſions and revelations, and through the Holy Ghoſt, that I write this book for the benefit of all men: therefore, to ſay it is falſe, that I am mad, am an impoſter, have a devil, or am out of my ſenſes, conſtitutes the dangerous ſin of blaſphemy.</p>

            <head>The following are ſome more of the <hi>VISIONS,</hi> which God ſhewed me, and which I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to publiſh here.</head>
            <p>In the month called July, 1791, I was in a viſion, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God to the ſea coaſt, in the Engliſh channel—a new ridge of unknown land was brought in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant plain to my eyes, while the finger of a hand wrote, in large capital letters, with great quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a voice pronounced twice from heaven, at the ſame time,
<q>SWEDE! SWEDE!</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this I was in a viſion in the month of January 1792, and was carried away by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to Sweden, when I was made look
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028359_0083_0FD8C606ED475AB8"/>
through a window in a room; I did, and ſaw a man walk from the ſide of a great chair, leaving it empty. I could not ſee his face as he went away, and although I could perceive that he had committed any crime, I thought with myſelf that he had been doing wrong. Immediately the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that ſtood by me ſaid, The chair means the chair of ſtate; and that man you ſaw will make it empty. The king of Sweden is <hi>delivered over for death,</hi> and that is the very man that will ſhoot him.</p>
            <p>The prince of Orange is cloſely purſued like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but he is not delivered over yet.</p>
            <p>After this I was in a viſion, and ſaw the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian eagle perched on a chair of ſtate? ſoon after, on a ſudden, I ſaw the chair, the houſe, and the whole city where the chair ſtood, in flames. The angel that was near me, ſaid, he is likewiſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued now.</p>
            <p>After this I was in a viſion, and the Lord God talked with me, and ſaid, I give you the life of the Swede: but know this for certain, that if yov prevent his death, the man himſelf will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was any danger of it. And when you write hereafter of things in this country, you will be called an impoſter, a fool, and a liar: you will be impriſoned, and treated very ill. When I ſee this it will make me angry; I will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to kill the people, and I will ſurely deſtroy this city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028359_0084_0FD8C6086F3FA078"/>For which I gave no public information to warn the king of Sweden, and prevented his death. Had this man lived, he would have commanded the German army againſt France; his private plan was to go through Normandy, cloſe by the ſea coaſt, to be ſupplied the eaſier with proviſions from England, and endeavour by all poſſible means, to take the harbour of Breſt.</p>
            <p>He ſaid to himſelf, in his own cloſet, this is the plan I will purſue; It will be giving a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow to the French navy, and getting a ſafe harbour for our own ſhips.</p>
            <p>All this was made known to me by revelation from the Lord God; and which I communicated to the queen and miniſter of ſtate in 1792, ſome time before the provinces of Brittany and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, ſhewed any open appearance of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt the preſent government of France.</p>
            <p>In the month of April 1793, I was in a viſion, and was carried away in the ſpirit of God to Ruſſia, where I ſaw a bear ſtop to reſt itſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a large tree; ſoon after I beheld a man, that lay concealed among the branches drop down ſoftly, and with a ſharp piece of iron, which he held in his hand, ſtab the bear; pronouncing, as he did ſo, I have watched a long time for you, but now, I have caught you at laſt.</p>
            <p>I know, by revelation from the Lord God, that this viſion means the preſent empreſs of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028359_0085_0FD8C60D85BBE928"/>
Ruſſia; for which, being permitted, I give her this warning.</p>
            <p>Let the death of the king of Sweden and France which is but a little time paſt; the death of the king of Spain and another, which will ſoon take place, for they are purſued; convince the princes and the people of Europe, that the ſeventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Daniel and the ſecond of Haggai are now fulfilling.</p>
            <p>At a former time, when, the Lord God was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing me in a knowledge of the laws and other things, relative to the nation I am appointed to govern, he ſaid, in a viſion of the night, when I bring princes and people from all nations to bow down to you; when I begin to exalt you above kings of the earth—Be ſober, be modeſt, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. And immediately after he added, you may inform the king of England that I call you my nephew.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of March, 1794, I was in a viſion, and ſaw the ſun in its full ſtrength, clear and high up in the firmament: ſoon after I ſaw another ſun riſe on a ſudden, equally large as the former, and ſtand cloſe by it; both ſhone with equal brightneſs, and the laſt as well as the firſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the world.</p>
            <p>After the firſt diviſion of this copy was ſent to be printed, and even ſome of it done, the printer was adviſed not to do it according to my form; for, if he did, proſecution, impriſonment, and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028359_0086_0FD8C60E6429CC18"/>
perhaps hanging, would be the conſequence to him. For which the Lord God commands me to keep back the additional information that otherways would be given, and terminate the book.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid already that the ſixth chapter of the Revelation was now fulfilling: the <hi>four firſt ſeals</hi> are opened, and the covering, which kept the meaning of the prophecies a profound ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the preſent time, is removed: <hi>recorded</hi> decrees are held up, and God himſelf commands a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their contents to be publiſhed for the good of all nations. But if I cannot have the commands of God, and a knowledge of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, printed exactly as I write, how is this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of mercy to be known over Europe, and the people of London informed of any danger that is paſt or any danger that is to come? All the prophecies in the Scripture were given by men: the Ninevites were warned through one.</p>
            <p>How is the king to ſave himſelf from that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,</hi> determined, unavoidable death, which all the powers of armies cannot prevent? How is Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and the parliament to be ſaved, when they are recorded in the ſcripture of truth to be deſtroyed? How is England, Europe, and moſt parts of the world to be ſaved, when they are recorded to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with blood by war, and to be made deſolate for ever by earthquakes, if the perſon I employ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trered
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028359_0087_0FD8BD6CC07E4050"/>
by the fears of perſecution and evil, from printing the full copy, exactly as I give it?</p>
            <p>The king of Egypt and his people were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, becauſe they would not believe Moſes; but the king of Nineveh and his people were ſaved, becauſe they did believe Jonah and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>The king of England, the chancellor of the Exchequer, ſecretaries of ſtate, other members of adminiſtration, and as many members of both houſes of parliament, as my ability will allow; the biſhops, judges, and all the foreign ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors in London; will have a book ſent to each.</p>
            <p>On account of my being inſulted, becauſe the Jews do not believe in the firſt book, by a public acknowledgment of it, the Lord God commands me to remind all men of what is wrote in that book, and to ſay, that as the Jews do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, it cannot he expected that they will in me; <hi>neither are they,</hi> until I am revealed in a ſimilar manner to Moſes in Egypt, but with the additional power of fire as his ſign, to make them.</p>
            <p>The night before I had finiſhed this book for the preſs, the Lord God ſhewed it to me in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ready printed, holding it up at the ſame time by one leaf, and ſhaking all the others open, while he pronounced, in ſtrong clear words, and commanded me to writ them down exactly as he ſpoke, for univerſal information:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:028359_0088_0FD8C616A72AB008"/>There is nothing in this book that the Engliſh law can take hold of:—So ſays him that Iſaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Counſellor.</p>
            <p>I requeſt every body, in all nations, to read this book with attention, and receive it favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; for although the information and warning it contains is through me, yet it is not mine, but God's.</p>

               <p n="4">4. That the Lord called, Samuel; and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, here am I. And he ran unto Eli, and ſaid, here am I; for thou calledſt me. And he ſaid, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel roſe, and went to Eli, and ſaid, here am I; for thou didſt call me. And he anſwered, I called not, my ſon; lie down again.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he aroſe, and went to Eli, and ſaid,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028359_0103_0FD8C63C31016CE8"/>
here am I; for thou didſt call me. And Eli per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Lord had called the child.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Therefore Eli ſaid to Samuel, Go, lie down, and it ſhall be, if he call thee, that thou ſhalt ſay, ſpeak, Lord; for thy ſervant heareth. So Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel went and lay down in his place.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the Lord came and ſtood, and called, as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el anſwered, ſpeak, Lord; for thy ſervant heareth. And the Lord ſaid to Samuel, behold, I will do a thing in Iſrael, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle.</p>

               <p>1794. The 25th of the month called June, the Lord God ſaid to me, in a viſion of the night, on my bed, in ſeven days more the judgment will be on this nation.</p>
               <p>After this I was in a viſion, and the Lord God brought cloſe to me, that I might hear the report of a gun that was fired, and ſee a man privately ſhoot at another to kill him: it was ſo near, that I ſaw the flaſh, and ſmelt the powder. Before the death of the king of Sweden I was ſhewn, in a viſion, ſimilar to this, that he would be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over from the protection of God, to be ſhot.</p>

He will be ſhot, but not killed; he will be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not mortally.</p>
               <p>He has not believed me at any time, although I fully informed him in 1792, and ſince, that it would be ſo; neither will he, until the very evil is viſited on him: and viſited on him, to increaſe his diſtreſs, at a time when he is ſurrounded with danger, and loaded with trouble: it moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will. Then the king of England will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, by woeful and feeling proofs, but it will be very late:—comparatively, when death knocks at the door, that he deſpiſed the offered mercy of God in 1792, and conſtantly ſince his beſt friend, among mankind, as falſe.</p>
               <p>In the month called March, 1794, I was in a viſion, and the Lord God ſhewed me a large and very tall oak tree; it ſtood alone; it was entirely wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and all its branches were cut off While I was conſidering the tree, its lonely condition and nakedneſs, I heard a very loud voice call out of heaven, how down that tree. Immediately the the tree was covered with a thick cloud of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and an angel deſcended from God, who ſtruck the tree with ſo violent a blow that it fell to the ground, and in its fall it made a great noiſe.</p>

Our Father, which art in heaven; hallowed be thy name; thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come; <hi>which is the kingdom of peace;</hi> is very good: but the next form of prayer is beſeeching God to go forth with fleets and armies: this is very bad, becauſe it is in direct oppoſition to the former; it encourages, ſtrife, hatred, war, and bloodſhed; it is calling on God to keep back his kingdom, and to overthrow his own goſpel of peace. The worſhip of Chriſtians ought to be pure, humble, and peaceable, without any mixture of politics or directional conſtraints from human law.</p>

               <p>Turn from ſuch deceitful unmanly ways, and endeavour to live long; for it is the word of God through a man that points at the crime, and warns you to forſake, what muſt, if you do not, lead to certain death: for, believe me, the day of deſtruction to puniſh diſobedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is ſo very nigh, that it will take place before

               <p>Remember, God created man in his own image and likeneſs, and created the earth for his uſe; that man might believe in him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his commands.</p>

               <p>The Lord God is great, merciful, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate to forgive all that do entreat and obey his commands; but be aſſured, he is alſo great, mighty, and powerful, jealous of his ſacred name and honour when given to men: and he can do now what he did of old, <hi>they are recorded for our example and warning,</hi> that is, overthrow cities, and deſtroy multitudes in an inſtant.</p>

               <p n="42">42. I Eſdras, ſaw upon the Mount Zion a great multitude of people, whom I could not number, and they all praiſed the Lord with ſongs.</p>
               <p n="43">43. And in the midſt of them there was a young man of a high ſtature, taller than all the reſt, and upon every one of their heads he ſet crowns, and was more exalted; which I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at greatly.</p>
               <p n="44">
                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:028359_0121_0FD8C69626E0E568"/>44. So I aſked the angel, and ſaid, Sir, what are theſe? He anſwered and ſaid to me, theſe be they that have put off the mortal cloathing, and put on the immortal: (It means the Jews, who, when I am revealed, will acknowledge that the Lord Chriſt is the Lord God: then they will put off the mortal cloathing unbelief and error, and put on the immortal cloathing of faith and righteouſneſs) and have confeſſed the name, of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Then ſaid I to the angel, what young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that which crowns them, and gives them palms in their hands. So he anſwered and ſaid to me, it is the Son of God, whom they have confeſſed in the world. Then I began greatly to recommend them that ſtood ſo ſtifly for the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The Son of God, alluded to here, is not the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways erroneouſly ſuppoſed; but a human being, of fleſh and blood, like any other. It is a man, and but a man; though recorded, and honoured with being called the Son of God.

great power and extended goodneſs of God. It is that man, whom God has deſigned to be the viſible prince of Iſrael. As a believer in God, <hi>by, and through Chriſt, the divine Spirit of Truth,</hi> and an obeyer of his commands, he is a ſon, an adopted ſon: ſo is every man under heaven an acknowledged ſon, whether rich or poor, that does the ſame; and ſo is every woman likewiſe, an adopted, an acknowledged daughter.</p>
               <p>Remember the words of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, where he ſays, after this manner therefore pray ye, Our Father which art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c. As God then is our father, we, that acknowledge and pray to him as ſuch, are ſurely his ſons and daughters.</p>
               <p>All that believe in the teſtimony of God by me, which he now commands me to make known, are his people, a part <hi>(becauſe the viſible Jews are the great body)</hi> of that innumerable multitude, ſhewn by the angel to Eſdras, crowned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving palms.</p>
               <p>The Lord God commands me to remind all people of the loud thunder that was on the 7th of Auguſt laſt, and to ſay, it was a threat from him to deſtroy London, ſooner than ſuffer me to be hurt: take it for a warning, and beware of the dreadful conſequences that will moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue, if a ſimilar injury is intended againſt me: for if you, the Engliſh Government, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to moleſt me, the Lord God is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

               <p>For thoſe unhappy men, which compoſe it, as if the injuſtice of the preſent war was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to provoke him, have imprudently gone on, adding evil to evil, and now, more than before, publicly encourage blaſphemy againſt him, and abuſe againſt his prophet. Why do they do ſo? ſaid the Lord God to me. Why? becauſe you have not their <hi>mark,</hi> but my ſeal; you have not their authority, the laying on the hands of their biſhops, to give the Holy Ghoſt to prophecy by, but my Spirit, <hi>yet thoſe are the men that pretend to judge of ſpirits,</hi> to diſcern the good from the evil: they ſuppoſe every man, that ſpeaks or writes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and influence of God, is a falſe prophet, an impoſtor under deluſion; becauſe the words of truth, by him, go to contradict their mark, their human ordinances, and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal forms of prayer.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſays, in the fifteenth chapter of his Goſpel by St. Matthew, "but in vain they do worſhip me, teaching, for doctrines, the commandments of men.</p>

               <p>The Lord God commands me to ſay, for the information of the Engliſh government, the judges, and all men, that the priſoners, now in confinement, and on trial for their lives, charged with the crime of High Treaſon againſt the life of the king of England, are innocent: as ſuch, he requires me to make known to the king his ſacred commands in writing, and to publiſh this for the knowledge of all.</p>
               <p>The Lord God commands me to inform, through this book, all that honour him—his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants—the peaceable and righteous in all nations, which have had their property, whether in land or money, confiſcated, for no other reaſon than becauſe the nation they belonged to declared war againſt the nation they lived in, all ſuch proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

               <p>And you, Peter Woulſe, one of the Avignon Society, whom the Lord my God commands me to mention here by name, as a teſtimony of his great regard, your property, confiſcated in France, will all be reſtored with intereſt, and much kindneſs ſhewn to you by the members of its government: they will reſtore the property of every other <hi>peaceable individual</hi> likewiſe: by the ſame divine rule of juſtice, Spain, England, Pruſſia, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Holland, and all other nations in Europe, muſt reſtore theirs. For the time of the world is juſt now come, and God is firmly determined to manifeſt his mighty power, for the prſervation of his people and ſaints, by fulfilling by me his words in the eleventh chapter of Iſaiah, a part of which are— But with righteouſneſs he will judge the poor, and reprove, with equity, for the meek of the earth; and he ſhall ſmite the earth with the road of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he ſhall ſlay the wicked.</p>

            <p>This beaſt means the Engliſh monarchy; and it is by ſhips and commerce that it has roſe from the ſea to ſuch aſtoniſhing grandeur and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The heads, horns, and crowns, allude to the many departments of government, and their ſplendid diſtinctions. The Blaſphemy means the titles given to, and aſſumed by the king of England; ſuch as, Our moſt Gracious Sovereign Lord, ſacred Perſon, Majeſty, defender of the Faith, and ſupreme head of the Church; all which names belong to God, he only can be what they expreſs, and when they are applied to any other, the ſin is blaſphemy in his ſight.</p>

            <p>The beginning of this verſe means the death of Charles the firſt, king of England: and the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound being healed, means the recovery of monarchy by the reſtoration of Charles the ſecond. During the interval of time between the death and ſucceſſion, all the world wondered if the Engliſh monarchy would ever be reſtored again.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If any man have an ear let him hear. He that leads into captivity, ſhall go into captivity: he that kills with the ſword muſt be killed with the ſword. Here is the patience and the faith of the ſaints.</p>
            <p>The leading into captivity means impriſonment and ſlavery: and killing with the ſword, means violence and war. The patience of the ſaints is, to bear quietly with thoſe evils, and to reſiſt the temptations of wealth to do them: All that have faith in God will not do ſuch things, from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that they are offenſive, becauſe he commands them not.</p>

               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:028359_0130_0FD8C6808E9A4030"/>11. And I beheld another beaſt coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he ſpake as a dragon.</p>
            <p>This verſe means the Elector of Hanover. Coming up out of the earth, is to ſignify that his country or government is ſituated inland. The horns of a lamb, and the voice of a dragon, means that although he is weak in power like a lamb, yet by his voice he can threaten in great and mighty words like a dragon.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And he exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt before him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It means the elector of Hanover's ſucceſſion to the crown, place, and power of the former king of England. To fulfil this part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy given by revelation to St. John, the utter expulſion of the Stuart family muſt againſt all human oppoſition have taken place to admit the elector of Hanover.</p>
            <p>A great part of this chapter is taken up in deſcribing the king and parliament. I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to inform both of the recorded judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, the dangers which threaten them, and their certainty of taking place, unleſs they implore him for mercy, and obtain it.</p>
            <p>They have individually promiſed, by their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and godmothers, in the ſacred covenant of baptiſm, and acknowledge a confirmation of it by receiving the ſacrament, (for both were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) to believe in
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028359_0131_0FD8C6A01C54A7B0"/>
him and obey his commands; yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this heavieſt of all obligations which a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being can enter into, (for it is with his God,) and on the performance of which his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation depends, the laws they make a part of the Thirty nine Articles, and ſome of the forms of prayer, uſed in public worſhip, goes more to break the covenant of baptiſm, to diſhonour God, and oppoſe an obedience to his bleſſed Goſpel, than was ever authoriſed in any other nation.</p>
            <p>Without ſubmitting to the forms of law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by act of parliament, which are in direct oppoſition to the commands of Chriſt, and very ſinful to do, no man can hold any place of profit or truſt, enjoy the privilege of freedom, and comparatively to buy or ſell.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And that no man might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Here is wiſdom. Let him that has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding count the number of the beaſt: for it is the number of a man; and his number is ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix.</p>
            <p>This verſe means the the Engliſh parliament; and although it exceeds the number mentioned here, yet notwithſtanding, it is the real and very aſſembly of men alluded to in the Revelation, by the number of 666.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the parliament acknowledge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the king by the divine names which belong
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028359_0132_0FD8C682AA1C70F8"/>
only to God; ſuch as, our moſt gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord, Sire, Majeſty, and honour him with equal humility in ſupplication, when they require any thing, as if he really was the Lord of heaven and earth; ſuch as, Humbly praying that your Majeſty would be moſt graciouſly pleaſed, &amp;c. Therefore God, in his great anger, being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his name and honour, calls the king a beaſt, and the parliament his image and number.</p>

               <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. 1. And I looked, and lo, a lamb ſtood on Mount Sion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thouſand, having his father's name written in their fore-heads</p>
            <p>The lamb, mentioned here, means myſelf as Prince of the Hebrews; and Mount Sion, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: the hundred and forty-four thouſand with me, having the name of my father wrote in their foreheads, means not only the viſible Jews of the twelve tribe, but likewiſe the inviſible—it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all of Hebrew extraction that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the teſtimony of God by me.</p>

            <p n="8">8. And there followed another angel, ſaying,

Babylon is fallen, is fallen; that great city! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And the third angel followed them, ſaying, with a loud voice, if any man worſhip the beaſt, and his image, and receive his mark in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the lamb: and the ſmoke of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſcends up for ever and ever; and they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt and his image, and whoſoever, receives the mark of his name.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Here is the patience of the ſaints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jeſus.</p>

               <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi 1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple, ſaying to the ſeven angels, go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And the firſt went, and poured out his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al upon the earth; and there fell a noiſome and grievous ſore upon the men which had the mark of the beaſt, and on them which worſhipped his image. And the ſecond angel poured out his vial upon the ſea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living ſoul died in the ſea.</p>

               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:028359_0134_0FD8C684341EBA48"/>4. And the third angel poured out his vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſay, thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and was, and ſhalt be; becauſe thou haſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus.

            <p n="10">10.

               <hi>Chap.</hi> xxi. 6. And he ſaid to me, it is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: I will give to him that is a-thirſt of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my ſon.</p>

            <p>The Lord God commands me to ſay to you, George the third, king of England, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on my being revealed, in London, to the Hebrews as their prince, and to all nations as their governor, your crown muſt be delivered up

to me, that all your power and authority may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ceaſe. On my being revealed, the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power of the angel of God, which gaurds me now, will then become viſible as a flame of fire; the very ſame that accompanied Moſes and the children of Iſrael out of Egypt. I muſt not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any ſuperior but the Lord Chriſt, who is the Lord God: and as a man raiſed up, like David, by him to be a prince, he commands me to allow no equal, but inſtantly to burn out of his kingdom the rebellious and diſobedient. Read the xli. chap. and verſe 25, of Iſaiah.</p>
            <p>Be adviſed by this, for evil is going to be let looſe; when it is, the king of England will no more believe the ſigns of God by me than the king of Egypt would by Moſes; therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your ſervants to deliver to you all letters and meſſages from me; for, it is for your contempt to me that your country is ordered to be invaded, and your power to be deſtroyed. The tall oak, with all its branches cut off, mentioned in one of the viſions of God, in the preceding part of this book, means yourſelf and family.</p>
            <p>The Lord God commands me to ſay to you, Nathaniel Braſſey Halhed, that as you are reviled and conſidered, by your former acquaintances, as ruined and loſt, for ſpeaking the truth as he manifeſted it to you, for publiſhing your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of me, his ſervant, you ſhall, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of three months, from this day, have

            <p>The Lord God commands me to inform all men, as a prevention, in future, to their aſking unneceſſary queſtions, that all that is proper and allowable for me to relate from him, is publiſhed in this book.</p>
