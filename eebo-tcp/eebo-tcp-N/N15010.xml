            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Theſe conſiderations induce us to form ourſelves into a Society, to be ſtiled a Society for promoting the Manumiſſion of Slaves, and protecting ſuch of them as have been, or may be, liberated.</p>
                  <p>"And that the objects of the Society may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with uniformity and propriety, we have agreed that it ſhall be regulated by the following rules:</p>
               </q>
               <p>I. The Society, at their next Meeting, ſhall elect, by a majority of votes, to be taken by ballot, a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Vice-Preſident, Secretary, and Treaſurer, who ſhall reſpectively continue in office for one year from the time of their election, at the expiration of which time, and of every ſucceeding year, there ſhall be a new elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of officers in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>II. The Preſident ſhall have authority to maintain order and decorum at the Meeting of the Society, and to call a ſpecial Meeting at any time upon the requeſt, of the Standing Committee herein after-mentioned.</p>
               <p>III. The Vice-Preſident, in the abſence of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, ſhall have the ſame authority given to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and in caſe the Preſident ſhould die or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, the Vice-Preſident ſhall officiate till a new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident be elected.</p>
               <p>IV. The Secretary ſhall keep a record of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Society, in a book to be provided for the purpoſe, and ſhall cauſe to be publiſhed, from time to time, ſuch part of the proceedings or reſolutions as the Society may order, or the Preſident, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Standing Committee, between the Meetings of the Society, may think proper to direct.</p>
               <p>V. The Treaſurer, if required by the Society, ſhall give ſecurity for the faithful diſcharge of the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him, and ſhall keep regular accounts of the monies he has received and paid, obſerving always to pay no monies without an order ſigned by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and a majority of the Standing Committee, who are prohibited from drawing, between the ſtated Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Society, for a larger ſum than <hi>Ten Pounds,</hi>

unleſs impowered by a ſpecial order of the Society at a previous Meeting.</p>
               <p>VI. If any of the officers above named, ſhould die, reſign, or be diſplaced, the Society ſhall fill the vacancy in the mode preſcribed by the firſt rule, and if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Vice-Preſident, or the Secretary, or Treaſurer be abſent at any of the Meetings, the Society may elect one to officiate in his room, <hi>pro tempore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. The Society ſhall meet once in every quarter, that is to ſay, on the ſecond Thurſday in February; on the ſecond Thurſday in May; on the ſecond Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in Auguſt, and on the ſecond Thurſday in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in every year, at ſuch place as ſhall from time to time be agreed upon, in order to receive the reports of the Standing Committee, and deviſe the ways and means of accompliſhing the objects of this Inſtitution.</p>

               <p>X. Any perſon deſiring to be admitted a Member of this Society, ſhall be propoſed to the Society at a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting, and be ballotted for at the next Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting, and if, upon counting the ballots, two-thirds of the Members preſent ſhall be found to be in his favour, he ſhall be declared a Member.</p>
               <p>XI. The Society ſhall have the power of expelling any perſon whom they may deem unworthy of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing a Member of it.</p>
               <p>XII. A Standing Committee of ſix Members, ſhall be elected by ballot, at the firſt Quarterly Meeting, four of the Committee ſhall be a quorum, and it ſhall be their duty, to carry into execution in the receſs, and,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019044_0005_0FA9AD40AF9FECD0"/>
at the expence of the Society, the orders given to them by the Society, and generally to purſue ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as appear to them beſt calculated to attain the ends of the Society. It ſhall likewiſe be their duty to report their proceedings in writing at the next Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting of the Society, at which time, the two firſt Members of the Committee named on the Minutes, ſhall be releaſed from ſervice, and two other perſons elected by ballot, to ſerve in their room. And at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceeding Quarterly Meeting, the ſame ceremony ſhall be obſerved with reſpect to two other Members of the Committee in the order which their names ſtand on the Minutes.</p>
               <p>XIII. The foregoing rules ſhall be in force without alteration, for the ſpace of ſix months, from the firſt Quarterly Meeting, after which period they ſhall be ſubject to ſuch alterations as ſhall be agreed upon by a majority of the Members of the Society at a Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting."</p>
               <p>At a Meeting of the Society on the 10th inſtant, they proceeded to elect by ballot, their officers and Standing Committee, and on counting the ballots, the following perſons appeared to be elected, <hi>to wit.</hi>

               <salute>MUCH HONOURED GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS God the Great Father of the Univerſe, has made you the fathers of theſe Colonies; and in anſwer to the prayers of his people, given you counſel, and that wiſdom and integrity, in the exertion of which, you have been ſuch great and extenſive bleſſings, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the approbation and applauſe of your conſtituents, and the reſpect and veneration of the nations in whoſe ſight you have acted, in the important, noble ſtruggle for LIBERTY: We naturally look to you in behalf of more than half a million of perſons in theſe Colonies, who are under ſuch a degree of oppreſſion and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as to be wholly deprived of all civil and perſonal liberty, to which they have as good a right as any of their fellow men, and are reduced to the moſt abject ſtate of bondage and ſlavery, without any juſt cauſe.</p>
            <p>We have particular encouragement thus to apply to you, ſince you have had the honour and happineſs of leading theſe Colonies to reſolve to ſtop the ſlave-trade; and to buy no more ſlaves imported from Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. We have the ſatisfaction of the beſt aſſurances that you have done this not meerly from political rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but from a conviction of the unrighteouſneſs and cruelty of that trade, and a regard to juſtice and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, deeply ſenſible of the inconſiſtence of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſlavery of the Africans, at the ſame time we are aſſerting our own civil liberty, at the riſque of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and lives. This leaves in our minds no doubt of your being ſenſible of the equal unrighteouſneſs and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019044_0008_0FA9AD483971C7B0"/>
oppreſſion, as well as inconſiſtence with ourſelves, in holding ſo many hundreds of thouſands of blacks in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, who have an equal right to freedom with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while we are maintaining this ſtruggle for our own and our children's liberty: and a hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that the cries and tears of theſe oppreſſed will be regarded by you; and that your wiſdom and the great influence you have in theſe colonies, will be ſo properly and effectually exerted, as to bring about a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abolition of ſlavery, in ſuch a manner as ſhall greatly promote the happineſs of thoſe oppreſſed ſtrangers, and the beſt intereſt of the public.</p>
            <p>There are many difficulties and obſtacles, we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in the way of this good work: But when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, importance, and neceſſity of it, come into view, we think ourſelves warranted to addreſs you, in the words ſpoken to Ezra, on an occaſion not wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar. "Ariſe, for this matter belongeth unto you; we alſo will be with you: be of good courage and do it."</p>
            <p>The righteous and merciful governor of the world has given the greateſt encouragement to go on, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly execute judgment, and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hand of the oppreſſor, both in his word, and in the wonderful things he has done for us ſince we have began to reform this public iniquity. But if we ſtop here, what will be the conſequence!—</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that when the Swiſs were engaged in their ſtruggle for liberty, in which they ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſucceeded, they entered into the following public reſolve: "No Swiſs ſhall take away any thing by violence from another, neither in time of war, nor peace."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. ZUBLY's Short Account, P. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A DIALOGUE, &amp;C.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> SIR, What do you think of the motion made by ſome among us, to free all our <hi>African.</hi> ſlaves? They ſay, that our holding theſe blacks in ſlavery, as we do, is an open violation of the law of God, and is ſo great an inſtance of unrighteouſneſs and cruelty, that we cannot expect deliverance from preſent calamities, and ſucceſs in our ſtruggle for liberty in the <hi>American.</hi> colonies, until we repent, and make all the reſtitution, in our power. For my part, I think they carry things much too far on this head; and if any thing might be done for the freedom of our ſlaves, this is not a proper time to attend to it, while we are in ſuch a ſtate of war and diſtreſs, and affairs of much greater importance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all our attention, and the utmoſt exertion of the public.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Sir, I am glad you have introduced this ſubject, eſpecially, as you own a number of theſe ſlaves; I ſhall attend to it with pleaſure, and offer my ſentiments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it freely, expecting you will as freely propoſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections you ſhall have againſt any thing I ſhall advance. And I take leave here to obſerve, that if the ſlavery in which we hold the blacks, is wrong; it is a very great and public ſin; and therefore a ſin which God is now teſtifying againſt in the calamities he has brought upon us, conſequently muſt be reformed, before we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect deliverance, or even ſincerely aſk for it. It would be worſe than madneſs then, to put off atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this matter, under the notion of attending to more important affairs. This is acting like the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who, when his ſhip is filling with water, neglects to ſtop the leak or ply the pump, that he may mend his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019044_0011_0FA9AD4C00C82648"/>
ſails. There are at the loweſt computation, 800,000. ſlaves in <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> including the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands; and a great part of theſe, are in the colonies on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. And if this is in every inſtance wrong, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and oppreſſion; it muſt be a very great and crying ſin, there being nothing of the kind equal to it on the face of the earth. There are but few of theſe ſlaves, indeed in <hi>New-England,</hi> compared with the vaſt numbers in the iſlands and the ſouthern colonies; and they are treated much better on the continent, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among us, than they are in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> But if it be all wrong, and real oppreſſion of the poor helpleſs blacks, we, by refuſing to break this yoke, and let theſe injured captives go free, do practically juſtify and ſupport this ſlavery in general, and make ourſelves, in a meaſure at leaſt, anſwerable for the whole: and we have no way to exculpate ourſelves from the guilt of the whole, and bear proper teſtimony againſt this great evil, but by freeing all our ſlaves. Surely then, this matter admits of no delay; but demands our firſt, and moſt ſerious attention, and ſpeedy reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I acknowledge the <hi>ſlave trade,</hi> as it has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with the <hi>Africans,</hi> cannot be juſtified. But I am not yet convinced that it is wrong to keep thoſe in perpetual bondage, who by this trade have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Africa</hi> to us, and are become our ſlaves. If I viewed this in the light you do, I ſhould agree with you that it is of the higheſt importance that they ſhould all be made, free without delay; as we could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the favour of Heaven, or with any conſiſtency aſk it, ſo long as they are held in bondage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I am glad you have attended to the affair ſo much as to be convinced of the unrighteouſneſs of the ſlave trade. Indeed, this conviction has been ſo ſpread of late, that it is has reached almoſt all men on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, except ſome of thoſe who are too deeply intereſted in it, to admit the light which condemns it. And it has now but few advocates, I believe, being generally condemned and exploded. And the members of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019044_0012_0FA9AD4CB35EF870"/>
Continental Congreſs have done themſelves much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in adviſing the <hi>American</hi> colonies to drop this trade entirely; and reſolving not to buy another ſlave, that ſhall be imported from <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I think it of importance that this trade ſhould not only be condemned as wrong, but attentively conſidered in its real nature, and all its ſhocking attendants and circumſtances; which will lead us to think of it with a deteſtation and horror, which this ſcene of inhumanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oppreſſion and cruelty, exceeding every thing of the kind that has ever been perpetrated by the ſons of men, is ſuited to excite; and awaken us to a proper indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the authors of this violence and outrage; done to their fellow men; and to feelings of humanity and pity towards our brethren, who are the miſerable ſufferers. Therefore, though I am not able to paint this horrid ſcene of barbarity and complicated iniquity, to the life, or even to tell the one half which may be told, in the ſhort time allotted for this converſation; yet I will ſuggeſt a few particulars; leaving you, if you pleaſe, to conſult the authors who have given a more particular deſcription.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the <hi>Africans</hi> are in a ſtate of heatheniſm; and ſunk down into that ignorance and barbarity, into which mankind naturally fall, when deſtitute of divine revelation. Their lands are fertile, and produce all the neceſſaries of life: The inhabitants are divided into many diſtinct nations or clans; and of courſe are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entering into quarrels, and open war with each other. The <hi>Europeans, Engliſh, French, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. have carried on a trade with them for above 100 years; and have taken advantage of their ignorance and barbarity, to perſuade them to enter into the inhuman practice of ſelling one another to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> for the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they carry to them, moſt of which, they ſtand in no real need of: but might live as well, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without them: particularly ſpiritous liquors, which have been carried to them in great quantities by the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019044_0013_0FA9AD4D6F6AEE68"/>
               <hi>Americans.</hi> They, by this means, have tempted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the poor blacks to make war upon one another, in order to get captives, ſpreading diſtreſs, devaſtation and deſtruction over a vaſt country; by which many millions have periſhed: and millions of others, have been captivated, and ſold to the <hi>Europeans and Americans,</hi> into a ſtate of ſlavery, much worſe than death. And the inhabitants of the towns near the ſea, are taught to exert all the art and power they have, to entrap and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy one another, that they may make ſlaves of them, and ſell them to us for rum; by which they intoxicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and become more brutiſh and ſavage than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could be, ſo that there are but few inſtances of ſobriety, honeſty, or even humanity, in theſe towns on the ſea, to which the <hi>Europeans</hi> have acceſs: and they who live the furtheſt from theſe places, are the leaſt vicious, and much more civil and humane.</p>
            <p>They ſtand in no need of the rum that is carried there in ſuch vaſt quantities, by which ſo many thouſands have been enſlaved, and which has ſpread ſuch infinite miſchief among them. And I leave it with you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to what a dreadful degree the <hi>Americans</hi> have, by this abominable practice, brought the curſe upon them, pronounced by an inſpired prophet; and how very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable it is to this caſe. <q>Woe unto him that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his neighbour drink: that putteſt thy bottle to him, and makeſt him drunken alſo, that thou mayſt look on their nakedneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Hab. ii. 15.</note>.</q> And is not this curſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently come upon us, in a dreadful degree, in ſuch a way, as to paint itſelf out, ſo that he who runs may read it? We have put the bottle to our neighbours mouths, by carrying immenſe quantities of rum to them, and inticed them to drink, that we might take advantage of their weakneſs, and thereby gratify our luſts. By this means multitudes of them have been enſlaved, and carried to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands, there to be kept to hard labour, and treated ten thouſand times worſe than dogs. In conſequence of which, incredible quantities of rum,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019044_0014_0FA9AD5105B1CF38"/>
and molaſſes which has been diſtilled into rum among ourſelves, have been imported; the moſt of which is conſumed in intemperance and drunkenneſs, in ſuch a dreadful degree, as to exceed any thing of the kind in any part of the world; by which thouſands, yea milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have ruined themſelves, body and ſoul, for ever. Let any one conſider this, and forbear to confeſs, if he can, that this woe has fallen heavily upon us, and that in ſuch a way and connection as to point out the ſinful cauſe.</p>
            <p>But to return. This trade has been carried on for a century and more, and for many years paſt, above an hundred thouſand have been brought off the coaſt in a year, ſo that many, many millions have been torn from their native country, their acquaintance, relations and friends, and moſt of them put into a ſtate of ſlavery, both themſelves, and their children for ever, if they ſhall have any poſterity, much worſe than death. When numbers of theſe wretched creatures are collected by the ſavages, they are brought into the public market to be ſold, all naked as they were born. The more than ſavage ſlave-merchant views them, and ſends his ſurgeon, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to examine them, as to the ſoundneſs of their limbs, their age, &amp;c. All that are paſſed as fit for ſale, are branded with a hot iron in ſome part of their body, with the buyers mark; and then confined, crowded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſome cloſe hold, till a convenient time to put them on board a ſhip. When they are brought on board, all are immediately put in irons, except ſome of the women perhaps, and the ſmall children, where they are ſo crowded together in that hot climate, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a conſiderable number die on their paſſage to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> occaſioned partly by their confinement, partly by the grief and vexation of their minds, from the treatment they receive, and the ſituation in which they find themſelves. And a number commonly die after they arrive at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in ſeaſoning to the climate; ſo that, commonly, not above ſeventy in an hundred ſurvive their tranſportation; by which means
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019044_0015_0FA9AD53360D0940"/>
about thirty thouſand are murdered every year by this ſlave-trade, which amounts to three millions in a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. When they are brought to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they are again expoſed to market, as if they were ſo many beaſts, and ſold to the higheſt bidder; where again they are ſeparated according to the humour of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without any regard to their friendſhips or relations, of huſbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and ſiſters, &amp;c. being torn from each other, without the leaſt regard to any thing of this kind, and ſent to different places, without any proſpect of ſeeing each other again. They are then put under a taſk maſter, by the purchaſing planter, who appoints them their work, and rules over them with rigour and cruelty, following them with his cruel whip, or appointing one to do it, if poſſible, more cruel than himſelf. The infirm and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the females, and even thoſe who are pregnant, or have infants to take care of, muſt do their taſk in the field equally with the reſt; or if they fall behind, may be ſure to feel the laſh of their unmerciful driver. Their allowance of food at the ſame time is very coarſe and ſcant, and muſt be cooked by themſelves, if cooked at all, when they want to be aſleep. And often they have no food but what they procure for themſelves, by working on the ſabbath; for that is the only time they have to themſelves. And to make any complaint, or petition for relief, will expoſe them to ſome ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, if not a cruel death. The leaſt real or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeable crimes in them, are puniſhed in the moſt cruel manner. And they have no relief; there being no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from their maſters ſentence and will, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are more like ſavage beaſts, than rational, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creatures. And to petition for liberty, though in the moſt humble and modeſt terms, is as much as their lives are worth; as few eſcape the moſt cruel death, who preſume to hint any thing of this kind to their maſters: It being a maxim with thoſe more than, cruel tyrants, that the only way to keep them under, and prevent their thinking of the ſweets of liberty, is to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019044_0016_0FA9AD54513DC9B0"/>
the leaſt intimation of it in the ſevereſt manner, as the moſt intolerable affront and inſult on their maſters. Their labour is ſo hard, and their diet ſo ſcant and poor, and they are treated in all reſpects with ſuch oppreſſion and cruelty, that they do not encreaſe by propagation in the iſlands, but conſtantly decreaſe, ſo that every planter muſt every year purchaſe five at leaſt to every hundred he has on his plantation, in order to keep his number from diminiſhing.</p>
            <p>But it is in vain to attempt a full deſcription of the oppreſſion and cruel treatment theſe poor creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conſtantly at the hands of their imperious, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, worſe than <hi>Egyptian</hi> taſk-maſters. Words cannot utter it. Volumes might be written, and not give a detail of a thouſandth part of the ſhockingly cruel things they have ſuffered, and are conſtantly ſuffering. Nor can they poſſibly be conceived of by any one, who has not been an eye witneſs. And how little a part does he ſee! They who are witneſſes to any part of this horrid ſcene of barbarous oppreſſion, cannot but feel the truth and propriety of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s words: "So I returned, and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are done under the ſun: and behold the tears of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and they had no comforter; and on the ſide of the oppreſſors there was power; but they had no comforter. Wherefore I praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccl. iv. 1, 2.</note>:" <hi>Solomon</hi> never ſaw any oppreſſion like this, unleſs he looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this very inſtance, in the ſpirit of propheſy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Sir, there is one important circumſtance in favour of the ſlave-trade; or which will at leaſt ſerve to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance many of the evils you mention; and that is, we bring theſe ſlaves from a heathen land, to places of goſpel light; and ſo put them under ſpecial advantages to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I know this has been mentioned by many in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the ſlave-trade: but when examined, will turn greatly againſt it. It can hardly be ſaid with truth,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019044_0017_0FA9AD5506509F78"/>
that the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands are places of goſpel light. But if they were, are the Negroes in the leaſt benefited by it? Have they any acceſs to the goſpel? Have they any inſtruction, more than if they were beaſts? So far from this, that their maſters guard againſt their having any inſtruction to their utmoſt; and if any one would attempt any ſuch thing, it would be at the riſque of his life. And all the poor creatures learn of Chriſtianity, from what they ſee in thoſe who call themſelves Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, only ſerves to prejudice them in the higheſt degree againſt the Chriſtian religion. For they not only ſee the abominably wicked lives of moſt of thoſe who are called Chriſtians, but are conſtantly oppreſſed by them, and receive as cruel treatment from them, as they could from the worſt of beings. And as to thoſe who are brought to the continent, in the ſouthern colonies<note n="*" place="bottom">It can be proved, that ſince the war begun, a propoſal was made to ſend ſome blacks, who were qualified to teach Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, into the ſouthern colonies, to teach the blacks there, and attempt to Chriſtianize them: but the gentlemen who were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the diſpoſition of ſlave-holders, in thoſe parts, diſcouraged the deſign, and ſaid the maſters of the blacks in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, would not ſuffer any ſuch thing!</note>, and even to <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo little pains are taken to inſtruct them, and there is ſo much to prejudice them againſt Chriſtianity, that it is a very great wonder, and owing to an extraordinary divine interpoſition, in which we may ſay, God goes out of his common way, that any of them ſhould think favourably of Chriſtianity, and cordially embrace it. As to the moſt of them, no wonder they are unteachable, and get no good by the goſpel; but have imbibed the deepeſt prejudices againſt it, from the treatment they receive from profeſſed Chriſtians; prejudices which moſt of them are by their circumſtances reſtrained from expreſſing: while they are fixed in the ſtrongeſt degree in their minds.</p>
            <p>But if this was not the caſe, and all the ſlaves brought from <hi>Africa,</hi> were put under the beſt advantages to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, and they were in circumſtances that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019044_0018_0FA9AD55BA5F5430"/>
tended to give them the moſt favourable idea of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and the religion they profeſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Which cannot be the caſe, ſo long as they are held in a ſtate of ſlavery, or they are brought away from their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the manner they are; ſo that the ſuppoſition is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and deſtroys itſelf.</note>; and though all concerned in this trade, and in ſlavery in general, ſhould have this wholly in view, viz. their becoming Chriſtians, by which they ſhould be eternally happy; yet this would not juſtify the ſlave trade, or continuing them in a ſtate of ſlavery: For to take this method to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianize them, would be a direct and groſs violation of the laws of Chriſt. He commands us to go and preach the goſpel to all nations; to carry the goſpel to them, and not to go, and with violence bring them from their native country, without ſaying a word to them, or to the nations from whom they are taken, about the goſpel, or any thing that relates to it.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Europeans</hi> and <hi>Americans</hi> had been as much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to chriſtianize the <hi>Africans,</hi> as they have been to enſlave them; and had been at half the coſt and pains to introduce the goſpel among them, that they have to captivate and deſtroy them; we have all the reaſon in the world to conclude that extenſive country, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a vaſt multitude of inhabitants, would have been full of goſpel light, and the many nations there, civilized and made happy; and a foundation laid for the ſalvation of millions of millions; and the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of it have been rewarded ten thouſand fold for all their labour and expence. But now, inſtead of this, what has been done on that coaſt, by thoſe who paſs among the Negroes for Chriſtians<note n="†" place="bottom">For they have no way to get an idea of a Chriſtian, but from the appearance and conduct of the Europeans or Americans, in the practice of all their unrighteouſneſs, cruelty, profaneneſs and debauchery.</note>, has only ſerved to produce and ſpread the greateſt and moſt deep-rooted prejudices againſt the Chriſtian religion, and bar the way to that which is above all things deſirable,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019044_0019_0FA9AD5674DE4958"/>
their coming to the knowledge of the truth that they might be ſaved. So that while, by the murdering or enſlaving millions of millions, they have brought a curſe upon themſelves, and on all that partake with them, they have injured in the higheſt degree innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nations, and done what they could to prevent their ſalvation, and to faſten them down in ignorance and barbarity to the lateſt poſterity!—Who can realize all this, and not feel a mixture of grief, pity, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and horror, truly ineffable! And muſt he not be filled with zeal to do his utmoſt to put a ſpeedy ſtop to this ſeven-headed monſter of iniquity, with all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid train of evils with which it is attended.</p>
            <p>And can any one conſider all theſe things, and yet pretend to juſtify the ſlave-trade, or the ſlavery of the <hi>Africans</hi> in <hi>America?</hi> Is it not impoſſible, that a real Chriſtian, who has attended to all this, ſhould have any hand in this trade? And it requires the utmoſt ſtretch of charity to ſuppoſe that any one ever did, or can buy or ſell an <hi>African</hi> ſlave, with a ſincere view to make a true Chriſtian of him<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It has been often ſaid, in vindication of the ſlave trade, that the blacks are ſo cruel to each other, that they would put their captives to death, if they could not ſell them; ſo that they who buy them ſave their lives, and do them the greateſt kindneſs. And, at the ſame time, this trade is of the greateſt advantage to the Weſt-India iſlands and the ſouthern States, and to all in connexion with them: For while men cannot do the buſineſs which is done by the blacks, in thoſe hot climates, ſo that were not the blacks introduced and improved, all this labour, and the produce of it, muſt ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe ſuggeſtions may be a ſufficient vindication of the ſlave-trade with the intereſted and inattentive; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and judicious will ſee with how little reaſon and truth they are urged, when they have attended to the following obſervations.</p>
                  <p>There is no evidence that thoſe people did kill the captives, in general, which they took in war; but the contrary is evident, from the account given of them by thoſe Europeans who have travelled and lived longeſt among them. They repreſent thoſe nations, which have not been corrupted by the whites, to be, in general, induſtrious, friendly and hoſpitable; and in a great meaſure happy in the enjoyment of ſociety, and the comforts of life. [See <hi>A ſhort account of that part of Africa inhabited by the Negroes,</hi> printed at Philadelphia, 1762.] And there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence from hiſtory, and teſtimonies inconteſtible, that theſe nations have been encouraged and induced to carry on moſt of their wars, for more than a century paſt, by the Europeans and Americans, that they might get captives to ſell to traders in the ſouls and bodies of men; and where this trade has been the means of ſaving one life, it has deſtroyed millions. Therefore, if profeſſing Chriſtians, inſtead of encouraging them in their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and tempting them to deſtroy, captivate, and ſell each other, had taken as much pains to teach them humanity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, as they have to reduce millions to a ſtate of ſlavery worſe than death; they might have ſaved as many lives, as now they have been the means of deſtroying.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the cruelty of thoſe ſavages to each other, is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the ſlave trader to buy thoſe ſuppoſed victims, and put them into a ſtate of ſlavery, which, by their own confeſſion, is worſe than death. This, ſurely, is not an act of mercy, but of cruelty. The voice of mercy and humanity is againſt ſelling them as ſlaves. Who does not know that, "one who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> means of preſerving a man's life, is not, therefore, entituled to make him a ſlave, and ſell him, as he does a piece of goods."</p>
                  <p>As to other ſuggeſtions, viz. That the blacks are neceſſary to cultivate the lands in thoſe hot climates, ſince the whites are not able to labour there, it may be obſerved, <hi>that there is not the leaſt evidence of this, but much of the contrary.</hi> Whites are healthy, and do the labour in the Eaſt-Indies, which blacks do in the Weſt, in the ſame climate; and that to much greater advantage, of which authentic accounts have been publiſhed. The truth is, moſt of the whites which are born in the ſouthern ſtates, or the Weſt-Indies, are not educated to labour, but, great part of them, in idleneſs and intemperance. The blacks are introduced to do the work, and it is thought a diſgrace for a white perſon to get his living by labour. By this means, the whites in general are vicious, and all imbibe ſuch a haughty and tyrannical ſpirit, by holding ſo many ſlaves, that they are above labour, and many of them, rather a plague than a bleſſing to all about them: And whole families are ruined for ever, by means of this ſlavery. Whereas, if African ſlaves had never been introduced, or this ſlavery were now aboliſhed; and every man had his farm or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no more than he could cultivate to the beſt advantage, by the help of his children, and perhaps a few hired men; this would introduce induſtry, temperance and oeconomy; the land would produce much more than it does now; and the country be filled with induſtrious, virtuous inhabitants, happy themſelves, and bleſſings to all around them, inſtead of the comparatively few families now, many of which are a burden to the earth, and a diſgrace to human nature.—This brings the words of Solomon freſh to mind, Eccl. viii. 9. "There is a time, when one man ruleth over another <hi>to his own hurt.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>We cannot heſitate to ſay, this ſage obſervation is verified in the moſt ſtriking manner, and to the higheſt degree, in the ſlavery under conſideration. It is an unſpeakable hurt to the public, to the commonwealth. If it is inconſiſtent with republican princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and tends to overthrow the liberty of thoſe ſtates, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce monarchy and tyranny, to have ſuch ſlavery tolerated among us, and ſo many petty ſovereigns and lords, ruling over a number of vaſſals with deſpotic ſway. Their children natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbibe thoſe arbitrary principles, and grow up as unfit to be uſeful members of thoſe free; republican ſtates, as do the children of the moſt haughty monarch on the globe. And thoſe men rule over themſelves to their own hurt, and the hurt, the miſery and ruin of their families, temporal and ETERNAL.</p>
                  <p>But if it ſhould ſtill be thought by any, or it be in fact true, that thoſe climates cannot be cultivated by whites; let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that this is no juſtification of the horrid ſlave-trade, and ſlavery n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w practiſed: But it is a good reaſon why the whites ſhould abandon the places where they cannot live, unleſs it be on the blood of others, as good as themſelves; and renounce the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which is carried on in the exerciſe of ſo much unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruelty. If the blacks <hi>only</hi> can labour there, the lands are theirs, by right; and they ought to be allowed to poſſeſs them, as freemen, and enjoy the fruit of their labour.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:019044_0020_0FA9AD5A7B088C80"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> All this ſeems to be little to the purpoſe; ſince it was granted in the beginning of our converſation, that the ſlave-trade, as it has been carried on, is not to be juſtified. But what is this to the queſtion we propoſed to conſider; which is, Whether it be wrong to hold the blacks we have among us in a ſtate of ſlavery, or ought to ſet them free without delay? To this you have ſaid little or nothing as yet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:019044_0021_0FA9AD5C743831D0"/>
               <hi>B.</hi> All I have ſaid upon the ſlave-trade, to ſhew the unrighteouſneſs, the cruelty, the murder, the oppoſition to Chriſtianity and the ſpread of the goſpel among the <hi>Africans,</hi> the deſtruction of whole nations, and myriads of ſouls, which are contained in this horrid practice, has been principally with a view to a more clear and ſatisfactory, determination of the queſtion before us, which you have now renewedly propoſed—For I think
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019044_0022_0FA9AD5C9969DC00"/>
the following propoſition may be advanced as undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, viz. <hi>If the ſlave-trade be unjuſtifiable and wrong; then our holding the</hi> Africans <hi>and their children in bondage, is unjuſtifiable and wrong; and the latter is criminal in ſome proportion to the inexpreſſible baſeneſs and criminality of the former.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>FIRST, If they have been brought into a ſtate of ſlavery, by unrighteouſneſs and violence, they having never forfeited their liberty, or given any one a right to enſlave and ſell them; then purchaſing them of theſe piratical tyrants, and holding them in the ſame ſtate of bondage into which they, contrary to all right, have brought them, is continuing the exerciſe of the ſame unrighteouſneſs and violence towards them. They have yet as much a right to their liberty as ever they had, and to demand it of him who holds them in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and he denies them their right, which is of more worth to them than every thing elſe they can have in the world, or all the riches the unjuſt maſter does or can poſſeſs; and therefore injures them in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree every hour he refuſes or neglects to ſet them at liberty. Beſides,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Holding theſe blacks in a ſtate of ſlavery, is a practical juſtification of the ſlave-trade, and ſo brings the guilt of that on the head of him, who ſo far partakes in this iniquity, as to hold <hi>one</hi> of theſe a ſlave, who was unrighteouſly made ſo by theſe ſons of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The old addage, "The partaker is as bad as the thief," carries ſuch a plain truth in it, that every one muſt diſcern it: And it is certainly applicable to this caſe.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to buy one of theſe blacks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him a ſlave, without partaking with him who firſt reduced him to this ſtate, and put it in his power, thus to poſſeſs him; and practically juſtifying him for ſo doing, ſo as to bring upon himſelf the guilt of firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving him. It is not therefore poſſible for any of our <hi>ſlave keepers</hi> to juſtify themſelves in what they are doing, unleſs they can juſtify the ſlave-trade. If they fall here,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019044_0023_0FA9AD5D92F34D98"/>
they bring on themſelves an awful degree of the guilt of the whole.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, By keeping theſe ſlaves, and buying and ſelling them, they actually encourage and promote the ſlave-trade: And therefore, in this view, keeping ſlaves, and continuing to buy and ſell them, is to bring on us the guilt of the ſlave-trade, which is hereby ſupported. For ſo long as ſlaves are bought and poſſeſſed, and in demand; ſo long the <hi>African</hi> trade will be ſupported and encouraged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But there is a ſtop put to the importation of ſlaves into the <hi>American</hi> Colonies, as they have reſolved no more ſhall be bought. This being the caſe, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe we have among us in ſlavery, is no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the ſlave-trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I grant, if this reſolution ſhould be perpetual, and extend to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> it would diſcourage the ſlave-trade; ſo far as the <hi>Americans</hi> are concerned in it: But it would be more effectually diſcountenanced and condemned, if ſlavery was wholly aboliſhed; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſiſtently done without this. For if it be wrong to import and buy them <hi>now,</hi> it was <hi>always</hi> wrong; and therefore they that are already ſlaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, are injured, and unjuſtly enſlaved; and we have made them our ſlaves without the leaſt right; and ought to retract it, and repair the injury done to them, ſo far as is in our power, by ſetting them free, and compenſating them otherwiſe, ſo far as we are able. There is therefore a palpable inconſiſtency in reſolving to import and buy no more ſlaves; and yet refuſing to let thoſe go out free, which we have already enſlaved, unleſs there be ſome inſuperable impediment in the way.</p>
            <p>The whole I have ſaid concerning the unlawfulneſs of keeping the blacks in ſlavery, if the trade by which they are become our ſlaves be unlawful, may be illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the following example.</p>
            <p>A number of robbers invaded a certain province, and took off moſt of their goods and effects, and carried them
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019044_0024_0FA9AD5E00ECF810"/>
to a neighbouring province, and ſold them to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; and the robbers finding this encouragement, continued the practice for many years. At length the people of the injured province applied to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who had their goods of the robbers, and were now In poſſeſſion of them, and aſked them to reſtore what was taken from them by violence, and to which they had a good and indiſputable right; it being impoſſible theſe robbers could give a right to what they had unjuſtly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them. But the people in whoſe poſſeſſion the ſtolen goods were found, utterly refuſed to deliver them up to the injured people who demanded them. They told them, they had indeed been greatly injured, and they muſt condemn the robbers as very injurious and cruel in what they had done: But as they now had theſe goods in their own poſſeſſion, they intended to keep them, and looked on themſelves under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deliver them up, though they ſuffered ſo much, and would probably periſh for want of them. And they intended ſtill to buy all the robbers ſhould bring to them.</p>
            <p>To this the injured replied, <q>By partaking with theſe robbers in receiving the goods at their hands, you practically juſtify their conduct, and muſt ſhare with them in their guilt. For by this means you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and are determined to go on to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in this violence and rapine: And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them, you equally condemn yourſelves, and muſt remain under this condemnation till you reſtore the goods we demand; and reſolve never to purchaſe any thus taken from us by violence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this they determined to purchaſe no more of them, but refuſed to deliver up what they had already got in poſſeſſion. But the oppreſſed told them, they did right in reſolving to injure them no more in that way; but they were now very inconſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for if it were wrong to purchaſe any more, it was as wrong to withhold what they had already gotten
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019044_0025_0FA9AD5EB0B3A6C0"/>
in poſſeſſion: And they had no other way to juſtify themſelves in detaining their goods, and to be conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but by proceeding to take whatever thoſe robbers ſhould bring to them in future, and juſtifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo doing, and the robbers in all their depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This reaſoning looks ſomething plauſible, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; but the holy ſcripture approves of making and keeping ſlaves; and this ſurely is ſufficient to keep us in countenance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I hope you will not appeal to the holy ſcripture, in ſupport of a practice, which you and every one elſe muſt allow to be ſo inexpreſſible unjuſt, inhuman and cruel, as is the ſlave-trade; and conſequently ſo glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly contrary to the whole tenor of divine revelation. And if the ſlave-trade is ſuch a groſs violation of every divine precept, 'tis impoſſible to vindicate the ſlavery to which the <hi>Africans</hi> have been reduced by this trade, from the holy ſcripture. Of this we have ſuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>a priori,</hi> that would be a horrid reproach of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, to pretend this practice can be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that; or even to look into it with any hope or expectation of finding any thing there in favour of it. And if there be any paſſages in the bible, which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a conſtruction in favour of this practice, we may be very certain it is a wrong one. In a word, if any kind of ſlavery can be vindicated by the holy ſcriptures, we are already ſure our making and holding the Negroes our ſlaves, as we do, cannot be vindicated by any thing we can find there; but is condemned by the whole of divine revelation. However, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear what you can produce from ſcripture, in favour of any kind of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You know that a curſe was pronounced on the poſterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> for his wickedneſs, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>A ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren.</hi> He could not be a ſervant unto his brethren, unleſs they made him ſo; or at leaſt held him in ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019044_0026_0FA9AD5FA155CC58"/>
The curſe could not take place unleſs they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it, and they ſeem to be by God appointed to do this. Therefore while we, the children of <hi>Japheth,</hi> are making ſuch abject ſlaves of the blacks, the children of <hi>Ham,</hi> we are only executing the righteous curſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon them; which is ſo far from being wrong in us, that it would be a ſin, even diſobedience to the revealed will of God, to refuſe to make ſlaves of them, and attempt to ſet them at liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Do you think, my good Sir, it was the duty of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to make the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſerve him and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and to afflict them, by ruling over them with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and holding them in hard and cruel bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had expreſsly foretold this, and ſaid it ſhould be done? And was the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> king blameleſs while he executed the judgments which God had threatened to inflict on his profeſſing people? Did God's threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with thoſe evils, warrant this king to diſtreſs, captivate and deſtroy them, as he did? And will you ſay, the <hi>Jews</hi> did right in crucifying our Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this they fulfilled the ſcriptures, declaring that thus it muſt be!—Your argument, if it is of any force, will aſſert and juſtify all this; and therefore, I hope, will be renounced by you, and by all who have the leaſt regard for the holy ſcripture, with proper ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horrence.</p>
            <p>But if this argument were not ſo fraught with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and impiety as it really is, and it were granted to be forcible, with reſpect to all upon whom the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned curſe was denounced; yet it would not juſtify our enſlaving the <hi>Africans,</hi> for they are not the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who was the only ſon of <hi>Ham</hi> that was doomed to be a ſervant of ſervants. The other ſons of <hi>Ham,</hi> and their poſterity, are no more affected with this curſe, than the other ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Therefore this prediction is as much of a war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant for the <hi>Africans</hi> enſlaving us, as it is for us to make ſlaves of them.

               <hi>A.</hi> The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were allowed by God to buy and make ſlaves from the nations that were round about them, and the ſtrangers that lived among them; which could not have been the caſe, if this was wrong and unjuſt.

It was right for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to do this, becauſe they had a divine permiſſion and direction to do it, as the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a right to deſtroy the ſeven nations of <hi>Canaan</hi> in what way he thought beſt, and to direct whom he pleaſed to do it. And it was right for them to make bond-ſervants of the nations round them, they having an expreſs permiſſion to do it from him who has a right to diſpoſe of all men as he pleaſes. God ſaw fit, for wiſe reaſons, to allow the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus to make and poſſeſs ſlaves; but is this any licence to <hi>us</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave any of our fellow men, any more than their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed to kill the ſeven nations in <hi>Canaan,</hi> is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to us to kill any of our fellow men, whom we pleaſe, and are able to deſtroy, and take poſſeſſion of their eſtates? This muſt be anſwered in the negative, by every one who will allow himſelf a moment's reflection. God gave many directions and laws to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which had no reſpect to mankind in general; and this under
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019044_0028_0FA9AD61D8CBA030"/>
conſideration has all the marks of ſuch an one. There is not any thing in it, or relating to it, from whence can be deduced the leaſt evidence that it was deſigned to be a regulation for all nations through every age of the world, but every thing to the contrary. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were then diſtinguiſhed from all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on earth; they were God's peculiar people, and favoured on many accounts above others; and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in their conſtitution and laws that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to keep up their ſeperation and diſtinction from other nations, and to make the ſpecial favour of Heaven towards them more apparent to all who had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this law reſpecting bondage, is ſuited to anſwer theſe ends. This diſtinction is now at an end, and all nations are put upon a level; and Chriſt, who has taken down the wall of ſeperation, has taught us to look on all nations as our neighbours and brethren, without any reſpect of perſons, and to love all men as ourſelves, and to do to others as we would they ſhould treat us; by which he has moſt effectually aboliſhed this permiſſion given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as many other inſtitutions, which were peculiar to them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that this permiſſion was not deſigned for all nations and ages, will be very evident, if we conſider what ſuch a ſuppoſition implies: For if this be ſo, then all other nations had a right to make ſlaves of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Egytians</hi> had a right to buy and ſell them, and keep them all in bondage for ever. And the nations round about <hi>Canaan,</hi> had a right to bring them into bondage, as they ſometimes did. And the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had a good warrant to reduce them to a ſtate of captivity and ſervitude. And the <hi>Africans</hi> have a good right to make ſlaves of us and our children. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> may lawfully make ſlaves of all the <hi>Americans,</hi> and tranſport us to <hi>England,</hi> and buy and ſell us in open market, as they do their cattle and horſes, and perpetuate our bondage to the lateſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And the <hi>Turks</hi> have a good right to all the Chriſtian ſlaves they have among them; and to make as
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019044_0029_0FA9AD628BC95968"/>
many more ſlaves of us and our children, as ſhall be in their power; and to hold them and their children in bondage to the lateſt poſterity. According to this, every man has a warrant to make a bond ſlave of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whenever it lies in his power; and no one has any right to his own freedom, any longer than he can keep himſelf out of the power of others. For inſtance, if the blacks now among us, ſhould by ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providence have the power in their hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us, they have a right to make us and our children, their ſlaves; and we ſhould have no reaſon to complain.</p>
            <p>This would put mankind into ſuch a ſtate of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual war and confuſion, and is ſo contrary to our lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our neighbour as ourſelves, that he who has the leaſt regard for his fellow men, or the divine law, muſt reject it, and the principle from which it flows, with the greateſt abhorrence. Let no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> then, plead this permiſſion to the <hi>Jews</hi> to make bond ſlaves of their neighbours, as a warrant to hold the ſlaves he has made, and conſequently for univerſal ſlavery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But what will you do with thoſe paſſages in the new teſtament, which are in favour of ſlavery, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſtian maſters to have Chriſtian ſlaves; and the maſters are ſo far from being directed to free them, that 'tis ſuppoſed they may hold them in bondage; and their mutual duties in this relation are inculcated? <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle is ſo far from being diſpoſed to have ſervants made free, that he ſays, <hi>Let as many ſervants as are under the yoke, count their own maſters worthy of all honour</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 1.</note>! And in the following words ſuppoſes that <hi>believing maſters</hi> had ſervants, whom he exhorts to ſerve ſuch maſters with the more chearfulneſs, out of reſpect to their Chriſtian character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Before I make a direct anſwer to this, I beg leave to remind you, that whatever other kind of ſlavery theſe paſſages will vindicate, they certainly will not ſupport the ſlave-trade, and that ſlavery of the negroes into
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019044_0030_0FA9AD65E5C07D60"/>
which they have been brought by this trade, which is manifeſtly unrighteous from beginning to end; and therefore can be nothing to our preſent purpoſe, viz. to juſtify Chriſtian maſters among us in holding the blacks and their Children in bondage.</p>
            <p>I grant there are bond ſervants who are made ſo, and may be held in this ſtate, conſiſtent with juſtice, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and benevolence. They are ſuch, who have forfeited their liberty to the community of which they are members, by ſome particular crimes, and by debt, in ſome inſtances: and are for this condemned to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude for a longer or ſhorter time, and ſold by the civil magiſtrate. And perſons may put themſelves into this ſtate by their own voluntary act. There were doubtleſs ſuch in the Apoſtle's days; and if maſter and ſervant, in this caſe, were converted to Chriſtianity, the ſervant would ſtill be under the yoke, and the Apoſtle's exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation highly proper. Therefore if every maſter, when he embraced Chriſtianity, was obliged to free all his ſervants who had not evidently forfeited their liberty, and not one who refuſed to do this, was admitted into a Chriſtian church; yet there might be many maſters and ſervants in the firſt Chriſtian churches: And the paſſages of ſcripture under conſideration prove no more than this: And therefore will not juſtify any maſter holding one ſervant in bondage againſt his will, ſo much as an hour, who has not evidently brought himſelf into this ſtate by his own crimes, and been adjudged to it, after proper trial, by the civil magiſtrate. Theſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therefore are infinitely far from juſtifying the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very under conſideration; for it cannot be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that one in a thouſand of theſe ſlaves has done any thing to forfeit his own liberty. And if there were any ſuch, they have never been condemned to ſlavery by any who are proper judges, or had any authority to act in the affair. But if this were the caſe of any, they certainly could not forfeit the liberty of their children, and cauſe them to be born ſlaves.</p>
            <p>But it may be further obſerved, that it might be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019044_0031_0FA9AD66B679FFC8"/>
in many caſes at that day, to determine what ſervants were juſtly in a ſtate of bondage, and who had a right to their liberty (which is not the caſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſlaves whoſe cauſe I am now pleading). And the Apoſtles did not think it their buſineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into every inſtance of ſlavery, and find the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ground of it, in order to determine, whether the ſervant ought to be ſet free or not; and as it was taken for granted by all, or moſt, that the ſlavery which then took place was generally juſt: And if every one who embraced Chriſtianity, and had ſlaves muſt undergo a ſtrict examination, and be obliged to diſmiſs his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, unleſs he could produce good evidence that they had forfeited their liberty; this, as circumſtances then were, would have greatly prejudiced the world againſt the Chriſtian religion and tended to retard its propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I ſay, conſidering all theſe things, the Apoſtles might be directed not to intermeddle in this affair, ſo far as to enquire into every inſtance of ſlavery, whether it was juſt or not; but to treat it as if it were ſo, unleſs there were particular, poſitive evidence of the contrary in any inſtances; only giving general rules for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and conduct of maſters and ſervants, which, if applied and put into practice, would not only render this relation comfortable, where it ought to ſubſiſt; but would effect the liberty of all the ſervants, who were evidently reduced to that ſtate unjuſtly; and were ſuited to put an end to ſlavery in general. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking to maſters, ſays, <hi>Maſters give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſervants that which is juſt and equal</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Col. iv. 1.</note>. The maſter who conformed to this rule, muſt not only treat his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with equity, in all inſtances; but muſt ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty all who were evidently unjuſtly enſlaved, and therefore had a right to their freedom. And if any Chriſtian maſter refuſed to do this, he would bring upon him the cenſure of the church, for diſregarding this Apoſtolic rule<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Theſs. iii. 6.</note>. And the ſame Apoſtle ſays to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019044_0032_0FA9AD68A2527BD8"/>
               <hi>If thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Cor. vii. 21.</note>
               <hi>?</hi> In theſe words it is declared, that ſlavery is, in itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, undeſirable, and a calamity, in every inſtance of it; and therefore that it ought to be avoided and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as far as poſſible. And not only the ſervant is warranted and commanded to deſire and ſeek to be made free; but the maſter is alſo implicitly required to ſet him at liberty, if there be no inſuperable impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way; for if the ſervant ought to deſire and attempt to obtain his freedom, the maſter ought to deſire it alſo, and aſſiſt him to obtain it, if it can be effected; and will do it, if he loves his ſervant, as himſelf: And the church to which the ſervant belongs, and every member of it, ought to do all in their power to procure the freedom of every ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch ſervant; for will any one ſay they ought not to do their utmoſt in aſſiſting their poor ſuffering brother to obtain his liberty, which God has commanded him to deſire and ſeek? This Apoſtolic command therefore, being properly regarded, would ſoon put an end to moſt inſtances of ſlavery in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, if it did not wholly aboliſh it; eſpecially at this day, when many of the impediments in the way of freeing ſlaves, which were in the Apoſtles days, are removed. And it may be left to the conſciences of all ſlave holders among us, whether, if it had been left to them, ſuch a direction and command would ever have been given to any ſervant whatever, as is here given by the Apoſtle; and whether, now it is given, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, and practice accordingly. So far from it, that moſt of them, even profeſſing Chriſtians, hold their ſervants at ſuch a diſtance, and treat them in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the poor ſervant dare not ſo much as treat with his maſter about his freedom; and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhould ſay a word, is pretty ſure to receive nothing but angry frowns, if not blows. And if any one undertakes to plead the cauſe of theſe oppreſſed poor, whoſe right is turned aſide in the gate, and they have no helper, he
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019044_0033_0FA9AD694913CAA0"/>
may expect to feel the reſentment of almoſt every keeper of ſlaves, who knows him. And is there one church now in this land, who are ready to do what is in their power to obtain the freedom of the ſlaves which belong to them; or are willing calmly to conſider and debate the queſtion among themſelves, whether it be right to hold the Negroes in bondage? Where is the church that has done any thing of this kind<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the firſt edition of this Dialogue, a number of Churches in New-England, have purged themſelves from this iniquity, and determined not to tolerate the holding of the Africans in ſlavery. If all the Churches in theſe United States would come into the ſame meaſure, and imitate the Friends, called Quakers, in this article, would they not act more like Chriſtian Church then they now do?</note>? And how few churches are to be found, that would not be greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, and filled with reſentment, if the queſtion were ſeriouſly propoſed, and urged to be conſidered?</p>
            <p>Let none who are conſcious, all this is true, urge the Apoſtle <hi>Paul'</hi>s authority in favour of the ſlave-keeping which is practiſed in <hi>Britiſh America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return. The Apoſtle ſeems to have conducted in this caſe, as he did in that of civil government. He conſidered this as a divine inſtitution, and pointed out the end and deſign of it, and the duty of civil rulers, and of the ſubject, without particularly applying it to the government Chriſtians were then under, ſo as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to juſtify or condemn the particular form of government that then took place; or the conduct of thoſe who then had the civil authority in their hands; and that for very obvious reaſons, grounded on the ſtate and circumſtances of the Church and of public affairs at that day. We may as well infer from this, that the civil governors of that day were not unjuſt and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, which is moſt contrary to known fact, as we can, that the ſlavery which then took place was in general juſt and right, from his pointing out the duties of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſervants, without mentioning and condemning any particular inſtances of unjuſt ſlavery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:019044_0034_0FA9AD69F1675E90"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> You well obſerved that the apoſtles did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the affair of ſlavery, ſo as to condemn maſters for holding their ſlaves; or tell the ſervants their maſters had no right to keep them in bondage; but ought to free them, &amp;c. I wiſh all were as wiſe and prudent now; eſpecially miniſters of the goſpel: But all are not ſo. Many make ſuch a clamour about holding our Negroes in bondage; and ſome miniſters have of late ſaid ſo much in public about freeing our ſlaves; and have ſo inveighed againſt the <hi>African</hi> ſlave-trade, and even keeping our blacks in ſlavery, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the negroes are become very uneaſy, and are much more engaged to obtain their liberty than they uſed to be.</p>
            <p>I think, if any thing be ſaid on this ſubject, it ſhould be in private; and not a word of this kind ſhould be liſped in the hearing of our ſervants; much leſs ought miniſters to ſay any thing about it in public; leſt the blacks ſhould all take it into their heads that they are treated hardly, and never be eaſy till they are ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi>—It has been obſerved, there were reaſons, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the ſtate of things at that time, why the apoſtles ſhould not be ſo particular on this head: which reaſons do not take place now. The ſlavery that now takes place is in a Chriſtian land, and without the expreſs ſanction of civil government: And it is all of the ſame kind, and from one original; which is moſt notoriouſly unjuſt; and if it be unrighteous in one inſtance, it is ſo in almoſt every inſtance; and the unrighteouſneſs of it is moſt apparent, and moſt maſters have no colour of claim to hold their ſervants in bondage. And this is become a general and crying ſin; for which we are under the awful frowns of Heaven. Theſe things, which make the caſe ſo different from the ſlavery which took place in the apoſtles days may be a good reaſon of a different conduct; and make it duty to oppoſe, and bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, both in public, and more privately, againſt this
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019044_0035_0FA9AD6AFA01F5D8"/>
evil practice, which is ſo evidently injurious to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and threatens our ruin as a people.</p>
            <p>As to making ſervants uneaſy, and deſirous of liberty, &amp;c. I would obſerve, that moſt of them do not want to be informed that they are greatly injured and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that they are reduced to a ſtate of ſlavery, without the leaſt colour of juſtice. They have ſenſe and diſcerning enough to be ſenſible of this, without being told; and they think much of it almoſt every day, though they are obliged to keep it to themſelves, having none to pity them, or ſo much as hear their complaints. They have a thouſand times more diſcerning and ſenſibility in this caſe than their maſters, or moſt others. And their aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſlavery, and deſires of liberty, are inextinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Therefore their hearing it aſſerted that they ought to be ſet at liberty, gives them no new light and conviction, except it be, that he who aſſerts it, has ſome diſcerning of what they have long known, and moſt ſenſibly felt; and has courage enough to aſſert that in their favour, which they have long felt the truth of; but dared not ſo much as liſp it out.—But if by this means any of your ſervants ſhould be more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight to liberty, and the injuſtice done them in making them ſlaves, will this be ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evil? Would you deſire they ſhould be held in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that you may exerciſe your tyranny, without oppoſition or trouble from any quarter? As reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be angry, and complain of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for ſaying a word to thoſe whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſlavery, about their cruel bondage, and their obtaining their liberty.</p>
            <p>It has always been the way of tyrants to take great pains to keep their vaſſals in ignorance, eſpecially to hide from them the tyranny and oppreſſion of which they are the ſubjects. And for this reaſon they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the liberty of the preſs, and are greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked when their conduct is ſet in a true light before the public, and the unrighteouſneſs they practiſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly expoſed. The complaint we are now conſidering,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019044_0036_0FA9AD6DCA04FCB8"/>
ſeems to be of the ſame kind with this, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all thoſe petty tyrants, who have ſlaves in their poſſeſſion, which they are conſcious they cannot vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but the unrighteouſneſs will be detected, if free enquiry and freedom of ſpeech cannot be ſuppreſſed. And this complaint is of the ſame kind with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the maſters of ſlaves in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their being taught any thing of chriſtianity; becauſe they know every gleam of this light carries a diſcovery of the unrighteouſneſs of the treatment they receive.</p>
            <p>The preſent ſituation of our public affairs, and our ſtruggle for liberty, and the abundant converſation this occaſions in all companies; while the poor Negroes looks on, and hear what an averſion we have to ſlavery, and how much liberty is prized; they often hearing it declared publicly and in private, as the voice of all, that ſlavery is more to be dreaded than death, and we are reſolved to live free or die, &amp;c. &amp;c. This, I ſay, neceſſarily leads them to attend to their own wretched ſituation, more than otherwiſe they could. They ſee themſelves deprived of all liberty and property, and their children after them, to the lateſt poſterity, ſubjected to the will of thoſe who appear to have no feeling for their miſery, and are guilty of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of hard heartedneſs and cruelty towards them, while they think themſelves very kind; and therefore to make the leaſt complaint, would be deemed the height of arrogance and abuſe: And often, if they have a comparatively good maſter now, with conſtant dread they ſee a young one growing up, who bids fair to rule over them, or their children, with rigour.</p>
            <p>They ſee the ſlavery the <hi>Americans</hi> dread as worſe than death, is lighter than a feather, compared to their heavy doom; and may be called liberty and happineſs, when contraſted with the moſt abject ſlavery, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable wretchedneſs to which they are ſubjected. And in this dark and dreadful ſituation, they look round, and find none to help—no pity—no hope!
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019044_0037_0FA9AD6F40B1E310"/>
And when they obſerve all this cry and ſtruggle for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for ourſelves and children; and ſee themſelves and their children wholly overlooked by us, and behold the <hi>ſons of liberty,</hi> oppreſſing and tyrannizing over many thouſands of poor blacks, who have as good a claim to liberty as themſelves, they are ſhocked with the glaring inconſiſtence, and wonder they themſelves do not ſee it. You muſt not therefore lay it to the few who are pleading the cauſe of theſe friendleſs diſtreſſed poor, that they are more uneaſy than they uſed to be, in a ſenſe of their wretched ſtate, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a deſire of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; there is a more mighty and irreſiſtable cauſe than this, viz. all that paſſes before them in our public ſtruggle for liberty.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould the miniſters of the goſpel hold their peace, and not teſtify againſt this great and public iniquity, which we have reaſon to think, is one great cauſe of the public calamities we are now under? How can they refuſe to plead the cauſe of theſe oppreſſed poor, againſt the cruel oppreſſor? They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lift up their voice, and cry aloud, and ſhew the people their ſins, &amp;c. Have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear many of them have offended Heaven by their ſilence, through fear of the maſters, who ſtand ready to make war againſt any one who attempts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their ſlaves; or becauſe they themſelves have ſlaves, which they are not willing to give up?</p>
            <p>Might they not fully expoſe this iniquity, and bear a conſtant teſtimony againſt it, in ſuch a manner as would have no tendency to influence our ſervants to behave ill in any reſpect; by giving them at the ſame time proper cautions and directions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is impoſſible to free all our Negroes; eſpecially at once, and in preſent circumſtances, without injuring them, at leaſt, many of them, and the public to a great degree.

in bondage, it is indeed folly to put ourſelves to any trouble and expence, in order to free them. But if the contrary be true; if it be a ſin of a crimſon dye, which is moſt particularly pointed out by the public calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have come upon us, from which we have no reaſon to expect deliverance till we put away the evil of our doings, this reformation cannot be urged with too much zeal, nor attempted too ſoon, whatever difficulties are in the way. The more and greater theſe are, the more zealous and active ſhould we be in removing them. You had need to take care, leſt from ſelfiſh motives, and a backwardneſs to give up what you unrighteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, you are joining with the ſlothful man to cry, <hi>there is a lion in the way!

            <p>No wonder there are many and great difficulties in reforming an evil practice of this kind, which has got ſuch deep root by length of time, and is become ſo common. But it does not yet appear that they cannot be removed, by the united wiſdom and ſtrength of the <hi>American</hi> colonies, without any injury to the ſlaves, or diſadvantage to the public. Yea, the contrary is moſt certain, as the ſlaves cannot be put into a more wretched ſituation, ourſelves being judges, and the community cannot take a more likely ſtep to eſcape ruin, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſmiles and protection of Heaven.

laid before them, and they were threatened with deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation if they did not reform: They broke through every difficulty, and ſet their ſervants at liberty.</p>
            <p>And how great muſt have been the impediments, how many the ſeeming unanſwerable objections, againſt reforming that groſs violation of the divine command in <hi>Ezra'</hi>s time, by their marrying ſtrange wives, of which ſo many of the <hi>Jews</hi> were guilty, and the hand of the princes and rulers had been chief in this treſpaſs! Yet the pious zeal of <hi>Ezra</hi> and thoſe who joined with him, and their wiſdom and indefatigable efforts conquered every obſtacle, and brought them to a thorough refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Would not the like zeal, wiſdom and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, think you, ſoon produce a reformation of this much greater abomination, by finding out an effectual method to put away all our ſlaves? Surely we have no reaſon to conclude it cannot be done, till we ſee a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able zeal and reſolution, among all orders of men, and anſwerable attempts are thoroughly made.</p>
            <p>Let this iniquity be viewed in it's true magnitude, and in the ſhocking light in which it has been ſet in this converſation; let the wretched caſe of the poor blacks be conſidered with proper pity and benevolence; together with the probable dreadful conſequence to this land, of retaining them in bondage, and all objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt liberating them would vaniſh. The mountains that are now raiſed up in the imagination of many, would become a plain, and every difficulty ſurmounted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> could not bear to think of letting the <hi>Hebrews</hi> go out free from the bondage to which they had reduced them; and, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, they had as many weighty objections againſt it, as can be thought of againſt freeing the ſlaves among as. Yet they were at length brought to drop them all, and willing to ſend them out free; and to be ready to part with any thing they had, in order to promote it<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be well worthy our ſerious conſideration, whether we have not reaſon to fear the hand of God, which is now ſtretched out againſt us, will lie upon us, and the ſtrokes grow heavier, unleſs we reform this iniquity, ſo clearly pointed out by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner in which God is correcting us; and whether we have any reaſon to hope or pray for deliverance, till this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation takes place.</note>.</p>

If many thouſands of our children were ſlaves in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> or any parts of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> dominions, and there were but few families in the <hi>American</hi> colonies that had not ſome child, or near relation in that ſad ſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of freedom to them, or their children, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were ſome very extraordinary exertion of the colonies to effect it; how would the attention of all the country be turned to it! How greatly ſhould we be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it! Would it not become the chief topic of converſation? Would any coſt or labour be ſpared, or any difficulty or hazard be too great to go through, in order to obtain their freedom? If there were no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulties than there are in the caſe before us; yea, if they were ten times greater, would they not be ſoon ſurmounted, as very inconſiderable! I know you, Sir, and every one elſe, <hi>muſt</hi> anſwer in the affirmative, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation. And why are we not as much affected with the ſlavery of the many thouſands of blacks among ourſelves, whoſe miſerable ſtate is before our eyes? And why ſhould we not be as much engaged to relieve them? The reaſon is obvious. 'Tis becauſe they are <hi>Negroes,</hi> and fit for nothing but ſlaves; and we have been uſed to look on them in a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible light; and our education has filled us with ſtrong prejudices againſt them, and led us to conſider them, not as our brethren, or in any degree on a level with us; but as quite another ſpecies of animals, made only to ſerve us and our children; and as happy in bondage, as in any other ſtate. This has baniſhed all attention to the injuſtice that is done them, and any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe of their miſery, or the exerciſe of benevolence towards them. If we could only diveſt ourſelves of theſe ſtrong prejudices, which have inſenſibly fixed on
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019044_0041_0FA9AD723169CF90"/>
our minds, and conſider them as, by nature, and by right, on a level with our brethren and children, and thoſe of our neighbours, and that benevolence, which loves our neighbour as ourſelves, and is agreeable to truth and righteouſneſs, we ſhould begin to feel towards them, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, as we ſhould towards our children and neighbours in the caſe above ſuppoſed, and be as much engaged for their relief.</p>
            <p>If parents have a ſon preſſed on board a King's ſhip, how greatly are they affected with it! They are filled with grief and diſtreſs, and will chearfully be at almoſt any coſt and pains to procure his liberty: and we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at it, but think their exerciſes and engagedneſs for his deliverance very juſt, and ſtand ready to condemn him who has no feeling for them and their ſon, and is not ready to afford all the aſſiſtance in his power, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to recover him. At the ſame time we behold vaſt numbers of blacks among us, torn from their native country, and all their relations, not to ſerve on board a man of war for a few years, but to be abject, deſpiſed ſlaves for life, and their children after them; and yet have not the leaſt feelings for them, or deſire of their freedom! Theſe very parents perhaps, have a number of Negro ſlaves, on whom they have not the leaſt pity; and ſtand ready highly to reſent it, if any one eſpouſes their cauſe ſo much as to propoſe they ſhould be ſet at liberty. What reaſon for this partiality? Ought this ſo to be? An impartial perſon, who is not under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of intereſt, education and cuſtom, is ſhocked with it beyond all expreſſion. The poor Negroes have ſenſe enough to ſee and feel it, but have no friend to ſpeak a word for them; none to whom they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved, that if the General Aſſemblies, &amp;c. of theſe <hi>American</hi> colonies, would take this matter in hand in earneſt, with a concern and reſolution an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its real importance; and the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity were properly diſpoſed and engaged, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſlaves among us might ſoon be effected,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019044_0042_0FA9AD7331DC9278"/>
without injury to the public, or thoſe who ſhall be ſet at liberty; but greatly to the advantage of both. But if this ſhould be neglected, will it excuſe individuals who have ſlaves, in their continuing to hold them in bondage? I think not. If you, Sir, had as many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſlavery at <hi>Algiers,</hi> as you have <hi>African</hi> ſlaves in your houſe, would you take no pains, and deviſe no method to obtain their liberty, till the public ſhould make ſome proviſion for the emancipation of all ſlaves there? If any opportunity ſhould preſent, to obtain their liberty, would you not greedily embrace it, though at much hazard and expence? And if their maſter ſhould refuſe to let them go free, till there was a general eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Chriſtian ſlaves in that country, would you juſtify him as acting a proper, humane, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent part? I trow not. How then can you excuſe yourſelf, and deliver your own ſoul, while you have no compaſſion for theſe black children in your houſe, and refuſe to break the yoke, the galling yoke, from off their necks, becauſe your neighbours will not be ſo juſt and humane to theirs!</p>
            <p>Some maſters ſay, they will give up their ſlaves, if all maſters will do the ſame; but ſeem to think they are excuſed from ſetting their's free, ſo long as there is not a general manumiſſion. What has juſt been obſerved is ſuited, I think, to ſhew the inſufficiency of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Beſides, if you deſire to have all our ſlaves freed, why do you not ſet an example, by liberating your own? This might influence others to do the ſame; and then you might, with a good grace, plead the cauſe of theſe poor <hi>Africans.</hi> Whereas, while you retain your own ſlaves, your mouth is ſtopped, and your example ſerves to ſtrengthen others, and keep them in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, while they practiſe this abominable oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> My ſervants have coſt me a great deal of money, and it is not reaſonable I ſhould loſe all that. If the public will indemnify me, and pay me what my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are worth, I am willing to free them; and none can reaſonably deſire to do it, on any other conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> If your neighbour buys a horſe, or any beaſt, of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019044_0043_0FA9AD7781A4D278"/>
a thief who ſtole it from you, while he had no thought that it was ſtolen, would you not think you had a right to demand your horſe of your neighbour, and pronounce him very unjuſt, if he ſhould refuſe to deliver him to you, till he had received the whole ſum he had given for him? And have not your ſervants as great a right to themſelves, to their liberty, as you have to your ſtolen horſe? They have been ſtolen and ſold, and you have bought them, in your own wrong, when you had much more reaſon to think they were ſtolen, than he who bought your horſe had to miſtruſt he was trading with a thief. Though your horſe has paſſed through many hands, and been ſold ten times, you think you have a right to demand and take him, in whoſe ſoever hands you find him, without refunding a farthing of what he coſt him; and yet, though your Negroes can prove their right to themſelves, and conſtantly make a demand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to deliver them up, you refuſe till they pay the full price you gave for them, becauſe the civil law will not oblige you to do it.—<hi>Thou Hypocrite!—Luke</hi> xiii. 15.</p>
            <p>Had you not been amazingly inconſiderate and ſtupid, you would have concluded theſe men were ſtolen; and <hi>known</hi> that no man had a right to ſell them, or you to buy them And muſt they be for ever deprived of their right, which is worth more to them, than all you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, becauſe you have been ſo fooliſh and wicked as to buy them, and no one appears to prevent your loſing by the bargain! You would do well to conſider the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful denunciation by <hi>Jeremiah. Woe unto him that buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong; that uſeth his neighbour's ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work!</hi> He who refuſes to free his Negroes, that he may ſave his money, and lay it up for his children, and retains his ſlaves for them to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over, leaves them but a miſerable inheritance—infinitely worſe than nothing!</p>
            <p>Beſides, if indifferent perſons were to judge, it would doubtleſs be found that many of your ſervants, if not
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019044_0044_0FA9AD78726D6C80"/>
all, have much more than earned what they coſt you; ſome of them double and treble, yea, ten times as much; and in this view, you ought to let them go out free; and not ſend them away empty; but furniſh them liberally out of your ſtore, agreeable to the divine command; they having a much better right to part of your eſtate, than your children, and, it may be, much more likely to make a good improvement of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You ſpeak of ſervants earning ſo much; but for my part, I think not ſo much of this. Mine have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been much profit to me, and moſt of them do not pay for their victuals and cloaths, but are conſtantly running in debt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> The maſter is not a proper judge in this caſe. How common is it for men who hire others, to complain that the labourers do not earn the wages they give; and that they are continually loſing by all the labour they hire? And if it were wholly left to him who hires what wages he ſhould give the labourer, and he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none, how ſoon would his hire be reduced to little or nothing. The lordly ſelfiſh employer would ſoon find out that his labourers hardly earned the food he was obliged to find them. Let your unintereſted, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious neighbours, judge between you and your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in this matter, and we will give credit to their verdict. And ſurely you have no reaſon to expect we will rely on yours, as you ſeem not really to believe it yourſelf, ſince it looks like a contradiction to your own declaration and practice. For you have been ſpeaking of your ſervants as of as much worth to you, at leaſt, as their firſt coſt, and repreſented it as giving up your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, if you ſhould free them without a compenſation. Whereas, if what you now ſay be true, you will loſe nothing by freeing them immediately; but rather get rid of a burden now on your hands. And if this be true, why do you not free them without delay? Your holding them in ſlavery, is a practical contradiction to what you have now ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>I grant, what is evident to all the diſcerning who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019044_0045_0FA9AD78F9DF8570"/>
to it, that the introduction of ſuch a number of ſlaves among us is a public detriment, an injury to the commonwealth; and therefore, in this view, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ought by all means to be diſcouraged and aboliſhed by our legiſlators: This, however, is conſiſtent with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals getting eſtates by the labour of their ſlaves; and that they are in fact, in many inſtances, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to their owners, none can deny. And if this was not ſo, I ſhould be very certain of obtaining what I am pleading for, even a general manumiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You have repeatedly ſpoke of our ſlaves being hardly treated and abuſed. There may perhaps be ſome inſtances of this among us; but I believe they are generally treated very well, and many of them much better than they deſerve. My ſervants, I am ſure, have no reaſon to complain; they live as well as I do myſelf, and in many reſpects much better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> We will take it for granted, for once, that all you have ſaid is true; and that your ſlaves are treated as well as they can be, while they are held in a ſtate of ſlavery. But will this atone for your making them your ſlaves, and taking from them that which it better to them than not only the beſt living, but all the riches on earth, and is as much to be prized as life itſelf, THEIR LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY? As well, yea, with much more reaſon, may a highway-robber, tell a gentlemen from whom he has taken all his money, he has no reaſon to complain, ſince he had ſpared his life, which was at his mercy, nor had wounded him, or ſtripped him of his cloaths; and go away pleaſed with the thought that he had treated him with great kindneſs and generoſity.</p>
            <p>If a ruffian ſhould ſeize, raviſh and carry off a young virgin from all her relations and friends, into ſome lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cave in the wilderneſs; and when he got full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her there, ſhould treat her with great kindneſs providing for her every neceſſary and comfort ſhe could have in that ſituation. And when he was told of his violence and cruelty, and urged to reſtore her to her former liberty; he ſhould refuſe to releaſe her, and to juſtify himſelf, alledge his kind treatment of her, that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019044_0046_0FA9AD79D35A4110"/>
ſhe had all the comforts of life, and lived better than himſelf, &amp;c. Would not this be ſo far from juſtifying him in the ſight of the world, or being the leaſt excuſe for his barbarous treatment of her, that his offering it as ſuch, would be conſidered as a ſtriking evidence of his ſtupidity, and that he was an unfeeling, inhumane wretch? Whether ſuch an inſtance is in any meaſure applicable to the caſe before us, I leave you to judge.</p>
            <p>But I muſt now aſk leave to take back, what was juſt now granted; and obſerve, that you are not a proper judge of your treatment of your ſlaves; and that you may think you treat them very well, in ſome inſtances at leaſt, if not in a conſtant way, they juſtly think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uſed very hardly, being really ſubjected to many hardſhips, which you would very ſenſibly feel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if you were in their place, or ſhould ſee one of your children a ſlave in <hi>Algiers</hi> treated ſo by his maſter. There are but few maſters of ſlaves, I believe, who do not uſe them in a hard, unreaſonable manner, in ſome inſtances at leaſt; and moſt do ſo in a conſtant way; ſo that an impartial, attentive by-ſtander will be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, while the maſter is wholly inſenſible of any wrong. They who from us have viſited the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> have beheld how ſervants are uſed by their maſters there, with a degree of horror, and pronounced them very unreaſonable and barbarous; while the maſter, and perhaps his other domeſtics have thought they were uſed well, being accuſtomed to ſuch uſage, and never once reflecting that theſe blacks were in any ſenſe on a level with themſelves, or that they have the leaſt right to the treatment white people may reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of one another; and being habituated to view theſe ſlaves more beneath themſelves, than the very beaſts really are. And are we not, moſt of us, educated in theſe prejudices, and led to view the ſlaves among us, in ſuch a mean deſpicable light, as not to be ſenſible of the abuſes they ſuffer; when, if we or our children ſhould receive ſuch treatment, from any of our fellow men, it, would appear terrible in our fight? The <hi>Turks</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:019044_0047_0FA9AD7B5C954A90"/>
are by education and cuſtom, taught to view the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſlaves among them ſo much beneath themſelves, and in ſuch an odious light, that while they are treating our brethren and children, we being judges, in the moſt unreaſonable and cruel manner, they have not one thought that they injure them in the leaſt degree.</p>
            <p>Are you ſure your ſlaves have a ſufficiency of good food, in ſeaſon; and that they never want for comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cloathing and bedding? Do you take great care to deal as well by them in theſe things, as you would wiſh others would treat your own children, were they ſlaves in a ſtrange land? If your ſervants complain, are you ready to attend to them? Or do you in ſuch caſes frown upon them, or do ſomething worſe, ſo as to diſcourage their ever applying to you, whatever they may ſuffer, having learned that this would only be making bad worſe? Do you never fly into a paſſion, and deal with them in great anger, deciding matters reſpecting them, and threatening them, and giving ſentence concerning them, from which they have no appeal, and perhaps proceed to correct them, when to a calm by-ſtander you appear more fit to be confined in Bedlam, than to have the ſovereign, uncontroulable dominion over your brethren, as the ſole lawgiver, judge, and executioner? Do not even your children domineer over your ſlaves? Muſt they not often be at the beck of an ungoverned, peeviſh child in the family; and if they do not run at his or her call, and are not all ſubmiſſion and obedience, muſt they not expect the frowns of their maſters, if not the whip?</p>
            <p>If none of theſe things, my good Sir, take place in your family, have we not reaſon to think you almoſt a ſingular inſtance? How common are things of this kind, or worſe, taking place between maſters and their ſlaves? In how few inſtances, if in any, are ſlaves treated as the maſters would wiſh to have their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren treated, in like circumſtances? How few are fit to be maſters? To have the ſovereign dominion over a number of their fellow men, being his property, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:019044_0048_0FA9AD7C293D7EC0"/>
wholly at his diſpoſal; who muſt abide his ſentence and orders, however unreaſonable, without any poſſibility of relief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I believe my ſlaves are ſo far from thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abuſed, or being in the leaſt uneaſy in a ſtate of ſlavery, that they have no deſire to be made free; and if their freedom were offered to them, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to accept it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I muſt take leave to call this in queſtion, Sir; and I think you believe it, in contradiction to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the ſtrongeſt feelings of human nature, till they have declared it themſelves, having had opportunity for due deliberation, and being in circumſtances to act freely, without the leaſt conſtraint, or fear.</p>
            <p>There are many maſters (if we believe what they ſay) who pleaſe themſelves with this fond opinion of their goodneſs to their ſlaves; and their choice of a ſtate of ſlavery, in preference to freedom, without the leaſt foundation, and while the contrary is known to be true by all who are acquainted with their ſlaves. If they really believe this, they by it only diſcover great inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, and want of proper reflection. They have not ſo much as put themſelves in the place of their ſlaves, ſo as properly and with due ſenſibility to conſult what would be their own feelings, on ſuch a ſuppoſition. Have they themſelves loſt all deſire of freedom? Are they deſtitute of all taſte of the ſweets of it; and have they no averſion to ſlavery, for themſelves and children? If they have theſe feelings, what reaſon have they to conclude their ſervants have not?</p>
            <p>But it ſeems moſt of thoſe maſters do not fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they ſo often ſay on this head: For they have never made the trial; nor can they be perſuaded to do it. Let them offer freedom to their ſervants: and give them opportunity to chooſe for themſelves, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the moſt diſtant conſtraint. And if they then deliberately chooſe to continue their ſlaves, the matter
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:019044_0049_0FA9AD7CB56FBBB8"/>
will be fairly decided, and they may continue to poſſeſs them with a good conſcience<note n="*" place="bottom">But this will give them no right to make ſlaves of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even if the parents themſelves ſhould expreſsly conſent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for the parent can have no right to ſell the liberty of his children.</note>.</p>
            <p>Slaves are generally under ſuch diſadvantages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, that however much they deſire liberty, they dare not ſo much as mention it to their maſters. And if their maſter ſhould order them into his preſence, and aſk them whether they had a deſire to be made free, many would not dare to declare their choice, leſt it ſhould offend him, and inſtead of obtaining their freedom, bring themſelves into a more evil caſe than they were in before, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, by deſiring <hi>Pharoah</hi> to free them.</p>
            <p>In this caſe ſuch precaution ought to be taken, as to give the ſlaves proper aſſurance that they may without any danger to themſelves, declare their choice of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and that it ſhall be done to them according to their choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If ſlaves in general were made free, they would ſoon be in a worſe ſtate than that in which they now are. Many of them know not how to contrive for themſelves, ſo as to get a living; but muſt ſoon be maintained by their former maſters, or ſome others: And others would make themſelves wretched, and become a great trouble to their neighbours, and an injury to the public, by their unreſtrained vices. This would doubtleſs be the caſe with moſt of mine, were they ſet free; and ſome of them are by no means able to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I confeſs this objection, at firſt view, ſeems to have ſome weight in it. But let us examine it, and ſee if it be ſufficient to hold ſo many thouſands in ſlavery, and their children after them, to the end of the world. Would you have all the white people, who are given to hurtful vices, or are unwilling or unable to maintain themſelves, made ſlaves, and their children after them, and be bought and ſold for life like cattle in the market?
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:019044_0050_0FA9AD7FEE907C88"/>
Would you willingly give up your own children to this, to be ſlaves for ever to any one who ſhould be willing and able to purchaſe them, if they were as vicious, or helpleſs as you ſuppoſe many of the blacks would be if ſet at liberty? I am ſure you will not anſwer in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative. And by anſwering in the negative, as I know you muſt, you will entirely remove the reaſon you have now offered for holding the blacks in this ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; till you can ſhew why the latter ſhould be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo very differently from the former, which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you will not attempt.</p>
            <p>A ſtate of ſlavery has a mighty tendency to ſink and contract the minds of men, and prevent their making improvements in uſeful knowledge of every kind: It ſinks the mind down in darkneſs and deſpair; it takes off encouragements to activity, and to make improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and naturally tends to lead the enſlaved to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to a ſtupid careleſſneſs, and to vices of all kinds. No wonder then the blacks among us are, many of them, ſo deſtitute of prudence and ſagacity to act for themſelves; and ſome are given to vice. It is rather a wonder, there are ſo many inſtances of virtue, prudence, knowledge and induſtry among them. And ſhall we, becauſe we have reduced them to this abject, helpleſs, miſerable ſtate, by our oppreſſion of them, make this an argument for continuing them and their children in this wretched condition! God forbid! This ought rather to excite our pity, and arouſe us to take ſome effectual method without delay, to deliver them and their children from this moſt unhappy ſtate. If your own children were in this ſituation, would you offer this as a good reaſon why they and their poſterity ſhould be made ſlaves for ever? Were ſome of your children unable to provide for themſelves through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of body, or want of mental capacity; and others of them were very vicious, would you have them ſold into a ſtate of ſlavery for this? or would you make ſlaves of them yourſelf? Would you not be willing to take the beſt care of them in your power, and give them
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:019044_0051_0FA9AD8207885458"/>
all poſſible encouragement to behave well; and direct and aſſiſt them in proper methods to get a living? I know you would. And why will you not go and do likewiſe to your ſlaves? Why will you not take off the galling yoke from their necks, and reſtore them to that liberty, to which they have as good a claim as you yourſelf and your children; and which has been violently taken from them, and unjuſtly withheld by you to this day? If any of them are diſpoſed to behave ill, and make a bad uſe of their freedom, let them have all the motives to behave well that can be laid before them. Let them be ſubject to the ſame reſtraints and laws with other freemen; and have the ſame care taken of them by the public. And be as ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and aſſiſt thoſe who want diſcretion and aſſiſtance to get a living, as if they were your own children; and as willing to ſupport the helpleſs, infirm and aged. And give all proper encouragement and aſſiſtance to thoſe who have ſerved you well, and are like to get a good living, if not put under peculiar diſadvantages, as freed negroes moſt commonly are; by giving them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable wages for their labour, if they ſtill continue with you, or liberally furniſhing them with what is neceſſary in order to their living comfortably, and being in a way to provide for themſelves. This was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command to the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and does it not appear, at leaſt, equally reaſonable, in the caſe before us? When one of their brethren had ſerved them the number of years that were ſpecified, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to let him go out free; and then the following injunction is added: <hi>And when thou ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If all who have ſlaves, would act ſuch a juſt, wiſe, and benevolent part towards them, and treat them in any meaſure as they would deſire their own children and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:019044_0052_0FA9AD83869541C8"/>
near relations ſhould be treated, our ſlaves might all be ſet free, without any detriment to themſelves or the public; and their maſters would be ſo far from loſing by it, that they would be abundantly rewarded for all their benevolence to theſe injured poor. And if our legiſlators would lend their helping hand, and form ſuch laws and regulations, as ſhall be properly ſuited to protect and aſſiſt thoſe that are freed, and ſo as in the beſt manner to deter and reſtrain them from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious courſes, and encourage their induſtry and good behaviour; this would be an additional ſecurity to the public againſt any imagined evil conſequence of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manumiſſion of our ſlaves; and but a piece of juſtice to theſe poor dependent creatures, whom we have made ſo by our own unrighteouſneſs and oppreſſion. This would encourage maſters to free their ſlaves, and leave the objection we are now conſidering without the leaſt ſhadow of foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You are doubtleſs ſenſible, Sir, that the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in theſe colonies, are ſo far from giving this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to manumit our ſlaves, that the laws are rather a clog or hindrance to any thing of this kind, as they require the maſter to give ſecurity for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his ſlaves, if they ſhould ever want any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, before he is allowed to make them free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I am ſorry to ſay there is too much truth in this. I hope our legiſlatures will ſoon attend with proper concern to this affair; and in their juſtice, wiſdom and goodneſs, enter upon meaſures which ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and effect a general emancipation of our ſlaves.</p>
            <p>But if this ſhould not be, I think it appears from the courſe of this converſation, that this will not excuſe thoſe who have ſlaves from ſetting them at liberty, even though they ſhould be obliged to maintain them all their days. If any ſlave-holder can lay his hand on his breaſt, and ſincerely ſay, if his children were ſlaves at <hi>Algiers,</hi> he would not deſire their maſter to free them, unleſs he could do it, without any riſque of their ever being a charge to him; then let him ſtill hold his ſlaves
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019044_0053_0FA9AD842F4BB250"/>
in bondage with a quiet conſcience. Otherwiſe, I ſee not how he can do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If it were granted that our ſlaves ought to be freed, if times and the public ſtate of the <hi>American</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies would admit. Yet in our preſent peculiar, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous, diſtreſſing ſtate, it may be very imprudent and wrong, and tend to great evil to adopt this meaſure. Moſt of the ſlaves in populous ſea-port places, have now little or no buſineſs to do; and are ſupported by their maſters, while they earn little or nothing. And if they ſhould be diſmiſſed by their maſters, they could not maintain themſelves, and muſt ſuffer. And the attention and exertion of the public is ſo neceſſarily turned to the defence of ourſelves; and this civil war introduces ſuch calamity and confuſion, that it cannot be expected; yea 'tis quite impoſſible, that there ſhould be any proper care of the public, ſo as to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and regulations which would be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this caſe. Though I ſuggeſted this in the beginning of our converſation, yet I think you have paid little or no attention to it. I wiſh this might be well conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I think the facts you have now alledged, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt freeing our ſlaves at preſent, will, if duly conſidered, afford arguments for the very thing you are oppoſing. The ſlaves who are become unprofitable to their maſters, by the preſent calamitous ſtate of our country, will be with the leſs reluctance ſet at liberty, it is hoped; and if no public proviſion be made for them, that they may be tranſported to <hi>Africa,</hi> where they might probably live better than in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; or be removed into thoſe places in this land where they may have profitable buſineſs, and are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, now ſo many are called from their farms to defend our country.—I ſay, if this be not done, the maſters, by freeing them, would loſe nothing by it, even though they continue to ſupport them, till ſome way ſhall open for them to help themſelves. I muſt here again deſire every owner of ſlaves to make their caſe his own, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:019044_0054_0FA9AD84F8EB4DE8"/>
conſider, if he or his children were unjuſtly in a ſtate of ſlavery, whether he ſhould think ſuch an objection againſt their being ſet at liberty of any weight? Would he not rather think it reaſonable that the maſters who had held them in bondage, againſt all right and reaſon, would conſider their being, by an extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, rendered unprofitable to them, as an admonition to break off their ſins by righteouſneſs and their iniquity by ſhewing mercy to theſe poor? And that it ought to be a greater ſatisfaction to them, thus to do juſtice without delay, and relieve theſe oppreſſed poor, than to poſſeſs all the riches, honors and pleaſures of this world? And if theſe maſters ſhould diſregard ſuch an admonition, and neglect this opportunity to ſet them at liberty, putting it off to a more convenient ſeaſon, would it not be very grievous to him, and overwhelm him in deſpair of their ever doing it? Is it not very certain that they who make this objection againſt freeing their ſlaves without delay, would not free them, if the times ſhould change, and they again become profitable! If they muſt maintain them, can they not do it as well when they are free, as while they are ſlaves; and ought they not to do it with much more ſatisfaction?</p>
            <p>And as to the public, all neceſſary regulations and proviſion might eaſily, and very ſoon be made even in our preſent diſtreſſing circumſtances, effectually to emancipate all our ſlaves, were the minds of men in general properly impreſſed with their miſery, and they ſufficiently engaged to do juſtice, and ſhew mercy<note n="*" place="bottom">God is ſo ordering it in his Providence, that it ſeems abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary ſomething ſhould ſpeedily be done with reſpect to the ſlaves among us, in order to our ſafety, and to prevent their turning againſt us in our preſent ſtruggle, in order to get their liberty. Our oppreſſors have planned to gain the blacks, and induce them to take up arms againſt us, by promiſing them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, on this condition; and this plan they are proſecuting to the utmoſt of their power, by which means they have perſuaded numbers to join them. And ſhould we attempt to reſtrain them by force and ſeverity, keeping a ſtrict guard over them, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them ſeverely, who ſhall be detected in attempting to join our oppoſers; this will only be making bad worſe, and ſerve to render our inconſiſtence, oppreſſion and cruelty, more criminal, perſpicuous and ſhocking, and bring down the righteous vengeance of Heaven on our heads. The only way painted out to prevent this threatening evil, is to ſet the blacks at liberty ourſelves, by ſome public acts and laws; and then give them proper encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to labour, or take arms in the defence of the American cauſe, as they ſhall chooſe. This would at once be doing them ſome degree of juſtice, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This objection might be urged with much greater ſhew of reaſon by the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> againſt freeing their ſervants when they were not only in a ſtate of war, but ſhut up, and cloſely beſieged in that city; yet we find it was their duty to free them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as the only way to eſcape threatened deſtruction; and as ſoon as they had done this, they had reſpite, and would have obtained final deliverance, had they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their old oppreſſion, and again brought their freed ſervants into bondage.</p>
            <p>This leads me to obſerve, that our diſtreſſes are come upon us in ſuch a way, and the occaſion of the preſent war is ſuch, as in the moſt clear and ſtriking manner to point out the ſin of holding our blacks in ſlavery, and admoniſh us to reform, and render us ſhockingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ourſelves, and amazingly guilty if we refuſe. God has raiſed up men to attempt to deprive us of liberty; and the evil we are threatened with is ſlavery. This, with our vigorous attempts to avoid it, is the ground of all our diſtreſſes, and the general voice is, "We will die in the attempt, rather than ſubmit to ſlavery." But are we at the ſame time making ſlaves of many thouſands of our brethren, who have as good a right to liberty as ourſelves, and to whom it is as ſweet as it is to us, and the contrary as dreadful! Are we holding them in the moſt abject, miſerable ſtate of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, without the leaſt compaſſionate feeling towards them or their poſterity; utterly refuſing to take off the oppreſſive galling yoke! Oh, the ſhocking, the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inconſiſtence! And this groſs, barefaced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:019044_0056_0FA9AD8D08B49B70"/>
is an open, practical condemna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> of holding theſe our brethren in ſlavery; and in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the crime of perſiſting in it becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably greater and more provoking in God's ſight; ſo that all the former unrighteouſneſs and cruelty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in this practice, is innocence, compared with the awful guilt that is now contracted. And in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the words of our Saviour, it may with great truth and propriety be ſaid, "If he had not thus come in his Providence, and ſpoken unto us, (comparatively ſpeaking) we had not had ſin, in making bond-ſlaves of our brethren; but now, we have no cloak for our ſin."</p>
            <p>And if we continue in this evil practice, and refuſe to let the oppreſſed go free, under all this light and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, ſuited to convince and reform us; and while God is evidently correcting us for it, as well as for other ſins, have we any reaſon to expect deliverance from the calamities we are under? May we not rather look for ſlavery and deſtruction, like that which came upon the obſtinate, unreformed <hi>Jews?</hi> In this light, I think, it ought to be conſidered by us; and viewed thus, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a moſt forcible, formidable argument, not to put off liberating our ſlaves to a more convenient time; but to ariſe, all as one man, and do it with all our might, without delay, ſince delaying in this caſe is aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dangerous, as well as unſpeakably criminal. This was hinted in the beginning of our converſation, you may remember, and I am glad of an opportunity to conſider it more particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You have repeatedly ſpoken of the attempt that is made to oppreſs and enſlave the <hi>American</hi> colonies, and the calamities this has introduced, as a judgment which God has brought upon us for enſlaving the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi> and ſay we have no reaſon to expect deliverance, but ſtill greater judgments, unleſs this practice be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But is not this ſuppoſition inconſiſtent with the courſe of divine Providence ſince this war began? Have we not been ſtrengthened and ſucceeded in our
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:019044_0057_0FA9AD8D45E4CDE8"/>
oppoſition to the meaſures taken againſt us, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our moſt ſanguine expectations; and a ſeries of events, very extraordinary, and almoſt miraculous, have taken place in our favour, and ſo as remarkably to diſappoint our oppoſers, and baffle them in all their plots and attempts againſt us. How is this conſiſtent with the above ſuppoſition? If theſe calamities were brought on us for our ſin in enſlaving the <hi>Africans,</hi> and an expreſſion of God's diſpleaſure with us on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, would he in ſuch a ſignal manner appear on our ſide, and favour, protect and proſper us; even ſo that thoſe of our enemies, who are conſiderate and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, have been obliged to acknowledge God was for us; I ſay, could this be, while we perſiſt in that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſo offenſive to him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> When I ſpeak of our being under the divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for this ſin of enſlaving the <hi>Africans,</hi> I do not mean to exclude other public crying ſins found among us, ſuch as impiety and profaneneſs—formality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference in the ſervice and cauſe of Chriſt and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion—and the various ways of open oppoſition to it—intemperance and prodigality; and other inſtances of unrighteouſneſs, &amp;c. the fruits of a moſt criminal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſelfiſhneſs, which is the ſource of the high handed oppreſſion we are conſidering. But that this is a ſin moſt particularly pointed out, and ſo contrary to our holy religion in every view of it, and ſuch an open violation of all the laws of righteouſneſs, humanity, and charity, and ſo contrary to our profeſſions and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the cauſe of liberty, that we have no reaſon to expect, nor can ſincerely aſk deliverance, ſo long as we continue in a diſpoſition to hold faſt this iniquity. If we ſhould be delivered while we continue in this evil practice and obſtinately refuſe <hi>thoroughly</hi> to execute judgment between a man and his neighbour, but go on to oppreſs the ſtranger, the fatherleſs, and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, we ſhould, agreeable to the ſpirit of what you have juſt ſaid, improve ſuch deliverance, as God ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> would have done, had he delivered them,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:019044_0058_0FA9AD8DF53830F8"/>
while they refuſed to reform. "Will ye ſteal, murder, &amp;c. and come and ſtand before me in this houſe, which is called by my name, and ſay, <hi>We are delivered, to do all theſe abominations?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Jer. vii. 5,—10.</note>" Surely this is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or deſired. Even the prayer for ſuch deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt be an abomination to the Lord.</p>
            <p>But your objection is worthy of a more particular anſwer.—It has been obſerved, that there has been a general reſolution to ſuppreſs the ſlave-trade in theſe colonies, and to import no more ſlaves from <hi>Africa.</hi> This is a remarkable inſtance of our profeſſed regard to juſtice, and a wiſe and notable ſtep towards a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this evil; and, as has been obſerved, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat reformation will be the unavoidable conſequence, if we will be conſiſtent with ourſelves. For no reaſon can be given for ſuppreſſing the ſlave-trade, which is not equally a reaſon for freeing all thoſe who have been reduced to a ſtate of ſlavery by that trade; and that ſame regard to juſtice, humanity and mercy, which will induce us to acquieſce in the former, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige us to practice the latter. Have we not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reaſon to think that the righteous, and infinitely merciful Governor of the world, has been pleaſed to teſtify his well-pleaſedneſs with that regard to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and mercy which we profeſſed, and appeared to exerciſe, in refuſing to import any more ſlaves; and which is an implicit condemnation of all the ſlavery practiſed among us, by appearing on our ſide in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, extraordinary manner you have mentioned; by which wonderful interpoſition in our favour, he has at the ſame time given us the greateſt encouragement not to ſtop what we have begun, but to go on to a thorough reformation, and act conſiſtently with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by breaking every yoke, and doing juſtice to all our oppreſſed ſlaves; as well as to repent of and reform all our open, public ſins? So that God is hereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us what he can do for us, and how happy we may
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:019044_0059_0FA9AD8F0DAEE248"/>
be, under his protection, if we will <hi>thoroughly</hi> amend our ways, and our doings; and loudly calling us to a thorough reformation, in this moſt kind and winning way.</p>
            <p>But if we obſtinately refuſe to reform, what we have implicitly declared to be wrong, and engaged to put away the holding the <hi>Africans</hi> in ſlavery, which is ſo particularly pointed out by the evil with which we are threatened, and is ſuch a glaring contradiction to our profeſſed averſion to ſlavery, and ſtruggle for civil liberty; and improve the favour God is ſhewing us, as an argument in favour of this iniquity, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſiſt in it, as you, Sir, have juſt now done, have we not the greateſt reaſon to fear, yea, may we not with great certainty conclude, God will yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his kind protection from us, and puniſh us yet ſeven times more? This has been God's uſual way of dealing with his profeſſing people; and who can ſay it is not moſt reaſonable and wiſe? He then acts the moſt friendly part to theſe colonies and to the maſters of ſlaves, as well as to the ſlaves themſelves, who does his utmoſt to effect a general emancipation of the <hi>Africans</hi> among us: And in this view I could wiſh the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation we have now had on this ſubject, if nothing better is like to be done, were publiſhed and ſpread through all the colonies, and had the attentive peruſal of every <hi>American.</hi>

            <p>SINCE it has been determined to publiſh the preceding dialogue, it was thought proper it ſhould be attended with a particular addreſs to you, who are more immediately intereſted in the ſlavery there conſidered.</p>
            <p>It would be injurious, it is confeſſed, to conſider you as the only perſons guilty or concerned in this matter. The ſeveral legiſlatures in theſe colonies, the magiſtrates, and the body of the people have doubtleſs been greatly guilty in approving and encouraging, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at this practice. Yea, every one is in a meaſure guilty, who has been inattentive to this oppreſſion, and unaffected with it, and neglected to bear proper teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it. And it is granted, the public ought to go into ſome effectual meaſures to liberate all the ſlaves, without laying an unreaſonable burden on their maſters. But though this be not done, ſuch neglect will not excuſe you in holding them in ſlavery; as it is in your power to ſet them free, and your indiſpenſible duty, and really your intereſt, to do them this piece of juſtice, though others ſhould neglect to aſſiſt you, as they ought.</p>

It is hoped, you will not be offended with the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech uſed on this ſubject; and that, though you ſhould at firſt think ſome of the epithets and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which are uſed, too ſevere, and find the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject itſelf diſagreeable; this will not prevent your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſidering it, and weighing what is offered, with the utmoſt impartiality, and readineſs to receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, how much ſoever you may find yourſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. For, if your practice is here ſet in a true light, in which it muſt appear to all impartial, judicious, good men; and in which it will appear to all, at the day of judgment; you muſt be ſenſible you cannot too ſoon admit the conviction, and reform. And here it cannot be improper to remind you of your liableneſs to ſtrong prejudices, which tend to prevent your ſeeing what in itſelf may be very plain. Our divine teacher ſays, "<hi>Every one</hi> that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved." If you are indeed doing evil, according to the import of the preceding dialogue, theſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſo far applicable to you, and are ſuited to awaken your jealouſy of yourſelves, and lead you to attend to the ſubject with great concern, circumſpection, and earneſt prayer to the Father of lights, for that diſcerning and wiſdom, by which you may, in the caſe depending, come to the knowledge of the truth. And is it not worthy your ſerious conſideration, that they who are not intereſted in this practice, and have no ſlaves, are generally, if not every one, fully convinced it is wrong? Are they not, at leaſt many of them, as capable of judging in this matter, as you yourſelves are; and therefore more likely to judge right than you, as they are unintereſted and impartial? The conviction of the unjuſtifiableneſs of this practice has been increaſing, and greatly ſpread of late; and many who have had ſlaves, have found themſelves ſo unable to juſtify their own conduct in holding them in bondage, as to be induced to ſet them at liberty. May this conviction ſoon reach every owner of ſlaves in <hi>North-America!</hi>

To this end you are deſired to conſider, what is more than once urged in the dialogue, viz.</p>
            <p>The very inconſiſtent part you act, while you are thus enſlaving your fellow men, and yet condemning, and ſtrenuouſly oppoſing thoſe who are attempting to bring you and your children into a ſtate of bondage, much lighter than that in which you keep your ſlaves; who yet have at leaſt as good a right to make ſlaves of you and your children, as you have to hold your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in this ſtate of bondage. Men do not love to be inconſiſtent with themſelves: and therefore this is ſo evident and glaring, that if you will only ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to reflect a moment, it muſt give you pain, from which you can find no relief; but by freeing yor ſlaves, or relinquiſhing the cauſe of public liberty, which you have thought ſo glorious, and worthy to be purſued at the riſk of your fortunes and lives.</p>

As Rhode-Iſland has been more deeply intereſted in the ſlave-trade, and has enſlaved more of the poor Africans, than any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony in New-England, it has been to the honor of that colony, that they have lately made a law prohibiting the importation of any more ſlaves How becoming, honourable and happy would it have been, had they acted up to the truth aſſerted in the preamble mentioned, and taken the lead of all the united colonies, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually providing for the freedom of all their ſlaves!</p>
                  <p>Since the above was publiſhed, the General Aſſembly of that State, have made a law, by which all the blacks born in it after March 1734, are made free. And the maſters who have ſlaves under 40 years old, are authoriſed to free them, without being bound, or liable to maintain them, if afterwards they ſhould be enable to-ſupport themſelves.</p>
               </note> have expreſſed their conviction of this inconſiſtence, and given it as a reaſon for freeing our ſlaves, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <q>Whereas the inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> are
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:019044_0063_0FA9AD9274B1E9F8"/>
generally engaged in the preſervation of their own rights and liberties, among which that of perſonal freedom muſt be conſidered as the greateſt; and as thoſe who are deſirous of enjoying all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of liberty themſelves, ſhould be willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend perſonal liberty to others: Therefore, be it enacted,</q> &amp;c.—Is it poſſible that any one ſhould not feel the irreſiſtable force of this reaſon? And who would be willing to practice this glaring ſelf-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, rather than let his ſervants go out free even though he ſhould hereby give up the greateſt part of his living, yea, every penny he has in the world! With what propriety will all ſuch inconſiſtent oppreſſors be addreſſed, by HIM before whom maſters and their ſlaves will ſhortly ſtand, as their impartial judge? "<hi>Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked ſervant!</hi>"</p>
            <p>Be intreated alſo ſeriouſly to conſider, how very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God, unrighteouſneſs and the oppreſſion of the poor, the ſtranger and fatherleſs, is repreſented to be, in the holy ſcripture. This is often ſpoken of as the procuring cauſe of the calamities that came on God's profeſſing people of old, and of their final ruin. It may ſuffice to quote a few paſſages of this tenor, and refer you to places where others are to be found. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxi. 12. "O houſe of David, thus ſaith the LORD, Execute judgment in the morning, <hi>and deliver him that is ſpoiled out of the hand of the oppreſſor,</hi> leſt my fury go out like fire, and burn, that none can quench it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evil of your doings." <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxii. 29, 30, 31. "The people of the land have uſed oppreſſion, <hi>and exerciſed robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppreſſed the ſtranger wrongfully.</hi>—And I ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make up the hedge, &amp;c.—but I found none. Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them," &amp;c.—<hi>Amos</hi> ii. 6. "Thus ſaith the Lord, For three tranſgreſſions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and for four, I will not turn away the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, <hi>becauſe they ſold the righteous for ſilver, and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:019044_0064_0FA9AD932D7B1CB8"/>
the poor for a pair of ſhoes." Zech.</hi> vii. 9.—14. "Thus the Lord of hoſts, ſaying, Execute true judgment, and ſhew mercy and compaſſions every man to his brother. And oppreſs not the widow, nor the fatherleſs, <hi>the ſtranger nor the poor;</hi> and let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in your heart. But they refuſed to hearken—yea, they made their hearts as an adamant ſtone—Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hoſts," &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">See to the ſame purpoſe, Iſa. iii. 14, 15. x. 1,—4.

            <p>Are not the <hi>African</hi> ſlaves among us the poor, the ſtrangers, the fatherleſs, who are oppreſſed and vexed, and ſold for ſilver? And will not God viſit and puniſh ſuch oppreſſion? Are you willing to be the inſtruments of bringing judgments and ruin on this land, and on yourſelves and families, rather than let the oppreſſed go out free?</p>
            <p>On the contrary, mercy, deliverance and proſperity were often promiſed them, if they would leave off their oppreſſions, and do juſtice, and ſhew mercy, in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oppreſſed, and ſhewing kindneſs to the ſtranger and the poor. <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 16,—18. "Ceaſe to do evil learn to do well, <hi>ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed,</hi> judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow—Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow—If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall cat the good of the land." <hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 1,—7. "Stand in the gate of the Lord's houſe, and proclaim there this word, and ſay—If ye thoroughly amend your ways, and your doings; <hi>If ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour, if you oppreſs not the ſtranger,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and the widow, and ſhed not innocent blood in this place—then will I cauſe you to dwell—in the land I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever." <hi>Jer.</hi> xxii. 1,—4.

            <p>How can we attend to the voice of God in theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings, and not ſee that you are moſt clearly pointed out. And will you be affronted, or even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard us, while we intreat and conjure you, by all that is important and ſacred, ſo far to regard theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and promiſes, and purſue your own higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and that of the public, as to let your oppreſſed ſlaves go out free! Do not ſay, "This is too great a ſacrifice for us to make; who will indemnify us, if we give up our ſervants? The ſovereign owner of all things has promiſed you indemnity; yea, infinitely more, deliverance from the awful curſe which comes upon the oppreſſor; and his protection and bleſſing. And here it may be proper to remind you of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine anſwer to the king of <hi>Judah,</hi> when, being ordered to diſmiſs the mercenaries he had procured to aſſiſt him, he aſked, what he ſhould do for the hundred talents which this army had coſt him? "And the man of God anſwered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this." 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxv. 6,—9.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, how very inconſiſtent this injuſtice and oppreſſion is with worſhipping God through Chriſt, and attending on the inſtitutions of religion; and how unacceptable and abominable theſe muſt be, while you neglect to let the oppreſſed go free, and refuſe to do juſtice, and love mercy. The bible is full of declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this<note n="†" place="bottom">Read Iſa. lviii. and ch. i. v. 10,—18. Amos v. 21,—2.</note>.</p>
            <p>"To do juſtice and judgment, is more acceptable to the LORD than ſacrifice." Without the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the latter is nothing but groſs hypocriſy, and abomination to God; for he "will have mercy, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>." He requires no devotion, or attendance on any religious right or inſtitution, which is inconſiſtent with mercy,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:019044_0066_0FA9AD989609EC08"/>
or that is done without the love and exerciſe of mercy; but rejects all ſuch prayers and ſervice, as moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and abominable to him. And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that Chriſtianity is the greateſt inſtance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of righteouſneſs and mercy that was ever known, or can be conceived of: And the great Author of it is, in the moſt eminent and glorious degree, THE JUST GOD AND THE SAVIOUR; we ſhall not wonder that no offering can be acceptable to him, which is without the exerciſe and practiſe of righteouſneſs and mercy: And that "he ſhall have judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy."</p>
            <p>You who are profeſſors of religion, and yet the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſlaves, are intreated well to conſider, how you muſt appear in the ſight of God, and of all who view your conduct in a true light, while you attend your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and public devotions, and ſit down from time to time, at the table of the Lord. If your neighbour wrong you of a few ſhillings, you think him utterly unfit to attend that ſacred ordinance with you; but what is this, to the wrong you are doing to your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom you are holding in ſlavery! Should a man at <hi>Algiers</hi> have a number of your children his ſlaves, and ſhould, by ſome means be converted, and become a profeſſor of Chriſtianity, would you not expect he would ſoon ſet your children at liberty? And if after you had particularly dealt with him about, it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered abundant light and matter of conviction, of the oppreſſion and cruelty of which he was guilty, he ſhould be deaf to all you could ſay, and reſolve to hold them and their children in ſlavery, what would you think of him, when you ſee him at his prayers, and attending at the Lord's ſupper? Would you think he was more acceptable to God, than if he neglected theſe inſtitutions, and yet had been ſo juſt and merciful, as to ſet all his ſlaves at liberty? Yea, would you ſcruple to ſay, his devotion and attendance on the holy ſupper were hypocriſy and abomination? If <hi>Nathan</hi> the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:019044_0067_0FA9AD99A5106F10"/>
prophet was here, he would ſay, "<hi>Thou art the man</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It is granted this oppreſſion has been practiſed in ignorance by many, if not the moſt, who have been owners of ſlaves: And though this has been a very criminal ignorance; yet profeſſors of religion, and real chriſtians may have lived in this ſin through ignorance, conſiſtent with ſincerity, and ſo as to be acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt, in their devotions, &amp;c. But though God has in time paſſed, ſuffered us, ignorantly, to walk in this wicked way, he is NOW uſing ſpecial means to open our eyes, and commands all, every where, to repent of his iniquity. And they who perſiſt in this ſin, in oppoſition to the clear light, and alarming admonitions which are now ſet before us, will greatly aggravate their own guilt, if they do not hereby give juſt reaſon to ſuſpect the ſincerity of their profeſſion. Some, who are in the ſcriptures, declared to be good men, lived in evil practices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſincerity in their attendance on divine inſtitutions; in which practices no Chriſtian can now live, conſiſtent with his Chriſtian character; becauſe we enjoy much greater light than they had, and theſe evil ways are more fully expoſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note>."</p>
            <p>The Friends, who are commonly called Quakers, have been for a number of years, bearing teſtimony againſt this oppreſſion, as inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity; and ſtriving to purge themſelves of this iniquity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thoſe from fellowſhip with them, who will not free their ſlaves. They indeed do not attend the Lord's ſupper; and it is granted, they are herein neglecting an important inſtitution of Chriſt: But ought it not to alarm you to think, that while you are condemning them for this neglect, your attendance, in the omiſſion of that righteouſneſs and mercy which they practiſe, is inexpreſſibly more diſhonorable and offenſive to Chriſt, than their neglect! Theſe things you ought <hi>firſt</hi> to have done, to let the oppreſſed go free, and break every yoke; and then not leave the other undone.</p>
            <p>May you all, in this day of your viſitation, know and practice the things that belong to your peace, and the ſafety and happineſs of the united <hi>American</hi> colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by no longer oppreſſing theſe <hi>poor ſtrangers</hi> wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019044_0068_0FA9AD99F5237078"/>
and doing violence to them; but by executing judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hands of the oppreſſor! May this counſel be acceptable unto you, and you break off this your ſin, and all your ſins, by righteouſneſs, and your iniquities by ſhewing mercy to theſe poor; that it may be a lengthening of the tranquility of yourſelves, your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and of this now diſtreſſed land!</p>

            <p>
               <hi>To the Second Edition of the Dialogue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Slavery of the</hi> Africans.</p>
            <p>SINCE the firſt edition of the foregoing dialogue, peace has been reſtored to the <hi>American</hi> States; in which they have obtained all that for which they have contended, and more; and are become free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. Thus we have had proſperity, and the ſmiles of Heaven, in our attempts, while the ſlavery of the <hi>Africans</hi> has not been wholly aboliſhed by us. This may be conſidered by ſome, as an evidence that this ſlavery, and even the ſlave-trade, are not ſo great and heaven-provoking ſins, as they are repreſented to be in the dialogue; and that the repeated declarations there, that we could not reaſonably expect proſperity, until this iniquity was reformed, were groundleſs and raſh.</p>
            <p>The following obſervations, it is hoped, will ſerve to give a juſt view of this matter.</p>
            <p>I. Since the publication of the dialogue, many things have been done, and ſteps taken, toward a reformation of this evil. In the ſtates of the Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, the ſlavery of the blacks is wholly aboliſhed. And it is one of the fundamental articles in the conſtitution of the propoſed ſtate of Vermont, that no ſlavery ſhall be tolerated there. The ſtates of Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, Pennſylvania, and the lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on Delaware, have provided for the gradual abolition
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:019044_0069_0FA9AD9BA8E49508"/>
of ſlavery; and ordered that all the blacks who ſhall be hereafter born in thoſe ſtates, ſhall be free at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain age. And that no more ſlaves ſhall be introduced among them. And the ſtate of Virginia has repealed a law, which was formerly in force there againſt the freeing of blacks; and now allows the maſters of ſlaves to free them when they pleaſe. Thus all the ſtates but five, have manifeſted a diſpoſition to promote the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Africans.</hi> And numbers of ſlaves, have been liberated by their maſters, under a conviction of the unrighteouſneſs of holding them in ſlavery.</p>
            <p>This is a great advance in the deſired reformation, and has given ground to hope, that ſlavery will be wholly aboliſhed in all the United States of <hi>America.</hi> And may it not be conſidered as one reaſon why the omniſcient, long-ſuffering Governor of the world has ſpared and proſpered us, as he hath done?</p>
            <p>II. Though we have been thus ſaved and proſpered, evil <hi>may,</hi> and we have reaſon to fear it <hi>will</hi> come upon us, if we do not proceed to a thorough reformation of this ſin; eſpecially upon theſe ſtates in which there is no degree of reformation. What has taken place ſince the peace, chiefly by our own imprudence, extravagance and folly, by which our trade is almoſt ruined, and theſe ſtates are in a great meaſure drained of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and many evils are introduced, is enough to ſhew us how eaſily, and how ſoon, we may be made miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and be ruined as a nation, after all that God hath done for us; and, at the ſame time, is an evidence that he is diſpleaſed, and hath a controverſy with us.</p>
            <p>And we may eaſily account for this, notwithſtanding the partial reformation reſpecting ſlavery, which has been mentioned, when we conſider that amidſt other open ſins and inſtances of unrighteouſneſs, we are again going into the practice of that ſeven-fold abomination, THE SLAVE TRADE: againſt which, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the war, we bore public teſtimony, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a united and ſolemn reſolution wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, and all connection with thoſe who ſhould
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:019044_0070_0FA9AD9C3B6EB8C0"/>
perſiſt in this evil practice. A number of veſſels have been ſent from ſome of the ſtates in New-England, and from other ſtates, to <hi>Africa,</hi> to procure ſlaves, and they are in ſuch demand in the Weſt-Indies, and ſome of the ſouthern ſtates, eſpecially South Carolina, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſsful voyages have been made, and thouſands of ſlaves brought into theſe United States, and ſold at an extraordinary price, by which others are tempted and encouraged to go into this trade; and there is a proſpect that it will take place to as great a degree as it has heretofore, unleſs it ſhould be ſuppreſſed by thoſe in public authority, or by the people at large.</p>
            <p>Are not the ſtory and denunciations of evil, which we have in the prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. xxxv. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to this caſe? The inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were beſieged by the army of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and brought into great diſtreſs and fears of utter ruin: Upon which, being convinced of their ſin in the practice of ſlavery, which had taken place among them, they being led to it by their King and princes, entered into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and ſolemn covenant to free all their ſlaves. Soon after this their enemies raiſed the ſiege, and they thought themſelves delivered; but when their fears and diſtreſs were thus removed, they returned to their former practice, and reduced to ſlavery the ſervants they had ſet at liberty. God then directed <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to tell them, that ſince they had returned to their former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which they had ſolemnly promiſed to relinquiſh, and refuſed liberty to their brethren, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a liberty for them; even a moſt dreadful liberty to the ſword, to the peſtilence, and to the famine, and cauſe them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth, &amp;c. If this barbarous trade ſhould go on, and ſlavery be ſtill encouraged and promoted in theſe ſtates, and yet we eſcape the deſtruction which came on the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or evils that ſhall be as great, it muſt be aſcribed to mere, ſovereign, diſtinguiſhing mercy, which we have no reaſon to expect.</p>
