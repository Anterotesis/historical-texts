            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
            <p>INTRODUCTORY reflections. A traveller un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes a voyage to Boſton: arrives in a river of Maſſachuſetts: has there a ſight of the native Genius of North-America, who preſents him with a mantle, and acquaints him with its virtue of rendering the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inviſible: deſires him to viſit the town in that ſtate, and remark the tranſactions there. Accordingly he arrives at General Gage's manſion, where are ſeveral other miniſterial tools ſitting in council. The ſtriking familiarity of Gage's temper and conduct to that of Hernando Cortez. Some account of Cortez. and his horrid devaſtations in Mexico, &amp;c. The traveller en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their junto, and gives an account of the chief members of it, viz. General Gage. Admiral Greaves, General Burgoyne, Lord Percy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> General Howe, Capt. Wallace, and a numerous fry of dependents and needy favourites waiting for poſts and eſtates in America, as ſoon as they ſhall have compelled us to reſign our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: General Gage's ſurprize at their ſeveral defeats in New-England and queſtions his leaders thereupon. Lord Percy's anſwer: Greave's reply to that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Gage's raillery upon Percy for his nimble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat on April 19 1775. Percy's defence of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct on that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reaſon of his activity; and deſires them to forget Lexington for the preſent and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014044_0003_0F92AB64C0CCAE70"/>
turn their eyes to their late loſs at Bunker's Hill. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe's ſpeech concerning that action. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's harrangue, with his invectives againſt Colonel Grant, who "pledged himſelf for the general cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of all America:" Gage's brief reply; and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his intention of purloining cattle from the iſlands, and plans that right honourable exploit: but being overcome with ſleep diſmiſſes his counſellors: The cutting down the Liberty Tree in Boſton, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end of one of the wretches employed in that ſneaking affair: Diſtreſſes of the impriſoned citizens in Boſton: Diſſection of a Tory: The traveller leaves Boſton, and viſits the Provincial Camp; meets the Genius of America again on the way and reſigns the mantle, whereby he again becomes viſible; arrives at the camp: View of the Rifle-men, Virginians, &amp;c. Speech of an American Soldier; his determined reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which is that of all America, to defend our rights and privileges: Grief that he muſt fight againſt our own nation: Mention of Carleton and Johnſon; concludes with a melancholly recital of our preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, and ſincere hope of reconciliation with Great-Britain, before a wicked miniſtry render it too late: Concluſion.</p>

               <l>HOW curs'd the man whom fate's unhappy doom</l>
               <l>Confines, unluckly, to his native home,</l>
               <l>How doubly curs'd by croſs-grain'd ſtars is he,</l>
               <l>Whom fate ties down, tho' ſtruggling to be free!</l>
               <l>Heaven gave to man this vaſt extended round,</l>
               <l>No climes confine him and no oceans bound;</l>
               <l>Heaven gave him foreſt, mountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vale and plain,</l>
               <l>And bade him vanquiſh, if he could, the main:</l>
               <l>Then miſer hoard and heap thy riches ſtill,</l>
               <l>View the ſun riſe above thy well known hill,</l>
               <l>Vile as the ſwine enjoy thy gloomy den,</l>
               <l>Sweat in the compaſs of a ſqualid pen,</l>
               <l>'Till ſick of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on terms with death agree,</l>
               <l>And leave thy fortune, not thy heart to me.</l>
               <l>So mus'd the bard who this rough verſe indites,</l>
               <l>Aſſerting freedom, and his country's rights:</l>
               <l>Nor mus'd in vain; the fruitful muſings brought</l>
               <l>To practice what in theory he thought;</l>
               <l>And gave deſire, a keen deſire to roam</l>
               <l>A hundred or two hundred leagues from home.</l>
               <l>Where ſhould he go? The eaſtern hills reply,</l>

               <l>O come and view the Queen of all that's ſad,</l>
               <l>Long are her nights, that yield no chearful ſound,</l>
               <l>Like endleſs nights in tombs below the ground,</l>
               <l>Low burns her lamp before th' inſulting rout;</l>
               <l>See, the lamp dies, and every light goes out!</l>
               <l>O Britain come, and, if you can, relent</l>

               <l>(Perhaps a mountain or Dame Fancy there)</l>
               <l>Could I refuſe, ſince mutual grief endears,</l>
