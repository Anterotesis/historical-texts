            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If this is in any degree effected, the good intention has obtained it's reward—and it is preſumable that God will bleſs every humble endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſubſervient to ſo happy an end. And, ſhould that end be, in any meaſure obtained—ſhould one falling tear be wiped from the moiſt eye of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—ſhould the heaving ſigh be repreſſed at the throbbing heart of woe—Glory will thereby redound to God

Alike unmoved by the breath of applauſe or the blaſt of cenſure, let theſe papers be permitted to paſs; they hurt no-body, and offer their ſervice to do every-body good, and therefore hope to be viewed in a benevolent light even by thoſe, who ſtand in no need of them.</p>

            <p>HOMAR, the Son of Haſſan, to all the Children of Affliction, Peace and Conſolation.</p>
            <p>The great will of the HOLY GOD be done: for WISDOM dwelleth with him, and MERCY is the foundation of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal throne.</p>
            <p>Glory be to thee JESUS thou PRINCE of ſufferers, who didſt triumph through, and upon thy croſs. Thrice holy Croſs! From thee bath been diſtributed among all nations the fruit of the TREE OF LIFE: Homar will bear thee with reſignation and thankfulneſs, and follow his RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER with faith and patience, to the realms of light and joy.—Thrice holy croſs, I ſay, thou haſt inſtructed my ſoul—underſtanding and comfort are thy gifts and bleſſings. I have taken my ſtation at the foot of the croſs of my Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, with the two Maries, humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that, in all my afflictions "I receive the due, reward of my deeds"—
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022046_0006_0FB69DF523F1F720"/>waiting patiently "to bear the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the LORD, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him."</p>
            <p>Toſſed on the tempeſtuous ocean of life, Homar heard not the voice of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor liſtened to the admonitions of truth. He ſailed along, O ye children of affliction, regardleſs of Heaven, and its auguſt inhabitants: Heedful only of the winds of advantage,—attentive only to the call of pleaſure, and animal gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He built his houſe—oh vain and ſelf-deceived!—he built his houſe, in towering fancy, on a rock; ſtability ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it's ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Behold you towering cedar, on the mountain, how it erects its ſtately head to the clouds, and ſendeth far abroad its wide ſpreading branches. Such was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar; high in honor, and reaching forth the arms of his protection to all around.—Behold you deep and fertiliſing ſtream! how it winds i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now, how changed is Homar! B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hold, and ſee, O ye children of ſorrow; all of you who have drank deep of the bitter cup of adverſity; behold, in the ſon of Haſſan, the correcting hand of Providence; and learn with him to bow and adore!—For, tho' deſpoiled of all his former glories;—tho' rendered like the heath in the deſert, like the barren rock, or the unfruitful ſand on the ſea-ſhore; tho' left alone, like ſome blighted tree beſpoiled of all its boaſted glory, its leaves and branches;—alone—and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a ſolitary cottage, amidſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented wilderneſs, far removed from the habitations of men;—he rejoiceth in comfort unknown to him amidſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; for he rejoiceth in God. His ſoul doth magnify the Lod, and his Spirit exulteth in God his Saviour, and in the golden hope of everlaſting glory with him!—</p>
            <p>Come then, and hearken unto me; let me inſtruct you my fellow-ſufferers;—let
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022046_0008_0FB69DFF9B56B010"/>me lead you to the fountain, whence I have drank ſuch draughts of conſolation and delight.</p>
            <p>Approach unto me, all ye who have known affliction from the hand of the Lord. I offer no barren or unſatisfying comfort: I ſpeak that I do know, and teſtify what experience her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has taught me. Come then, and compare your griefs with mine; and, while we diſcourſe, may the angel of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience diffuſe her balm, more precious than that of Gilead, into our breaſts!</p>
            <p>But firſt, Oh Firſt, let us bend the knee of earneſt ſupplication to the Father of unutterable mercies, to the Prince of ſufferers, to the Spirit of eternal Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!

And, now, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grief and deſpair, thou art reſolved to go mourning to thy much deſired grave.</p>
               <p>Melancholy and afflicted Parent! my

Great, indeed, is the calamity which hath befallen you; but let not the cries of anguish drown the ſo't and perſuaſive voice of conſolation—let not the demon of despair prevail over the angel of truth and reflection.</p>
               <p>Great is the calamity which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen YOU: but, alas! not greater; than many fellow-ſufferers have had cauſe to deplore.</p>
               <p>Oh! my Son, my firſt born, how doth the remembrance of thy untimely fate recur to my mind! hearken unto me, ye afflicted Parents, and receive comfort from the lips of a partner in woe.</p>
               <p>The Son of Homar was graceful, and pleaſing to behold; he grew up as the lilly of the mountains, and flouriſhed as the roſe of Sharon; health mantled in his cheek, and ſensibility ſpoke from his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant eye! He lent his ear to inſtruction, and received with ſtall increaſing thirſt, the ſlowing cup from the hand of wiſdom! Duty and reſpect bowed his head every

               <p>Lo he fell! my firſt born, my beloved! A ſudden ſtroke left him a lifeleſs corps in my arms; the lovely flower withered in my boſom! God ſnatched him from me—"he had need of him"—And, O my God, thy ſeverity was wholeſome!</p>
               <p>But could I, Oh ye Parents, ſay, could I refrain from lamentation and tears? Give to humanity it's tribute! Weep, Oh ye ſufferers, your tears are allowed; weep Oh ye ſufferers; but weep as men, as immortals as chriſtians!</p>
               <p>But reflect with me: Is your ſon, your child, your friend, loſt—loſt and gone for ever? Is there no hope, no probability of a future meeting?—Is all of the man buried with body in the grave?—And do all our thoughts and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vaniſh there?—Forbid it Reaſon!—And thou divine diſplay of high benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to man, thou glorious goſpel of my Saviour, hail! hail THOU who has brought LIFE and IMMORTALITY to full and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

And doſt thou murmur and complain! alas! thou feeble and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mortal, conſider a moment.—Oh conſider and be wiſe! Waſt thou not born to ſickneſs, pain, and ſuffering?

And wouldſt thou wiſh, canſt thou reaſonably hope, to be exempt from that of which all they brethren par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take? Be ſilent and reſigned.</p>
               <p>But whence comes ſorrow—whence comes ſickneſs?—By whom is it commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, and whoſe is the hand that inflicts the ſtroke?—Hear IT with the voice of ſerious rebuke, declaring to thee, <q>Am <g ref="char:startq">“</g>I come up without the Lord to try thee?—The Lord hath ſaid to me, go <g ref="char:endq">”</g>up againſt this man and afflict him.</q> And canſt thou complain?

               <p>It is GOD who afflicts, the good, the gracious and wiſe FATHER of manking. And wherefore doth he afflict? Son of man, reflect, and be admoniſhed.

Wherefore then can he afflict—or, what end can be propoſe in ſending his ſolemn meſſenger, DISEASE, to thee, but thy true and everlaſting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare? Say, therefore, with acquieſcence in thy trouble, <q>I know, O Lord, that <g ref="char:startq">“</g>thy judgments are right, and that thou of very faithfulneſs hath cauſed me to <g ref="char:endq">”</g>be troubled.</q> I know, that <q>whom <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

O wait in faith and patience Brother—tho' the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe wait—tarry for it—it will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in due ſeaſon: for <q>ſooner ſhall <g ref="char:startq">“</g>day and night, ſaith JEHOVAH, ceaſe before me, together with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ordinances of heaven, than the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>SEED of JACOB COME TO AN END.</q>—O my ſoul bow down to adore thy GOD for this promiſe of providential care and love to Abraham's ſeed.—Receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from God, then, O my Brother, for he only can, and he certainly will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thine afflition and diſtreſs.—Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may not be the deſigns of his holy will to comfort thee with worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts—we know not—tho' we heartily wiſh thee to enjoy—if it be the will of our GOD—the comforts of the life that now is—as well as the ineſtimable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that life which is to come.—"Refrain therefore, O Brother," thy voice from weeping and thine <q>eyes <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>from tears,</q> for thy labour and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enduring ſuffering ſhall in God's good time and way moſt certainly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded:—"there is hope in the end"
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022046_0063_0FB69EC982B1D1C0"/>of the ages <q>that thy children ſhall <g ref="char:startq">“</g>come again from the land of the enemy —and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>return to their own border.</q>—For which cauſe O my Soul bleſs the GOD of ABRAHAM, of ISAAC and JACOB, the ever adorable ELOHIM—TRINITY in UNITY and UNITY in TRINITY. He is a GOD of Judgments and by him acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are weighed.—I blend my prayers with thine O SON of ABRAHAM, that the ſufferings of thy brethren may be relaxed—and that the hearts of nations may now at length relent towards ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ISRAEL'S Sons who are, as JOSEPH was, before his enlargement, faſt bound in affliction and iron.—O my Soul look back, and on the wing of towering ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, dart thyſelf into antient times—and thou wilt be heard to exclaim, "What things" hath God done for his people of old!'—He one time fed them as his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with the fineſt of wheat four—and with honey from the rock, did he amply ſatisfy their deſire; at other times, as being his more honoured and immediate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he ſent them on embaſſies into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and diſtant lands, to hold out THE TORCH OF REVALATION—the divine
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022046_0064_0FB69ECE54B748A0"/>mandate of his will to all peoples, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and languages, whetherſoever (in the language of men) he carried them captive.—And at preſent, Brother, you are employed in ſuch an embaſſy—your ſervice in this way GOD ſees neceſſary—O may be it be diſcharged ſo as to be acceptable to that HOLY AND PURE EYE, who ſees from the one end of heaven to the other.—To thee Dear Brother, we acknowledge our obligations for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient writings of the Prophets thoſe holy men who walked with GOD—And O my Soul be thou emulous to walk with them even though the path ſhould lead thee into the ſhadow of death. O my Brother let us pray for each other—that the promiſed REDEEMER may ſanctify and ſave US BOTH from the power of the ſecond death.—At the ſame time I ſhould not be much ſurpriſed, wert thou to refuſe joining with a chriſtian in this or any other act of adoration, prayer or praiſe;—prejudiced as I muſt needs allow thee to be from the inhuman uſage many of thy lineage have met with from the profeſſors of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.—They are not all alike—GOD forbid they were!—Our SAVIOUR
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022046_0065_0FB69ECF67960880"/>JESUS of your on kindred and of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID'S line had but twelve Diſciples—and, deplorable the thought! one of them a traitor—a diſgrace to man!—wonder not then O Brother if there has ariſen ſince many Judaſes;—and O my Soul pray that thou as well as thy brother may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be preſerved from ſuch wicked and unreaſonable men;—who put on the ſemblance of RELIGION'S unſpotted Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the more effectually to conſummate their villany. But believe me Brother, there are thouſands and ten thouſands of Chriſtians whoſe moſt ardent prayers for THEE aſcend up morning and evening to the GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB; imploring him to ſanctify thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and expatriation for thy final good; and ſhedding abundance of tears for that unhappy prejudice which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded hitherto that much to be deſired union, of the JEW and GENTILE into one great and amiable family under HIM, who was predicted to bruiſe the Serpents head,—who was repeatedly promiſed in the books of the prophets,—celebrated in the Pſalms, the Expectation of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and who according to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022046_0066_0FB69ED56355EDD0"/>was to appear in the holy CITY OF JERUSALEM in the time of the Second Temple; with irreſiſtable power to cure diſeaſes—raiſe the dead, and work innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable other miracles, not for the aggrand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſement of himſelf, or his followers in this world,—but for the Glory of Him that ſent him and for the good of thoſe to whom he was ſent, in the world to come. Reflect—Brother, the Chriſtian has no promiſe of grandeur here—but JESUS gave a promiſe, that PERSECUTION would await his CHURCH—and ſo it has in divers times and ways—inſomuch that the old adage is fully true—<q>Shew me a <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Church rich and great in this world—and I will ſhew thee a corrupted one; but ſhew me one poor and deſpiſed and perſecuted and I will ſhew thee a pure <g ref="char:endq">”</g>one.</q>—And now—my Soulthy—ardent love to thy brother the JEW, hatch perhaps carried the further than he will readily pardon—thou wilt not think it very had if he ſhould not—but to HIM who ſeeth in ſecret, look up, and appeal to his OMNISCIECE, that all this is in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and ſinglneſs of heart,—and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding purely from a heart untutered in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022046_0067_0FB69EE15BB41E08"/>the ſchool of diſſimulation or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
               <p>O thrice holy LORD GOD, hear in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the contemplations of the meaneſt of thy ſervants;—hear,—have mercy—and bleſs!—Be a Father to the fatherleſs—a Huſband to the widow—the Stay of the orphan—the Comforter and Supporter of all who ſuffer for conſcience ſake. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not, O Lord our offences, nor the offences of our forefathers—neither take thou vengeance of our ſins—ſpare us good Lord—ſpare thy people whom thou haſt redeemed with thy moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood, and be not angry with us for ever. Preſerve, O Father of mercies, and commiſerate all priſoners, exiles and cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

God, forgive all our enemies—perſecutors and ſlanderers—and turn their hearts to the enlivening principle of charity and love.</p>
               <p>O Lord help—and deliver thy ſervant, who putteth his truſt in thee—holy, holy, holy, GOD, FATHER and SON and
